1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,760
APPLAUSE

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Hello, hello, everybody.
Thank you so much, thank you.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,920
Thanks very much.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,600
We're back!

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,880
APPLAUSE

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,320
We're back! We're back
with a new-look Top Gear.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,560
We have changed everything.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,040
And to give you a taste of what you
can expect over the coming weeks,

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,120
we have prepared a little montage.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,440
Tally-ho, tally-ho, chaps.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
They are all over me!

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
At Twickenham, for England!

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,880
We might actually just
be in with a chance.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,840
Let's do this for
Carroll Shelby, come on!

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,720
You will find
the source of the River Nile.

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,440
Here we are, ladies, at
the bowling club. Oh, lovely.

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,200
And, stop. Oh, I am so on board.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,240
There's nobody driving!

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,360
The last to arrive will cross
into Mexico...

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,680
Hello. I've accidentally
painted a gentleman's
sausage on a storm drain.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
'Oh, my.'

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Big jump, whoa!

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,880
APPLAUSE

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,800
We haven't changed anything,
have we? No. Not really.

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Wait, I have bought a new jacket.
You have new shoes.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm in my 50s now. James, to be
fair, you were born in your 50s.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,720
To be honest,
James turned 50 just last week.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,200
Yeah.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,600
APPLAUSE

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,240
Why are you applauding?

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,880
All he had to do to get to 50
was not die,

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,960
and the speed he drives,
that's not difficult.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,200
Anyway, we have a tremendous series
coming up, some amazing races,

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,720
some incredible challenges
and, of course, some brilliant cars.

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,280
And we start with
the best of them all.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,400
The Pagani Zonda is
my favourite supercar.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
But it's been around
for a decade now,

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,320
and for the last few years,
Pagani have been promising again

39
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,080
and again that they will replace it
with a brand-new car.

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,960
And now, finally, they have.

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,600
It's called the Huayra.

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,440
It costs Â£800,000 and it has
a top speed of 230 miles per hour.

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,320
The name Huayra comes from
the South American god of wind.

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
Probably not what you want to hear.

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,800
What you DO want to hear is that
it has six-litre twin-turbo V12,

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,280
made especially for it by AMG.

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,040
And once petrol is applied,
it makes 730 brake horsepower.

48
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,680
And what you do want to hear and see
is what that does.

49
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,680
Aaaargh, ha-ha!

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,720
It spins its wheels all the time!

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,360
I'm in a monster!

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Ha-ha-ha!

53
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,680
Oh, dear God! 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds
and then on into space!

54
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,480
That is 180.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,440
That is savage. Savage, savage thing.

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,400
I can't get enough of that.
I'm going to do that again.

57
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,400
The drama isn't just
restricted to the speed.

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Because inside the Huayra,
it looks like a Victorian's idea
of the 23rd century.

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,120
And the detail is beyond obsessive -
every single nut and bolt

60
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
is made from titanium.

61
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,440
The name badge takes 24 hours
to carve out

62
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,560
from a solid piece of aluminium.

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,600
Each wheel, also hewn from
a single aluminium block,

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,640
takes five days to make.

65
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
And look at this gear shifter.

66
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,240
All the mechanism is exposed so
you can see the workings.

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,640
It's made from 67 different parts,
all arranged

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,600
just so you can hear that mechanical
clunk of a gear being selected.

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,480
You don't even need to use it - you
can use the paddles by the wheel -

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,320
but they have put that there because
it makes it more of an occasion.

71
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,320
This fanatical attention to detail
goes on and on and on.

72
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,400
Even the body is more high-tech
than the one

73
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,840
you'll
find on a Formula One car.

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,920
It's made from carbotanium.
I even know what that means!

75
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,560
Now somebody's told me.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a blend of carbon fibre
and titanium,

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,880
which is incredibly light but is
actually stiffer than carbon fibre

78
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,280
and doesn't shatter
when you crash.

79
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,720
That makes things safer

80
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,800
should you suddenly find
all 730bhp

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
propelling you towards a hedge.

82
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,680
Not every element, though,
is quite so cutting edge.

83
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,280
Pagani haven't gone with
a fashionable twin plate clutch
that so many cars use,

84
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,040
because they do make for
faster changes.

85
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,360
They have gone instead for
a more traditional single plate
clutch because it's smaller

86
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
and a whole 100 kilograms lighter.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,360
In fact, the Huayra
weighs just 1,350 kilograms

88
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,840
and has the power-to-weight ratio
of 541 brake horsepower per tonne,

89
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,000
which is more than you get
from a Bugatti Veyron.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,280
But where the Bugatti Veyron
is four-wheel drive,
this is only rear-wheel drive,

91
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,720
and, rather worryingly, we have now
come to the part of the film

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,760
where we must see what it's like
going round corners.

93
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I understand the more infantile
viewers, of which there are many,

94
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,200
will now want to see me
sliding the back end around.

95
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,240
So, here goes.

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,120
Amazingly, you can corner this car
like a halfwit

97
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,040
and come out the other side alive.

98
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,640
And that's because, in the Huayra,
the black art of aerodynamics is
watching over you.

99
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,640
You see those flaps on the outside?

100
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,040
There are two at the back and two
the front. They measure how fast
you're going

101
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,680
and then deploy
to keep everything stable.

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,240
That's astonishing!

103
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,840
All from the back wheels -
I'm in love!

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,000
But the handling is not
all down to the magic flaps.

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,280
It doesn't feel big,
like a Lambo,

106
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,920
and it's all been set
up so well

107
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,120
and made so stable that even I can
corner it hard without hiding in
the glove box, whimpering.

108
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,040
Oh, God,
this is properly put together.

109
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,840
The Zonda was always going to be
a difficult act to follow,

110
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
but the Huayra has pulled it off.

111
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,640
It drives better, it looks better
and it hasn't lost any of the drama.

112
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,680
On top of that, it also has something
that its main rivals,

113
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,960
Ferrari and Lamborghini,
no longer possess.

114
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,160
This car, and this may get
a bit Culture Show now, I know,

115
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,520
has still got its innocence.

116
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,400
Ferrari and Lamborghini haven't.

117
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,920
One is owned by Audi,

118
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,480
the other is a commercial machine
for selling hats and keyrings.

119
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,440
Pagani is where those companies
were 30 years ago -
no corporate culture,

120
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,080
no branded teddy bears,
they just want to make
a bedroom wall pin-up poster.

121
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,240
With a touch of the madness
we saw in the Lamborghinis
of a few decades ago.

122
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,840
And you can feel that!

123
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,400
There might be some people watching
right now who could actually

124
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,920
afford one of these things.

125
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,320
And it is the job of you, me
and everybody else to stand around

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,000
and join together in a chorus,
"Do it, do it, do it!"

127
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,920
APPLAUSE

128
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,000
Wow. That is an amazing-looking
thing. Crazy but wonderful. Amazing.

129
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,720
Now, do you know, do you know
which of the world's cities

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,600
has placed the largest number
of orders for this car? No.

131
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
Wakefield. Is it?
No, I made that up.

132
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,360
Is it really as fast as it looks?

133
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,280
Yes, yes! You know
the straight between Chicago

134
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,480
and Hammerhead? Yeah. In this,
it's not as long as you think.

135
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,000
It's just there. Is it not?
So I can't relax. "Oh, there!"

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
It is just one corner,
it is amazingly insanely fast.

137
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
Now, obviously, we must find out
how fast it goes around our track,

138
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,080
and that of course means handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

139
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,440
Some say that we have at least
thought of a new way

140
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,360
of introducing him.

141
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,320
But we haven't.

142
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,440
It's The Stig!

143
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,640
And he's off,
surprisingly gentle at first,

144
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,960
but then the tyres light up,
the spoilers spring into action.

145
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,040
Coming up to the first corner,
and he is...he's indicating,

146
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,200
seems unnecessary,
but he is keeping it all in shape.

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Just about.

148
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,560
MUSIC PLAYS

149
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,520
Should explain that, since
the Olympics, The Stig has become
obsessed with national anthems.

150
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,360
He's around Chicago
and fires in towards Hammerhead.

151
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,560
Hammond was right,
that took no time at all.

152
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,600
Under-braking and takes it easy
through the left and right.

153
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,520
Now, hard on the power. Do you hear
those turbo waste-gates fluttering?

154
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,280
Now, follow through - surely he
can't use all the power there.

155
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,600
He did. He double-breaks
as he passes the tyres,

156
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,640
presumably with his left foot
or the middle one.

157
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,760
Just two corners left.
God, he's coming in fast.

158
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,320
Steady, Stig, up to Gambon.
He's very smooth through there.

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
And across the line.

160
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,520
APPLAUSE

161
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,440
Right, the Pagani, Pagani...

162
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,960
Hu...in. Huayra.

163
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,880
Huuuugh. It's a stupid name.

164
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,400
Why is it stupid?

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
It hasn't got any consonants
in it.

166
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,920
Consonants are the meat of language.
If you had no consonants in your
name,

167
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,280
you'd be...I-a.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,840
And I'd be...Eey.

169
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,680
People have waited a long time for
us to come back, and that's it.

170
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,560
Anyway, the fastest car
we have ever had around the track is

171
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
the Ariel Atom V8 1.15.1.

172
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,000
Now, are you seriously suggesting
that this is faster than that?

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,640
I would say it is in with a shout
of being as fast, yes.

174
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
Well, you're wrong. Oh.

175
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,960
Because, the Pagani did it in 1...

176
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,040
13.8. I am not joking.

177
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,920
APPLAUSE

178
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,840
It's genuinely staggering.

179
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,080
I can't see that time being beaten
ever, to be honest.

180
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,200
Anyway, it is time to do
the news, and it's good news,

181
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,240
because the Dacia Sandero is on sale
in the UK and taking the nation
by storm.

182
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,560
Great! Now, the Mercedes SLS,
there it is.

183
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,080
There is a new black version of it,
there's a picture of it there,
and it's yellow.

184
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,680
It has 60 more horsepower than the
standard, more speed, more violence.

185
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,880
Dear God, is the brochure
written in bullet holes?

186
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,040
No, the brochure is carved into your
face with a hunting knife. Is it?

187
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,320
Subtle.

188
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,200
I wonder if they have addressed
the problem with the old one -
you could never get it sideways.

189
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,920
This one doesn't go in
a straight line.

190
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,000
It's funny, weirdly - my friend
just bought a black series Mercedes,

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,760
and every time I see him,
I say, "How is it going?"

192
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,080
And he pretends it's great.
"It's fine!

193
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,400
"I'm enjoying it!" "But you've
aged 30 years in a week."

194
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
"I know! But I really like it!"

195
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,320
That's like saying, "I've got
a new attack dog, and it's great!

196
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,480
"You don't know when it's going
to attack, or who! I love it."

197
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,240
That's what that is. It's a big
yellow attack dog. It's very silly.

198
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,720
Now, may I talk about
50 Shades Of Grey?

199
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,480
Really?

200
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,400
Can I just honestly ask,
who here has read it? Be honest,

201
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,920
who here has read it?
We're noticing a trend.

202
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,840
It's mainly a women thing,
I'm guessing, yes?

203
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,400
Men don't really have an equivalent,
until now.

204
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,920
I have found the male equivalent
of 50 Shades Of Grey.

205
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,880
Tremendous Tractors.

206
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,440
LAUGHTER

207
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,040
APPLAUSE

208
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,400
Come on, you're going
to love it the most!

209
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,160
Why would you not read that?

210
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,840
It is all in here, isn't it? "Spikes!

211
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,480
"These move through the ground
to cover the seeds
after they drop.

212
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,840
"This has chunky treads,
to grip bumpy or sloppy ground."

213
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,000
Hammond... This is
absolutely marvellous.

214
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,520
I think you're reading more into it
than is actually there.

215
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,640
"It cuts the stocks and threshes them
up to knock the grain right out."

216
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm coming over all flushed.
It's just a book about tractors.

217
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
And the best thing is,
there's a series of them -

218
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,800
there's Dazzling Diggers, Amazing
Aeroplanes, Enormous Erections.

219
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,720
What? I made that last one up.

220
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,720
"Spreads the straw behind it as
the grain spills from the spout...

221
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,200
"..for farmland can be rough!"

222
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,320
I've gone somewhere else.

223
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,400
You've gone cross-eyed,
is what you've gone.

224
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,480
Right, Volkswagen... Volkswagen
named the Touareg, the big 4x4,

225
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,000
after the Tuaregene North African tribesmen.

226
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,720
It must have seemed like
a very good name at the time,

227
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,440
because they're a tough,
romantic nomadic people,

228
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,720
eking a simple living
from the harsh desert.

229
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,480
Unfortunately, it turns out that
today, the Touareg are running guns

230
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,240
from Libya into Mali and fighting
there alongside hardline Islamists.

231
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,760
I think we can be pretty sure
there will be some high-level
very urgent meetings at VW this week.

232
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,120
They're certainly dropping plans
now for the new hatchback,

233
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,600
the Baader-Meinhof.

234
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,080
"This van, the new
VW Lord's Resistance Army..."

235
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,920
That's the one with the independent
rear access, or IRA. Stop it! Yes.

236
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,040
If you think about it,
you only need one letter

237
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,880
to drop off the back of your Polo
and you will have VW PLO.

238
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,400
It turns out every single Volkswagen
is named after
a terrorist organisation!

239
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Right, there is a new Corvette out,

240
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,160
and they have brought back
the Stingray name.

241
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,080
All-new chassis, so it has perfect
50-50 weight distribution, 450 brake
horsepower from a 6.2 litre V8,

242
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
which means 0 to 60
will be under four seconds.

243
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,480
And the best thing is it makes you
27% more attractive
to your sister.

244
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,400
Now, you know those dot-matrix signs
on motorways?

245
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,560
The overhead gantries that are used
to warn you about impending doom?

246
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, sometimes, there is
no impending doom,
so they put up other messages.

247
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,680
I was driving along other day,
and one said,

248
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,360
"Have you prepared your car
for winter?"

249
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,240
And I thought,
"When I bought it from Mercedes,

250
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,680
"I rather hoped they'd done
that already."

251
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,120
How do you prepare your car
for winter?

252
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,680
We genuinely don't know.

253
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,400
Does anyone have any ideas how you
would prepare a car for winter?

254
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,480
Winter tyres!

255
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,200
Winter tyres - you could conceivably
put winter tyres on,

256
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,120
but you only need them for, what,
half a day? And they cost
about Â£150 each.

257
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,560
In the olden, olden, olden days,
you probably did have
to prepare your car for winter.

258
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,120
Perhaps that's the problem - the
man writing the sign is stuck in
1953. Yes.

259
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,200
Is it you? Have you been
moonlighting writing signs?

260
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,040
"Don't forget to line your engine
block with some stout canvas."

261
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,640
It was you!
Can I direct you to your jacket?

262
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,560
Before you say I'm locked in 1953,
Mr Toad.

263
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,640
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

264
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm the only modern one here.
Really?

265
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,440
You may remember,
a while back on Top Gear,

266
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,360
we met the Race2Recovery team,
a group of injured soldiers

267
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,320
who were planning to take on
the toughest race in the world- The Dakar.

268
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
I remember thinking,
that is very noble,

269
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,240
but it's impossible, because Mark
Thatcher had four functioning limbs,

270
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,120
he never made it,
so the idea that they would was,
in my mind, preposterous.

271
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,720
The race was over 8,500 kilometres
across South America,

272
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,840
it took two weeks, 30 percent
of the entrants didn't finish.

273
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,240
But, and this is amazing news,
last Sunday, they did!

274
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,600
APPLAUSE

275
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Philip Gillespie, Matt O'Hare
and the rest of the team,

276
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,640
deep, deep respect from all of us
here, that is amazing.

277
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,720
Tremendous. Right,
that is the end of the news.

278
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,000
I would like to move things on
swiftly to the Bentley Continental.

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,920
There are various versions
available - you can have one with a
top speed of 187, top speed of 194,

280
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,960
a top speed of 198,

281
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,480
but what if none of these top speeds
are quite what you're after?

282
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,400
Well, Bentley has a solution.

283
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,480
And here it is.
The Continental GT Speed.

284
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,480
This is not to be confused
with the previous
Bentley Continental GT Speed,

285
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,680
or the Bentley Continental GT
Supersports or in fact any other

286
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,160
Bentley Continental that looks
exactly the same as this one.

287
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,200
No, this one is a bit special.

288
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,880
What this is is
the fastest Bentley ever built,

289
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,120
because it will do
205 miles per hour.

290
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,200
It will also go from 0 to 60
in just four seconds.

291
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
And to deliver that kind
of performance,

292
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,520
the standard issue six-litre
twin-turbo engine has been stoked

293
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,840
to produce 616 horsepower.

294
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,360
To ensure that all that power is
delivered in an orderly fashion,

295
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,720
this car has been fitted with a new
eight-speed automatic gearbox.

296
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,480
To help it stand out next
to a regular Continental GT,

297
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,680
the speed has been given
a few signature flourishes.

298
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,400
Such as
this black mesh radiator grille,

299
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,600
these rifled exhausts,

300
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,040
and inside, a gorgeous
dark-tinted aluminium fascia.

301
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,640
It costs just over Â£150,000, and at
this point, you may be thinking,

302
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,160
"So what?

303
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,360
"Why do we need another fast
Bentley anyway?"

304
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,760
I thought exactly the same,
until I drove it.

305
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,280
Up until now, every Continental GT
has been, to my mind,

306
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,960
just a sort of big posh car
built to the numbers.

307
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
Built to an easy directive.

308
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,400
But this car, finally feels,
I think, like a Bentley should.

309
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,280
It's not the magnitude of the
power that is important,

310
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
it's the way it is turned into
speed.

311
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,840
You sort of get a discreet
"ahem" from the butler

312
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,200
and then this big aristocratic
whomp in the kidneys.

313
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,200
The ride in a Bentley,
I think, should be reasonably firm

314
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,160
but forgiving and supple,
and that's what you get here.

315
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,760
You feel very much in control.

316
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,920
You can read the road
through the wheels
and through the steering wheel,

317
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,520
but it doesn't batter you
in any way.

318
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,200
Likewise, that new eight-speed
gearbox is an absolute peach.

319
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,640
It's also intelligent -
it will skip gears,

320
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,200
it will go from fourth to eighth
if that's what is required.

321
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,120
The Continental has
been around for ten years now,

322
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,920
and what this version feels like
is a decade of engineering

323
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,480
coming together to make
something rather special.

324
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,120
So to find out
how good it really is,

325
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,680
we decided to take it somewhere more
demanding than a Welsh B road.

326
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,720
So, since it
has four-wheel-drive...

327
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Yes, we're going to unleash her
Â£150,000 Bentley on a full-blown

328
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,960
stage of
the World Rally Championship.

329
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,520
Specifically, here, on a 15-mile
stage of the gruelling Welsh Rally.

330
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,280
This is Top Gear
consumer journalism.

331
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,320
I've never driven a rally stage

332
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,280
and I'm not going to now.

333
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,040
I'm giving the job to rally ace
Kris Meeke...

334
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,240
who you may remember from our race
between a rally car

335
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,200
and Olympic gold-medal skele-bob
pilot Amy Williams.

336
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,280
On that occasion, my job was to sit
next to him and not look scared.

337
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Today, though, I would have to give
Kris directions,

338
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,760
which meant getting to grips with
the mystifying world of pace notes.

339
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,360
Basically, the number before the R,
the R is a right,

340
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,080
the number is the severity of
the bend. One is a slight bend

341
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,960
and the six is a real hard bend,
so the numbers are graded
one through to six.

342
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,680
The numbers between the corners
are the distance,

343
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,880
so 40 is 40 metres, the C that you
were calling is a crest,

344
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,920
and the arrow is into, so that'll be
crest into one right over crest.

345
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,280
So how do I do this and look out
the window at the same time?

346
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,080
You don't look out, you have to feel
the corners through your backside.

347
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,120
So your brain needs to be
200-300 metres ahead of my driving.

348
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,920
If it goes wrong, and we have
a crash, who says sorry first?

349
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,560
First thing I will do
is check your pulse
to see if you're still living,

350
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,280
then I'll ask you to apologise.

351
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,360
Besides the complexity of the pace
notes, there was another worry.

352
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,920
A World Rally car is
purpose-built for the job.

353
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,960
It weighs just 1,200 kilograms

354
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,840
and has bespoke brakes
to help it stop.

355
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,800
Its gearbox is made to soak up
the punishment.

356
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,160
Its roll cage is designed to keep
the occupants in one piece.

357
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:54,240
By contrast, all we have changed on
our 2.3-tonne Bentley was the seats.

358
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,760
The seats are good.
I think that's good thinking,

359
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,640
but most of other things about this
car are bad, aren't they, for rally?
Too big.

360
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah. A Bentley on a rally
is a stupid idea.

361
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,280
It has all the horsepower you need
to get it up to speed,

362
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,840
but we're trying to stop
2.3 tonnes on road tyres,
so we don't have the grip.

363
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,600
And you haven't got the handbrake.
You have the electric handbrake,
which is no good.

364
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,840
It's not, but we will have to do
a little bit of man manoeuvring
around the hairpins.

365
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,000
Are you a bit scared about driving
this rally course?

366
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,840
I am a little bit.
You should be even more scared.

367
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,080
And on those final words of
comfort...

368
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,640
..we took our place
on the start line.

369
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,000
You see that bloke's
moustache there? Yes.

370
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,520
That tells me everything
is going to be all right.

371
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,240
So if you count me down,
do a five. Yeah.

372
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,560
Five, four, three, two, one.

373
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Four right. 40.

374
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,240
You need to be quicker, James,
come on. 40 metres. Four right.

375
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,920
Suddenly, I knew what it felt like
to be a rabbit

376
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,320
caught in the headlights.

377
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,200
Next, James, come on!
Left, left plus two left.

378
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,400
James, I can't go up the road
if you don't call out the notes!

379
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,720
One right. One right?

380
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,840
Repeat, repeat!
Then three right and then 40 metres.

381
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,120
Five right into six left
then 40 metres into five right.

382
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,920
This is a five, you're too late,
James, come on!

383
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,760
Right, square right.
Sorry, square left.

384
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,880
James, either get it right
or shut up!

385
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,800
'The red mist had descended
on Kris.

386
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,000
'A fog of doubt had enveloped me,

387
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,800
'but it seemed he wasn't going to
back off.'

388
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
Oof!

389
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Next one! One right.

390
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
Bloody hell!

391
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,720
Four right.

392
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
On the plus side, the Bentley's
four-wheel drive was superb.

393
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,080
The power phenomenal.

394
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,120
And Kris was majestic.

395
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,760
Especially in the tight bends

396
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,240
where the Bentley's electric
parking brake was useless.

397
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Going into large hairpin right.

398
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,320
That's where you needed
the handbrake. Yeah.

399
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,520
Ten miles in, and I was giving Kris
proper backup.

400
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,880
Five right.

401
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,280
Severe six right. OK.
That's a bit better, James.

402
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,960
Through water.

403
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,760
40, four left.
Got it. The finish, James.

404
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,840
Two left. Tight.

405
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,720
Man in road. Two left, over a crest.

406
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,400
Jesus!

407
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,960
APPLAUSE

408
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
So, James May, James May...

409
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,560
the big question is, were you last?

410
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,960
No.

411
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,120
We beat a proper WRC rally car
by two seconds.

412
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,080
So you were second to last?
Yeah. First of the winners.

413
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,440
I have to say, though,
obviously I would like to mock you
for your hopeless co-driving skills,

414
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,840
but watching this
on that rally circuit,

415
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,440
a deeply impressive spectacle,
it really was.

416
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,520
Yeah, it is a deeply impressive car.

417
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,800
It's weird, I've never been
a fan of the Continental,

418
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,200
but I drove the little V8 engine one
last year

419
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,880
and I thought that was pretty
good as well. Yeah, absolutely.

420
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,520
They have done a great deal
to improve the car over the years.

421
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,160
But the trouble is,

422
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,280
they haven't really done anything to
improve the people who buy them. No.

423
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,720
I mean,
they do all that engineering work

424
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,520
and then they sell it
to Mario Balotelli. Exactly.

425
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,120
Who? I knew you didn't know.

426
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,000
He's that Manchester City player
with the blond Brazilian
on his head.

427
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

428
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,240
Anyway, it is now time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

429
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,200
My guest tonight is best known as a
ginger man who is intent on bringing

430
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,920
suffering and misery to countless
millions of innocent souls.

431
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,880
Don't worry,
I'm not talking about Mick Hucknall.

432
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, from Homeland,

433
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
Damian Lewis!

434
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

435
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,320
You're here! Thank you. How are you?
Pretty great. Have a seat.

436
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Thank you. Have a seat.
Thank you. Thank you.

437
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
I want to talk about Homeland,
obviously,

438
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,560
I know everybody wants to do that,
but...

439
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,480
I keep reading that
you don't know how it ends,

440
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
but you must do, really.

441
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Well... I could tell you,
but I'd have to kill you!

442
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,480
I don't know how it ends,
because THEY don't know how it ends.

443
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,000
It sounds a little avoiding
to say that,

444
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,600
but honestly, the writers
write incredibly spontaneously.

445
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,040
They're actually sitting down
this week to work out what happens
next season. You're in a wood now.

446
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,560
It's a bit of a surprise
I'm still alive, I think. Yeah.

447
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,720
Now they've got the headache
of me still being alive,

448
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,680
they've got to work out what
to do with me.

449
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,200
Obama's a fan, isn't he? The
President of America is a hug fan

450
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,880
and invited my wife
and I to the White House.

451
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
You are kidding. Sat...

452
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,000
convinced we would be sitting,
you know, by the revolving doors,

453
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,360
you know,
just on the way to the toilet,

454
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,440
consistently being
hit on the back of the head as...

455
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,320
old people went to pee.

456
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,960
And then actually we sat
at the table opposite him.

457
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,520
The programme I'm surprised
you haven't been on yet -

458
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,240
Match Of The Day. You're a big
football fan, aren't you?
I do like a bit of footy, yeah.

459
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,800
You are a...
I'm a Liverpool fan. Can I ask...

460
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,200
SPORADIC CHEERS

461
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,520
As you can tell from
my deep Scouse accent!

462
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,240
..have you never played in
one of those pro-am celebrity...?

463
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,720
I've actually twice had
the extraordinary experience

464
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,440
of playing at Old Trafford
in front of 70,000 people.

465
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,920
And last time I played, actually,
I was playing in the centre midfield

466
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,280
for England against
the rest of the world

467
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,640
with Jamie Redknapp.

468
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,560
It was just me and Jamie
marshalling midfield

469
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,960
behind Shearer and Sheringham.

470
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,360
And I clattered into Zizou,
Zinedine Zidane,

471
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,360
after about 15 minutes, and I didn't
realise how angry he was.

472
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,160
Jamie Redknapp kept following me
around the pitch, saying,

473
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,200
"Dame, Dame, calm down!"

474
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,800
And I said, "What do you mean?"

475
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,120
He said,
"They haven't come to see YOU play!"

476
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,920
And then in the 30th minute,
in front of 75,000 people,

477
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,960
what does Zidane do?

478
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,480
He rolled his foot over the ball
a few times,

479
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,160
went to the touchline,
stood there with the ball,

480
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,880
looked up at me
as I came charging in, like this,

481
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,680
going to tackle Zidane,
looked at me and went...

482
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,240
poked it straight
through my legs...

483
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,960
to spontaneous laughter.

484
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,400
I've never been laughed at
by 70,000 people.

485
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,360
It would shrivel up,
and there'd be space for things,
that's for damn sure.

486
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,440
But it was an amazing experience.

487
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
Cars. Cars.

488
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,440
I gather your first car
was an Alfa Romeo? Yes, it was.

489
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,320
It wasn't a Spider,
it wasn't a sexy Alfa Romeo.

490
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,960
I bought my Alfa Romeo for a grand
on a forecourt in Balham High Road.

491
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
No! Yeah. And it wasn't even
at a car dealership.

492
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,760
It was like a junk shop
with four cars in front of it,

493
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,560
just lined up on the pavement.

494
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,720
I used to live in Balham
and I know exact...

495
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,440
You bought an Alfa from that man?
It was just off the pavement.

496
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,240
I was pulling out of the car park
at the Royal Shakespeare Company

497
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
where I'd been working
for a couple of years.

498
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,560
I put my foot to the brake, it went
straight to the floor. No, no!

499
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,040
I just rolled out
straight across the road,

500
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,880
bang into the opposite wall.

501
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,920
Normally, the Alfa Romeo prevents
that happening by breaking down

502
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,360
on the way TO
the Royal Shakespeare Company.

503
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,960
So if you'd gone through the woe
and the misery of
a very, very unreliable car,

504
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,880
presumably your next one
was more sensible, more reliable?

505
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,560
It was a TVR. There you go.

506
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,240
Which one? The Chimaera.

507
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,080
TVR stands
for Total Vehicle Reliability.

508
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,840
LAUGHTER

509
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,480
It's amazing fun, though, the TVR,
when you get it going

510
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,680
and you throw it around
the country lanes.

511
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,240
I thought you were a bike man
more than cars.

512
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,760
I do, well, I have had motorbikes.

513
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,160
I went and got my test
and then totally fell in love

514
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,560
with the ultimate hairdresser's
chopper bike.

515
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,840
Which was the Yamaha Virago 1,000cc
high-handlebarred...

516
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,920
An Easy Rider bike! Chopper.
Easy Rider. Quite.

517
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,520
Did you never fall off a bike?

518
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,120
That's what would stop me getting on
one, the terrible pain that would
result. No idea.

519
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,560
I had a couple of prangs

520
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,680
and then I had a bad one
just outside Pentonville Prison

521
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,560
on the Caledonian Road
when a cabbie pulled out

522
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,320
and I just went straight
into his windscreen.

523
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,880
And I was out cold,

524
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,400
woke up in a sort of cinematic
cliche of a circle of faces

525
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,640
as I came to. And also to feel this
really hard grip on my wrist.

526
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,000
That's the first thing I remember,
just thinking,

527
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,760
"That doesn't feel good. Someone's
really holding onto me tight."

528
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,360
Turned out the guy who was in the
back of the taxi was a male nurse

529
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,560
from the Royal Free Hospital who'd
taken a taxi because he was pissed.

530
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,280
He then said to me later,

531
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,720
he said, "It was good I managed to
get you into the recovery position."

532
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,680
I said, "Yeah, but why were you
holding onto my wrists so hard?"

533
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,800
He said, "Because I couldn't tell
if you were actually dying

534
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,400
"or if I was just too pissed
I couldn't find your pulse!"

535
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,840
So it was just like...
My God, come back! Holding onto me.

536
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,000
Normally, these days,
when people have accidents,

537
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
the first thing they see
is somebody videoing them.

538
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,240
That is today's version, isn't it?
It is today's version. Ten iPhones.
Yeah, exactly.

539
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:57,960
Now, obviously, you came here to do
your lap. Yes. Which wasn't easy.

540
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,280
The sight that greeted us
this morning...

541
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,960
let's have a look at the pictures
we've got. This is our track.

542
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,240
That is what... Yeah.
With light sleet.

543
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,480
So, realistically, you were never
going to set the fastest time.

544
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,080
You know, it's quite nerve-wracking
coming to do this
for the first time.

545
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,520
You think, what's my limit?

546
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,120
At what point do I just follow
through a bit, you know?

547
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,440
And will that be
on the first corner?

548
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,880
And when I saw the weather,
it was oddly relaxing.

549
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,680
You were thinking, now I can't win,
so it doesn't matter?

550
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,080
Yeah, then I thought...

551
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,480
Then everyone was going, it's going
to be great fun, it's quite icy
out there,

552
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,360
you'll be able to lose the back end
and throw it around a bit.

553
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,360
I was going, how do you know I'm
going to be able to do any of that?

554
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,960
Well, who'd like to see him
doing a bit of that?

555
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
AUDIENCE: Yes!

556
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,080
These are some of the practice laps.
Let's just run the tape here.

557
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,800
Now, this is the follow-through. The
fastest part, that's pretty ballsy.

558
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,000
And...

559
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,120
I wouldn't want to go off there,
because it's pretty fast.

560
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,880
Second to last corner, yep.

561
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,160
Well held!

562
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,320
Is it well held?
Yes, it is well held!

563
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,760
And that one is...?

564
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,840
I do like your determination to keep
going. Because of the camera!

565
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,440
More rally driving, I think, today.
Very good, though.

566
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,360
Eventually, you did manage
to get a lap in. Yes.

567
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,680
Who here would like to see that?
Yes! Let's go.

568
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,040
And they're off!

569
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,920
Determined.

570
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,320
Coming up to the first corner,
just wet there,

571
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,440
nothing much to worry about.

572
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,280
Now there's something
to worry about!

573
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,280
Ooh. That's slightly scary
when the back does that.

574
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Keep it on the throttle, Damo!

575
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,560
Look at that!

576
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,280
Change gear now. Now!

577
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,560
Braking's not easy into
the Hammerhead at the best of times.

578
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,040
In those conditions...

579
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,080
Ooh, a dab of handbrake!

580
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,320
I see a dab of handbrake
and a bit of under... Change gear!

581
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,360
The Skandi flick. I believe.
It was a Skandi flick.

582
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,640
No racing driver should have to
put his windscreen wipers on.
Do you know what I mean?

583
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,200
When they're rallying,
that is quite normal.

584
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,400
I wouldn't want to be going over
there at anything more...

585
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,640
Can he make it all the way
through the tyres?

586
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,880
Yup!

587
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,440
Back into the fast bit. Now, can he
get to the second last corner right?

588
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,160
Yes... No!

589
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,960
Yes!

590
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,760
Into Gambon. Looking good.

591
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,480
Oh, no! No!

592
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,320
That was a lot of fun.
That was tremendous!

593
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,680
That does look like a lot of fun. It
was a lot of fun. It was terrific.

594
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,400
So where do you think you've come?

595
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,400
So far, the slowest man we've ever
had round here was John Prescott.

596
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,440
In a 1.56.7. Yes.

597
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,880
Damian Lewis, you did it in...

598
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,000
Two minutes...

599
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,400
..nine seconds...

600
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,920
..point one!

601
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,880
But...

602
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,480
APPLAUSE

603
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,960
Should we have
a separate board for snow?

604
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,840
So I think you're the fastest person
we've ever had in the snow.

605
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,280
So we'll put you up there.

606
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,800
It's good!

607
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,200
I have to say, actually... Great.

608
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,880
I do have to say, that is
the slowest lap we've ever had.

609
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,320
But, and I'm sure everyone
will agree with me on this,

610
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,160
by far and away
the most entertaining.

611
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,080
Ladies and gentlemen, Damian Lewis!

612
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

613
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,160
Now, so far in this programme,

614
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,800
James has been rallying
in a Â£150,000 Bentley,

615
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,120
and I've raced around our track
in an Â£800,000 Pagani.

616
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,520
So someone's got to bring it all
back down to earth.

617
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,840
Yes, and unfortunately
that person is Jeremy.

618
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,880
Yes, as usual, it falls to me
to be the voice of reason
and common sense.

619
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,800
With this, the Peel P50,
the smallest car ever made.

620
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Until now. Because I have created,
behold, this!

621
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,960
Now, I know. I know.

622
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,480
Incredulity is often
the first response.

623
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,960
But let me talk you through it.

624
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,200
Because underneath the handcrafted
aluminium bodywork,

625
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,520
you have the engine and the running
gear from a quad bike.

626
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:38,680
But you will note it has lights
and indicators and a number plate.

627
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,480
It's passed
all the Government tests,

628
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,320
which means you can drive it
on the road.

629
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,200
Are you seriously suggesting that
that is an actual car?

630
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,040
I promise it's a real car. What's it
called? Ah! Well, that's brilliant.

631
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,160
Because it's shorter and narrower
than a Peel P50,

632
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,200
I've called it the P45.

633
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Now I'm going to test it.

634
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,960
What, you're going to test a car
that you built? Yes.

635
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,120
So what are we going to do next
week? VW tests its new Golf?

636
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,280
Shut up! I'm going to be completely
unbiased, as you shall see.

637
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,440
I began on the track.

638
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:27,280
And having determined very quickly
that the P45 was exquisite
in every way,

639
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,440
I took it onto the public highway.

640
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,320
I should make it plain this is
Base L model that I'm driving now,

641
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,720
but there are some optional extras.

642
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,920
CAR BACKFIRES
Urgh! Nothing wrong.

643
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,520
Edit that out.

644
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,680
There is, for instance,

645
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,800
the deluxe wash wipe option
which costs just Â£1.99.

646
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,680
Good.

647
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,880
And also, for just Â£500, this does
come with satellite navigation.

648
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,120
There's the sat nav. You see?

649
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,440
You just hold it up
and see where you're going.

650
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,680
The P45 is designed to deal
with all eventualities.

651
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,720
I'm relaxed.

652
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,760
So, I decided to join the main road.

653
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,040
Yes, look at this! Look at this!
Very brilliant.

654
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,560
CAR BACKFIRES
Oh! Oh my God!

655
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,880
If you're watching this in the edit,
make sure that doesn't go
on television.

656
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
I don't want people thinking
it's a death trap.

657
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,480
CAR BACKFIRES AND JEREMY SCREAMS

658
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,920
It happened again!
Edit that out as well.

659
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,760
I can't believe how quiet
the roads are this morning.

660
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,440
I'm barely seeing
any traffic at all.

661
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,680
As I neared Guildford,
I did find a jam,

662
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,000
but this was no problem
for the super-narrow P45.

663
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
The speed machine is coming through!

664
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,080
Ah! Oh! Oh! Nothing wrong!

665
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,200
Oh, yes!

666
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,520
This is incredible.
Ladies and gentlemen,

667
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,320
you are witnessing
the birth of the future.

668
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,480
I'm just staggered that
Ford, General Motors, Toyota,

669
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,960
all the automotive giants, haven't
thought to make a car like this.

670
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,920
And yet, a poky little motoring show
on BBC...

671
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,880
Ow!

672
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,600
This is the way to drive the P45,
with your face on the windscreen,

673
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,520
then it can't smash into it.

674
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,480
So, for local commuting,
my car is faultless.

675
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,400
But what if
you want to go further afield?

676
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,480
To find out,
I pulled into a petrol station

677
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,880
and without even getting out,
I brimmed its tank.

678
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,640
Good.

679
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,800
Damn!

680
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,960
I only have a 1.7-litre fuel tank,

681
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,760
but the minimum delivery
here is two litres.

682
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,200
Discreetly, I squirted
the difference into a bin.

683
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,480
(I didn't see anything.)

684
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,680
Then I fired up the two-stroke,
100cc engine

685
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,800
and set off to London.

686
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,920
Technically, I'm legally allowed
to drive the P45 on motorways

687
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,040
and dual carriageways.

688
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,400
So to see how it gets on,
I'm about to join the fearsome A3.

689
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,360
Here we go.

690
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,480
Ooh.

691
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,680
Aarghhh!

692
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,480
Arghh! I've never been frightened
of a Citroen Picasso before

693
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,960
and I just was!

694
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,560
Aarghhh! A van!

695
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,720
Arghh! I've got a weave on!

696
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Ohhh!

697
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,880
Oh, yes! Help me! HELP! HELP!

698
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,200
How fast is that now?

699
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,160
34! Arghh! Lorry, lorry,
lorry, lorry!

700
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,560
Ohhh! A lot of poo shot out then!

701
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,480
So while this may be
completely legal,

702
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,160
it's also
completely terrifying.

703
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,120
However, the advantage of a car
this small is that

704
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,560
you don't have to take
it on dual carriageways.

705
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,640
In fact, you don't have to use
the main roads at all.

706
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,080
What you do instead is you drive it
to the railway station,

707
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,080
but instead of leaving it in the car
park to be vandalised and stolen,

708
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,560
you take it on the train with you.

709
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,000
Now, I will be honest.

710
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,360
None of the train companies
we contacted would play ball,

711
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,680
so I'm using the coach instead.

712
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,520
Coach is good.
Coach is better than a train.

713
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,360
Fewer diseases on a coach.

714
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
And of course,
when you get to the big city,

715
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,120
you don't have to use
the tube or the bus,

716
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,120
because you have your car WITH you.

717
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,960
Ah.

718
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,600
ENGINE SPLUTTERS

719
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,480
Oh, dear.

720
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,360
I don't think...

721
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,480
ENGINE CUTS OUT

722
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,120
Ah.

723
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,280
ENGINE FAILS TO START

724
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,520
Just cut the cameras.

725
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,120
In London, I went for
a little drive.

726
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,520
Yes!

727
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,840
All sorts of hand signals
available. If I want to go...

728
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,040
left, right, somebody annoys me.

729
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,200
And then I went shopping.

730
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,880
And with the P45,
there's no need to pay.

731
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,120
Or waste time
looking for a parking space.

732
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,160
Oh, dear.

733
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,920
Of course,
a Peel P50 also fits in a lift,

734
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,680
but because it has no reverse gear,
you can't back it out again.

735
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,720
Unless there's a newsreader to hand.

736
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,200
This, though,
does have a reverse gear.

737
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,160
So...here we go.

738
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,480
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep...

739
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,520
I know what you're thinking.
There's no way you'd be allowed

740
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,080
to drive around here
with a two-stroke engine

741
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,440
belching fumes into the faces
of all the baby children.

742
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,640
But here's the thing.

743
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,240
The P45 is a hybrid.

744
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,760
So when you come inside,
you can disconnect the petrol engine

745
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,680
and connect up
a couple of electric motors.

746
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,960
A very simple job.
You take off a wheel,

747
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,680
connect a free-wheeling hub...

748
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,760
It takes a couple of guys...minutes.

749
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,000
There are a couple of drawbacks.

750
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,200
Number one,
the top speed is now 3mph.

751
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,600
Number two, the batteries will
only last an hour.

752
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,320
But I'm a man and I can't
think of any shopping expedition

753
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,440
that could possibly take
longer than that.

754
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,240
Shoes, I've got some,
I don't need any of those.

755
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,320
I've got a chair.

756
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,880
There's nothing I want to buy.

757
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,360
Eventually, I bought
a present for James.

758
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,560
Then I decided to find out
just how quiet my car is

759
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,920
in electric mode,

760
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,000
so I took it here.

761
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,280
This is extraordinary.

762
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,280
Nobody's looking up.
Nobody's noticing me.

763
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,440
The only trouble is that
libraries are more interesting

764
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,960
than shopping centres.

765
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,360
Whoa. History Of Germany.

766
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,440
Can't be that big just to say,
"We lost a lot."

767
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,920
An hour simply flew by.

768
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,880
Get out of the way, student.

769
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,960
Soon, the batteries were flat.

770
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,720
Oh, no.

771
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,360
HE SIGHS

772
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,240
Now, if this were a Peel P50,
I could simply pick it up

773
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,200
and carry it out.

774
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,640
But I'm afraid the P45
is a bit heavier.

775
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,640
A lot heavier. Weighs a tonne.

776
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,960
There's only one thing for it.

777
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,760
ENGINE STARTS

778
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,120
ENGINE REVS

779
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,120
This is so embarrassing.

780
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,320
ENGINE REVS

781
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,640
Sorry. Sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry. Really, I'm so sorry.

782
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,400
That night, I was due
to go to a show.

783
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,720
Oh, yes!

784
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,320
Stupid idiot!

785
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,200
And as I was running late,
I decided to take a short cut.

786
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,960
Look here. "Cyclists not allowed."

787
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,800
Good.

788
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,640
I'm not a cyclist, so here I come.

789
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,880
Hello...

790
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
GLASS SHATTERS

791
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,080
ENGINE REVS

792
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,840
Come on. Quickly...

793
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,720
GLASS SHATTERS

794
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,160
I'm really sorry.

795
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,560
'Soon, I was in the West End...'

796
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,120
Arghh!

797
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,960
'..and nearing the theatre.'

798
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,720
This is the joy of a P45.

799
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,720
Everything is a drive-through.

800
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,880
Hello. One, please.

801
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,520
Thank you very much.

802
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,800
THUD

803
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,440
Ooh...

804
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,240
There you go.

805
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

806
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,560
The show was ace!

807
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,520
# Radio ga ga, video goo goo... #

808
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,120
Not a single gay man on that stage.

809
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,680
# All we need is... #

810
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,760
However, my seating arrangements
were a bit cramped.

811
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,920
MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH

812
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,120
INDISTINCT

813
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,200
Oh, no! Cut! Cut!

814
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,320
The next morning,
it was clear to me that the P45

815
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,760
was completely excellent, but would
it make commercial sense

816
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,440
to put it into production?

817
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,000
To find out, I'd set up
an important business meeting.

818
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,720
To make sure I look my best,
I'm wearing a suit, as you can see.

819
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,800
I've washed my hair
and now I'm going to give the car

820
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,240
a wash and brush-up as well.

821
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,720
Now, here we go. Yes.

822
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,040
Arghh! It's not warm!
It's extremely cold!

823
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,560
Oh, yes! People pay many pounds
for this in countries...

824
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,480
Oh, it's gone quite badly.

825
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,920
What's happened here?
A terrible thing has happened.

826
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,320
SHOUTING

827
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,080
A bad thing has happened.

828
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,480
I've got completely wedged.

829
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,280
ALARM BEEPS

830
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,680
With the P45 untangled, I headed
off to my big business meeting.

831
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,480
First of all, I'd like to
apologise for my...wet sleeves

832
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,960
and my bloodshot eye -
I got soap in it.

833
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,840
We'll gloss over that.

834
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,280
Right, erm...
Cars are getting bigger, these days.

835
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,200
I've got a picture of an original
Ford Cortina,

836
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,720
which I'm sure you won't remember,
Deborah! (LAUGHS)

837
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,040
And the modern Mondeo,
which is bigger.

838
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,200
And it's the same story with
the Golf and the same story

839
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,040
with the Fiesta, and it's ridiculous

840
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,880
when we live in a country
as cramped and overcrowded as ours.

841
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,680
So cars should be getting smaller.

842
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,000
And that is where this comes in.

843
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
This is my creation.

844
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,600
The P45.

845
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,880
The idea is you can drive
this to a railway station

846
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,840
and then you pop
it on a train or a coach,

847
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,120
go to the next city
and you can use it there as well.

848
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,960
It's road legal...

849
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,600
Can I make sure, cos I might
have missed something?

850
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,080
You started off apologising
why your arms were wet

851
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,320
and then didn't explain why.

852
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
Because they've got water on them.

853
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,760
I actually do travel back and forth
from the West Country on the train.

854
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,920
You say you can take that with you.

855
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,880
That looks quite big
to get on a train.

856
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,440
That's because train companies
put seats in their carriages,

857
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,760
which they needn't do with this.

858
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,360
If you just produced a carriage,
you could drive in and sit there.

859
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,640
Hold on a minute. At the moment,
you can't get it on a train?

860
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,360
Not as such. No. So you've got
to rely on the train companies

861
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,000
redesigning their trains for you
to get this on the train?

862
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,720
Well, redesigning is quite easy -
you just take the seats out.

863
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,680
OK. I, erm...

864
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,600
Jeremy,
is this your first business venture?

865
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,560
Yes.

866
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,240
What would it cost to have
one of these on the road?

867
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,480
Â£8,000. Â£8,000?

868
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,720
What would you make them for?
It'll cost Â£4,000 to build.

869
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,680
By children or will you get adults?

870
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,800
Can you really get children
to work in a factory?

871
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,040
Cos that would be
brilliant if you could.

872
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,600
EVAN DAVIS: Jeremy has asked
if he could get children

873
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,000
to work in a factory.

874
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,720
You must come and have a look.

875
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,400
Theo Paphitis decides to take
a closer look.

876
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,640
Jeremy. It's shit. It isn't!

877
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,680
It is. Total and utter shit.

878
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,000
Theo Paphitis thinks Jeremy's car
still needs work.

879
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,800
I don't understand why you're not
seeing what I'm seeing here.

880
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,760
DEBORAH: We are, Jeremy.

881
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,640
I can see exactly what
you're looking at.

882
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,320
It's just that I can see
that it's loopy and you can't.

883
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,520
How much of YOUR money have you
invested in this? None at all.

884
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,640
That is the best thing that
you've done yet.

885
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,960
Do you have a plan? Do you have any
idea of the size of the market,

886
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,120
how you're going to sell it
to that market?

887
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,360
Yes. So, size of the market?

888
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,240
1,600 a month.

889
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,760
1,600 a month? Or a year.

890
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,200
Well, Jeremy.
I'm going to make you an offer.

891
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,680
That's the ticket!

892
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,120
Â£1 for 1%.

893
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,800
Why would anybody buy this?

894
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,000
It's got stripes on it.
I couldn't invest in you.

895
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,360
I'm sorry. I'm out.

896
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,840
Jeremy, I have to say one thing.

897
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,800
It is the smartest
I've ever seen you.

898
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,120
So congratulations for that.

899
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,640
You've made, clearly, a real effort.

900
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,920
However, I can't invest
in ridiculous things.

901
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,720
So on that basis, Jeremy, I'm going
to have to tell you I'm out.

902
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,080
Jeremy, it's rubbish. It's useless.

903
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,880
You're wasting your time.

904
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,960
I can't invest in this. So I'm out.

905
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,120
Theo Paphitis is out,
which means Jeremy's only chance

906
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,760
is Duncan Bannatyne.

907
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,080
Well, Jeremy.

908
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,920
I'm the last Dragon in.
I tried to tempt them

909
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,320
by making an offer,
hoping they would come in with me.

910
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,600
Sorry, I can't understand
a word you're saying.

911
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,760
That is... I'm out.

912
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,440
Jeremy has insulted Duncan
Bannatyne,

913
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,600
and now he too is out.

914
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,320
All the Dragons have given him
his P45.

915
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

916
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,480
Well, I'm sorry...

917
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,160
I'm unbowed by their negativity.

918
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,400
How can they not realise this is
a car you NEVER need to park?

919
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,440
You can go to the theatre in it,
shopping, your arms are free

920
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,680
so you can reach things from
the shelves.

921
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,800
You never need get out of it.

922
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,880
Which is ironic, because the first
thing anyone will want to do

923
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,160
on getting in, is get out of it.

924
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,320
LAUGHTER

925
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,480
And it's a death trap.

926
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,200
I feel like Vincent van Gogh.

927
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,440
You've only got one ear? No.
Nobody recognised his genius

928
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,840
until AFTER he died.

929
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,720
So what you're saying is,
for this to be a commercial success,

930
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,200
you have to be dead?

931
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,280
LAUGHTER

932
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,400
Yes.

933
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,720
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

934
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,760
Thank you for watching. They'll see
you next week. Good night!
