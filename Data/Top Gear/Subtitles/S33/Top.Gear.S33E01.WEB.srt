00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,759
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,800
We're back!

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,599
This is always my
favourite time of the year.

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,959
Everything feels nice and familiar.

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,079
The clocks have gone back,
Strictly's on the telly

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,559
and Harris has got his autumn
socks on.

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,959
100% Merino, Pad.
Anything less - mug's game.

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,239
It's that time of year, isn't it,
for battening down the hatches

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,759
and hunkering down. Oh, I do love a
hunker.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,999
I've heard you in the dressing room.
I've heard you!

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,479
And, of course, we've got a
brand-new series of Top Gear.

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Take a look at this.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,560
Watch this.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,200
We're going in!

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,399
I love the fact that it revs to 11!

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Love that it goes to 11!

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
It's like a giant game of Guess
Who, isn't it?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
Where's the turn there?

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240
Just reminds me of being young
and stupid.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
My onions have gone again.

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,640
My onions have gone!

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Watch this, boys - the transformer.
Are you ready?

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,039
It's crazy, that.

24
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,599
Oh, my word!

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,760
I hope you've got comprehensive
insurance, Paddy.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Whoa!

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
This is absolutely bonkers.

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,800
Ready?

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,280
It sort of worked.

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,999
Exciting!

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
It's not bad. The best bunch
of cars we've had in ages.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,079
Real quality. Yes. Really good.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,719
All that to come.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,399
But right now, we've got
a cracking show in store.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,679
Later on, Chris Harris gets
his Merino-woollen mitts

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,000
on that battery-powered
beast over there.

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,239
But we kick off by talking
about this, the humble

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,959
pick-up truck. Fred!

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,319
Say some words.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,439
I will do that.

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,199
Pick-ups are on the rise here
in the UK,

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,199
but pretty much everywhere
else on the planet

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,759
they're already massive news.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,999
About 4 million of them are sold
around the world every year.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,439
That's a lot of picking up.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,759
We wanted to dig a little deeper
into this mysterious world,

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,359
so we hopped on a flight to the
spiritual home of the pick-up,

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,600
which, as it turned out,
wasn't America.

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,840
Get out!

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,999
This is Thailand, home to white sand
beaches, lush jungle

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,720
and plenty of pick-up trucks.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,880
Thailand buys more pick-ups per head
than any other country in the world.

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,319
And, with a few grand each

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,319
to see what we could pick
up on the local market,

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,520
let's just say I had absolutely
nailed it.

56
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
Look at this.

57
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,039
I have not messed about.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,599
I've gone for a Toyota Hilux,

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,759
the camel of the car world,

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,519
tough as old boots, because you see
round here, pick-ups...

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,559
They're not just for delivering
trestle tables

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,439
to the local village fete.

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,839
These get things anywhere
they need to go.

64
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,199
As you can see, this one,
not exactly standard.

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,319
It's been raised.

66
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,719
It's got big monster tyres,
got a winch at the front.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,879
This thing has been made
Thailand ready.

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,679
I've smashed it out of the park.

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,839
Jeez!

70
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,560
Not so fast.

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,519
Because, if you want a truly
Thai truck,

72
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,680
then look no further
than the Isuzu D-Max.

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Oh, wow!

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Look at this!

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
Morning. Good morning.

76
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,159
D-Max? Yes.

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,679
Most popular pick-up drop
in Thailand, that.

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,719
150,000 sold every year.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,119
This is what they're all about.
This is the culture.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,879
It's a big thing over here -

81
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,359
pimping up your pick-up trucks.

82
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,399
You've got a carbon bonnet pad.
Is that carbon?

83
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,439
Yes, I have. Carbon-wrapped fibre.

84
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,519
Don't ruin the illusion.
Your wheels. Yes. Have a look in.

85
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,679
Lovely, isn't it? Bucket seats.

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
Gear stick. Oh, it's got the lot.

87
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,959
I must admit, I think you've done
all right. It's what it's all about.

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,599
Stands out, doesn't it?

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,839
Maybe, but to really appreciate
Thailand's love affair
with the pick-up,

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,640
you'll want something
a bit more bespoke.

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
Ah! I tell you what, bud...

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,679
Wow, Chris - an E30 BMW.

93
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,479
What I've done here...
I was just going
to say. Talk us through it.

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,719
Well, I mean, come on.
I've taken a lovely old three series

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,919
which was nearing the end
of its life

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,919
and I've transformed it into a
performance pick-up.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,399
Doesn't it look gorgeous?
I'm just staring at its beauty.

98
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,319
Didn't do it myself - it was a
man here who did it because frankly

99
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,759
they will turn anything into a
pick-up out here and they'll do

100
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,239
it with some style.

101
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,719
It's a beautiful job, all done
locally.

102
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,319
Now, obviously, we can see what
you've done to it, OK.

103
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,279
But pick-up trucks essentially are
going to be off-roading.

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,319
We can see what you've done. Whoa!
What can we not see?

105
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,519
What have you done to make
it pick-up-esque underneath?

106
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,959
When you said off-roading...
Yeah. I'm looking at these cars

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,039
and we're very much for
different roads.

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,519
You just took a three series...
Yeah.

109
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,799
..cut the back off...
Yeah. ..that's it. Yeah.

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,840
Wow!

111
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,040
So, with two trucks and a chopped
up Beemer all ready to roll...

112
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,160
..we headed out to discover
what Thailand and its pick-up
obsession was really all about.

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,199
I look the Thai culture, lads.

114
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,999
It's very bright and brash
and in your face.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,040
It's a bit of a senses overload.

116
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
Anywhere else. If we were driving
around in the UK in this pick-up,

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,039
everyone would be looking at it.

118
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,599
But over here it's just part
of the furniture.

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,279
Do you know what the single most
important law of the road

120
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,519
is over here?

121
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,920
It is actually illegal to drive
without wearing a shirt.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,240
McGuinness, you are, let's say,
pushing it slightly.

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Everywhere you look, boys, there's
pick-up trucks.

124
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,559
Thailand really is the pick-up
capital of the world.

125
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,439
It's known as the Detroit
of the Far East because they build

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,000
so many of the things, literally
millions a year.

127
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,080
Look at this coming through.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,559
It's outrageous.

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,960
That is ridiculously overloaded.

130
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,519
Now, to put our pick-ups to the
test, we've been told to head north

131
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,800
towards the capital, Bangkok.

132
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,800
From there, we'd be striking out
deep into Thailand's rural interior.

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,199
What that would mean for my
low-slung Beemer

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,199
we'd have to wait and see,

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,440
but so far it was looking
very good indeed.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,239
If you want quality and durability,
go mid-'80s Germany.

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,919
I mean, this must be a
40-year-old car

138
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,959
and it's superb.

139
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,439
The trim's in great condition.

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
I've got the optional sport seats.

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,999
Still think that if BMW made a car
that looked like this now

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,120
it'd be a runaway best-seller.

143
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,200
Especially as BMW already knows
exactly how to build one.

144
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,520
Behold the original E30 pick-up.

145
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,119
Built back in the mid-'80s
to haul parts around the factory

146
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,759
at BMW's slightly unhinged,
high-performance M Division,

147
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,600
it was surely the coolest
pick-up truck in history.

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,720
And now, thanks to some genius local
workmanship, there's another one.

149
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,399
I've not budgeted for tarmac
as good as this.

150
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,999
You must be loving life
in yours, Chris.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,999
Lovely BMW, straight six.
It's all familiar in here.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,039
Yeah, she just cruises along.

153
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,559
I don't want to burst your bubble,

154
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,959
but whatever the road throws
at me in this, I'm ready for.

155
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
Anything!

156
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,239
These days, everyone's rolling round
in SUVs,

157
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,759
but I've Got to ask, what does an
Audi Q7 give you that this doesn't?

158
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,999
I'm up high. I can see everything.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,119
Now, it's a bit tatty inside,
but it's going to be.

160
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
These are workhorses.

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,719
And don't forget, this workhorse
is a Hilux.

162
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,279
Over 50 years
they've been building these.

163
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,159
Selling 18 million of them to every
corner of the globe.

164
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,679
It's 20 years old, this car.

165
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,280
207,000 kilometres, it'll
go forever.

166
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
Maybe it will.

167
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
But in Thailand, they have
different priorities.

168
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,239
If you go to Holland, you'll
expect to see a bicycle.

169
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,680
Come to Thailand and expect to see
a D-Max.

170
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,319
It was made here, it was
launched here.

171
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,959
And it's capable.

172
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,599
It's practical.

173
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,399
The white T-shirt of the
pick-up world.

174
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,359
Everyone's got one, and they do
the job.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,679
And like any white T-shirt,

176
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,839
there's always room for improvement.

177
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,519
A bit of glitter, a few
sequins sewn on.

178
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Really pimp 'em up.

179
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,279
And to make that very point,

180
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,919
we were soon told to stop off
at a nearby circuit

181
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,160
where we'd be getting a taste
of how the locals go racing.

182
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Look at this.

183
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,039
Oh, wow!

184
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,520
That is mega.

185
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,639
Look at the trucks coming through,
look at these.

186
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,679
Oh, D-Maxs, lads.

187
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,239
I told you, they absolutely
love 'em round here.

188
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,479
What a little circuit.

189
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,719
Set on the edge of the Kaeng Krachan
National Park,

190
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,239
the KK Circuit is surely one
of the more spectacular tracks

191
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
that the world of motorsport
has to offer.

192
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,799
This is nice, Chris, innit?

193
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,159
Look at this.

194
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
What a track.

195
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,959
But better still,
it plays host

196
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,920
to one of Thailand's
favourite race series.

197
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,759
Diesel D-Maxs tuned to over
300 horsepower

198
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,840
going wheel to wheel in a fully
fledged pick-up truck championship.

199
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
CHRIS COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS

200
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,559
Wowsers.

201
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,639
ENGINES ROAR

202
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,439
Sound a bit different to yours, Pad.

203
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,159
Yeah. Don't they? Yeah.
THEY LAUGH

204
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,559
We weren't just here to
watch, though.

205
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,639
No. To give us the full performance
pick-up experience,

206
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,000
we'd been invited to take part
in our own special relay race.

207
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,039
Each paired with a local pro

208
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,999
whose first job was to jump

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,559
on board our pick-ups

210
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,959
to give us a quick look

211
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,239
at the track.

212
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,719
Here we go.

213
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,639
A ride, it would be fair to say,
some enjoyed more than others.

214
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,079
TYRES SCREECH

215
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,320
CHEERING

216
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,240
Right line? Right line.

217
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,520
Whoa!

218
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,160
LAUGHING

219
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,519
Whoa.

220
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,039
TYRES SCREECH

221
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,039
LAUGHING
The back wheel came up.

222
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,719
Whoa!

223
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,479
Whoa! Whoa!

224
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,159
CHRIS LAUGHS
Wow!

225
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,720
I think he likes the drift.

226
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,800
With the pre-race entertainment done
with, it was relay time.

227
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,479
Having each been lent one of our
team-mates' spare trucks to run in,

228
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,759
the race itself would be fought over
two stints,

229
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,399
each with a grid of six cars.

230
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,639
Our team-mates would be up first,
battling for four laps

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,479
to put us in the best position
they could

232
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,999
to then take on our own set
of pros

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,240
in another four lap run
to the finish.

234
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,479
My lad, Pete, he's all over it,
he loves it.

235
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,080
This is your lad, 68.

236
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,359
Come on, boss.

237
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,599
There's my lad.

238
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,919
Sarun. He's called Sarun.

239
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,159
He's in Tommy.

240
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,519
Bit confusing. You what?

241
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,039
That's... He's called Sarun,

242
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,079
his car's got the name Tommy
on the side.

243
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,439
He's not called Tommy. Is his car
called Tommy?

244
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,359
His car's called Tommy.
Who's called Tommy?

245
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,319
The car.

246
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,400
So, our first pick-up race was on.

247
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,800
Go on, Sarun!

248
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,559
They shift, don't they?

249
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,279
And it looks easy from out here.
I don't think it's so easy in there.

250
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,879
I don't think it looks easy, Chris.

251
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,200
No, I don't know what
you're watching, Chris.

252
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,799
Can I make a prediction here, Paddy?

253
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
We're going to be fifth and sixth.

254
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,999
Come on, Tommy!

255
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,520
Wind it up, son!

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,119
Are you at the front, Fred? Second.

257
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,799
Second, Chris, I'm third.

258
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,199
You're lad is racing the race of his
life here. Shut up.

259
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,880
He's going to get out to you and go,
"Carry on."

260
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh! He nearly had the back end
out then.

261
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,559
With the pros now fighting
over the last lap,

262
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,440
we headed for our race trucks...

263
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,240
..and got ready to take
to the track.

264
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,840
Wow, it's hot in here.

265
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,959
McGuinness's would be handing
over to him in fourth,

266
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,799
mine second,

267
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,839
while Harris's...

268
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,719
Bloody hell, I'm in first.

269
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,239
What a drive.

270
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,839
..had landed him in the lead.

271
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,360
I'm off. And we're off.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,119
Come on!

273
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,719
Six cars, four laps, and we were off
to a flying start.

274
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,599
This is a very intimidating vehicle.

275
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
Might have bit off more than I can
chew here.

276
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,879
Although one of us would probably
have liked

277
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,119
a slightly smoother take-off.

278
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,799
Oh, he's away here, Chris Harris.

279
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,119
How am I going to keep
with this lad?

280
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,560
TYRES SCREECH

281
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,999
There's an off straight away.
Is that Flintoff?

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,440
Get back out.

283
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,599
Wow, that was different.

284
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
This is sketchy.

285
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,319
What is this I'm driving?

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,159
I've spun out on the first corner.

287
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,399
To be fair, though, up at the front,
even our best driver

288
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,160
was finding his truck
tricky to master.

289
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,839
TYRES SCREECH

290
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,160
Brakes are terrible.

291
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,079
This thing, I know it just looks
like a pick-up to you,

292
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,240
but it's one of the most difficult
cars I've ever driven.

293
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,279
Oh, too much, too much, too much.

294
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,999
Take it off a bit.

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,199
Wow!

296
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,480
Whoa, Fred, nice and easy.

297
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,039
Is he catching me? I'm not sure
he is.

298
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,119
Despite his teething troubles,

299
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,479
Harris was keeping the second place
pro at bay

300
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,199
and was looking nailed on
for the win.

301
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,759
Come on!

302
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,639
But as the laps ticked away...

303
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,120
Yeah, baby!

304
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,159
Two to go, come on.

305
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,999
..Flintoff was getting his eye in.

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,360
Get round. Get round.

307
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,879
Oh, nice, Fred.

308
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,280
And that meant this race was now
all about the battle for third.

309
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,559
Gaining on Paddy's tail here.

310
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,799
Oh, he'll be feeling it now.

311
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
Oh, Paddy, I'm going to make you
make a mistake here.

312
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
Whoa! Smokey Joe!

313
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,840
Power, power, power, power, power.

314
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,800
Come on, old girl!

315
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,280
Come on!

316
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,400
Victory!

317
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,119
Get out, get out, get out.

318
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,279
Let's go.

319
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,199
Keep going. Come on, Fred.

320
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,559
Here we go.

321
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,319
Woo!

322
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,079
Chequered flag, over we go.

323
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,920
He got me.

324
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,839
So, there we have it, our first
taste of Thai pick-up racing.

325
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,799
And given our usual track record
with this sort of thing,

326
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,639
we had to chalk it up as a
surprise success.

327
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,159
Number one?

328
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,479
Well done, Christopher.

329
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,799
But I am absolutely...
Well done. ..rooted.

330
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,479
I don't advise racing
in the tropics.

331
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,959
Hey. Thanks, Pete. Thank you.
Well done, lads. Well done.

332
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,519
You were wicked. I tell you what...
Thanks for letting us loose.

333
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,039
..these... We love 'em. I have a
new-found respect for the D-Max.

334
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,879
Yeah, amazing. Fantastic.
Is it the power?

335
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,639
The power is amazing.
The brakes are not amazing.

336
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,999
The brakes are either all on
or nothing.

337
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,079
But the real winner is the circuit.

338
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,759
The circuit is the best.

339
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,400
Amazing. Fantastic.

340
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,399
It was time to get back on the
road north

341
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,799
and see what else we could pick up
about Thailand

342
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,320
as we headed towards Bangkok.

343
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,720
Dear God, have a look at this.

344
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
That has got to be so heavy.

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,279
The chassis is bowing in the middle
and there's two lads sitting on top.

346
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,240
It's bent that much he can't even
shut his driver's door properly.

347
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,999
In my many years of travelling
the globe,

348
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,960
that is the ropiest thing
I've seen car-wise.

349
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Look at the vista, lads.

350
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,880
Welcome to Bangkok.

351
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,519
You must have been there
before, Chris.

352
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,199
Did you not have a gap year
when you was at uni?

353
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,959
I might have had a gap year.
Did you?

354
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,519
Did you spend it in Thailand?

355
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,799
No, I did not.

356
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,199
I went to Africa to teach,
actually, Andrew.

357
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,079
POSH ACCENT: I went and
found myself.

358
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,560
I-I just went over.
It was AMAZING.

359
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,039
What did you do, rob shops?

360
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,320
HE CHUCKLES

361
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,759
Lads, now we're in our first
bit of traffic,

362
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,279
coming into the heart of the city,

363
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,439
last night I was doing a bit
of research on the old Internet,

364
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,799
Googling Bangkok,

365
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,679
and I've found us a very,
very interesting

366
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,000
back street venue.

367
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,440
Remember, delete history, Patrick.

368
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,199
No need for that.

369
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,880
Because what I'd actually
found was pick-up paradise.

370
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,679
What've we got here, Pad?

371
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,639
D-Max nirvana.

372
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,479
This is the Mecca for all
things pick-up.

373
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,999
Oh!

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
Fellow D-Maxer there.

375
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,399
Look at these D-Max, lads.

376
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,039
Look at this!

377
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,719
I think they've even got you covered
here, Paddy, with graphics.

378
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,199
Look at that one.

379
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,319
How many turbochargers?

380
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,359
That one's got two massive
blowers on it.

381
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,919
Look at this, it goes all the way
around here.

382
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,200
It carries on going.
There's everything.

383
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,679
I'll tell you what, this makes
me feel a bit wistful for my past,

384
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,559
for the max power years.

385
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,359
When I was younger, I couldn't leave
stuff alone.

386
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,879
If I bought a car, I had to
add the bits -

387
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,799
the fancy Hi-Fi, the rims,
the lowering kit.

388
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,319
It's just... It's a... It's a rite
of passage, isn't it?

389
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,839
You want to just add things.

390
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,999
Got to say, Pad, when I saw
your pick-up,

391
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,319
I thought, "That's a
bit much, that."

392
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,239
However, I get it now. I get it.

393
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,960
Good Lord, I could waste days here.

394
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,079
But the market was only the warm up.

395
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,919
And just around the corner,

396
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,720
we found some of Thailand's proper
max power petrolheads.

397
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,999
Wowsers.

398
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Check out the metal here.

399
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,959
Look at that Lotus.

400
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,160
Wow!

401
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
Look at these.

402
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,439
That might be the fastest Jazz
I've ever seen in my life.

403
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,039
Turns out Bangkok isn't
just mad for mods, though.

404
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,079
This is mega!

405
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,200
They also love a bit of drifting.

406
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,079
Oh!

407
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,279
Yes!

408
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,040
Look at this behind. Look at this.

409
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,840
Now, this was what we'd come to see.

410
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,759
Another corner of the world
completely mad for tuning

411
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,480
and tyre smoke.

412
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,040
Fantastic.

413
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,119
To get the full Thai
drift experience, though...

414
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,679
Come on, then, McGuinness.

415
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,919
..we nominated our
D-Max correspondent

416
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,159
to go along for the ride.

417
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,919
He's going to love this.

418
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,679
He's going to love this.

419
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,119
Here we go.

420
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,599
I'm Christy.

421
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,159
Hi, Christy. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

422
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,599
Er, where are we?

423
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,839
Sorry, there's no belt for you.

424
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,799
THUD
Oops! Oh, my God.

425
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,399
Yep, no belts,

426
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,879
lots of exposed metal.

427
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,959
ENGINE REVS
Kids,

428
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,440
do NOT try this at home.

429
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,240
PADDY SCREAMS

430
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,800
Whoa!

431
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,280
Ha-ha!

432
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,440
HE SCREAMS

433
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Oh, my God!

434
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,719
Nicely done.

435
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,679
SHE LAUGHS

436
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,359
Right.

437
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,360
I'm going to find a little spot
to...lie down and have a cry.

438
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,959
SHE LAUGHS
Is he OK?

439
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,679
Oh.

440
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,960
Wowsers.

441
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

442
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,760
Did you enjoy it?

443
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,319
So, Pad, how did you enjoy your
first experience

444
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,519
of the Zed drift scene?

445
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,239
Well, schoolboy error,

446
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,079
I had a Thai green curry
before I got in the car

447
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,119
and I just felt extremely queasy.

448
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
Everything was spinning, hot sweats.

449
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,879
But I wasn't on my own...
No, you weren't, Pads.

450
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,399
As the day went on, I was getting
rougher and rougher.

451
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,799
Did you have the curry, as well?

452
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,879
Oh, no, worse than that,
I got Covid.

453
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,919
Oh! Again. Again.
CROWD GROANS

454
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,199
I spent the rest of the trip holed
up in a hotel room,

455
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,399
sweating and shivering,
browsing the web.

456
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,799
I bet you did.

457
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,759
LAUGHING

458
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,879
Well, there's plenty more of
Thailand still to see,

459
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,959
and we'll get back to it later on in
the show.

460
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,639
But first, there's a shiny
new electric supercar on the scene,

461
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,599
and we told Chris Harris to pop
on his rubber wellies

462
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,000
and go check it out.

463
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,759
Here it is.

464
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,479
It's called the Nevera.

465
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,999
It's powered by electricity.

466
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,079
And it doesn't come from Italy,

467
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,559
or Germany,

468
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,799
or Britain,

469
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,359
or Japan,

470
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,439
or even America.

471
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,960
No, the Nevera comes...

472
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
..from Croatia.

473
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,399
Now, Croatia.

474
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,639
Lovely place, cracking
seafood scene,

475
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,479
but not one with any history
of building fast cars

476
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,239
or any history of building any cars.

477
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,079
But this Nevera could be the car
to put Croatia on the car map

478
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,199
because it's built by a company
called Rimac.

479
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,759
Rimac's barely a decade old,

480
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,959
but it's already worked its
electric wizardry

481
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,719
for the likes of Porsche,
Aston Martin,

482
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,599
Ferrari and Koenigsegg.

483
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,759
Last year, it took control
of Bugatti.

484
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,759
In short, Rimac means business.

485
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,639
And with the Nevera, it's very much
going it alone.

486
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,599
See, normally if you're a start up
carmaker,

487
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,439
you buy all your bits off the shelf.

488
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,119
You get your headlights from Ford,
steering wheel from Volvo,

489
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,799
engine from GM,

490
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,880
and then you wrap it all in some
fancy new bodywork.

491
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,840
But Rimac hasn't done that.

492
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,480
The Nevera is built completely
from scratch.

493
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,399
The only bits this car shares
with any other on the planet

494
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,160
are the tyres and a few bits
of the aircon.

495
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,479
Everything else - battery,
motors, software,

496
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,880
single piece carbon fibre
chassis - is bespoke.

497
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,199
As business plans go, that's like
opening your own pizzeria

498
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,319
and decided that instead of buying
in any ingredients,

499
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,679
you'll grow your own wheat,
your tomatoes,

500
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,639
your pineapple, your buffalo.

501
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,239
I mean, it's a ruinously stupid
idea, and it's why no-one does it.

502
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,400
But somehow Rimac has made it work.

503
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,080
And more remarkable still...

504
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,239
..they've actually made it
rather well.

505
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,679
It's comfy in here.

506
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,279
I mean, the seat's pretty good,

507
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,039
everything's covered in
expensive materials,

508
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,839
I can see out of the thing
perfectly well.

509
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,639
I mean, I wouldn't call it a
luxury motorcar,

510
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,639
but it's beautifully built.

511
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,039
And it's practical-ish.

512
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,279
I mean, it's fitted with the largest
battery of any electric vehicle,

513
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,959
so it'll do 300 miles on a
single charge.

514
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,559
As products from companies
you've never heard of go,

515
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,639
it's all very convincing.

516
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,839
How much they want you to pay
for it, on the other hand,

517
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,399
might take a little more convincing.

518
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,119
Because this upstart costs -

519
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,279
wait for it -

520
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,759
£2 million.

521
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,519
Now, that's not Ferrari money,

522
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,599
that's not even Lamborghini money,

523
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,359
that's Bugatti money.

524
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,359
It's private jet money.

525
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,680
That's... That's punchy.

526
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,279
Luckily, the Nevera does
have a little trick up its sleeve

527
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,239
that might go some way to justifying
its enormous price tag.

528
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,199
A little trick that requires
a rather long runway to demonstrate.

529
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,839
Now, I probably should have
mentioned this earlier,

530
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,399
but even by conventional supercar
standards, the Nevera is...

531
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,399
It's quite powerful.

532
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,479
You see, it's got one electric motor
for each wheel,

533
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,400
combined power output just under
2,000 horsepower.

534
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,760
That is a lot.

535
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,440
So, what does it feel like?

536
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,760
Oh, my Lord.

537
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,560
That's 100.

538
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,359
130.

539
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,319
150.

540
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,159
170.

541
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,359
This is ridiculous.

542
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,679
190.

543
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,319
That's 200. She's still pulling.

544
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,920
That's 211, 212.

545
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,920
Right, that is absolutely
mind scramblingly fast.

546
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,239
Good Lord!

547
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,039
That's not driving, that's an
out-of-body experience.

548
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,239
In fact, the Nevera accelerates
to 60mph in under 2 seconds.

549
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,159
And whereas electric cars up to
now have always run out of puff

550
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,839
the further north of 100 they go,

551
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,039
this car is limited to 219.

552
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,359
Now, what we need here is a bit
of context.

553
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,999
To my left, we have a
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ.

554
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,919
ENGINE REVS

555
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,399
By any standards,

556
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,040
a very, very fast car.

557
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,919
Watch what happens now.

558
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,040
LAMBORGHINI ENGINE REVS

559
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,719
Three, two, one, go!

560
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,000
Bye-bye.

561
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,800
Just disappearing.

562
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,279
I can't begin to describe...

563
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,600
He's not even there, he's gone.

564
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,040
I can barely see him in my mirror.

565
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,040
Over the line.

566
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,479
That spec in the mirror
that I can hardly see

567
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,440
is one of the fastest
Lamborghinis ever made.

568
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,800
It's not... It's not a beating,
it's a mauling.

569
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,599
Tell you what, the old guard better
get ready for it,

570
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,639
cos this is... This is all new
for me.

571
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,600
It's all new for everyone.

572
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,559
The remarkable thing about
the Nevera

573
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,719
isn't that it's the fastest
accelerating road car ever built,

574
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,960
it's the sheer scale of the leap
in performances made.

575
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,959
Round two.

576
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,599
Let's give the Aventador
a better chance this time.

577
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,119
It's 300 metres up the runway

578
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,200
and we're going to run
over a standing mile.

579
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,400
Watch this.

580
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,960
ENGINE REVS

581
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,279
Three, two, one, go!

582
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,679
Here we go.

583
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,079
It can't do it, can it?

584
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,000
How can it possibly catch
that Lamborghini?

585
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
We're catching it.

586
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,599
We're catching it.

587
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,839
I can't believe this.

588
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,000
It's absolutely absurd.

589
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,239
Oh, my Lord.

590
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,319
HE LAUGHS

591
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,439
That's outrageous!

592
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,800
I'm doing 218, 219mph.

593
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,480
Wow!

594
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,679
And it doesn't stop there.

595
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,559
In case all that straight
line fun wears off,

596
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,439
Rimac says they've been to town
on the handling, too.

597
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,519
Each wheel's motor is
independently controlled,

598
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,959
so the way the Nevera drives
can be transformed

599
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,680
at the flick of a switch.

600
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,480
A switch that includes...

601
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,200
..drift mode.

602
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,840
TYRES SCREECH

603
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,479
Dear me!

604
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,080
Mate! This is a drift beast
like I've never been in before.

605
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,080
TYRES SCREECH

606
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,639
It's so easy.

607
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,919
It's just wind the lock on,

608
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,200
bit of throttle.

609
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,759
Whoa-ho-ho!

610
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,319
Oh, they're clever.

611
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,119
They're clever. And it's fun.

612
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,840
It's fun and it's silly.

613
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,879
This car slides.

614
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,479
It feels fantastic
when it's moving around.

615
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,999
I know it doesn't have the noise,

616
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,679
but when you've got
this performance,

617
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm starting to wonder if you care.

618
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,719
Of course, we have seen this sort
of digital drifting before.

619
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,759
In recent years, it's become pretty
much the standard party mode

620
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,720
for performance cars
all over the market.

621
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,839
But this being Rimac,

622
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,280
in the Nevera there's also an
afterparty.

623
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,279
Four-wheel drive,

624
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,559
no traction control,

625
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,719
all wheels spinning.

626
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,880
Here we go.

627
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,920
TYRES SCREECH

628
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,080
Good God.

629
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,440
What is going on in this car?

630
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,120
We just did a tyre in one skid.

631
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,999
That's just ridiculous.

632
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,559
Mr Rimac, you are my kind
of lunatic.

633
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,160
Yes, you are!

634
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,080
I don't quite know what to say
about that.

635
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,760
Wow.

636
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

637
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,039
Mind blown.

638
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,039
Mind blown. That is
absolutely bonkers.

639
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,359
It went past that Lambo
like it was standing still.

640
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,679
It's extraordinary. It's not like
anything I've ever driven before.

641
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,119
It's that fast.

642
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,879
The day after I drove it,
I actually felt a bit queasy.

643
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,199
I don't know whether that's the high
voltage cables

644
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,039
or whether my kidneys are bruised.

645
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,399
I mean, it's crazy. So you're saying
your innards have been Rimac'd?

646
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,959
Not a nice sounding phrase,
but that's correct.

647
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,239
THEY LAUGH

648
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,639
And these lads are now in
charge of Bugatti?

649
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,319
Yeah, they are. It's very businessy.

650
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,319
They were bought by Porsche, who've
now put them in charge of Bugatti.

651
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,839
I mean, the whole world's been
changed upside down

652
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,919
in a matter of years.

653
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,839
So is that it, electric's won?

654
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,399
Should all petrol supercars
just give up now?

655
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,559
It's not as simple as that.

656
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,799
They need to give up on
the acceleration and speed race

657
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,239
because these things are so fast,
there's no catching up.

658
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,159
Petrol needs to trade
on emotion now.

659
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,399
Gear changes, sound, go lightweight,

660
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,559
but don't try and out-accelerate
this monster cos you will lose.

661
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,079
Well, with that in mind,

662
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,519
when are we going to get
it on the track?

663
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,359
Slight problem. It's so fast,
we've got to update the software

664
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,679
on The Stig because he can't deal
with it just yet,

665
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,519
but hopefully next year.

666
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,519
OK, watch this space.

667
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,919
But now it's time to get back
to Thailand,

668
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,879
where Fred was properly in a bad
way - coughing, shivering, the lot.

669
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,919
So Chris and I did what any true
mates would do.

670
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,679
Left him to it
and enjoyed the rest of our trip!

671
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,119
CROWD CHEERS

672
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
LAUGHING

673
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,719
With Flintoff left behind
in Bangkok,

674
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,960
me and Harris had pointed
our pick-ups north.

675
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,199
Our mission now was to haul a
much-needed cargo

676
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,519
to a remote hill village
near the border with Laos.

677
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,239
Nice to have been given
something useful to do.

678
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,879
Plus, hauling for free meant
we'd had to start doing things

679
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
the local way.

680
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,759
I've got to be honest, I'm happy
with the extra weight in the back.

681
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,439
It just gives the car a bit
more stability.

682
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,039
And whereas when we first saw
something overloaded coming past us,

683
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,559
we sort of whooped with joy,
they're probably going,

684
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,559
"Amateur. We could get another
bale on that."

685
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,919
I know, it's bonkers, isn't it?

686
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,040
It was bonkers, particularly
given two important points.

687
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,839
I've got one thing on my mind,
though, Pad -

688
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,280
I've never seen so much fresh grass,
so why are we carrying grass?

689
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,359
I've seen quite a few cows
knocking about,

690
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,679
maybe we're taking them
a bit to feed.

691
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,640
Do cows eat hay or is that horses?

692
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,600
They do eat hay, yes.

693
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,959
I reckon we're going feeding
a load of cows.

694
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,399
Whatever the bales
were actually for, though,

695
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,879
as the miles ticked up,
the second, more pressing issue

696
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,679
was that the scenery was
getting bigger.

697
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,319
You look to your left,

698
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,999
you've just got
a tree-and-foliage-covered mountain

699
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,599
with a vast amount
of weather coming off it.

700
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,519
Look at the moisture coming off
these hills.

701
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,759
Can you say "look at the moisture
coming off these hills" again

702
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,240
but a little bit slower?

703
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,680
This is ominous.
We're climbing up a hill.

704
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,600
Yeah, it's starting to get
tarmac-y now.

705
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,119
I've got a funny feeling
this is more D-Max country.

706
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,999
Oh, this is what the D-Max loves.

707
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,120
Ooh-oh.

708
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,599
Oh, this looks like it's too much
for me.

709
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,760
Come on, then, little fella.

710
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,959
CAR CLATTERS

711
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,439
It's sounding good, this.

712
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,879
Oh, my Lord.

713
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,280
Oh, God.

714
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,479
The D-Max absolutely loves
this terrain.

715
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,879
Power, power, power.

716
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,640
Power, power, power!

717
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,680
Come on, old girl.

718
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,199
Come on, old girl.

719
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,119
This is where the two-wheel drive
has been found out, Chris.

720
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,120
She's struggling now.
This is like live Jenga.

721
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Oh, your load's looking
a little bit wobbly, there, Chris.

722
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,199
Stop! You've lost a bale.

723
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,399
You've lost a bale, son.

724
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,799
Come back.

725
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,879
I can't lose a bale.

726
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,119
Keep coming. How far back
can I come?

727
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,640
Keep coming. That'll do you.

728
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,039
Shall we just lob it up?

729
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,800
You ready? One, two, three.

730
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,520
Well, it sort of worked.

731
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,919
Back on the move, though, our
oversized and badly lashed cargo

732
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,120
was quickly becoming the least
of Harris's concerns.

733
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,959
I've got an issue -
my air con's gone

734
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,599
and also I've lost the front window,

735
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,720
so I'm just sitting, literally,
in an oven now.

736
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,840
Sitrep on the D-Max.

737
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,880
Everything's fine.

738
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,680
Aircon's blowing a bit extreme,
though. Bit chilly in here.

739
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,880
3 Series with a black vinyl interior
in this heat is a hot place to be.

740
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,119
I can't deal with this.

741
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,600
This heat is just absurd.

742
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,039
And so my slow coupe colleague set
about redesigning the ventilation

743
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,200
on his Beemer.

744
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,960
What are you doing?

745
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,480
I've broken the door
but not the window.

746
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,239
What are you doing?

747
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,479
Just trying to deal with my
ventilation issues at the moment.

748
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,999
I'm just going to have a minute
to contemplate it

749
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,159
if you don't mind, Pad.

750
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,879
So, the place to contemplate it
is on a steep gradient

751
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,280
on a gravel track?

752
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,279
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

753
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,919
I've got to get rid of that glass.
I can't breathe.

754
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,120
What?

755
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,639
Great work.

756
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,600
Ha-ha, ha!

757
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,719
I feel like this is a job
for a man from Bolton.

758
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,640
Watch yourself, son.

759
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Thank you, Pad. There you go.

760
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,279
Lovely.

761
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,079
Would you like me to give you
a little nudge?

762
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,040
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

763
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,079
ENGINE REVS

764
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,560
Oh.

765
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,120
There she goes. There she goes.

766
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,999
Go on. Go on, the D-Max!

767
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,759
That low range is
doing the business!

768
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,840
Right up your chuff.

769
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,679
One of the biggest problems
with the D-Max, Chris,

770
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,719
when you're driving it
is your fingers get cold.

771
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,480
It's so... It's like driving
a fridge, this thing.

772
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,959
This isn't aimed at you,
dear viewer,

773
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,400
this is aimed at Paddy McGuinness.

774
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,919
Rude.

775
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,519
After all, the D-Max had got us both
up to the top of the hill

776
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,999
and our destination was now
just around the corner.

777
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,759
Where are we going now?
Oh, look at this.

778
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,599
Look at this!

779
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,320
This has got to be the place.
That's a surprise, isn't it?

780
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,399
Look at this, McGuinness,
a beautiful little village.

781
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,079
Hang on.

782
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,120
You're taking the bunting.

783
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,199
Chris.

784
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,279
You've got a man on the side
of your car, Chris.

785
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,679
Chris, you've got a man
on the side of your car. Have I?

786
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,519
LAUGHING: He just drove off.
He's on the side of your car.

787
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,920
Is he still holding on to it?
I can't see anything.

788
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,839
Slightly embarrassing arrival
notwithstanding,

789
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,879
we had two flatbeds full of bales,

790
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,119
which, as the villagers set
about unloading...

791
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,199
Hello.

792
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,080
..we would soon discover were
definitely not for feeding the cows.

793
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,720
Now...

794
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,239
..it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to
work out - there's the hay bales...

795
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,399
Yeah.

796
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,279
..that looks like a finish line.

797
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,600
So it's a racetrack.

798
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,399
Yep.

799
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,000
And what they race around here
are these.

800
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,079
Known as Formula Hmong,

801
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,319
this traditional Thai downhill event
is about as grassroots

802
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,840
as motorsport gets.

803
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,719
The braking is rudimentary,

804
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,919
the steering is done by foot,

805
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,719
the only fuel is gravity,

806
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,320
and the machines themselves are,
let's say, sustainably sourced.

807
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,279
And as a thank you
for safely delivering

808
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,439
their plant-based barriers,

809
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,439
they were kind enough
to let us have a go.

810
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,439
You know what?
I love his safety gear.

811
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,279
White pumps, trackie pants.
He's got some elbow protection on.

812
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,199
That lad there's got a spoiler
so he can alter his downforce.

813
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,759
And he's got a pair of wellies on.
He's got welly boots on.

814
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,719
Gentlemen, start your...legs.

815
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,760
OK...

816
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,960
Oh, no, they're gone. They're gone.

817
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,679
Not a lot of suspension, is there?
We'd be off there.

818
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,600
Yeah, we're not going as fast
as that.

819
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,280
Oh, he's off!

820
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,199
APPLAUSE

821
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,879
Dear me.

822
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,119
Dear me!

823
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,800
And then it was our turn.

824
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,559
You're welcome to this win,
by the way, McGuinness. Er...

825
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,280
The feeling is reciprocated.

826
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,120
Formula Hmong.

827
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,119
Good luck, brother. Good luck.

828
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,959
Come on, then, you horrible
wooden bastard.

829
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,720
PADDY LAUGHS

830
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,080
Ready? Yeah. OK.

831
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,959
I've got him! I've got him
straight away!

832
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,959
That's a jump start for Guinness.

833
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,399
Oh, where's the bloody brakes?

834
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,999
He's getting away from me.
How's he so quick?

835
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,320
I can't steer it.

836
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,160
Whoa! My word!

837
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,119
Whoa!

838
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,560
Oh, my God.

839
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm catching him.
I'm definitely catching him.

840
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,799
Where's Harris? Is
he on my shoulder? Where is he?

841
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,359
I can't see him.

842
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,800
I've got absolutely no control
over this thing.

843
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,400
Oh, no.

844
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,479
Oh, whoa.

845
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,439
APPLAUSE

846
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,920
Where is he?

847
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,960
Oh...

848
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,200
That was a shunt.

849
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,200
Oh... You all right?

850
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,839
My hand really hurts.

851
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,679
That's going to smart
in the morning, that is.

852
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,479
So, with Harris's career in
Formula Hmong ending as quickly

853
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,359
as it started, it turned out
the winner would now have the honour

854
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,319
of running the course again.

855
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,040
This time,
against one of the local pros.

856
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,079
Nice to meet you.
I saw you oiling your wheels up.

857
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,439
I'm not that big of a threat.

858
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,560
You don't need that. Trust me.

859
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,199
Here we go.

860
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,519
Ooh-hoo.

861
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,199
OFFICIAL READIES THEM

862
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,479
OK? OK.

863
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,919
OFFICIAL COUNTS THEM DOWN

864
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,600
We're off!

865
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,079
I'm taking him!

866
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,599
I've taken him! I've got it!

867
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,080
I've got it!

868
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,479
Oh, no, no, no. He's here.
He's here.

869
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,360
Aah! He's gone past me!

870
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,480
He is flying. I can't catch him!

871
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,600
Come on, Pad.

872
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,680
Come on. Come on, McGuinness.
Come on!

873
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,959
I can hear something.

874
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,359
I can see the line.
I can see a line.

875
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,079
I'm going for it!
I'm going for it!

876
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,359
I can hear him now.
I can hear him now.

877
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,759
I'm going for it!
Nearly there!

878
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,480
I've got him! I've got him!
Oh, no!

879
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,200
Jesus!

880
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,199
Mate, are you all right?

881
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,639
Oh, my God!

882
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,679
What are you doing?!
I nearly had him.

883
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,919
Come on!
I nearly had him.

884
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,599
Get over the line.

885
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

886
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,280
Fantastic.

887
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,919
Chalking up Formula Hmong, then, as
one of our more painful

888
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,279
motorsport failures...

889
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,279
Aah! Oh, sorry.
PADDY LAUGHS

890
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,439
..we left the winner with
a parting gift of

891
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,079
lightly soiled body armour...

892
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,199
Thank you. Thank you.

893
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,639
CHEERING

894
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,040
..and then it was time to return
to our pick-ups.

895
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,919
Because, having now proven their
Thai readiness to the local village,

896
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,199
while we've been busy getting
battered and bruised,

897
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,000
they'd been tasked with
one last job.

898
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,999
That job would take us to the next
hilltop where a new temple

899
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,680
was under construction.

900
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,680
Its exterior is covered in thousands
upon thousands of tiles.

901
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:30,840
And so, to help complete it,
that was the cargo we'd bring.

902
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:39,040
Loaded up with a muddy road ahead,
setting out to be useful once more.

903
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,559
The pick-up.

904
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,399
I know we've tried to joke around
them, but these things are the

905
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,079
workforce of humanity, aren't they?

906
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,919
There's something
about an honest pick-up.

907
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,039
When you see one on the road,
you know, ultimately, it's helping

908
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,039
someone somewhere,
or giving someone something.

909
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,999
It just makes you feel good
about yourself.

910
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,279
And I'm telling you now, I know
we're in the jungles of Thailand,

911
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,320
but no matter where I'd be dropped
in the world, I'd pick the D-Max.

912
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,799
It has served you well.

913
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,880
And it's actually served me
pretty well as well.

914
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,160
By the word, I can see the temple
'pon the hill.

915
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,399
Come on. We're nearly there.

916
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,719
So are we awarding that victory
to the D-Max,

917
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,759
given that I turned up in a saloon
car and hacked the back off it

918
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,719
and Flintoff is still in isolation?

919
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,240
I think so.

920
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,520
My word.

921
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,919
Wow!

922
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,280
This is mega, Chris.

923
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,720
I'm going to have a soppy moment
and say this is quite special.

924
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,360
Wow.

925
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,160
That is something else.

926
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,439
Look at that.
They climb up there and tile that?

927
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,959
It's amazing.

928
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Cor. So each of those goes...
On that roof.

929
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,159
Right, which is your hood hand?
Left.

930
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,239
You got it? Yeah.
You sure? Yeah, let's go.

931
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,960
Right, up we go.

932
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,520
Wow!

933
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,079
What a place.

934
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,360
Amazing.

935
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,119
These are stunning.

936
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,160
Wow.

937
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,159
That is a big, big statue.

938
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,840
Look at the size of that guy there.
I know.

939
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,720
Look at the size of him!

940
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,959
You can't take it all in.
You look up - it's so much.

941
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,200
It is massive.

942
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,279
He's waiting. It looks like
he's waiting for us.

943
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,919
Pop them down there.

944
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,440
Pop them down.

945
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,120
Sawadee kraap.

946
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,279
Apparently we need
another 600,000 of them.

947
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,319
600,000? 600,000.

948
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,639
Where's Flintoff when you need him?

949
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,599
Flintoff!

950
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,360
Back down to the pick-up.

951
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,479
Thank you, Thailand.

952
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,920
Tile-land.

953
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,160
Kicking myself for not
coming up with that one.

954
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,919
How's your body. Broken.

955
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,960
Good. Good, good, good.

956
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,360
STUDIO AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS

957
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,679
Beautiful. Beautiful country.

958
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,199
Beautiful. Amazing.
Amazing. Amazing.

959
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,559
What a place that temple
was and what a pleasure to help out.

960
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,399
And Fred, I'm gutted
you weren't there, pal,

961
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,999
because he'd have been handy
carrying them tiles up them steps,

962
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,759
wouldn't he?
Oh, cheers, thanks. Yeah.

963
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,279
Thanks, Pad, but I am upset, too.

964
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,759
Firstly because my Hilux would have
smashed your two up the hill. Oh.

965
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,879
Oh, come on, the Hilux.
Yeah?

966
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,319
And secondly, Formula Hmong.
Oof.

967
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,079
That's my type of motorsport.

968
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,959
Just falling. Yeah!

969
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,319
Gravity is your specialist subject,
to be fair.

970
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,479
Exactly, I'd have wiped the floor
with you two. Yeah.

971
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,559
We did a pretty good job of that
ourselves, actually, Fred. Yeah,
we certainly did. We certainly did.

972
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,399
Great trip, though,
and an amazing country.

973
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,359
Thailand, thanks for having us.

974
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,479
Well, that's it for tonight,
but we're back next week as we head

975
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,079
to Paris in some tiny cars,

976
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,959
and Germany in some
very fast supercars.

977
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,160
See you then. Thanks for watching.
Goodnight.
