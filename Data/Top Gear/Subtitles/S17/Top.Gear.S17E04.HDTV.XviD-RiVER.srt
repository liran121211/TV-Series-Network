1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,159
'Tonight, I use a machine.'
Agh!

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,199
James writes on a blackboard...

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,400
And Richard lobs fruit
into a caravan.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,799
APPLAUSE
Thank you, everybody.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,319
Thank you, thank you so much.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
Good evening, hello. Thank you,
everybody. Thank you so much.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,439
Now, in the not very olden days,
Jaguar had a worldwide
reputation for...

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,559
I was going to say quality - not
quality, but quietness, comfort,

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,159
restrained good looks and value.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,039
Now, though,
they've introduced a new car which
seems to be only about one thing.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,439
Speed.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,199
120. 130.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,280
140.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,839
Into fifth.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,559
150.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,799
160.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,880
170. In a Jag! Come on!

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,079
Apparently with a long
enough runway, it'll hit 186.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,280
Woah!
This isn't long enough. Help, help!

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,639
So, welcome to the new XKR-S,

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,599
the most powerful road car
Jaguar has ever made.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,919
The supercharged V8 has been
re-calibrated and the exhausts
beefed-up

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,279
so that it now fires
542 horsepower at the rear wheels.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,440
That's on the edge
of Ferrari territory.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,559
As a result, it feels and sounds

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,760
as though it's being fuelled by a
blend of plutonium and wild animals.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
It's very fast.

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,880
And very, very loud.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,479
And then in the corners,

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
it'll get its tail out more readily
than George Michael.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
There you go. Hit the throttle...

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,439
A lot of smoke. Ha-ha!

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,079
It's mad! A mad car.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,840
It's like Terry Thomas
with a sub-machine gun.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,479
To make sure deaf people don't
mistake the S for an ordinary XKR,

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,959
the body has bigger sills,
a bigger rear spoiler,

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,960
and snowshoes on the bonnet.

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,479
It's also got this new
downturned nose which makes

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,759
it look rather disapproving,
like a 1950s seaside landlady.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,519
And I'm sorry but
red brake callipers on a Jag...

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,199
it's like fitting Camilla Parker
Bowles with a vajazzle and rings.

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm saying this out loud, aren't I?

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,279
Inside, we find leather designed
to look like carbon fibre,

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,519
and blue ambient lighting.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,439
The walnut from Jags
of yesteryear, gone.

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,439
The gentleman's club has been
turned into Grant Bovey's gym.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,359
There are other issues, too.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,679
The ride is a bit harsh.

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,959
Run over a pheasant, and
you'd be able to tell if
it was a cock or a hen.

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,479
Then there's the price,
it's not what you call cheap.

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,559
In fact it's what
you'd call £97,000,

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,600
and that's what you'd call
nearly 100 grand.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,479
So, Jag has sacrificed subtlety,
good looks, comfort, silence

54
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,600
and value - all its core values -
in the pursuit of speed.

55
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,839
But if all you're interested
in is speed, I wonder,

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
would you be
better off with the Nissan GTR?

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,879
This is the new model.

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,120
More powerful, more aerodynamic
and unbelievably even more grippy.

59
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,599
We're told it's a masterclass in
what's technically possible
right now.

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,639
Built in a hermetically sealed
factory, it's the last word

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
in precision engineering.

62
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,679
Every single piece -
the brakes, all four wheels,

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
the 3.8 litre twin-turbo engine,

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,839
the steering, the new
double clutch gearbox,

65
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,679
they're all electronically linked
to sing the song of speed

66
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,640
in perfect harmony.

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,919
Let me give you just one example.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,159
The tyres on this car are filled
with nitrogen

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,399
because ordinary air
is considered to be too unstable.

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,599
It expands and it contracts
too much.

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,079
And I know what they mean,
air drives me mad.

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,080
It's too big, it's too little.
Rrrrr! Air!

73
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,840
But can this OCD special really
be faster than the bonkers Jag?

74
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,679
The Jag has 20 more horsepowers and
50 more torques,

75
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,599
and I know this is lighter
and it has launch control,

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,239
which is what I'm engaging now,
but on paper this can't win.

77
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Three, two, one! Oh, my God!

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,320
That was 0-60 in three seconds.

79
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,640
The Jag is just a speck.

80
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,399
It's funny, the Jag is surprisingly
fast because it's a Jag.

81
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,480
This is surprisingly fast
because it's surprisingly fast.

82
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,719
That was not a win,
that was a demolition.

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't think I've ever been
in a car that has launched itself
quite like that.

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,519
And don't think the Jag can get
away on the corners either.

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
Here it is now coming through the
follow-through as fast as it can.

86
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,079
That's 84.8mph.

87
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,919
And here is the Nissan...

88
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,199
same corner, same conditions,
same driver.

89
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,959
That's 93.3mph.

90
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,319
So it's 8.5mph faster and that
explains why at the Nurburgring,

91
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,599
where there are 147 corners, the
Jag takes nine minutes to do a lap

92
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,639
while the Nissan can get round
in seven minutes and 24 seconds.

93
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,119
That's faster than almost
anything else with a tax disc.

94
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,920
This is an incredible car. The
new gearbox is spectacularly good.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,239
The engine... Well, it's not
an engine, it's just a bomb.

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,079
The turbo is crisp and fantastic,

97
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,239
and if you have the chassis and the
gearbox and the traction control set
in race mode, which they are now,

98
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,399
the grip...

99
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,959
is just mind-boggling.

100
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,040
As I shall now demonstrate
graphically with my face.

101
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
Bloody hell!

102
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,959
All I've got
is the PlayStation G reading

103
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,640
telling me how much damage this car
is doing to my internal organs.

104
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,240
Just driving a Nissan.

105
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,479
And yet, despite
everything, this car produces
fewer carbon dioxides than the Jag.

106
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,279
It has seats in the back you can
actually use, a bigger boot,

107
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,039
and at £69,000,
it's nearly £30,000 cheaper.

108
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,959
So the conclusion is easy.

109
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,879
Why buy a brogue that has been
converted into a training shoe,

110
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,239
when for much less you can have
something that was designed

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,000
to be a training shoe
in the first place?

112
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,320
Astonishing.

113
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,319
Outstanding. What the GTR is, it's
an instrument of speed. An
instrument. I like it.

114
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,999
What about the Jag, not so good?

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,039
I don't understand what Jaguar were
thinking of because they must have
looked at Aston Martin and thought,

116
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,479
"right, they make nothing but a
range of hardcore front-engined GT
cars so we'll do exactly the same."

117
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,359
But you know what the problem is,
don't you?

118
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,679
Jaguar now have a permanent
testing facility at the Nurburgring.

119
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,159
Where they should have
a permanent testing facility

120
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,639
is between the two mini roundabouts
in Chipping Norton where I live
because that's the bumpiest stretch

121
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,639
of road in the known universe and
it's been dug up again by that...

122
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
what's that construction company
called that you can't pronounce?

123
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,000
Chlamydia, no, not chlamydia.

124
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,239
Clancy... Whatever it's called.
I know the one you mean.

125
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,639
It would just be intolerable in a
car like that. So hang on, let me
get this straight, you're saying

126
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,599
Jaguar should tailor their cars
to the Chipping Norton set. Yes.

127
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,119
What's the point of that? Aren't they
all going to be in prison next week?
LAUGHTER

128
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,119
Thank you, nice to know my friends
can count on you for your support.

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,839
Now, though, it's time to find out
how fast the Nissan goes round our
track and that means handing it

130
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,599
over to our tame racing driver.

131
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,919
Some say

132
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,440
that he once hacked
into his own helmet,

133
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:06,039
and that he thinks Harper Seven
is a convicted terrorist cell.

134
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,000
All we know is he's called the Stig.

135
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,839
And he's off. A tiny chirp from
the back tyres, then a crisp smooth

136
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,919
slingshot up to the first corner
like a precise Japanese missile.

137
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,159
Turns in.

138
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,840
Predictably tidy all the way through
and still tidy on the way out.

139
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,879
Stig enjoying Rock the Casbah
in Algerian there.

140
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,079
Wow!
Right, another laser-guided line

141
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:43,119
through Chicago, hammerhead, the
one place where the Nissan's four
wheel drive might bring understeer.

142
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,919
Not a chance.

143
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,599
Tiny drift towards
the exit, then through.

144
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Cleaner than James's tool bench.

145
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,119
Just kisses 7,000rpm and up a gear.

146
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,919
Fires it into the follow through.

147
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,559
Ballistic, through the tyres.
Two corners left.

148
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,559
Here we go, getting a bit
squirrelly and wiggly in there.

149
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Back under control now
for Gambon, and drifts it
through, and across the line.

150
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,240
OK, now, earlier on...

151
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,199
Thank you, earlier on in the day,

152
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,519
we went around in the jag
and we recorded a time of 1.23.3,

153
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,799
so that goes there, and that's not
bad, it's faster than the DBS

154
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,559
and faster than any other Aston.

155
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,519
However, in the GTR,
he did it in not 1.23.3, OK?

156
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,119
Little bit higher than that.

157
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,359
Little bit harder than an R8V10.

158
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,919
Or a 599.

159
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,399
Or a 599GTO.

160
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,159
Past the old GTR.

161
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,639
Still higher, past the Enzo.

162
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,999
Higher, higher, higher!

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,879
There!

164
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,800
Unbelievable! 1.17.8.

165
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,759
So, that's
as fast as he's gone there,

166
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,479
which cost four times as much.

167
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,759
Yes. And it's faster than a
GTO Ferrari, by a big margin,

168
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,919
which is four times as much.
Anyway, we must now do the news.

169
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,079
Before we get into the news properly,
can I just say that, sticking with
the Nissan,

170
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,999
it's very difficult to
get a four-wheel-drive turbocharged
car like that off the line quickly,

171
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,919
except that the Nissan has
a thing called launch control, which

172
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,919
is basically just a computer that
sorts everything out for you, so that
you get a perfect start every time.

173
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,839
Yes, there's just one problem
with the launch control.

174
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,479
It is the stupidest thing
ever fitted to a car. Why?

175
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,599
No, seriously, when you think about
it, what you have to do to engage
it, right, a series of switches.

176
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,999
You put your left foot on the brake,
plant your right foot hard
down on the accelerator, and

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,320
when the lights go green you take
your foot of the brake and it goes.

178
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,879
The computer sorts
it out, as you say.

179
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,719
So, OK,
you're at the lights, MEHHHH!

180
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,119
And everyone's looking at you
thinking, what an unintelligent man.

181
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,399
It makes a bit of a scene. It does,
really. The most uncivilised thing
you can do with a car

182
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,920
is use launch control
at a zebra crossing.

183
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,639
Hnnnggghh! Come on, old lady!
It would hurry 'em up!

184
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,799
Can we just say one other thing
as well, about launch control?

185
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,639
Only one of us
has it fitted to our car.

186
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,000
Is it, it's him!

187
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,559
James May has launch control.

188
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,719
Yeah, I don't use it. You don't say!

189
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,119
Are you sure? Every time you're
in the pie shop, "Thanks for
the pies, I'm off! Hnnnggh!

190
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,239
Can anybody think of a device

191
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,079
fitted to modern cars that's
more stupid than launch control?

192
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,279
You're fitted to quite a lot now.

193
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,439
Has anybody got any ideas?

194
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,599
What, like a gizmo? What?
Cup holders!

195
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,799
They're useful, you stupid idiot!

196
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,559
Cup holders are brilliant things,
for if you need a drink -
it won't fall, no, but,

197
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,239
actually, I have a really good one.

198
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,479
Mercedes and BMW now fit
a night-vision camera,

199
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,319
so you can drive along at night,
and the dashboard's got this screen,

200
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,679
showing you what's on the road ahead
so I was driving up a country lane
the other day, single track, OK?

201
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,679
Doing about 60 miles
an hour, which is legal,

202
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,119
middle of the night, and I thought,
God, I'm going to try and drive,
just using the night-vision camera.

203
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,279
Why am I not surprised?

204
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,199
Turned the lights off, looked down
to see where I was going, and there

205
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,320
was a message saying "night vision
not available when lights off"!

206
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,679
Aaargh! That's night vision
that only works...

207
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,559
With the lights on.
Be good for snipers, wouldn't it?

208
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,119
I'll just... bink... put the
lights on, now I can line up.

209
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,279
Now, last week,
James brought you news of a new
Range Rover called the Evoke.

210
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,319
This week, there's more new Range
Rover news, there's a new Sport.

211
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,599
Now, what's interesting about
this is, it has voice control

212
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,560
with what Land-Rover call
a "say what you see" function.

213
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,519
Now, in order to get the car to do
things, it brings up words on the
screen, and then you repeat them.

214
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,039
What's the point of that?
Does it have a picture of
the object next to it?

215
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,519
Apple! Apple!
If it was that, you could have
enormous fun with foreign markets.

216
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,159
In Germany you could bring
up a picture of a squirrel.

217
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,599
Because, if you think about it, all
Germans, no matter how well they
speak English, can't say "squirrel".

218
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,960
"What's this?
That would be a Skvirrol!!"

219
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,559
Any Glaswegians here?

220
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
Come here. Where are you?

221
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,959
I want to just test it.

222
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,678
Are you actually from Glasgow? Yes.

223
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,600
Right, can you say "burglar alarm"?
"Burr-glur alar-rm."

224
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,960
No! Burr-glurr alarrrm!

225
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Burrr-glurr!

226
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,959
Och, it's the burrr-glurrr
alarrrm gone off again!

227
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,320
Anyway, there you go,
couple of other things about it.

228
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,959
It's got an 825 watt stereo.

229
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,559
That's more than Motorhead.

230
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,839
A lot more. 17 speakers.

231
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,080
And I'm sorry, but that front end
is hideous. I don't know why they

232
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:13,639
don't just have done with that
car, and call it the Wilmslow.

233
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,239
The day is coming when they fit
that with fake pillars on either
side of the door, I'm warning you.

234
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,999
Now, there is a new version
of the Fiat Punto Abarth out - OK,

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,639
it's called the SS.

236
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,239
Here it is. Looks fantastic.
And I have to say, Hammond,

237
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,679
this is the car you should
have taken on our hot hatchback
test to Monte Carlo, recently. Why?

238
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Because it is actually a hot
hatchback.

239
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,839
Anyway, it's a normal Punto Abarth,
which you buy for £17,000,

240
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,559
and then you buy the SS kit,

241
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,039
so different suspension components
and a different ECU for the engine,
taking it up to 180 horsepower, OK?

242
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Now, they arrive in a box.
They make a big deal of this.

243
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:59,159
They say all the parts arrive
in a high-quality wooden crate.

244
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,119
There it is. Which, apparently,
you can keep as a memento.

245
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,519
I'm sorry, but when I buy a new
washing machine, I don't go, I'm
going to keep the box it came in

246
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,479
as a souvenir of the day
when my washing machine arrived.

247
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,919
I always struggle
throwing boxes away. Why?

248
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,879
If you take the washing machine out
of it, and fit it in your kitchen,

249
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,519
and there's the box, all crisp and
new and empty and I can't help
but look at it,

250
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,239
and part of my mind
sees the potential.

251
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,479
You look at it and you think,
wow, that could be, like, a castle -
you've been there!

252
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,839
Or a den, or a car. With shoeboxes,
I don't think I've ever thrown
one away, because you think,

253
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,399
I could keep special things in it,
or put it on that side and you
could have, like, a TV screen,

254
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,919
or maybe you could use the big box
as a spaceship and then the little
one as a dashboard. Come on!

255
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,519
Richard? Are you all right?

256
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,359
Seriously, because this is a man,

257
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,039
there's no other way of putting
this, with a helicopter licence.

258
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,639
The CAA said I was...

259
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,279
The CAA, if they're watching this,
will think, "He's a madman!"

260
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
It's not a real helicopter - it's
just the box his fridge came in.

261
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,279
I just make the noise!

262
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,119
THEY IMITATE
HELICOPTER ROTORS

263
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,119
You don't live in a house, you just
live in boxes that things came in.

264
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,799
Now, last week,
these two morons spent good money on
two second-hand V12 coupes.

265
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,879
They spent the same money you would
spend on the Nissan Pixo, the
cheapest new car on sale in Britain.

266
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,519
And I was prepared to bet all my hair
that, within two weeks, one of them
would have gone "pop".

267
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
So, chaps, what's the news?

268
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,359
My BMW, 100% not a problem.

269
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,719
Still working perfectly.

270
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,239
There you go, excellent. Moving on...
No, your Mercedes is here.

271
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,479
My Mercedes, yes,
I bought a Mercedes 600CL.

272
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,840
Yes, you did. It's quite interesting,
this, because I have a photograph

273
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:58,279
here that I'd like to share with
everyone, of the Top Gear car park.

274
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,959
There, in fact, is Hammond's BMW,
and where's your Mercedes?

275
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,639
Warm and dry. Now, moving on...

276
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,359
Tell the ladies and gentlemen
why it isn't in that space.

277
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,079
Can't remember. Tell them.

278
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,799
Tell them! One of its ignition
coils has gone a bit wonky.

279
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,480
It's interesting that you should say
that because I did some research, and

280
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:28,959
I found out that the ignition coil
for the Nissan Pixo is £138.

281
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,919
How much is it for the Mercedes?

282
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,719
800 and something.

283
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,799
£878.

284
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,159
Sorry, did that include fitting?

285
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,759
No. No.

286
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,479
Did it include the VAT?

287
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,999
No. No.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,479
So, what, in fact, was the cost of a
new ignition coil for your Mercedes?

289
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,279
HE MUMBLES: £1,200.

290
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,999
£1,200, ladies and gentlemen!

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,119
Thank you. I keep my hair.

292
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,879
That's annoying.

293
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,199
Now, recent figures have shown
that 71% of people across the UK

294
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:11,399
still commute by car, and more
people go to work by walking or by
bicycle than they do, by train.

295
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,199
Yeah, and the reason for that
is very simple. Train tickets
are enormously expensive.

296
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,639
And they're enormously
expensive because trains are
enormously expensive to build.

297
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,799
But why are trains
expensive to build?

298
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,239
Why has
Britain's last train maker recently
laid off half its workforce?

299
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,639
Surely there is a solution to this
problem. I mean, how hard can it be?

300
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,559
This is a Jaguar XJS.

301
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,719
It's 22 years old
and it cost £4,500.

302
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:47,480
For that, we got the convertible
version with the big engine,
the 300 horsepower 5.3 litre V12.

303
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,199
It really does go like a train,
this car, and that is what
got us thinking,

304
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,480
because... could
it actually be a train?

305
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,159
To find out, I took it to Top Gear's
Secret Railway Development Centre

306
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,439
in Leicestershire, just off the A46
near Thurcaston,

307
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,920
where we cued the music
and set to work.

308
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,240
MUSIC: Theme from The A-Team

309
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,520
Perfect!

310
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Argh!

311
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,200
Finally, our XJ Express was ready.

312
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,399
So, what we've done
is replace the standard wheels

313
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,839
with train wheels, and that's it.

314
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,399
Nothing else. The cost savings are
phenomenal, because a normal
railway locomotive is 4 million.

315
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,119
This was in total £4,750.
That is an enormous saving!

316
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,719
It's not much more than
one thousandth of the cost.

317
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,159
Exactly. If we were running
this from Peterborough to London...

318
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,640
I don't know what a season
ticket is. Do you know?

319
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,799
Many thousands of pounds a year.

320
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,599
This would be 20p or 30p.

321
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,080
It was time for the
Jaguar's inaugural run.

322
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,120
I don't think we need to turn that.
We could have taken this off.

323
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,480
Ready? Yeah.
History's in the making. Drive.

324
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,599
We are pulling out of the station.

325
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,120
Oh! No steering - it's weird!

326
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,200
This feels fantastic!
This is awesome.

327
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,440
Sounds like a train. Listen to that!

328
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,120
Blow the horn.
HORN BLARES

329
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,079
We've solved public transport,
literally solved it. Yep!

330
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,559
The only thing that would really
perfect the experience would
be if there were steam.

331
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,639
But, as it's an old Jaguar,
there's a very real chance.

332
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,239
But the old Jag ran like clockwork.

333
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,840
So, we returned to base...

334
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,319
You're all right. You're all right.

335
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,799
You're all right... to attach our
equally brilliant carriages.

336
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,839
You're all right. You're all right.

337
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,639
A modern-day railway carriage costs
in excess of £1 million.

338
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,000
Ours didn't cost
anything like that much.

339
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,519
Now, we have made some
mechanical modifications.

340
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,559
We've stripped out the
central wheels and added one
in each corner for extra stability.

341
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,759
And we've introduced a class system.

342
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,840
Absolutely. Now, I have taken the
Pageant CD Champagne model, no less,
and used it to create first class.

343
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,079
Inside, it was
beautifully appointed,

344
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,319
creating an atmosphere that I
hoped would resurrect the golden age

345
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,800
of train travel for the
discerning first-class passenger.

346
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,359
Hammond, meanwhile, had been
responsible for the buffet car
and second class.

347
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,119
Just look at this.

348
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,199
Inside, smart, clean, functional.

349
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,439
Everything the modern rail traveller
wants and demands.

350
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,079
And at the back,
there was Jeremy's creation.

351
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,799
This is the economy section.

352
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,599
What I've done is I've fitted
benches and, on the floor, straw

353
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,999
to absorb the diseases and the
blood, should there be a riot.

354
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,639
Then, for an authentic
working-class feel, at the back,

355
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,479
I fitted an outside khazi.

356
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,639
Why have you called it 'scum class'?

357
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,759
Good name. It's a bit blunt.
Honestly, think about it.
This way, it's an incentive.

358
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,039
You're not going to walk into the
ticket office and go, "Hello, can
I have three scum-class tickets?"

359
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,279
You're going to say, "Oh,
I'll spend a little bit more
so I don't have to say that."

360
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,039
You'll say, "I'll have second
class." We'll make more profit.
We'll make more money. Exactly.

361
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,359
With the carriages hooked up to
the Jag, we prepared ourselves

362
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,959
for the maiden voyage
of the world's cheapest train.

363
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,880
Engaging drive. Engage forwards.

364
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,479
Not moving.
Be gentle with it. Gently!

365
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,519
That's not working, is it?

366
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,839
It says we're doing
80 miles an hour then.

367
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,879
Get out and give us a push.

368
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,959
How's he going to push it?

369
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,360
Just get it started. When did you
ever see anybody push a train?

370
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,520
Why won't it go? 300 horsepower.

371
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
It's not working.
Why isn't it working?

372
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,560
Because it's just spinning all its
power away and not going anywhere.

373
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:26,239
Why? Well, one, you're
driving it like an oaf.

374
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,039
I've done gentle!
You didn't do gentle.

375
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,160
You just planted your foot on it
and went, "power!" as normally.

376
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:35,559
Secondly, I'm sorry to say this,
but you've brought the wrong car.

377
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,839
You did.
It's a rear-wheel-drive roadster.

378
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,678
What do you want?
Do you want front-wheel drive?

379
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,840
Possibly. Four-wheel drive
is where it wants to be.

380
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:45,279
It's not the car.

381
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,439
We've got too many carriages.
It's too heavy.

382
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Of course it's got carriages
on it, you muppet! It's a train!

383
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:52,639
There are too many.
Actually, that's the bare minimum.

384
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,359
We've got first-class, second class,
scum class, buffet. Real trains!

385
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,359
No less. Well, it's too heavy.

386
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,159
That's how much it weighs.

387
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,520
We need a different locomotive.

388
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,360
What about...

389
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,519
A sports train? A what?

390
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,879
A sports train. One carriage
and a car. It's a sports train.

391
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,679
Well, that defeats the point
of it being a train, doesn't it?

392
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,639
One carriage? Listen, you've got
sports cars, sports planes,
sports boats, sports jackets.

393
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,119
You've got loads of those.

394
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,079
People pay more for sports
experience. If it's got
one carriage, it's not a train.

395
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,039
No - Train GTI.

396
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,479
And you can sell tickets for
millions of pounds because everybody
will want to go in a sports train.

397
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,639
All the trains are on the same line.
Might as well get a bigger, better
locomotive and put them together.

398
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,479
That's why it's called a train.
I'm not changing the car.

399
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,079
Well, we're doing a proper train.
Well, you haven't got a car.

400
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,799
Well, we'll go and get one.
We'll get one.

401
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,879
Uncouple me. Gladly.
Off you go.

402
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,360
Jeremy departed, leaving us with the
task of finding a new locomotive.

403
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,920
Oh, yeah. That's great!

404
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,879
We shall pick that up later on.

405
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,559
No, we will not.
Because what is wrong with my idea
for a sports train?

406
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,399
It's stupid, you're an idiot.

407
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,559
Are you suggesting, therefore,
that Isambard Kingdom Brunel,

408
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,719
the greatest engineer who
ever lived, was an idiot?

409
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,639
No. Because Brunel did not
suggest making a sports train.
Well, that's where you're wrong.

410
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,679
Because I have a photograph here
of an engine designed to go on
Brunel's Great Western Railway.

411
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,919
And look at that.

412
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,759
What? In what way is that sporty?

413
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,639
Let me explain. We think today of
a 20-inch rim as being very sporty.

414
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,559
Look at that. That is a 96-inch rim.

415
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,639
For goodness' sake.
Look at this, that is a fat exhaust.

416
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,639
And, you will notice, one carriage.

417
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,719
This is a Max Power train,
right here.

418
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,279
Anyway, putting aside Jeremy's
ideas of Pimp My Stovepipe Hat,

419
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,919
Hammond and I think we might be
onto something with our train.

420
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,119
So we will, in fact,
pick that up later.

421
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,599
We will. But now it is time to put
a Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

422
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,400
And my guest tonight is
quite simply... Rowan Atkinson!

423
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,359
120 shows. Finally got you here.

424
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,719
Thank you so much.

425
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,239
Have a seat.

426
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Rowan Atkinson.

427
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,799
So, Rowan,
obviously Not The Nine O'Clock News,

428
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,799
Mr Bean you are, Blackadder.

429
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,159
But may we begin by talking, if
you don't mind, about the Honda NSX?

430
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,520
You are a fan, I believe, of the
Honda? I have owned one. Yes.

431
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:57,199
And why, did you find that...?
Well, I liked its modesty.

432
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,039
I liked its understatedness.

433
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,439
I liked the fact
that it was a very good car.

434
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,559
And yet it didn't shout itself.

435
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,919
It was sort of image-free. I
think that's what I liked about it.

436
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,278
This is nice, I like
talking to a man about cars.

437
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,758
It's the only thing I can really
talk about. Yes, quite. Which is why
we've looked forward

438
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,640
for some many years to have you on.

439
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,959
Of course, the McLaren F1
was another one of your...

440
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,999
Which I've still got. 14 years on.
You still have it? Yeah.

441
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,320
That is more interesting.
Because I don't like that.

442
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:26,039
I know, you've never
been wild about it.

443
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,399
I don't know, you could live with
it. I've lived with it for 14 years.

444
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,039
And I've done a lot of miles in it.

445
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,599
I've done 37,000 miles.

446
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,199
In a McLaren?
Which, for a McLaren, is a lot.

447
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,719
And you actually lent yours to us,
I seem to recall?

448
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,959
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

449
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,600
What on earth possessed you to say,

450
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:47,879
"Yes, Top Gear have rung saying, can
they borrow my most prized
possessions?"

451
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,800
I know,
for some reason I trusted you more
than most people trust you, Jeremy.

452
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:54,679
It was Richard Hammond as well,
I believe, who has a reputation

453
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,479
for driving in a straight line
with no incidents at all.
Oh, right, yes.

454
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,319
You had an Aston Martin last time
we saw you in Johnny English. Yes.

455
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,479
Which was a DB7. Yes, a DB7 Vantage.

456
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,439
That shows how long ago it was.

457
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,119
It was 2002 when we made
the first Johnny English.

458
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,320
And, of course, now there is
another one. There is a new one.

459
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,919
Johnny English Reborn.

460
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,159
Reborn? I'm embarrassed to say,

461
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,399
I haven't actually seen it.

462
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,639
There's a very good reason for that,
because we haven't
actually finished it.

463
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,359
But it's coming.
It's in the pipelines.

464
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,599
It's out in September,
so you'll see it then.

465
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,560
We have a sample of what's
going to be in the new movie.

466
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:36,319
Hopefully some cars.
Some bits and bobs, yes.
Let's have a look at the clip.

467
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,759
The world's greatest spy...

468
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,640
Johnny English.
Work hard, play hard. Is back.

469
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,439
And deadlier than ever.

470
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,320
You've been away for some time,
English.

471
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:52,320
But you haven't been forgotten.

472
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,919
There is a plot to kill the Premier.

473
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,320
Time is of the essence.
Where are we on security? English?

474
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,920
Give me 24 hours.

475
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,359
In 2011... My country needs me.

476
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,199
It's Johnny English.
Let's kick some bottom.

477
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,600
British intelligence...

478
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,000
Fights back.

479
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,439
Johnny!

480
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,840
It's the killer from Hong Kong!
Murderous crone!

481
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,759
I've got her!
You old hag! She's the killer!

482
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,600
She's my mother! Granny!

483
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,759
I thought the last one was
excellent. And that looks...

484
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,959
You'd go and see that, wouldn't you?

485
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,439
Obviously, let's talk
about the cars in there.
We saw a Rolls-Royce, the Phantom.

486
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,040
Yeah, Rolls-Royce
Phantom coupe, exactly.

487
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:57,319
I feel as though the Aston
thing has been a bit over done.

488
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,678
It's in the James Bond movies
and we used it in the first film.

489
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,680
I just felt like doing
something a bit different.

490
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:07,079
I've become quite a fan of the
Phantom. But I wanted to give the
car we had a little USP.

491
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,719
You know, some unique little thing
which no other Phantom had.

492
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,559
Which was? Which was an engine.

493
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,159
But not any engine.

494
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,679
This was an engine...

495
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,679
There's an interesting
story behind it.

496
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,519
When BMW bought the rights to the
Rolls-Royce name

497
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,919
in the late 20th century,
they had the opportunity to create

498
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,439
the ultimate
luxury car for the 21st century.

499
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,159
And they thought, "Maybe we ought
to give it the ultimate engine."

500
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:39,039
So let's give it something like
a nine-litre V16 engine.

501
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,919
And, unbelievably, they made
three or four of these
engines and they tested them.

502
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,119
They got them up to speed
and they had unbelievable
power and torque figures.

503
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,239
And then, at the last minute,
they thought, "Hmm, might
be a bit over the top."

504
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,799
But they had developed these
engines and they'd stuck them
in the warehouse somewhere.

505
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,039
And I knew that they existed,
so I got in touch with Rolls-Royce

506
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,799
and said, "Would you mind squeezing
one of your V16 engines in the front
of our Johnny English Phantom?"

507
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,799
Very sweetly, they agree to do it.
And it works, it's the real thing.

508
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,239
So the car we have over there,
which is from the movie,
that's got a V16 engine in it?

509
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,799
Yes, a nine litre V16 engine.

510
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,520
That's amazing.
That's why its bonnet's up?

511
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,919
I thought it had broken down.

512
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,519
No, Jeremy, it hasn't broken down.

513
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,599
I'm with you,
I'm a huge fan of the Phantom.

514
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,759
I think it is one of the greatest
cars. And, of course, it fits
perfectly because the Phantom

515
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,479
was designed for that engine.

516
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,400
I want to talk, if I may,
just a bit about comedy.
We've talked about cars now.

517
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:35,679
The comedy stuff, take Blackadder.

518
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,119
Right. When you read that script and
there was somebody there called Bob.

519
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,080
Anybody else would read it and go,
All right, they're called Bob."
You decided that

520
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,879
Bob could be a funny word.

521
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,839
Right. Bob.

522
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,319
But how do you do that?

523
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,279
It was always at
the end of the sentence.

524
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,079
"So, how can I help you, Bob?"

525
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,759
It just seemed like
a funny way of saying it. Bob.

526
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,480
Because I was wondering, I was
looking at a list of motoring words

527
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:06,359
the other day and wondering if you
could, just by saying them,
make them funny.

528
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,240
Just say the word. Airbag.

529
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,239
De Dion-Bouton.

530
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,599
That's a French word, that.

531
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,280
Petrol pump.

532
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,959
Very good. Round of applause
for saying "petrol pump".

533
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,319
Can I just say, it's also the
faces. Exactly, that helps.

534
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,199
Reviewing the car, because I
have to think of all sorts of
things to say about a car.

535
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,679
I know that if you were a
presenter on this show, you could
just do it with an expression.

536
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,080
Right. So, for example, if you
were presented with a McLaren F1.

537
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,439
Think of another one.
The imperiousness one
gets from a Range Rover.

538
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,080
Ah, right, OK.

539
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,479
LAUGHTER

540
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,959
APPLAUSE

541
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,320
Amazing!

542
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,919
We have so much to learn. So,
obviously, you do love your cars.

543
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,959
Yeah. Now, of course, you race.

544
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,159
Yeah, occasionally.
Historic racing, yeah.

545
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,639
So, what are you racing now?

546
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,599
What I have got is a Ford Falcon,
1964 Ford Falcon.

547
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,039
It's a big 4.7 litre V8,
and very, very light.

548
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,120
Isn't that like land yachting?!

549
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,799
Yes, exactly,
it's got a certain floppiness to it!

550
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,719
So, obviously, driving the Kia...

551
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,279
One of my worries about
coming on the show was

552
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,239
that I think people know

553
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,959
that I'm a car enthusiast
and that I have done some racing,

554
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,759
and they will assume
that in the Reasonably Priced Car

555
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,159
I'll be very good, when there's
no guarantee of that whatsoever.

556
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,399
Because it is
a very particular thing,

557
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,599
and I'm a slow learner of cars
and all that.

558
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,040
But anyway, I was keen to have a go,
so I had a go.

559
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:06,199
Who here would like to see
Rowan's lap?

560
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,599
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

561
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,640
Play the tape. Let's have a look.

562
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,000
Like you were using launch control!

563
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,759
Okey-dokey. Here we go.

564
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,479
You look a bit nervous,
if I may say.

565
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,999
Ooh, wide line, like
a Formula 1 driver through there.

566
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,520
And wide on the way out as well.
Looking smooth.

567
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,440
Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless.

568
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,919
Yes, now, here we are,
into the Hammerhead,

569
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,400
keeping it between the lines.

570
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:49,759
Obviously, the slower
you appear to be going...

571
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,159
and that does appear to be
very slow indeed...

572
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,560
sometimes, the faster it is.

573
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:58,200
That doesn't look too bad,
but what do you think from inside?

574
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,279
Good, good, good.

575
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,999
You really weren't pleased with
any part of this, were you?

576
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,080
Obviously, flat through there.

577
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,680
Not so good. Not so good, that.

578
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:14,439
Come on, cheer up!
Yeah, that's nicely done.

579
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,999
I say, keeping it very tight
on the runway.

580
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,799
That's a new, interesting line.

581
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,319
Second to last corner,
that is beautifully handled.

582
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,679
And Gambon, no drama,
no histrionics, across the line.

583
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

584
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,279
Well.

585
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,399
There's the board. Where do you
think you might have come?

586
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
Who's at the very top?

587
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:44,399
The man at the very top is
John Bishop, the northern comedian,

588
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,839
followed by Ross Noble, the northern
comedian. I was born in the north.

589
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,519
You're from the same neck of
the woods as Ross Noble.

590
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,839
Indeed. You're looking at the top,
you have that...?

591
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,559
No, exactly, one looks at that,

592
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,919
but there's no reason
why I should be there.

593
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,119
I felt as though I did OK,
but not great. That's my view.

594
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,119
OK, at the very top is Bishop on,
what is he, 1:42.8.

595
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,360
So, Rowan Atkinson. You did it...

596
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,079
one...

597
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,000
Good.

598
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,920
..forty...

599
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,039
Excellent.

600
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,800
..two...

601
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,999
..two.

602
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

603
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Come on! That's the new fastest man
we've ever had on our track!

604
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,160
Ladies and gentlemen, Rowan
Atkinson, the fastest man ever!

605
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,759
It is actually remarkable,

606
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,919
because we did genuinely think
when Bishop did that time

607
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,639
and was so much faster than Tom
Cruise, it would never be beaten.

608
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,959
No, the Tom Cruise thing
is fun, actually.

609
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,159
And your lap times were
incredibly consistent,

610
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,319
as is the mark
of a great racing driver.

611
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,199
Pish and posh!

612
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,479
Turns out
you're in the wrong career.

613
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,839
So, a lot of people think you've
already been on this show. Yes.

614
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,639
Ladies and gentlemen, he has now.
Rowan Atkinson!

615
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

616
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,799
Great time!

617
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,000
"Petrol pump." I can't do it!

618
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,479
Now, earlier on, we embarked on
a project to build a cheap train

619
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,799
using an old Jaguar XJS
and some caravans.

620
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,639
Yeah, and sadly, it didn't work,

621
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,159
because Jeremy's driving was rubbish,
and he bought the wrong car.

622
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,999
Then there was a really big argument
and he stormed off with the Jag,

623
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,839
saying he was going to make
something called a sports train.

624
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,839
Yeah, and that left Hammond and me
with all the coaches,

625
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,520
but nothing to pull them with.

626
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,719
'After a canter through
the classifieds,

627
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,519
'Hammond and I found
our new locomotive.'

628
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,679
Here's what Hammond and I have
bought instead. It's an Audi S8.

629
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,519
It has even more power than the
Jaguar, but more importantly, it has

630
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,359
four-wheel drive,
which is what you need,

631
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,559
because the rails are slippery.

632
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:29,159
Also, I have feet made of flesh,
with nerves in them,

633
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,959
like a human being, not lumps of
lead yoked to an incompetent oaf.

634
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,279
'While I was doing the driving,

635
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,799
'Hammond would take care
of the passengers.'

636
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,519
In just a few minutes,
I shall be welcoming the passengers

637
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,079
onto the train. This is the manifest
with their names.

638
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,279
But before I do that,
let's get the buffet car ready.

639
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,759
This has to look good.

640
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,159
This really is... All passengers -
first, second - will be able

641
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,519
to come in here, so I want it
to look excellent.

642
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Biscuits, various. Muffins. Yeah.

643
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
It's the carriage of plenty.

644
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,720
'With the buffet ready,
it was time to greet our guests...

645
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,239
'..who were a group of
top officials and inspectors

646
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,160
'from the railway world.'

647
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,159
You are? Steve Davies.

648
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,079
Steve Davies. MBE!
Steve Davies, MBE! Indeed.

649
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,319
And you're a colonel! Hello! How do
you do? Nice to see you again.

650
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,879
You're in first,
which is there. Indeed.

651
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,239
Hello, you're Helen...? Helen Ashby.

652
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,399
OBE! Hello! Hi! Come on in, please.

653
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,319
Thank you.
You're on first as well, obviously.

654
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,199
And sir? Ian Walmsley.
Yes, you're also...

655
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,319
Yes, in there, Ian,
that'll be absolutely brilliant.

656
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,519
In. There you go, you'll be fine.

657
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,960
The straw's fresh, don't worry.

658
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,039
'Everything now depended on giving
our passengers the train ride

659
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,600
'of a lifetime.'

660
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,759
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard the 14:53 express

661
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,519
from just outside Leicester
to near Loughborough.

662
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,079
This train is about to depart.
Thank you very much

663
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,960
for travelling with us.
We appreciate

664
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,599
that you have a choice
of car-based rail companies.

665
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,279
James, that's my job!
I'm running this bit of the train.

666
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,520
You just drive!

667
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:17,919
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your steward,

668
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,880
whose train this is. We will shortly
be departing towards Loughborough.

669
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,480
Look at this!

670
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,200
It's a train, and it works!

671
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
HE LAUGHS

672
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,440
This is the best thing
I've ever done!

673
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,200
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be through
shortly with refreshments.

674
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,360
Oh, yeah!

675
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,838
I don't know if this is
coming across

676
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,680
in the images you're seeing at home,

677
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:14,079
but the sensation of being in a car
but on the railway is just

678
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,079
the maddest thing I've ever seen
out of the window.

679
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,120
It's a railway!

680
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,240
Past another train parked
in the siding. It's just wonderful.

681
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,039
More points coming up. The
responsible driver slows down a bit.

682
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,960
A tiny bit of braking.

683
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Refreshments, gentlemen!

684
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Oh, it doesn't fit!

685
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,999
Across the little bridge,
the water on the left.

686
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,839
'While I was sightseeing,

687
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,639
'Jeremy was finally
leaving the station

688
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,760
'in his idiotic sports train.'

689
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,920
TGV 12 is up and running.

690
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,199
Let me talk you through
my passengers.

691
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,719
The man on the left, he's just
a man, but the man on the right,

692
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,759
that is the editor
of Rail Express magazine,
and I need to impress him.

693
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,960
He's going to be reviewing
this experience.

694
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,479
'Clearly, the best way of impressing
him would be to beat Hammond and May

695
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,479
'to our destination.'

696
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,120
Come on! Let's build up that speed!

697
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,760
Taking it up now to 40.

698
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,599
45!

699
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,679
A few bugs there smashing into
the face

700
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,080
of the editor
Railway Express magazine.

701
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,680
55!

702
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,159
HE LAUGHS
Look!

703
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,239
The wind in your hair,
the bees in your face!

704
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,759
V12 power!

705
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,479
The editor
of Railway Express magazine

706
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,720
basking in the shadow
of my magnificence!

707
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,479
Ugh, a train!

708
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,079
HORN BLARES

709
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,120
Oh, my God!

710
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,080
'Meanwhile, further up the line,
May had also got his foot down.'

711
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,400
25 miles an hour!

712
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,400
'But this turn of speed was
causing a few problems.'

713
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,160
The cruise control works.
Look at that! I'm now doing nothing.

714
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,159
'It wasn't just the vibrations that
were bothering the inspectors...

715
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,680
'the noise was also an issue.'

716
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,799
What? Do you think it's safe?

717
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,040
I can't hear you!

718
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:37,000
Do you think it's safe? No.

719
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,559
How do we communicate in
an emergency? We have to shout!

720
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,559
Is there a communication cord
to stop the train? Yes, yes, yes.

721
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,879
I'm going to check it, actually.
I'm about to ask the driver, Mr May,

722
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,000
to slow down a little bit,
just while we're serving the drinks.

723
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,960
James!

724
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,080
JAMES!

725
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,639
What's the matter?

726
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,400
Can you slow down a bit?
Everything's falling off. Right.

727
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,679
Meanwhile, I'd caught up with the
idiots but I couldn't get past,

728
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,679
due to a railway network design
fault.

729
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,759
Even here, we're stuck
behind caravans.

730
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,079
If I'm honest, though, that
wasn't the most immediate problem.

731
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,320
Oh, for God's sake.

732
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,359
Oh, this is really bad.

733
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,159
A member of the working
classes is now taking a dump

734
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,400
in full view of the editor
of Railway Express Magazine.

735
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,879
Oh, no.

736
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,720
I'm very sorry about this.

737
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,840
I can't just drive along like
this forever, I'm backing off.

738
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:00,079
I decided to go back
in search of some
points where I could change tracks.

739
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,400
I do apologise, I do apologise.

740
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:11,199
With Jeremy going backwards,
James and I decided we had time
to stop at the next station.

741
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,879
A tiny bit of braking.

742
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,600
You see, this is how you drive
a train. It's about finesse.

743
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,360
James, stop! James, stop!

744
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,399
James, we're bloody miles off.

745
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,240
I'm going to back up.

746
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,959
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd
like to stretch your legs at this
intermediate station,

747
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,360
and apologies for the overshoot.

748
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,319
That was an overshoot.
RICHARD: 'Stop doing the BLEEP-ing
announcements, that's my job!'

749
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,439
Ladies and gentlemen, we're just
pulling into the station in case,

750
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,440
you might want to stretch your legs,
perhaps, or maybe have a walk.

751
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,040
Allow me, please.

752
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,199
Bloody hell.

753
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,799
You don't have to be
wearing a short skirt, do you?

754
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,039
Thank you.

755
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,319
I have just discovered a small
design fault with the TGV12.

756
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,439
When going backwards, you
have to have the bonnet up
to keep the engine cool

757
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,560
because obviously there's no
air going into the radiator.

758
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:30,799
And I can't see
anything out of the back.

759
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,920
So the first I'll know about a
derailment is when we hear death and
screaming from the rear carriage.

760
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,719
Back at the station, the inspectors
were busy doing some inspecting.

761
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,759
What was the noise decibel level?

762
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,759
108, it peaked at. It's higher
than anything I've ever measured.

763
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,799
Just under 60. That's not
wide enough for disabled access.

764
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,359
Good for people with one arm.

765
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,359
There's only one armrest.

766
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,920
The flammability is what
worried me, actually.

767
00:51:58,921 --> 00:52:02,559
I think my general consideration,
it's not a train, it's a death-trap.

768
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,319
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I hope
you enjoyed your brief stopover at
Quorn and Woodhouse station.

769
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,199
We will now be departing
again for near Loughborough.

770
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,599
Come on!

771
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,360
Meanwhile,
I'd found the set of points where I
could switch to the other track.

772
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:25,839
Yes. Now, this is more of a palaver
than on the motorway but I am now
in the overtaking lane.

773
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,799
Yes, I am.

774
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,880
Let's go and hunt down James May.

775
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,159
We're really moving now!

776
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,039
70 miles an hour!

777
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,720
Yes!

778
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,880
That massive rear spoiler,
providing the downforce we need.

779
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,280
My passengers are looking thrilled.

780
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,319
And now I would show May
that speed is right, speed is good.

781
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,279
Speed works.

782
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,439
There he is.
James May is about to be splashed

783
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,560
by the mighty wheel-spinning TGV12.

784
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,879
Clarkson?

785
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,040
God, how did he do that?

786
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,720
The sports train is invincible.

787
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,079
Ever since the dawn of the
train it has been mired in this
sea of turgid practicality.

788
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,359
Nobody's ever thought, "Let's make
an exciting train."

789
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,200
And here I am, in just such a thing.

790
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,639
On Hammond and May's train,

791
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,639
it's just one long, dreary trail
of boredom.

792
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,960
Brace! Brace!

793
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,440
Some poo's come out.

794
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,919
Ladies and gentlemen, particularly of
first class, with your OBEs and MBEs.

795
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,560
Richard Hammond, your steward,
will be passing through
shortly with hot meals.

796
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,839
Oh, wait a minute.

797
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:37,079
Since hunting was banned,
one sees the horses frolicking
gaily in the fields, enjoying...

798
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,799
Forgive me while I just back
off and have a bit of a gloat.

799
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,159
If we look over here, we see
traditional farming methods.

800
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,159
And I think that pretty
much covers the lecture.

801
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,839
I'm just doing a lecture on the
countryside. Nothing to see here.

802
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,439
And that's it.

803
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,960
Now we'll be on our way.

804
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,079
Oh, dear.

805
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,600
Bye!

806
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,439
People of first class.

807
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,119
Once again, the editor of
Railway Express Magazine was
heading back towards Leicester.

808
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,039
Although this time I had
at least found a novel way
of seeing where I was going.

809
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,639
Ignore the enormous
locomotive behind me.

810
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,999
It's a glitch, really. Not my fault.

811
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,239
Our train was now certain of beating
Jeremy's to near Loughborough.

812
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,799
This is just serene.

813
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,880
However, in the buffet car,
things weren't going so well.

814
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
please brace yourself.

815
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:49,719
The incompetent steward is about to
pour tepid coffee into your crotch.

816
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,119
Christ's sake, James! Stop making
BLEEP-ing announcements!

817
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,079
That's my job, I'm the steward!

818
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,599
You drive, I steward.

819
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,279
It's my train and the driver makes
the bleeding announcements.
That's the way it is.

820
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,439
I had finally found a passing point

821
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,119
and was now back in the chase.

822
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,279
Really shifting, now.

823
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,360
Really, really, really moving.

824
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,759
No time to lose.

825
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,479
80mph.

826
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,679
Meanwhile...

827
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,239
♪ La la la la la la!

828
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,439
♪ La la la la la la la! ♪

829
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,520
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.
It's my Tannoy.

830
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,919
Hello, chaps.

831
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,840
Can I offer you refreshments?

832
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,559
Have you got a coffee, please? No.

833
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,720
Any chance of a Danish
pastry, please? No.

834
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,839
I'll slow it down
by one mile an hour.

835
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,799
This isn't the fastest train
in the world. I'm sure Jeremy
will claim his goes faster.

836
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,199
But ours carries more people.
That's the point of a train.

837
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,279
It's mass transport.

838
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,480
What Jeremy's built,
essentially, is a business jet.

839
00:57:08,481 --> 00:57:13,559
But that's out of the reach
of the vast majority of people.

840
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,280
There you go. Anything else
I can get you? Red wine? No.

841
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,279
Oh, dear.

842
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,960
It appears my colleagues
have a bit of a problem.

843
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,799
James. What?

844
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,679
Your train's on fire.

845
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,160
Is it? Yes, it is. Right.

846
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,239
Well, there we are.

847
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,519
Once again, then,
it looked like I would be the first

848
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,439
to our destination.

849
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,519
Very nearly at the end now.

850
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,079
And what an epic voyage
this has been.

851
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,199
Leicester - well, nearly Leicester -
to the outskirts of Loughborough.

852
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,279
A distance of nearly eight miles.

853
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,999
And the sports train

854
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,319
just about done it.

855
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,199
Easing it down, now.

856
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,359
Should imagine
there'll be a fanfare.

857
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,559
The mayor of Loughborough is
almost certainly going to be here.

858
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,239
Oh, he isn't.

859
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,719
Nobody is.

860
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,680
Not to worry, though, because
the great pioneers are often
unappreciated at first.

861
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,719
Throughout this epic voyage,

862
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:40,199
I have referred to this as either
the TGV12 or the sports train.

863
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,680
But I don't think that's right.
I don't think that does it justice.

864
00:58:42,681 --> 00:58:45,559
I think that the editor and the
other man

865
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,359
will agree that what you
are looking at here is the future.

866
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,880
And all we must do now is
await the arrival of my
less successful colleagues.

867
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,519
No, listen. If you ignore the fire,

868
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,599
and the fact we didn't get where we
wanted to go, it was incredibly noisy

869
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,359
and the fact that all the passengers
have run away... Apart from that,
it was a resounding success?

870
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,439
Yes, I think we can only judge it to
be a success. It worked as a train.

871
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,600
We came up with something
new and unique and brilliant.

872
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:18,679
Well, I think as a concept...
Oh, hello. It's quite nice.

873
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,880
But the fact is...
HORN BLARES

874
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,199
Hold on. Woah, woah.

875
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,159
Let's just get this straight,
your train was a total failure.
No, it was not.

876
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,679
Well, where is it, then? Well,
some of it is in the atmosphere.

877
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,559
The rest of this is
all over Leicestershire.

878
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,639
Whereas mine is here. And already
her Majesty's government

879
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,679
has been on the telephone asking if
they can have the rights to use this

880
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,039
on the proposed
West Coast Main Line.

881
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,599
Really? No, I made that up.

882
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,680
I'll tell you who has been
in touch, though. The editor of
Railway Express Magazine. Excellent.

883
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:15,279
He wrote a short view of
his journey and your train.
Would you like to hear it?

884
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,959
Uh-huh. He says the following.

885
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,999
"There was nothing to eat.

886
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,559
"The ride was awful.
The noise was distressing."

887
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,799
He spent most of the day
going backwards, he genuinely

888
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,959
feared for his life
and he ended up covered in excrement.

889
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,599
So, it's exactly
like a normal train.

890
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,159
Only much cheaper.

891
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,599
And, on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

892
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,279
Thank you very much for watching.

893
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,519
Next week, we destroy Kent
with a tank.

894
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,160
But, for now, good night.
