1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,689
Tonight,
I talk to a man in sunglasses.

2
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:18,397
James draws a square on a wall.

3
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,798
And Richard plays with
a soldier's chopper.

4
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,949
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,786
Hello, good evening.
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:36,667
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

7
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:46,626
Now, in the '60s and '70s
the TV schedules were awash with
detective shows like The Baron,

8
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:50,906
Department S, The Protectors, The
Persuaders, The Saint, The Avengers.

9
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,106
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

10
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:56,026
Let me explain. They were all
basically the same, OK?

11
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:59,946
Every week a good looking man would
run into a swanky hotel, punch a

12
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:04,386
swarthy looking man in a Fez and
then go to bed with a pretty lady.

13
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:07,746
Anyone here old enough to
remember that? Yeah, you, exactly.

14
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:12,306
The only difference was
the cars they all drove, OK?

15
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:15,346
This is Brett Sinclair,
Aston Martin DBS.

16
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,986
Steed had a Broadspeed tuned Jag.

17
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:22,946
And there is The Saint
with his Volvo P1800.

18
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:26,586
Now, the interesting thing is
that almost none of them ever drove

19
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:31,547
the Jensen Interceptor, and I think
there's a very good reason for that.

20
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:43,867
It looks fantastic, but it was built
very badly by people who didn't
seem to care what they were doing.

21
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,586
Let me give you one example.

22
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:53,586
When the people on the Jensen
production line needed a new
steering rack they'd go to

23
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:59,786
the steering rack factory and buy
one, often without bothering to
check what car it was for.

24
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:06,347
Some Interceptors were apparently
sold fitted with steering racks
designed for the Triumph Stag.

25
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:13,186
That, then, is why it wasn't very
popular with the TV heroes
of yesteryear.

26
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:16,067
It would never have worked properly.

27
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:25,306
Now, though, a small company
based here in the lungs of England

28
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:30,147
has launched an updated version,
which does.

29
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:42,346
In the old car the big Chrysler
engine turned petrol into noise,

30
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:45,186
but very little power was produced
on the way,

31
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:48,907
so they've taken that
engine out and thrown it away.

32
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:56,666
In its place there's a 6.2 litre
V8 from the modern day Corvette.

33
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:01,266
The rear suspension is modern, too,
as are the brakes.

34
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:07,786
But, critically, the body,
that glorious Italian styling,
that's untouched.

35
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,227
And it still has the best name
ever put on a car...

36
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:13,547
Interceptor.

37
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:23,186
So, what we have here then is much
the same as that house over there.

38
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:29,626
It's old and it's beautiful, but it
has central heating, it has all the
appurtenances of modern living.

39
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:36,066
And unlike that modern day E type
we looked at the other day
this doesn't cost £500,000.

40
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,107
This is 112,000.

41
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:44,226
I know that's a lot if you're on
benefits, but it's not a lot
if you're on Elton John.

42
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,626
I mean, if you are Elton John.

43
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:51,347
And it's really not a lot when
you see what this car can do.

44
00:03:54,667 --> 00:04:00,786
Thanks to 429 horsepower, 0 to 60 is
dealt with in 4.5 seconds

45
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:05,626
and the top speed is 167.

46
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:10,786
It goes, then, like that other
interceptor from the period,

47
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:13,586
the English Electric Lightning.

48
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,026
However, it as thirsty as the jet,

49
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,907
and as noisy.

50
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:26,186
The engine in this, though,
sounds fantastic... I think.

51
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:29,026
It's hard to be sure because there's
so much wind noise

52
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:31,706
coming from here
and everywhere else.

53
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:36,466
It's a reminder, really, that this
car was built in the '70s

54
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,986
in the West Midlands
and these words,

55
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:44,067
"West", "Seventies", "Midlands,"
they're not bywords for quality.

56
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:49,906
There are other period features
I don't much care for either.

57
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:52,906
First of all there's the air
conditioning. Two settings,

58
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,386
sauna or Turkish prison.

59
00:04:55,387 --> 00:05:01,706
Then you've got the wipers, which
are as good at removing water from
the windscreen as a pair of pencils.

60
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,946
And then there's
the steering system.

61
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:07,906
It's original, so it could be from
a Triumph Stag or it could be from

62
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,186
a lawn mower, who knows?

63
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:14,346
What I do know is to make the car
move that much

64
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,147
you have to do quite a lot
of flailing at the wheel.

65
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:24,106
There are, however, some
period features I love.

66
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:28,746
The traditional white on black
dials are the sort you get
in war films, that you tap

67
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:32,226
when they tell you bad news
and then they tell you good news.

68
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:33,786
Oh no, I've got no fuel!

69
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:36,666
Oh, look, I've got a full tank!

70
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:41,346
I also like having the
dim dip switch on the floor.

71
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:44,146
And, look at that radio!

72
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,746
'This is the BBC Home Service.'

73
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,827
It's from the James May collection.

74
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,066
So, how do we sum this car up?

75
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,466
Certainly it's more of a
grand tourer than a raging

76
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:02,626
B road barnstormer, but I
think that what it is most of all

77
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,986
is a time machine.

78
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:10,426
In my head, right now this is not
Top Gear and this is not 2011.

79
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:17,346
It's 1972, I have an enormous
moustache and I am the star

80
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:19,667
of a new TV detective show.

81
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,186
Nice wheels.

82
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:34,546
Rock your head.
I would have done if you'd
gone within a metre of me!

83
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:37,106
I did! It was like
you're swatting a fly over there.

84
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,945
That was rubbish. Did you see that?

85
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:40,067
Yeah, it was rubbish.

86
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:43,146
We can't just go around
pretending to punch each other.

87
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:48,346
You need a sort of proper sequence.
Nice wheels, by the way. Isn't it
just the best thing ever?

88
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:50,227
We need to sort this out.
We need a plan.

89
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:57,546
So, we adjourned to the
Top Gear office to plan our
Interceptor tribute show.

90
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:02,426
Why don't we just make
the title sequence? Mmm.
Title sequence is a good idea because

91
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:06,306
that tells the whole story.
It sums up the atmosphere
and the setting. Exactly.

92
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:09,586
They're always very short and
they often end with a freeze.

93
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:11,986
Yeah, exactly.
And everyone turns like that.

94
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:14,906
And there's always somebody
doing karate chops on people.

95
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:19,106
No, there's always a karate chop,
shooting, car chase. Explosion.

96
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,667
And then there was never any blood.

97
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,626
No. People were shot extensively.

98
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:25,186
Very close.
Very close, and they never bled.

99
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:30,066
If anything ever has a button on it
or a light, they're massive. Girls.

100
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,026
Do you remember that
bit in The Persuaders?

101
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:35,386
Roger Moore, Tony Curtis,
walking along, girl in

102
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:38,907
a bikini walks between them for no
obvious reason and they both go...

103
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:42,986
And the good thing about
a karate chop is there's no blood.

104
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:46,026
Because you wouldn't need blood.
The whole shooting and no blood.

105
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,626
Karate chop, no blood,
you just fall over. There is karate.

106
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:52,066
You can do a karate chop.
It's just there always was.

107
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:55,626
You get out of the car, karate.
There was a karate specialist.

108
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:57,346
You could be a karate specialist.

109
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:01,107
Yeah. Well, let's get out
there and make a title sequence.

110
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,787
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

111
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,146
Did you kick that girl
in the crotch? Yes, I did.

112
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:16,946
It was actually in her crotch?
You could edit that out.

113
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,306
Can I just ask...?

114
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:23,506
Can I just ask, why don't we
make that every week? Yes, I know.

115
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:26,426
I want to be a karate expert.
I want an Interceptor.

116
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,746
I want a moustache.
Well, there you go.

117
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:35,187
Who here would like us to
stop making this rubbish
and make that instead? Yes!

118
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,386
Because think of the snogging!

119
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:41,146
And I tell you what,
I know the girl we could have.

120
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,746
Wendi Murdoch! Blam!

121
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:49,386
Apparently, according to one
newspaper, so must be true,
she growled when she hit him. Oh!

122
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,106
LAUGHTER
Hammond likes a fighty girl.

123
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:56,306
Anyway, before we do
the news properly,
there's something I need to explain.

124
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,826
Very, very keen viewers may
have noticed that this

125
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:03,706
hour long programme, is sometimes
62 or even 63 minutes long.

126
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:09,106
But this week BBC Two have
told us it must be 59 minutes,
no ifs or buts, on the nose.

127
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:12,586
In fact, all the programmes on
BBC Two tonight must be exactly to

128
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:17,026
length because they're going at
10.00pm live to the MotoGP race.

129
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,466
Yes.
I'm not interested in bike racing.

130
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:22,346
That's hardly relevant!
Just because you're not interested

131
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:26,506
doesn't mean that the BBC
should deny all the people who are
the opportunity of seeing it.

132
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,426
Bike racing only works on YouTube.

133
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,226
What? Well, you just see the crashes
and then... Oh, don't be sick!

134
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:36,186
Hands up if you want to
see bike racing? Two...

135
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:40,786
So, about 8% of the population
want me to get a move on.

136
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:44,666
Yes, they do, so we're going to
press on and start with the news.

137
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:49,346
And we start with news you may
have heard of this week, a new
flying car has been announced.

138
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,667
It costs £150,000.
Here's a shot of it in the air.

139
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:55,507
That's what it looks like as an
aeroplane. And here's a shot of it on
the ground.

140
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,906
It's just a crumpled aeroplane,
isn't it? It just comes pre crashed.

141
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,506
There's an even bigger
problem I've thought of.

142
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:05,186
I think everybody knows, James, you
do have a light aircraft,

143
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:09,986
and before you take off you have to
do pre-flight checks. Well, a few,
yeah.

144
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,306
What are they? Eh?!

145
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,026
You have to check the fuel...

146
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,265
Why do you check the fuel?

147
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,587
So it hasn't got water in it.

148
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,946
How would water get into the fuel?

149
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,946
Oh, we haven't got time for this!
No, I'm very interested.

150
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,307
No, we haven't got time for this.

151
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,666
It's only bike racing.
James, tell me more about your
pre-flight checks. No, just...

152
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,707
Actually, you know what?

153
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:33,986
Even I would rather watch bike
racing than listen to James talk
about his pre-flight checks.

154
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:38,266
Exactly, so get on.
So, I will move it on. Now, there's
a company in America called SSC

155
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,467
and they brought out a car
called the Aero, which,

156
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:45,226
for a time, was the fastest car in
the world, verified by Guinness.
Faster than the Bugatti Veyron.

157
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:47,226
Now they've come up with
another new car.

158
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:51,466
I've got a picture of it here.
We have no details at all,
but we do know its name.

159
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:56,626
It's called the Twatawahfur.

160
00:11:56,627 --> 00:12:00,506
That's interesting.
Is this going to be a rival for
the new Pagani Huhurrua?

161
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:02,306
What?

162
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,626
The replacement for the Zonda,
it's called that Hurh...

163
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:10,226
Hurraher. It's spelt H-U-A-Y-R-A.
The Hurh...

164
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:15,226
Huayra. So, you've got a choice
now, if you're a wealthy person,
between the Twatawahurrr,

165
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,346
or the Hurwarrrrrrrr.

166
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:22,586
So, are car makers now naming their
cars after the noises people make
when they're punched in the stomach?

167
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,747
The Lamborghini Blurgha!

168
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:30,226
Mini recently announced a new car.

169
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:33,186
It's called The Mini
Inspired By Goodwood.

170
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:37,506
Stupid name, stupid price. £41,000.

171
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,106
For a Mini? For a Mini.

172
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:42,066
41 grand. However, Aston
has now gone one better, OK?

173
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:46,946
We've got this new car, it's
called the Cygnet and Colette

174
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:48,786
and that's £43,000. Eh?!

175
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,546
43 grand for that!

176
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:54,586
And we should point out
that is a Toyota iQ.

177
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,626
Yes, it starts out as an 11 grand
Toyota.

178
00:12:56,627 --> 00:13:02,106
Aston Martin take the Toyota badges
off, put Aston Martin ones on,
the price goes up to 31,000.

179
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:05,586
They've now added the
Colette badges, 43 grand.

180
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:08,067
So, what do you get for that
extra 12 grand on top, then?

181
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,946
You need to look inside.
Here they are, two cushions.

182
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,747
LAUGHTER

183
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:17,106
Wait a minute.
What is the Cygnet AND Colette?

184
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,786
It sounds like a lap dancing duo
from Leeds.

185
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:23,226
An ice skating duo,
Cygnet and Colette.

186
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:26,826
No, to be honest, we know that
the Cygnet part is an
Aston Martin Cygnet.

187
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:28,426
It's the Colette thing.

188
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:31,507
What is Colette? It sounds
like a feminine hygiene product.

189
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,706
Argh!

190
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,786
What? I made a mistake.
Did you?

191
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,986
You get more than just the cushions.

192
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:46,106
I do apologise. You also get
quilted sun visors, some biscuits.

193
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,826
I'm just quoting what you get.

194
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,226
"A guide to Paris,
a plastic camera, an empty bottle

195
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:57,306
"and four compilation CDs featuring
bands such as The Morning Benders."

196
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:58,426
LAUGHTER

197
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:02,386
So, basically they're selling you
a small Toyota full of clutter.

198
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,986
Oh, now, the most
important thing, obviously.

199
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:08,986
A couple of weeks ago I
showed you all a bird deposit

200
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:11,986
on the back of my Range Rover.
You may remember. Yes, we do.

201
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:16,986
And I invited viewers to send in
pictures of bird dirt on their car
that was more substantial.

202
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:20,747
We've had some, I admit.
Oh, yeah. Here's one from Africa.

203
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,987
I think we know who did it!
This is a marabou stork.

204
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,306
God's cruellest joke, this bird.

205
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:30,346
Yeah, we haven't really got
time for one of your bird lectures.

206
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:33,506
You're getting it because this is
more interesting than bike racing.

207
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:36,986
God knew that bird was going to live
in Africa when he gave it bald legs.

208
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:39,746
Now, I'm sorry, but
that's a bit unkind.

209
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,906
So, its legs get hot and sunburnt
and the only way it can cool them

210
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:46,306
down, and I'm not making this up,
is to wee on them constantly.

211
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:48,826
Yeah, but, Jeremy...
So it wees on its legs. Car show.

212
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:51,186
We're a car show.

213
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:55,186
A giant stork that wees on its knees
is not strictly our kind of deal.

214
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,866
It is if it's standing
on a Mitsubishi Lancer.

215
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,426
No! Which it is, so there's
a car element to my story.

216
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,265
Anyway there's another... You what?

217
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,307
That's a Galant.

218
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:05,066
What a cretin you are!

219
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,906
That could well be a Galant.
It's a Galant!

220
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,906
APPLAUSE

221
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:14,747
Remind me never to have
him round for dinner.

222
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:24,146
How did you know it was a
Galant, you can only see
the back of the television?

223
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:27,746
Anyway, I've just humiliated
myself and will now commit suicide.

224
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:30,986
Except, if I do that you'll be able
to watch the bike racing.
Yes, we will.

225
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:35,026
So, I won't, I shall keep going
with another bird dirt picture.

226
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:37,746
Now, I don't think a bird did that.

227
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:42,506
I think that was a man and I
think, if that's your car, you
should report him to the police.

228
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:46,586
Not that you can because, of course,
they've all resigned. But, anyway...

229
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:49,266
And that's the end of the news.
It isn't, actually.

230
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,627
Yes, it is. It isn't. It is.

231
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,946
I'm not going to waste time arguing.
Move on!

232
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,866
I will move it on because
I want to talk about sport.

233
00:15:55,867 --> 00:16:00,906
You see, anyone can kick a football
around and get an idea of what it
would be like to be David Beckham.

234
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:05,506
Anybody can pick up a golf bat
and get an idea of what it
would like to be a Freemason.

235
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:10,266
Let's get on with your point. If you
want to drive a Formula One car you
have to be a Formula One driver.

236
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:16,547
An ordinary mortal can't just
go into a Formula One factory
and buy one, except now you can.

237
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:34,306
This is the new Lotus T125.

238
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:39,626
And straight away, an anorak would
say, "that's not a Formula One car."

239
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:41,746
And that's right.

240
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,027
It isn't.

241
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:48,866
But it does come with a Cosworth V8,
a sequential gearbox,

242
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,706
full downforce,
a complicated steering wheel,

243
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:55,906
a hand-operated clutch and all
the other F1 trimmings as well.

244
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:59,746
For instance,
included in the price is Geoff,

245
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,706
who is a fitness instructor.

246
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:04,586
Alfonso, who will cook for you
and your friends,

247
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:07,426
and a team of mechanics who
will accompany you

248
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,826
and your car to any race
track in the world.

249
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:14,346
You also get a truck which is fitted
with all the things you need,

250
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:17,107
including a Jean Alesi...

251
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,666
So let's just get this straight.

252
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,146
If I buy one of these cars,
I get you,

253
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:28,626
a former Ferrari Formula One driver,
to teach me how to drive it?

254
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,626
It is like that.

255
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:33,426
The only problem is that it is single
seat.

256
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,426
When you are in, you are alone.
Well, exactly.

257
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:39,066
You will have to
follow my instruction.

258
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:43,346
Jean's first job was to get me
comfortable in the car.

259
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:46,786
The position is extremely important,
because it is where you will

260
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:52,506
have the feeling and the feedback
from what is happening.

261
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:53,626
Erm.

262
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:57,226
Now, you see...
No, that is not the correct position.

263
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:01,706
Well it is the position that I...
that's it. It's my seat.

264
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:05,106
Because I was
so generously proportioned,

265
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:10,026
the only option was to remove
the seat altogether.

266
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:12,666
OK... Well, I'm in. Yeah.
But I am sitting on the floor.

267
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:17,026
OK, but now, with the foam,
we will feel... With the foam?

268
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:20,706
A special foam. It's like being
taught by Inspector Clouseau, this.

269
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,266
Is there going to be a "minkey"
coming in a minute?

270
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:28,706
No, we have a special foam,
and you will really feel at home.

271
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,706
The foam fitting was rather
disturbing.

272
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,906
Why... what are you doing?
You're in my actual anus.

273
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,867
That was my actual anus that
you put your hand in.

274
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,906
It is a part of the programme!

275
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:46,346
Things that just happened that I
didn't think would happen today...

276
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:52,186
Jean Alesi, who I used to
hero-worship, is playing
with my genitals.

277
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,906
And Jean. Yeah?

278
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:58,106
Compared to the Formula One cars of,
I don't know, pick a period.

279
00:18:58,107 --> 00:19:02,026
'90s? Is this as fast as that?
I would say '90s, yes.

280
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,666
A lot faster.

281
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,906
This is faster than a '90s
Formula One car?

282
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:08,746
Yes, because you have a lot
more downforce.

283
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,547
We have a floor which
guarantees 60% of the downforce.

1
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:16,006
Really? So, it's got more downforce
than even today's Formula One cars?

2
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:23,406
Definitely, yes. In terms of power,
obviously it's down?
We have 640 horsepower.

3
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:26,567
Which is really enough for 600 kilo.

4
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:35,726
Soon, I was ready for my first ever
taste of Formula One.

5
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,447
ENGINE REVS

6
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:41,726
ENGINE STALLS

7
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,367
Oh f... no!

8
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,407
Erm...

9
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:55,887
Holy cow! Oh!

10
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:04,286
That's acceleration, and I'm not
even going fully down on the
throttle.

11
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:09,046
It's just terrifying.
Oh, I can't turn the wheel!

12
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:14,087
My legs are in the way!
God, this is quite horrible!

13
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:20,766
Unlike a Formula One car, which will
rev to 17 or 18,000...

14
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,047
Ow!

15
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,727
..this is limited to just 10,500,
and I'm glad about that!

16
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:37,206
I've lost all the temperature out of
the tyres. Oh, I don't like this.

17
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:40,687
No, no, no. No, I don't want this.

18
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:47,446
Thank you. I've driven a car that's
got this much power before, and I've

19
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:53,646
driven a car on slicks before, and I
drove a car that weighs as little as

20
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,646
this before, but I've never driven
a car that has all of those things.

21
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:58,486
Together.
HE SIGHS

22
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:01,127
Nicer.
HE LAUGHS

23
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:05,807
It wasn't nice.
It had been terrifying.

24
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:11,486
And to explain why,
I switched to my own car.

25
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:16,846
My mind tells me that it's OK to
turn into the follow-through,

26
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:20,527
which is coming up now,
at 90 miles an hour.

27
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:28,006
The thing is, in the Lotus,
I have to tell my mind,

28
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:33,127
it's OK to go through that corner
at 160 miles an hour.

29
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:41,086
And what's more, if I tried to do
it in the Lotus at 90,

30
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:45,086
there won't be enough air going over
the wings, so there won't be much

31
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:48,407
downforce, and the tyres will be
cold, so there won't be much grip.

32
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:55,006
If I do it at the speed my mind says
is safe, I will crash,

33
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:57,166
and I will be killed.

34
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:04,247
To stay alive, I have to go faster
than my mind thinks is possible.

35
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:08,046
Then,
there's the question of braking.

36
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:12,406
If I want to slow down enough at the
hammerhead which is down there,

37
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:16,406
in this car which has enormous,
ventilated discs, I would

38
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:22,406
have to start braking at this
point, 140 metres from the corner.

39
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:26,207
But what if you braked the
Lotus at this point?

40
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:38,046
So, he's come to a dead stop,
never mind slowing-down enough,

41
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:41,166
60 yards from the corner.

42
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,126
So, what that means is,

43
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,646
when I'm driving the Lotus,
I have to come past here,

44
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:53,246
with my foot buried in the loud
pedal, still going like hell here,

45
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,286
still not braking, still not
even thinking of braking

46
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,766
at this point, not here,

47
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,247
that would be stupid, I would look
like an idiot.

48
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:05,446
My mind is now SCREAMING at me,
stop! Stop!

49
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:08,286
You're going to be killed,
but I'm still accelerating.

50
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:14,046
And when I get to about here,
then I'll brake.

51
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:17,327
And I don't think I've got the balls
for that.

52
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:25,007
To spur me on,
I unchained the Stig.

53
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:31,806
Unlike me, this is a man that drives
as fast as a car will go,

54
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:34,206
not as fast as he thinks he can go.

55
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:39,046
And what he's doing now is setting
a lap time on our short circuit

56
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:44,007
in V8 powered Ariel Atom, the
fastest road car we've ever tested.

57
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:50,607
He did it in 36.2 seconds.

58
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:56,366
So, can a fat, frightened
51-year-old man

59
00:23:56,367 --> 00:24:01,127
overcome the limitations of his own
mind and beat that time?

60
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,726
Wish me luck, everybody.
ENGINE STOPS

61
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,087
Oh, bloody hell!

62
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,766
Going a bit too hard through there!

63
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:17,406
I've got to get used to these
brakes!

64
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:18,926
They just feel useless

65
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:22,966
until you stand on them!
It's all over the place!

66
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:26,526
I am literally all over
the place here!

67
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:32,127
37.9, Jeremy.
37.9 seconds was my last lap!

68
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:37,647
The whole thing is jumping about
like a wild animal!

69
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:42,886
Come on, Jeremy! Yes!

70
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,886
Oh, Jesus, no!

71
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:48,486
Ballsed it up. 37.7.

72
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:52,566
37.7. Oh, no!

73
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,486
Oh, for crying out bloody loud!

74
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:59,567
Clearly it was time for
another chat with Yoda.

75
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:05,326
Gears for the corners,
Hammerhead, second?

76
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:09,366
Second, for the first one, for the
left. And first for the right.
First for the right?!

77
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:12,006
Yes, because otherwise,
the car is pushing down,

78
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:17,846
so you use the engine braking to
make the back slide a little bit.
Yep.

79
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:22,686
Then, you keep the 6th for the fast
corner. 6th gear? Keep the 6th.

80
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,286
Then, second gear. For the Chicago.
Through the tyres. Yes. Yes.

81
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:27,887
And then...

82
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:33,206
With the noise curfew on our track
fast approaching,

83
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,407
this was my last chance to
beat 36.2 seconds.

84
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:42,447
20 minutes. 20 minutes to try
and beat that time.

85
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,967
Come on, now, come on!
Come on! Come on!

86
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:55,286
Yes, finally, I have got the Chicago
worked out.

87
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,806
Come on!

88
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,687
Feeling cramp in my hands!

89
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:05,287
37.5, Jeremy. 37.5!

90
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:19,767
Oh, that's braking! And the neck!
My neck is absolutely destroyed!

91
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:26,247
That's 37 dead. 37. Come on!

92
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:32,287
Ow, my head!

93
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:36,527
Come on! Come on! Come on!

94
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:45,086
35.8. Yes! Yes! Yes!

95
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:49,686
35.8! 35.8!

96
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:53,887
Eat that, Stig!
Yes, yes, yes!

97
00:26:56,367 --> 00:27:02,527
I'm a Formula One driver! Yes! Yes!

98
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:07,566
APPLAUSE

99
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,526
Well done. Thank you. Well done.
And I looked good.

100
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:15,006
I looked good in that suit.
I am slightly. What? No, well done.

101
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:18,246
You did good.
But I'm slightly confused by this.

102
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:20,647
So, if you buy one of these,
you don't actually race it.

103
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:24,646
No, what you do is,
you hire a track, you ring Lotus,

104
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:28,046
they bring your car to the track
with the mechanics, the chef,

105
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:30,686
all the things I talked about there,
and you drive it around

106
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:33,566
until your neck hurts
and then you go home.

107
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,566
How much does all this cost?
£650,000.

108
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,886
You see, that is quite a lot.
Is it worth it?

109
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:41,966
Well, if you're one of the Scottish
people that won the Euro

110
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:45,166
lottery millions, then, you know,
it's probably worth it.

111
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,127
I mean, you'd have
to lose a few pounds.

112
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:51,006
LAUGHING AND GROANING
I don't mean that cruelly.

113
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:54,006
I genuinely don't mean that cruelly,
and anyway,

114
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:58,966
people in glass houses. But, the
fact is, it's agony. It really is.

115
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:03,606
I was going around Chicago,
yet my head is just really,
like it's being pulled off,

116
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:06,686
and you know you can't accelerate to
go round to the Hammerhead,

117
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:10,726
until you can get your head back
upright and rested on the air box.
I know what you mean,

118
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:14,006
because when I drove that F1 car on
the show a few years ago,

119
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:17,566
I could not believe how fast you had
to go to make the thing work.

120
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:21,766
The thing is, that Formula One car
that you drove, came round here with
the Stig at the wheel,

121
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,606
did a lap in 59 seconds,
now we were very keen to find out

122
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:30,126
if this would go faster, so we
brought it down here the other day,
and you won't believe this,

123
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,487
in the middle of July in a British
summer, it was raining!

124
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:35,806
And in a show where we're already
tight for a time,

125
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:38,366
there is really no
point entering a wet lap in this,

126
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:43,246
what with that tell us? So we'll get
it back on a dry day and report back
on how it does. Yes, we will.

127
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:47,126
Now, it's time to put a star in
our reasonably priced car.

128
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:50,046
Now, my guest tonight has long,
straggly hair

129
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:54,726
and an incredible ability to heal
the sick and feed the hungry.

130
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:58,246
Ladies and gentlemen, Jesus...

131
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:01,607
it's Bob Geldof!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

132
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:07,687
How are you? Have a seat. Sir Bob!

133
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,966
Great to have you here. Thank you.

134
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,846
Obviously, you've topped what used
to be called the hit parade,

135
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:20,646
you fed the world,
but what a lot of people don't know,
is that you built the M25.

136
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:25,526
I built the M23 and M25, Jeremy.

137
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:27,807
I didn't even know you
built the road to Gatwick as well.

138
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,006
If you know the Merstham interchange
where you come off the 23

139
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:36,766
onto the 25, that is more or less
were I had my road digging career.

140
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:42,846
And that is Geldof Corner.
I know you've got Gambon Corner,
which I'm sure we'll see later.

141
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:46,726
Geldof corner is there, hence the
tailbacks for miles on the M25.

142
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:51,166
So, when you go round that,
actually, it's one of the best
corners on the motorway network.

143
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,246
And you built that! I built that.

144
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:57,246
Long before I could drive a car,
they gave me the chance to

145
00:29:57,247 --> 00:30:03,086
drive these immense machines which
I think, it was 11 forward gears
and six reverses.

146
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:06,446
Two engines.
You've got two throttles,

147
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:08,647
you've got to sit like this with
both feet on the throttles,

148
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:11,846
and a big bucket in the middle,
which you drop, and off you go.

149
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:14,806
And is it hard? It's hard.
I was crap. Yes.

150
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:19,486
LAUGHTER
And so you ran over a herd
of cattle.

151
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:22,927
I ran over practically the
same thing,
a guy from the county council.

152
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,447
On the haul roads,
as they're called,

153
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:29,086
there are no other vehicles allowed.

154
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:32,206
And the county council guy was
nosing around there for some reason.

155
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,726
I came around the bend,
and here he was in his Renault 4L,

156
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:37,686
and he just saw this huge thing
and this 18-year-old without

157
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:42,726
a driving licence coming
down the track.

158
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:45,646
And I slammed on the brakes

159
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:50,326
and these huge tyres just rolled
over the front of the Renault,

160
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:54,886
the bonnet, and I saw the windscreen
pull away from the top

161
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:57,886
and just flatten the engine
and he was just like this.

162
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:00,766
I don't know what was happening in
the seat of his pants,

163
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:04,046
but I saw what was
happening to his face

164
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:06,487
and I thought he was dead,
I thought I'd killed him.

165
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:12,486
He got out. The foreman came gunning
up on his Land Rover and just, I
thought I was gone.

166
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:16,726
I was just on the way out,
and he was just SCREAMING at this
guy who got fired.

167
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:21,446
The council official got fired? Yes.
Well that saved the council
a few bob!

168
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,766
One of the things that I read about
your road building career

169
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,606
is that your nick name on the
site was Dublin.

170
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:28,686
Yes.

171
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:34,166
Wouldn't that apply to absolutely
everyone, also working on the site?!

172
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:38,006
No. Hey, Dublin! 5,000 people!
"What?!"

173
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:42,366
No, because there were two crowds,
essentially,

174
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,206
building the roads, certainly with
this construction company,

175
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,326
there was a West Country crowd and
there were as an Irish crowd.

176
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:51,566
It was like, I landed in India,
not that long back,

177
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,406
on an Air India flight, and there
were three other Air India flights,

178
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:57,246
and this is in India, and there was
a man at the barriers

179
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:00,046
with a sign saying, Mr Patel,
and I just thought,

180
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:02,487
that's not going to work, is it?!

181
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:07,886
It's the same as Dublin on this
site. What sort of driver are you?

182
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,766
Not good. Really, I'm not.

183
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:14,966
I've got a Previa, because I
had 600 children. And, you know...

184
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,526
And 900 names between them. Yes.
And all excellent.

185
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:22,606
And, you know, it's just,
a superb thing.

186
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,606
You're up high,
you have got this big, broad vision.

187
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:28,326
You go like this
and the wheel turns.

188
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:31,566
You've just got endless amount of
power in the thing.

189
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:35,446
There isn't an endless amount of
power in a Toyota Previa.

190
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:38,526
It's a horrible car.
No, it's not, it's really not.

191
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,366
I'm Mr Big on Toyota.

192
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:44,966
I've got a Lexus, so I don't pay
the congestion charge.

193
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:50,406
Oh, the hybrid one.
And also, Jeremy, I think you should
start now becoming a little

194
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:54,846
more environmentally aware.
You know.

195
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,486
I am very aware of the environment

196
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:02,286
and I'm still not interested in it.

197
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:06,446
You're a businessman now.
Sometimes.

198
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:10,846
And you've got a lot of TV
production companies. So, how much
time do you have left for music?

199
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:16,326
As most of the time, I do music,
so there's still a lot of the

200
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,366
time spent on the Africa stuff,
business stuff, music

201
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:23,806
and the family, but the only thing
I like doing, being specific,

202
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:26,606
the only thing that I like doing is
music. Really?

203
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:31,046
You're touring, soon, aren't you?
Yes. September and November here.

204
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:35,086
So, North and South. Because you
had the album out, what...?

205
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:36,607
Three months ago. Three months ago.

206
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:41,326
Which was Bob Geldof age, well, it's
actually, what was it, 58 and three
quarters? 58 and a half.

207
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:45,206
I was going to call it that,
and then I saw a book called How To

208
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:49,086
Compose Popular Songs That Will Sell
and I thought, that was more ironic.

209
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:51,046
It's a good title, that. Yes.

210
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:55,526
It doesn't fit on iTunes very
easily, how to, oh, there we go.

211
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:59,246
You released that three months ago.
Why, because you know how to use
iTunes?! I do!

212
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:02,926
What do you listen to in the car?
What do I listen to?

213
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:06,726
Rat Trap, I Don't Like Mondays.
Classics.

214
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:10,846
Classics from the late '70s.
Yes.

215
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:14,566
I presume you've got an iPhone
thing. No, I don't have that.

216
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:19,046
We spent about two hours before this
extolling the virtues of the
Nokia 6310.

217
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:23,166
Does anyone remember the 6310? Yeah.
Five days without a charge.

218
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:28,886
Well, that's how long I do,
because I've got no friends,
so nobody rings me up.

219
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:32,926
There's self-evident reasons.
The jeans, being one.

220
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:36,526
At least I put socks on!
No, he came here.

221
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:39,806
Look, I'm wearing a sock! But you
don't have beautiful ankles.

222
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:42,966
A beautiful turned ankle is
something that I admire in somebody.

223
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:48,367
Your lap, how did it go out there?

224
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:56,886
I am so crap at this. You start off,
and you're really nervous.

225
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,926
I'm not a speed head,
and then I start to enjoy it

226
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:04,206
and be able to focus on what the
Stig told me. And I slowed down.

227
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:08,046
Who would like to
see the lap? Not me.

228
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:11,086
Come on, let's have a look,
let's see how it went.

229
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,567
ENGINE REVS AND TYRES SCREECH

230
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,366
Come on. BLEEP.

231
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:22,926
Already, we need the bleep machine
there. Right, first corner.

232
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:28,087
Where are we going? Nice,
wide line, like the look of that.

233
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,446
Might be time to change gear.
So slow. Go, go.

234
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:36,686
You've got to change up.
Where are we going?

235
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:41,886
Oh, wide, you see, that's too fast.
That's skidding wide.

236
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:47,366
Clarkson, Stig said it's raining now
and the track is getting slippery,

237
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:51,766
so, that's going to slow me down,
so shut up, I'm not making excuses.

238
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:55,646
Let's have a look at this
torrential rain, yes,

239
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:59,287
I can see what the state means.
That's pouring down out there.

240
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:02,646
Wait, I don't mean pouring down,
do I?

241
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:05,526
It looks so slow
yet feels so fast.

242
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:09,286
No, that is just quite slow.
Change gear!

243
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:13,926
Take this extreme bend at
full throttle, which is frightening.

244
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:20,127
Oh, I say, that's good. Your
instinct tells you to slow down.

245
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:27,126
Ooh! You managed to stay off the
bumpy bit, there. This is the worst.

246
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:31,566
Gambon corner. 0h, it is the worst.
Absolutely awful. This is Gambon.

247
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,566
And you're... a little bit too slow.

248
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,926
Didn't use all of the road,
but never-the-less,

249
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,286
across the line!

250
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:41,247
APPLAUSE

251
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:51,366
Last. Where do we think?
Third last. Third last? Yeah.

252
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:56,166
What, Louie Spence speed?
Yeah. 1.53... No, that was wet.
Yours was dry.

253
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,126
These are all wet.
You need to be looking above them.

254
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:03,166
I know they are as people,
but with regards to...

255
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:07,126
So, anyway, Bob Geldof.
Don't say and I'll watch it at home.

256
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:12,806
I'm embarrassed. Seriously.
It was rubbish.
You did it... Look at him!

257
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:16,407
You did it in two minutes...

258
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:24,526
I'm joking. I fully expect that.

259
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:29,606
He was going, "Mmmm? Mmmm, really?"
One minute 40...

260
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:31,166
eight

261
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:36,206
point one. I don't think that is...

262
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,567
APPLAUSE

263
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,526
Faster than Jeff Goldblum!

264
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,446
Oh, God. Average at everything!

265
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,566
Well, not really. I was just
thinking, you're - what are you,

266
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,486
a Knight of the British Empire?
Mmm-hmm.

267
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:55,806
You were nominated
for a Nobel Peace Prize. Mmm-hmm.

268
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,886
And now, you are the 14th fastest
celebrity ever to go round

269
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:03,367
our track in a Kia Cee'd. You could
have walked faster than that.

270
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:10,206
Hands up those that think
you could do... who could be
in the top ten if you did it.

271
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,206
Come on, hands up if you think...

272
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,607
LAUGHTER

273
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:22,286
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
liars, Bob Geldof!

274
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:25,006
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

275
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:28,247
Well done. Thank you very much.
Bob Geldof, everybody!

276
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:38,086
How are we doing for time?
No, we're all right.
We're all right. Just press on.

277
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:40,206
Now, the other day,

278
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:43,926
we received a challenge from
the world demolition champions.

279
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:47,526
We're not actually making that up.
There really is such a championship!

280
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,886
There is, and they said to us
that they reckon
they could knock down

281
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,486
a row of houses
faster than we could.

282
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:56,326
So naturally, we were prepared
to accept this challenge,

283
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:58,806
but first, we thought we'd do
a bit of practice.

284
00:38:58,807 --> 00:39:02,526
So we got in touch with our
old friends in the Albanian Mafia

285
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:05,806
and asked them if they had anything
that needed knocking down.

286
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,167
Luckily, they said, "Yes!

287
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:10,446
"There's a man who annoyed us
very much indeed and it would be

288
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:14,006
"an enormous help if you would come
over and smash his house to bits."

289
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:15,647
So, we did.

290
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:24,087
This is the poor chap's house. This
is where he had obviously tripped up.

291
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,807
And these are the machines
we'd be using.

292
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:31,887
That there is a digger.

293
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:34,687
That is a bulldozer.

294
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:39,486
And that down there is
a big crane with the pecky thing
on the end of it.

295
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,767
Bagsy I have that, it's the biggest.
Bagsy I have the bulldozer.
I'm having it.

296
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:45,526
'With our choices carefully
worked out,

297
00:39:45,527 --> 00:39:47,726
'Jeremy was keen to get cracking...'

298
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,246
Come on! Go, go, go!

299
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:52,526
'..but I thought it best
we first examine the house.'

300
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:57,286
This building is basically
a steel-reinforced concrete frame...

301
00:39:57,287 --> 00:40:00,446
a series of uprights and then beams
joining them together...

302
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:04,406
and then all the gaps
are filled in with these things,
which are pot bricks.

303
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:07,846
These are not structural.
They're there simply to...

304
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:09,847
DRILLING

305
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:14,726
OK...

306
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:20,406
Ye-e-e-s! You are history!

307
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:23,247
Oi! Not yet!

308
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:30,886
'Throughout the rest of the day,
there were some issues.

309
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:35,086
'I, for example, was not
that accurate with the digger.'

310
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:38,967
Oh, no, no! Hang on, hang on.

311
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:42,727
CLUNK!
Oh, God!

312
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:46,087
'Jeremy nearly caused a power cut.

313
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:53,086
'And when Richard stopped off
in town to buy some tea,

314
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:57,926
'he got a bit confused
with all his lorry's levers.'

315
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:04,527
Do you do tea?
English breakfast tea for workers.

316
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:12,087
'But the biggest problem we had
was the house itself.'

317
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:16,927
Come on!

318
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:23,366
May? What? It won't fall down.
You try.

319
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:27,687
'If I'm honest,
that wasn't a great suggestion.

320
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:37,126
'Everything else we tried failed
as well.'

321
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,127
Back! Give it some welly.

322
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:43,006
THUD!

323
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:44,927
JEREMY SIGHS

324
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:50,886
'In fact, by the time Hammond
got back from clearing up his mess,

325
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:55,207
'it was almost dark and the house
was still pretty much intact.'

326
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,847
APPLAUSE

327
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,167
Baffling. Absolutely baffling.

328
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:13,406
Clearly, clearly, it wasn't our fault
that the house was still standing.

329
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,646
No, which left us
with two possibilities.

330
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:19,326
Either Albanian houses
are built superbly well,

331
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:24,646
which seems unlikely,
or those diggery things
and the pecky thing,

332
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:27,326
that equipment was no good.

333
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:31,446
We very quickly concluded that it
was the equipment that was no good.

334
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,646
So for our challenge
with the experts,

335
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:36,687
we decided
to use military equipment.

336
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:43,046
This is the Witham Army
Disposal Yard in Lincolnshire.

337
00:42:43,047 --> 00:42:45,527
It's a giant toy cupboard.

338
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:52,767
And everything you see here
is for sale.

339
00:42:54,647 --> 00:43:00,246
Can we use this to demolish
the house? No, you can't
use any weapons. Just the vehicle.

340
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:03,526
Hammond, the driving position
has got you in mind in a Scorpion.

341
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:07,726
Is that what this is?
Yeah. £30,000. That's what it costs.

342
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:13,166
Already, I'm seeing buildings just
fall down of their own free will.

343
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:16,606
Didn't James Blunt use one of these
in Kosovo? It's got peddles!

344
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,566
I thought he had a guitar.

345
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:21,766
It's the Stormer.
Yeah, the Stormer.

346
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:27,006
Come on. 20 grand, maximum. Stormer!
That's a good name. £20,000.

347
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:29,646
So this, or a Ford Focus.

348
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:34,846
Inside, there was more. And soon,
Hammond started to lose focus.

349
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:39,606
This is your absolutely bog standard
British Army Land Rover,

350
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:45,326
cupboard for either, like, you know,
parking ticket money or bullets.

351
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:51,966
Oh, he's found a Land Rover.
94,000 gentle miles. In a war zone.

352
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:55,006
Richard... not really what
we're looking for.

353
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,806
Please don't look at Land Rovers.
OK.

354
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,726
That's the fuselage of a Harrier.

355
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:04,006
These are fantastic.

356
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,766
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

357
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:09,566
Come on, chaps. Yeah, there's
nothing else to see in here.

358
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,206
HAMMOND SQUEALS

359
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:15,806
Oh, my... Bloody hell. OH!
Hammond's found the helicopters.

360
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:21,326
Gazelles. Hey! Oh! Well,
that's it. That's my life over.

361
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:26,326
'With both my colleagues now
otherwise engaged,
I went off on my own

362
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:31,727
'to find a vehicle that might be
suitable for our demolition
project.'

363
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,326
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Saxon.

364
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:42,046
It has an eight-litre,
six-cylinder diesel engine.

365
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,326
Top speed - 30 miles an hour.

366
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:48,687
Or 60 if the tyres
haven't been shot through.

367
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:53,846
It has all the things you need -
power steering, automatic gearbox,

368
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:58,167
selectable four-wheel drive,
grenade launchers.

369
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,967
Side windscreen wipers. Oh, yes.

370
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:07,886
'James, meanwhile, had decided
that a Willys Jeep would be ideal.

371
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:11,847
'Although he was finding it
quite difficult to explain why.'

372
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:16,006
RATTLING

373
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:18,086
Argh! Oh! Argh!

374
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:20,326
ARGH!

375
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:21,887
Argh! Argh!

376
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:29,246
The problem is that while you could
drive this through a hail
of petrol bombs

377
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:32,006
and small arms fire
and you'd be fine,

378
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:35,686
I'm not sure you could drive it
through a building.

379
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:37,366
Oh, Hammond!

380
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,847
HAMMOND LAUGHS

381
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,687
This is a 1977 Westland Gazelle
helicopter.

382
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:49,126
One of the fastest helicopters built.

383
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:50,966
Top speed - 193 miles an hour.

384
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:56,807
Ha-ha! We've got to get us one
of these. We need one of these.

385
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:02,766
Eventually, I nailed
some sense into my colleagues
and we all selected

386
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:07,366
the vehicles we'd be using
for the demolition challenge.

387
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:10,446
This is a 434
Armoured Recovery Vehicle.

388
00:46:10,447 --> 00:46:13,246
I've gone for it in this spec
because it's got a crane,

389
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,846
which could be very useful to us.

390
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:19,246
But if all else fails,
it weighs 15 tonnes,

391
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:22,566
so I could just use it
as a sort of battering ram.

392
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:27,166
As you would imagine,
mine is much bigger than Hammond's.
This is a CET...

393
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:31,166
a Combat Engineering Tractor. And
they're all very encouraging words.

394
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,446
It has a bucket on the front
and many other things besides.

395
00:46:34,447 --> 00:46:39,086
Unlike James's, mine is white.
It's also absolutely excellent.

396
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,366
The tiller on the front
is used for mine clearance,

397
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:46,646
but it can also be used
for pulling down houses.

398
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:49,046
In my mind. What?

399
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:52,406
Why is it white? United Nations. Ah!

400
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:55,646
Yes, this very vehicle has just
come back from the Middle East

401
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,926
where it cleared 100
anti-tank mines.

402
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:02,246
It's kind of focused on one thing,
isn't it? Mine clearance.

403
00:47:02,247 --> 00:47:06,246
It is a mine clearing...
You aren't clearing mines.

404
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:07,727
We are knocking a house down.

405
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:10,646
You've focused on one thing
and we are not doing that thing.

406
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:13,646
It's a very, very specialised
piece of equipment.

407
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:16,726
This... Incredibly specialised -
the cab is on hydraulic rams.

408
00:47:16,727 --> 00:47:19,806
Mmm. It senses your weight,
raises it to the correct height,

409
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:23,686
so that if
there's a blast underneath,
you're cushioned from that blast.

410
00:47:23,687 --> 00:47:26,926
Again, amazing. But it won't be,
cos we're not clearing a minefield.

411
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,007
We're knocking houses down.

412
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:30,806
You wait till you see
what happens to a house

413
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:34,166
when it is presented with THIS
moving at 400 rpm.

414
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:37,486
If the house explodes,
you'll be OK, but that's about it.

415
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:41,206
It just goes around doing this...
It's like a mechanical cat.

416
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:44,726
It's a military machine
with some white paint on it.
It isn't military!

417
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:48,206
It's for clearance and saving lives.
Princess Diana had one of these.

418
00:47:48,207 --> 00:47:50,647
LAUGHTER

419
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,206
The location for our
demolition challenge was

420
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:58,206
the Christian Fields housing estate
in Kent.

421
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,606
Each team would have to knock down
six houses

422
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:02,766
and the professionals rocked up
on the day

423
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,686
with a selection of
conventional equipment

424
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:08,167
that we knew would not work.

425
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:15,286
As a result, they would be
humiliated by Team Top Gear.

426
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:18,527
MILITARY MUSIC

427
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,127
HE HUMS

428
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:33,607
What a machine this is.

429
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:36,686
1,300 RPM.

430
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:40,047
I'm doing very nearly
the top speed of six.

431
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:44,526
'The other machines
were considerably faster,

432
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:47,406
'so in order
not to keep the chaps waiting,

433
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:50,006
'I decided to take a shortcut.'

434
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:53,926
I think he thought, "The things
on the front go round
and smash everything.

435
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:55,526
"I work for the United Nations."

436
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:58,086
He failed to work out
it'll be the slowest..
BANGING

437
00:48:58,087 --> 00:49:00,486
You don't suppose
by any chance that...

438
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:02,287
CRASHING

439
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,926
Ladies and gentlemen, Jeremy
Clarkson, sometimes known as

440
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:11,846
the silver-tongued
cavalier of the Cotswolds.
I hope that was to come down.

441
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:16,726
'Before starting, the professionals
had a pre-demolition briefing.'

442
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:23,126
All the works today are going to be
carried out under BSEN 6187
demolition code of practice.

443
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,566
Richard, can you hand out the method
statements to all the guys, please

444
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:29,366
and the risk assessments? Yup.

445
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:33,406
'Mostly, they talked about
health and safety,
so we thought we should, too.'

446
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:36,166
Don't have an accident.
Don't have an accident.

447
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:39,446
If you DO have an accident,
remember it was an accident.

448
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:43,206
'Briefing over,
we got on with discussing the job.'

449
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:46,206
Why don't you do those, James? OK.

450
00:49:46,207 --> 00:49:50,886
Hammond, you do the cream ones, and
I'll do this lot. That make sense?

451
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,367
Two houses each then, effectively?
Effectively.

452
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:59,526
'With all the complicated maths out
of the way, it was time to begin.'

453

KLAXON BLARES

454
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:14,486
OK. Brace, Brace, brace.
We're going in.

455
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:16,726
Look at his...
He's concentrating like mad.

456
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:19,447
He looks like a proper orangutan
when he concentrates.

457
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:23,927
Firing up the rotors!

458
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:29,646
Oh God!

459
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:32,406
Ooh-hoo hoo-hoo-hoo!

460
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:33,646
Woah!

461
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:35,607
Ha-ha!

462
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:40,606
Why didn't we have this in Albania!?

463
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:41,927
Goodbye, lavatory!

464
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:45,446
Bricks flying everywhere.

465
00:50:45,447 --> 00:50:47,607
This is bloody brilliant.

466
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:53,726
Stop there, stop there! Jeremy,
the roof's going to land on it.

467
00:50:53,727 --> 00:50:58,766
'This was no problem
because my destroyer of worlds

468
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:01,487
'had a special device
for protecting the driver.'

00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:08,166
Is that... a remote control for that?
Yes, it is!

470
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:11,486
You can drive the whole thing
from there? Yes. From there? Yes.

471
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,286
Do you know how to?
No. But how hard can it be?

472

Woo-hoo-hoo. Look at that.
Oh, my God!

474
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:22,526
Now, stand back a bit.
Really? Do you think? Good idea.

475
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:23,887
Ooh. Argh, argh, argh!

476
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:32,006
'At the other end of the estate,

working methodically.

big harpoon. I'll fire that over

Brilliant.

Let's begin.

485
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:06,726
The grappling hook will catch on the
roof. That's it. It's caught it now.

486
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:09,087
Yeah. Here it comes.
Pulling the roof off.

487
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,567
Let's have a look.

488
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:18,206
It's not off.

489
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:22,247
'On the plus side, though, the house
now had another upstairs lavatory.'

490
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,007
Why have you pulled a portaloo
over a building?

491
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,527
It was supposed to pull the roof off.
This isn't demolition,
this is just stupid.

persevered with his idiotic

running across, like that.

00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:58,847
Oh! Oh, it's so close.

511
00:54:01,687 --> 00:54:04,567
Yes. Yes! Ha-ha ha!

512
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:10,647
'But despite this success,
let's not forget we still had
Jeremy on our side.'

513
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:19,287
I've lost control completely now.

514
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:26,846
'In the spirit of teamwork,
I decided to clear up his rubbish

515
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,806
'while Hammond set about
finishing off my house.'

516
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:33,647
I think I'll need to give this
the beans. Let's not mess about here.
In we go.

517
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:45,126
Oh! The roof came open.
I didn't expect that.

518
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:50,086
Hammond, what's happened here, mate,
is you are now the foundations of
the house.

519
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:52,846
Um, I think I might be a bit stuck.

520
00:54:52,847 --> 00:54:54,607
Hang on, Hammond. I'm coming.

521
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,126
Where are you going?

522
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:02,647
BANGING AND CRASHING

523
00:55:05,447 --> 00:55:07,527
Oh dear.

524
00:55:08,647 --> 00:55:11,166
That felt nasty. What happened then?

525
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:15,487
James crashed into the corner
of the house and now you've got
a whole house on your head.

526
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:17,846
ENGINE STARTS

527
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,887
Engine running.

528
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:25,166
'May then winched
Hammond's tank out...

529
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:28,087
'but Hammond himself
was still trapped inside.

530
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:32,286
'Happily, though, as I'd finally
house-trained my machine...'

531
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:36,246
Walkies. Yes! Good digger.

532
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:38,647
'..I was able to mount a rescue.'

533
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:41,846
BLEEP!

534
00:55:41,847 --> 00:55:43,007
Bad digger!

535
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:52,327
Oh! I've scratched me tank.
JEREMY LAUGHS

536
00:55:54,447 --> 00:55:58,247
'By now, the professionals
had pulled out an enormous lead.

537
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:04,166
'So, to try and catch up,
I decided to dig even deeper

538
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:06,686
'into the military toy box.'

539
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:09,686
Guys. What...? What on Earth
is that?

540
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:11,806
I put some explosives in the house.

541
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:14,726
You might want to stand back.

542
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:17,847
Because now I'm going to do...
the long walk.

543
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:27,287
Is that the suit or his piles
that's making him walk like that?

544
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:34,247
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

545
00:56:39,807 --> 00:56:43,247
You've only
blown the bloody door off!

546
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:45,367
'After that failure,

547
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:49,446
'we decided just to use
our machines as battering rams.'

548
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,326
DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS

549
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:53,567
Come on. Let's just
get this job done.

550
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:04,247
Not going to use the rotavator.
It's just TOO perilous.

551
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:11,046
Bloody hell fire! Ha-ha!

552
00:57:11,047 --> 00:57:12,206
Argh!

553
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:14,447
DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS

554
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:20,287
Go on. In you go.

555
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:24,926
ARGH!

556
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:27,806
'Finally, we were
really getting somewhere.'

557
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,486
Attack!

558
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:32,367
KLAXON BLARES

559
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:38,086
'The professionals had finished.
They had knocked everything down.

560
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,967
'Whereas we... sort of hadn't.'

561
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:46,366
Why don't we present them
with a prize, OK... Yeah...

562
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:51,286
standing just there? Yes. That's a
good idea. And then give them
a really loud round of applause.

563
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:54,766
A thunderous, "WELL DONE, WELL DONE!"
And throw the thing over...

564
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:55,806
APPLAUSE

565
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:59,887
Well done. You beat us
fair and square. Well done.

566
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:04,126
Can we just point out something very
important?

567
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:08,606
Well, as long as you're quick,
bike race. I know, I know, I know.

568
00:58:08,607 --> 00:58:13,526
Now you're wasting time saying,
"I know". I know. I know. Say it.
Listen...

569
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:17,686
OK, you may have noticed
during that whole sequence
of knocking the houses down,

570
00:58:17,687 --> 00:58:21,726
not one of us was wearing
a high-visibility jacket,
a hard hat or substantial shoes

571
00:58:21,727 --> 00:58:24,926
and I think I'm right in saying
that none of us was killed.
LAUGHTER

572
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:28,726
And that is an excellent bombshell
on which we could end, so... No.

573
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:31,167
No, no, no. I want to talk
more about the machine.

574
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:34,966
No, I said in the film
that this very machine, in fact,

575
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:37,046
had cleared 100 anti-tank mines.

576
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:40,206
You're probably thinking,
"How does it survive?" Not really.

577
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:44,686
I'm going to explain anyway, OK?
This is one of the blades
as it comes out the factory, yeah?

578
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,126
This one hit an anti-tank mine,

579
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:50,206
a mine designed to blow up a tank,

580
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:54,046
and that is the only damage
that it did.

581
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:57,606
This is an astonishing piece of
British engineering, I think.

582
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:01,007
It is. We really must finish. What
are they going to do? Cut us o...?

583
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:03,526
Oh, they have.

584
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,246
Well, they were warned.

585
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:07,607
So, as the guys have been telling
you all programme,

586
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:10,006
Don't miss live coverage
of the MotoGP at ten,

587
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:13,006
but before that, the
Final Mission of the Space Shuttle,

588
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,047
on the way next on BBC2.
