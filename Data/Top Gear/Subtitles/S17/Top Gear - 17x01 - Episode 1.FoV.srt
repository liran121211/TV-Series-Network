1
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:15,413
Tonight, Richard Hammond
buys a cup of coffee.

2
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:19,293
James May slips on some snow.
I hate snow.

3
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:22,494
And we show a picture
of Steve McQueen.

4
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:35,933
Hello! Hello, everybody. We're back!

5
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:40,613
Thank you so much. Thank you.

6
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:46,093
It is a whole new series
featuring many things.

7
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:52,053
We go to Las Vegas, Italy,
Monte Carlo, Albania,
Loughborough...

8
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:58,453
But we start tonight
with General Motors,
which is a big company in America.

9
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:04,853
Many people say that last year they
stopped making the Hummer because
it was too big and too silly.

10
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:12,534
However, Richard Hammond says
the reason it's gone west is because
it wasn't big or silly enough.

11
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,613
This is one of the deceased Hummers.

12
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,133
The H3.

13
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:31,573
And it is, you'll notice,
a pretty sizable car.

14
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:34,773
However, if you mourn its passing,

15
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:39,094
don't worry because happily you can
now buy something a bit bigger.

16
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:49,133
It's called the Marauder,
which is quite a scary sounding name.

17
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:52,773
But, hey, Buttercup didn't feel
quite right so, hey, live with it.

18
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:57,693
I can't imagine it ever having
one of those Christian fish symbols
on the back bumper.

19
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:02,933
The Marauder, which is built in
South Africa, weighs ten tonnes.

20
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:08,493
It's also 21 feet long
and 9 feet high.

21
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,014
So in traffic
it does tend to stand out a bit.

22
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,493
Ooh, don't people
get out of your way!

23
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:24,014
Don't they!

24
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:28,133
Yeah! Hmm...

25
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:35,133
Tell you what, you do get some people
telling you about how they feel
a bit nervous in Johannesburg.

26
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,654
I er... I don't, no! I don't.

27
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:45,053
It's a weird feeling because
I'm both worried about bumping
into things because it's big,

28
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,333
and NOT worried about
bumping into things

29
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,374
because, well, frankly, who cares?

30
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:59,373
Like the original Hummer, the
Marauder is a military-spec vehicle
that ordinary civilians can buy.

31
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:01,733
All you have to do is
pass a background check

32
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:06,573
to prove you're not a villain
living in a hollowed-out volcano,

33
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:10,014
and come up with
a cheque for £300,000.

34
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:14,933
That is Rolls Royce Phantom money,

35
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:18,933
for a machine that's not exactly
the last word in luxury.

36
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,653
Take the back seats, for instance.

37
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:24,093
There are eight of them,
which is good,

38
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:28,293
but I don't think you'll be
renting this out
as a wedding car any day soon.

39
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:35,253
And as for the dashboard, they
clearly decided not to go for the
walnut and leather option on here,

40
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:38,133
partly because they need to
leave room for the switches,

41
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,254
partly because the wood might clash
with the machine guns.

42
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:48,413
However, the Marauder
does compensate in other areas.

43
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:52,733
Take this annoying slow traffic
that I'm stuck in now.

44
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:58,093
Normally this is where you need
some expensive sat-nav system
to give you alternative routes.

45
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:00,974
The Marauder doesn't need sat-nav.

46
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:10,854
There you go. There you go.

47
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,174
Oh, yeah!

48
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:19,774
It really does control
its immense weight very well.

49
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:22,654
Yes!

50
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:29,934
It really is like offroading
quite a large building.

51
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:34,094
Right, now...

52
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,974
That gap's big enough.

53
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,334
I-It is now.

54
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:52,854
Oh, Lord!

55
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,294
This is a good town car.

56
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:16,214
In fact, the Marauder has several
benefits as a city runabout.

57
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:23,254
Imagine, for example, that you nip
off to get a coffee and this happens.

58
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:31,133
Oh! That's not nice, no.

59
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:36,693
Now, normally the towaway people
leave you powerless and penniless,

60
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:38,493
but not this time.

61
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:42,293
The Marauder has got
290 brake horsepower

62
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:46,133
and a top speed of just 70 mph,
which admittedly isn't brilliant.

63
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:49,613
However, the torque figure
is astonishing...

64
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:53,933
1,100 Newton metres of it,
which is... a lot.

65
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:57,774
And that makes it pretty good
in a towaway tug-of-war.

66
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,174
We're going this way.

67
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,774
Yes, there you go.

68
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,453
Another everyday irritation,

69
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:23,653
popping into the supermarket

70
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:27,653
and coming out
to find yourself blocked in. Again,

71
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:32,053
no problem for the Marauder, thanks
to its vertical climbing system.

72
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:36,893
Low range, four-wheel drive,
div lock,

73
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,654
drive, handbrake off.

74
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:13,014
It's really kind of
the ideal shopping car.

75
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:20,853
But let's not get carried away
because, like everything,

76
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:23,093
the Marauder has its weak points.

77
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:26,173
Visiting a drive-through,
for example.

78
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:29,613
Normally at about this point
you'd roll down the windows

79
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:32,733
and get ready to say,
"Cheeseburger and chips, please."

80
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:37,453
But the problem is the Marauder's
windows are for tough situations,

81
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:42,013
they're 90 mm thick.
They can shrug off an RPG

82
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:45,814
and as a result you can't open them,
so this is where
it gets a bit awkward.

83
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:53,053
Good morning,
can I take your order please?

84
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,693
Hello? If you're there...

85
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:58,613
I'd like a
cheeseburger and some chips, please.

86
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:01,173
This isn't a riot situation,
don't be alarmed.

87
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:07,294
But the real problem comes when you
drive around to collect your order.

88
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:10,134
Right.

89
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:14,174
Don't be alarmed, I'm not shooting.

90
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:24,053
So, a mark against
the Marauder there.

91
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:29,133
And if you happen to
visit a safari park...

92
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,814
you might find that the windscreen
wipers aren't that tough.

93
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:39,294
But is this the only weak spot?
Let's see.

94
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:46,933
Now, this is where we're going to
do a little test you won't find

95
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:52,373
in the NCAP ratings, and we start
not with this but with that.

96
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:54,534
Our old friend, the Hummer...

97
00:08:57,614 --> 00:09:02,734
whose underside was packed with
seven pounds of plastic explosive.

98
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,293
Oh, dear.

99
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:12,053
Really not much point trying to
see if it'll start because some
pretty important bits are missing.

100
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:17,813
So the H3 is, like Hummer itself,
very dead.

101
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:21,693
But the important question is
what happens to the Marauder

102
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,614
when you put the same amount
of explosives underneath it?

103
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,173
Right, well, clearly, what has
happened here is there was a fight

104
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:53,893
between the Marauder and the earth,
and the earth lost and the explosives
have just dug a big hole.

105
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,813
The question is,
can it still be driven?

106
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:02,373
OK, fingers crossed.

107
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,053
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

108
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:12,054
That was definitely an inconvenience
but really nothing more.

109
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,934
Oh, yeah.

110
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,173
Good car.

111
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:38,814
It was great.

112
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,493
Useful bit of consumer advice there.

113
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:46,013
Can I just say, though,
I was looking carefully.

114
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:52,173
The last little bit there as it came
out of the hole, I noticed the rear
tyre had been blown off the rim.

115
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:55,813
Seven pounds of plastic explosive and
all it did was below the tyre off.

116
00:10:55,814 --> 00:11:00,693
But a car with the tyre blown off
is as useless as a car that has
been blown to smithereens, really.

117
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,733
Well, no, seven pounds...
He's right because it's like saying,

118
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:06,533
"My watch survived the explosion
completely unscathed.

119
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,814
"The hour hand has come off,
but apart from that..."

120
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:12,733
It's like saying, "I survived
the explosion apart from my head,
which is over there."

121
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:16,093
Would you two please
just stop saying things?

122
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,973
I think it's an excellent car,
and now the news.

123
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:22,733
Yes, news. Yes, it's the news. For
people who think there's literally

124
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:29,653
too much room in the back of a
standard Mini, don't worry because
there's now a coupe. There it is.

125
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,893
Whoa-ho-ho!

126
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:38,373
Any details? I can tell you it's, er...
It's between £18,000 and £24,000

127
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,973
and the top model
has 208 horsepower.

128
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,853
A lot of people have been talking
about its roof, unsurprisingly.

129
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:52,013
Mini themselves say it's styled
to look like a baseball cap
being worn backwards.

130
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:53,494
Why would I want that as my roof?

131
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:56,773
I think this is a car
that, probably, at night
when you leave it,

132
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:59,254
entertains itself by
spitting at the elderly.

133
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,093
They should have called it the Lout.
The Slob.

134
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:07,093
Steal its own wheels
and put itself on bricks.

135
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:11,173
I like the idea of the Slob. Now,
hey, you know when you're pregnant?

136
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:15,334
Er, no. No.
Yours is coming on nicely.

137
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:19,973
And you go for a scan and
they're able to tell the sex? Yes.

138
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:23,893
Well a very kind lady has sent us a
photograph of a scan she's had done

139
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:31,293
of her forthcoming arrival,
and it seems to suggest she's
giving birth to a Stig. Look here.

140
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:35,053
She is! Oh, look!

141
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,693
All curled up, that's nice.

142
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:42,093
We're worried about this because
we've told him time and again
to stop impregnating people.

143
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:46,813
It's awkward. He made Michael Gambon
pregnant twice.

144
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:51,213
If there's any consolation,
it'll probably be a fairly
quick birth, I imagine.

145
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:54,053
Unless it comes out sideways,
like that.

146
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:58,333
Good news! Actually, it's not
good news, it's just some news, OK?

147
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,293
MG is back.
This is the new car, here he is.

148
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:06,093
It's called the MG 6, you can have
it as a saloon or as a hatchback.

149
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:09,013
It's supposed to be very modern
in every way but I don't think

150
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:15,093
the factory where it's being made in
Longbridge is modern at all because
I've got the press release

151
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:21,653
they sent out here and it says the
first car was driven off the line
by the only woman who works there.

152
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:24,773
That's not very modern, is it? No.
Did they go on to say,

153
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:27,493
"And best of all she has a
smashing pair of knockers!"?

154
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:28,853
Very modern.

155
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:32,053
Don't tell me. It says next,
"Don't worry, chaps, we'll let her

156
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:36,733
"drive it off but we won't let her
park it." Oh, God! Welcome to 1950!

157
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:41,214
The thing is, the car has gone away
for some reason. That's not a joke.

158
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:48,613
The thing about this is, OK,
we know this is made in China

159
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,813
by the lin-king wan-king
don-king non-king...

160
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:56,893
Them. Yeah. Them. Keep going.

161
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:59,493
Heavy corporation
industry, right, OK?

162
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:03,933
It's shipped over to Birmingham,
where they fix an MG
badge on it and sell it.

163
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:06,653
But they say in the actual
brochure, which I've got here,

164
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,813
it talks about Le Mans
and breaking land speed records.

165
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:13,493
It says the MG embodies
British sporting style.

166
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:15,973
It doesn't. No, it doesn't.

167
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:20,093
I think the only British sportiness
in that is the glue they use

168
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:24,973
to fix on the badge is made
from a dead British racehorse.

169
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:28,453
That's the only sporty
thing in that car, I reckon.

170
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:32,373
Wait a minute.
I should add, the press release
they sent us has got a typo on it.

171
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:36,213
Here it is, look. "Ear"?

172
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:40,573
MG ear. I think this indicates
the car will be a bit hit.

173
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:44,453
It might be complete rap.

174
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,013
Absolute ollocks!

175
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:48,533
Yes.

176
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:52,173
Now, I've always wondered, I've
always thought there was someone

177
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:56,573
in Britain now driving
around in, let's just say,
a Renault Fuego Turbo. OK?

178
00:14:56,574 --> 00:15:02,733
How do they know that's
not the last Renault Fuego Turbo
in the whole country?

179
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:07,053
Well now there's a website
called howmanyleft.co.uk,

180
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:11,293
where you can go on it and find out
precisely how many examples

181
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,453
of each model are left
in existence, OK?

182
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,253
It's unbelievable.

183
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:19,533
So how many Fuego Turbos are there?
I went on it, there were three.

184
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,013
Just three?
There were only three Fuego Turbos.

185
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:26,293
That makes them really special.
It's an incredibly rare car.

186
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:31,813
No, I went on it, and did you know -
because somebody doesn't - there's
somebody driving around

187
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:39,453
in an Austin Maxi 1750 automatic
and probably doesn't realise
it's the last one?

188
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:43,093
Only one Maxi 1750... One.
He's not here, are you?

189
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:48,413
It's a Maxi 1750 automatic and it's
unique. Still crap though, isn't it?

190
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,213
It's terrible. It's uniquely crap
because there's only one.

191
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:56,893
Whenever we're told
there's one Amazonian
green-backed nose turtle left...

192
00:15:56,894 --> 00:16:00,133
God, is there? We're all supposed
to have these candlelit vigils

193
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:06,013
and eat mud and not drive cars
and turn our central heating down to
save it because it's going extinct.

194
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:11,133
There's only one Vauxhall Chevette
GL automatic left, that's it.

195
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,413
There's only one left. Look at it!

196
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:16,493
What's being done to save this car?

197
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:20,213
I put it to you,
nothing is being done.

198
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:25,373
Actually, in the Victorian era,
chaps used to go off, when something
was about to become extinct,

199
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:29,693
they would go off, find it
and shoot it as a trophy.

200
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:34,533
"The very last one, blam! Ha-ha!"
And then nail its head to the wall.

201
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,293
Are you suggesting
then we go out and hunt?

202
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:41,333
Yes, nail its head to our wall in
here. The last Chevette, like that.

203
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,093
We've just thought of something to
do in programme six of this show.

204
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:50,533
We're going hunting the Chevette
GL automatic. It's out there.

205
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:54,973
Moving on, there was a poll recently
to find the most important car

206
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:59,573
from the 20th century,
and I went for the Golf GTi

207
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:04,373
because it was fast
and practical, and classless.

208
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:09,653
And it's been much the same story
with all the models that have
come along subsequently.

209
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:15,693
But none of them have ever
managed to capture, somehow,
the magic of the original.

210
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:17,374
Until now.

211
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:29,453
Now, I'll admit
it's not actually a GTi

212
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:31,133
or a Golf,

213
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,454
or even a Volkswagen.

214
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:38,574
What it is a BMW - the new 1M.

215
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:48,813
What BMW has done to create this
is take a standard one-series
and pump it up a bit.

216
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:56,014
The wheel arches are flared, the car
is slightly lowered, and, at the
back, there are extra pooh chutes.

217
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:02,693
Inside, there's a splash of suede on
the dash with some orange stitching.

218
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:06,053
Otherwise, it's humdrum, normal.

219
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,654
Not showy at all.

220
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:15,614
Apart from the orange paint,
you simply wouldn't guess
that it can do this.

221
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:26,694
Whoo! Whoo, yes!
Blimey, this is good.

222
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,213
So what have we got here?

223
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:36,213
Well, there's a straight-six
engine at the front,

224
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:40,853
a manual gearbox in the middle,
and drive goes to the back.

225
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:46,974
That's page one, chapter one
from the petrosexual handbook.

226
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:57,254
It just feels so...
beautifully balanced.

227
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:04,413
Of course, all BMW M cars
feel this way, they just feel

228
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:09,493
better than Mercs,
better than Audis,
better than pretty much anything.

229
00:19:09,494 --> 00:19:14,773
And just when you think it can't
possibly get any better than this,

230
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:18,174
you push the little
M button on the steering wheel...

231
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:21,813
and the whole car shimmies.

232
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,173
It's like a shiver of excitement.

233
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:31,694
The feeling you get if someone
suddenly gave you permission to set
fire to Piers Morgan. Ooh, yes! Ooh!

234
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:38,414
In M mode, it's even more
of a tyre-smoking mentalist.

235
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:48,613
Honestly, I haven't driven anything

236
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,293
this sort of perfect since...

237
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:54,574
I don't know, since the original
Golf GTi, in fact.

238
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:05,973
And what makes that quite surprising
is that the 1M is like a turkey
curry on Boxing Day.

239
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:08,694
It's made from leftovers.

240
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:13,213
The door mirrors
are from the current M3,

241
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:16,853
the rear axle is from the old one,

242
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,453
the engine is from a Z4.

243
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:22,933
It's a recipe that shouldn't work,
but it does.

244
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,934
As we shall now see.

245
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:34,813
What we have here is a new, lighter,
more powerful Porsche, the Cayman R.

246
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:40,013
And this is the new supercharged
Lotus Evora S.

247
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:43,893
Both these no-compromise
ground-huggers are purpose-built

248
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:49,773
to go like hell, so they should
cream the sit-up-and-beg Beemer.

249
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:54,693
However, while the three-litre
engine in this is from a Z4,

250
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:59,734
it's boosted to 340 horsepower
with two tiny little turbochargers.

251
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:10,214
So, let's see how we get on.

252
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:26,133
So, £50,000 Porsche, £60,000 Lotus,

253
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:33,134
and the £40,000 BMW is showing them
its many pooh chutes! Ho-ho-ho!

254
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:41,934
A bit depressing if
you've just bought a Lotus.

255
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:46,693
And there's more.

256
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:53,333
The Porsche and the Lotus are
effectively two-seaters and there's
hardly any luggage space at all.

257
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:56,173
You get the speed at a price.

258
00:21:56,174 --> 00:22:00,293
But there's no price to
pay with the 1M.

259
00:22:00,294 --> 00:22:06,493
There's space in the back
for two children,
and room in the boot for two more.

260
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:08,694
It's a family saloon.

261
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:19,053
This, then, does to today's sports
cars what the original Golf GTi did
to the MG and the Triumph Spitfire.

262
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:22,534
It renders them... pointless.

263
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,934
Drawbacks?

264
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:30,893
Pfff, erm...

265
00:22:30,894 --> 00:22:37,533
Maybe the sat-nav screen is a bit
far away, and perhaps the ride

266
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:44,373
is a tad firm, but that said
it's not as uncomfortable
as my AMG Mercedes.

267
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:49,293
Actually, falling down a
flight of stairs isn't as
uncomfortable as my Mercedes.

268
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:53,694
Sustained machine-gun fire
would be better than
popping to the shops in that.

269
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:59,733
And anyway, you won't really
notice the stiff suspension,
partly because the seats

270
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:06,454
are so comfortable
and partly because you'll
be having such a good time.

271
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:14,254
This is a brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant car,

272
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:20,214
and that's all, really,
I've got to say. The end.

273
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:36,094
Unbelievably good.

274
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:42,613
It's one of the most spectacular
cars I've driven in a long time.

275
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:46,133
Fair enough, but hang on,
hang on, hang on!

276
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:49,013
£40,000 for a one-series!

277
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,893
I'm sorry, were you not listening?

278
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:55,653
I just said it's a brilliant
car and that was the end.
There was nothing more to say.

279
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:58,893
Yes, but that's a big price tag.
There's nothing more to say.

280
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:02,133
But there's something more to do.
We have to find out how fast it goes

281
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:06,413
round our track and that of course
means handing it over to our
tame racing driver.

282
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:10,573
Some say he doesn't know what
dogs are for, and that he recently

283
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,853
took out a super-injunction to
prevent us from revealing that he...

284
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,774
with an enormous goat.

285
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:26,334
All we know is he's called The Stig.

286
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:31,933
And he's off.
Wipers on, it's drizzling out there.

287
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,293
Hopefully that won't
hurt the time too badly.

288
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:37,693
Let's see, coming up
to the first corner.

289
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:40,413
Very tidy on the way in,

290
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:43,693
tidy through the middle,
tail out, there it is.

291
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:46,693
The limited slip diff
allowing him perfect control.

292
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,453
♪ Ro-mah, rom-ma-ma

293
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,694
♪ Gaga, ooh la... ♪

294
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:55,453
For some reason the Stig is
listening to Lady Gaga in French.

295
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:59,613
Weird. OK, tidy through Chicago now,
down to Hammerhead.

296
00:24:59,614 --> 00:25:02,133
I have a sneaking suspicion
BMW have tried to

297
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:06,373
make this car slow so it doesn't go
faster than the more expensive M3.

298
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,293
Look at that,
tail really out there.

299
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:12,254
Stig looking where he's
going out of the side windows.

300
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,933
OK, follow-through.

301
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,173
He's even sideways through that.

302
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:26,853
BMW only bringing 450 1Ms to
Britain, 300 of them already sold.

303
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:32,933
OK, hard on the brakes, penultimate
corner, still very greasy out there.

304
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:36,134
Into Gambon and there he is
across the line.

305
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:41,493
I have the time here.

306
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:45,213
It did it in 1 minute 25 dead

307
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:50,093
so, even though it was a damp track,
it was faster than an M3.

308
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:55,093
Very good, but hang on, because I
think there was a bit of film there
we didn't see. No, there wasn't.

309
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:59,573
There was, from the final run.
I think the audience would like
to see it. No, they wouldn't.

310
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:02,133
Yes, they would. Let's have a look.

311
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:04,573
There he is, you see,
just past the tyres.

312
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:08,333
He's doing about 115 mph and,
oh, look, it's spat him off!

313
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,213
But even on the wet grass
it's still in shape.

314
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:14,813
No, that's just how good
The Stig is, not the car, you fool.

315
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:18,093
- It spat him off.
- Oooh!

316
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:22,414
Big price, small car,
big price, fell off.

317
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:29,973
Now time to put a star in
our reasonably priced car.

318
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:32,693
My guest tonight was
christened Vincent

319
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:40,373
but then he became a rock star
and decided he needed a rock-starry
name so he changed it to Alice.

320
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:44,854
Ladies and gentlemen, we're not
worthy. Please welcome Alice Cooper!

321
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,093
I can hardly believe you're here.

322
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:54,773
Alice Cooper!

323
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:58,094
A legend. Have a seat.

324
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:01,453
Thank you.

325
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,013
Why is it Alice?

326
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:05,733
Why Alice? You know,

327
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:10,093
you had to come up with a name
that was going to piss off
every parent in America.

328
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:16,453
It translated across the ocean so,
you know, and Mary Whitehouse just
hated us. Because you were banned.

329
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:20,853
Oh yes, she banned us for no apparent
reason but it was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

330
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:25,213
School's Out came out, we went
right to number one, sold out...

331
00:27:25,214 --> 00:27:29,933
Because the British public said,
"How dare you tell us what we
can see and what we can't see!"

332
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:34,773
So the British public was all for us
but there was the one lady
and we sent her flowers...

333
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:40,173
Mary Whitehouse - in essence,
she was the Daily Mail but
in a pearl necklace really.

334
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:41,933
She was a terrifying woman.

335
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:45,093
It was the stage shows, I think,
that made everybody say,

336
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:47,893
"Hang on a minute,
why are these people coming here?"

337
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:52,053
There was the story, which
I don't believe is true,
that you ripped a chicken in half.

338
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:56,013
No, that was Colonel Sanders.
Made a chicken die anyway.

339
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:58,973
Somebody threw a chicken on stage
in the middle of a concert.

340
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:04,373
I'm from Detroit, I've never been on
a farm in my life, so I picked it up.

341
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:06,814
It had feathers,
it was a bird, it should fly.

342
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:14,293
I threw it and it didn't fly
as much as it plummeted

343
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:17,693
into the audience,
and the audience tore it to pieces.

344
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:22,533
Then the next day
it was "Alice Cooper rips
a chicken apart and eats it."

345
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:27,773
Because in your shows,
you often got decapitated, hung.

346
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,893
I got killed four times in my
last show, but I play the villain.

347
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:34,893
I always play the villain, so
the villain has to get it in the end.

348
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:37,893
The Darth Vader, the Hannibal Lecter,
always has to get it in the end.

349
00:28:37,894 --> 00:28:40,134
So when's the next time
we can see you in the UK?

350
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,493
We'll be here in Halloween, of course
because I own Halloween, it's mine.

351
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:48,013
It is. The Prince of Darkness. We're
doing a big show at the Ally Pally.

352
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:50,414
I think it's kind of interesting,
Alice at the Palace.

353
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:52,533
Will you be killed many times?

354
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:56,533
Just once in this show, one good one.

355
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,533
Although you've been killed many
times, obviously on stage,

356
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:05,733
you didn't die in the '60s and '70s
when so many of your
contemporaries did.

357
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:11,093
Yeah, well my big brothers were Keith
Moon, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix.

358
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:13,653
I can go right down the list
of everyone that died

359
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:17,853
at 27 years old, and I was the little
brother trying to keep up with them.

360
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:22,773
It almost got me.
Who was the biggest?
Nobody can compete with Keith Moon.

361
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:25,813
I've heard this many times,
that Keith Moon was the maddest.

362
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:28,653
If you think of it this way,
about 40% of what you've heard

363
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:33,053
about me or Iggy or Ozzy or anything
like that is probably true.

364
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:36,333
Everything you've ever heard about
Keith Moon is true.

365
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:40,213
And you've only heard a tenth of it.

366
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:44,053
He'd come to Los Angeles and stay
at the house for a week, you know.

367
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:50,053
And I'd go out to a recording
session, come back and he'd be
dressed like a French maid.

368
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,173
And your car was in
the swimming pool.

369
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:56,093
And my wife would go, "Who is this?!"

370
00:29:56,094 --> 00:30:00,053
How did you manage to survive,
then, when obviously
so many people didn't?

371
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:05,773
I woke up one morning, and instead of
just throwing up beer, it was blood.

372
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:09,813
But real blood. I mean, not...?
Yeah, it wasn't fake blood.

373
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:16,613
You know, throwing up blood
on stage is very theatrical
and it looks great.

374
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,893
In your Holiday Inn room, you know,

375
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,973
where the only person
who can see is the maid

376
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:25,613
and she's really not impressed
because she has to clean it up,

377
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:28,493
that was a good message for me
that this is really it now.

378
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:32,813
If I keep drinking, I'm going to die.
So what did you replace it with?

379
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,334
Golf.

380
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:39,214
That would clear Keith Moon up.
Golf and cannibalism.

381
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:43,773
I don't want to talk about golf.

382
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:47,733
I want to talk about Detroit,
which is where you're from. Yep.

383
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:54,613
A lot of people think of it as
the music town, obviously Motown and
the Motown acts, but the amount of

384
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:58,373
rock-and-roll stars that have
come out of Detroit
is simply unbelievable.

385
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:03,613
Iggy Pop, Ted Nugent,
Bob Seeger, Madonna is Detroit,
which a lot of people don't realise.

386
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:04,854
The MC5. White Stripes.

387
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:08,893
Bits of the Eagles, everyone
thinks they're from California.
They're Detroit.

388
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:13,493
Detroit, yes.
Behind this music, which was huge,

389
00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:19,973
obviously cars were also big
and there's no question, you're a
big car freak. Massive petrolhead.

390
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:24,213
Yes, I love cars. And they
give me a Kia to drive!

391
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:27,893
Yes, we do. Down-to-earth, it's the
star in the REASONABLY priced car.

392
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:33,373
How many cars do you think you've
owned over the years? At least 100.

393
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,933
I'm assuming most of your cars
you've had over the years,

394
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:39,413
I guess are American.
Would that be the case?

395
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,493
Yeah, well, we were always addicted
to the Mustangs and Camaros.

396
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:44,173
Detroit.

397
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:49,373
Yeah, the Detroit muscle cars. And
you know, of course the Hemi Cudas.

398
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,973
What's the Alice Cooper Corral
that you read about all the time?

399
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:58,693
I'm so into the cars and in Phoenix,
Arizona, where I live, we build cars
and then... This is the Corral.

400
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:02,133
Yeah. Then we put my name on it
and I go and help sell it.

401
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,973
So we have a picture of...

402
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:06,973
That was a Lincoln Zephyr.

403
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:10,773
That's billion-dollar
bills burning up the flames

404
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:13,973
and we said, "Who would buy a car,
the billion dollar babies car?"

405
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,333
We said, well, Trump, maybe?

406
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,693
What would make it

407
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,293
really appealing to them?

408
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:23,813
You open the trunk in this car and
there's your own private ATM machine.

409
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:28,013
Oh really?
Yes, your own bank money machine.

410
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:31,893
A cash machine in the trunk.
Yeah! You open it up and...

411
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:35,973
So when you're touring,
are you looking for
these unusual cars to buy?

412
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:42,013
I just found a really nice
little '65 Mustang that
looks like it came out of

413
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:45,053
the shop in Nashville. I drove by
it every day going to the studio

414
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:50,213
and I finally went in and said
"What do you want for this car?"
They said 22,000.

415
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:52,533
Because that's cheap. Absolutely.

416
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:57,453
You didn't have the heart to say,
"You do realise cars like that
are worth a lot more these days"?

417
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:00,693
I didn't tell them.

418
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:04,653
OK, so, anyway, you came over here
to try your hand at a lap

419
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:09,013
and I guess a lap is quite unusual
with corners for an American.

420
00:33:09,014 --> 00:33:13,093
Yeah. No, you're really right
because in America we drag race.

421
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:16,533
We go from light to light.
You pull up next to a car.

422
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:18,493
This is the sign, this means race.

423
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:25,093
Really? You go, OK, you rev it up,
put it in first gear and whoever gets
to that light next is the winner.

424
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:30,293
But you burn rubber up,
it's just drag racing so you
don't even think about turning.

425
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:34,013
But this was interesting
for me to get in a car,

426
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,653
the shift on the left side.

427
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:38,293
It was like dyslexic driving

428
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:42,893
because I'm going 3rd, 9th? Opening
the door, no, it's not there.

429
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:47,054
So they gave me an automatic and
it was a really, really fast Kia!

430
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:54,054
Who would like to see
Alice's lap? Yeah.

431
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:59,653
Here we go. Let's have a look.

432
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:01,373
Oh, that's pouring with rain.

433
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,293
Look at that thing go.

434
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:08,573
Come on now. All right.
That's an intense stare
you've got going on there.

435
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:11,093
Clint Eastwood for a second.

436
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:13,613
And into the first corner.

437
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:16,853
This can go as a very, very wet lap.

438
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,653
No brake lights there, that's good.

439
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:21,373
Trundling.

440
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:22,734
Come on, you pig. Keep going.

441
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,853
Did I say "Come on, you pig"?

442
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,653
Yes, I think you probably did.

443
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,733
The Cee'd gripping well as it...

444
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,733
Where are you going? I've no idea.

445
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,133
It's tricky.
Now the Hammerhead, was this OK?

446
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:36,493
You managed to stay
between the lines?

447
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:38,573
Yes, come on, get the back around.

448
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:43,173
A bit of understeer and some
tyre squeal despite the conditions.

449
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:46,133
Yes, you're moving, just.

450
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:47,414
Come on, come on, come on!

451
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,213
Come on, Kia.

452
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:55,493
How many people say "Come on, Kia?"
Now where are you going?

453
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:58,973
Left! Left! Left!
I was getting a big...

454
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:02,053
That's not fast there,

455
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:04,053
not fast at all.

456
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:06,213
I was floored right there.
I had it floored.

457
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:10,213
There's obviously something stuck
behind the accelerator pedal.

458
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:12,613
Come on, spin a little bit. Come on!

459
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,173
Where are you now?

460
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:20,694
And you're being a rock star there,
all over the place. But across
the line, there we are!

461
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:26,094
So...

462
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:33,613
here is the board
with many, many names on it.

463
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,213
Where do you think you've come?

464
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:36,933
Oh, man, I have no idea.

465
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:41,013
If I broke two minutes
I'd be the happiest guy in the world.

466
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,373
I can make you
the happiest man in the world.

467
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,653
But not by much.

468
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:52,933
Because, Alice Cooper, rock legend,
all-round unbelievably nice guy,

469
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,334
you did it in one minute...

470
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:02,614
56.3. Oh, yes!

471
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:17,093
I don't know, really,
what to say about that
other than it was terrible.

472
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:20,413
But, you know what? I'm proud
of that. Do you know what I am?

473
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,253
I'm so grateful to you
for coming on because it's been

474
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:26,413
such an honour to meet you. You
were nothing like I was expecting.

475
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:29,853
I thought you'd eat the television
and kill someone in the audience.

476
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,733
Come and see the show, I do that.

477
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:36,614
I'd love to see it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Alice Cooper.

478
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,975
Now, as you know, here on
Top Gear it's our job

479
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,335
to keep you up-to-date with
all that's new and cutting edge

480
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:58,096
in the ever-changing world
of modern motoring.

481
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:07,295
Hello, viewers.
James Paddy May Hopkirk here,

482
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:12,656
driving a rally version
of the original Mini Cooper S.

483
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:17,295
And that's quite a special feeling
because, even though it rose to fame

484
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:24,936
because of all that Swinging '60s
stuff, the Mini is actually the most
iconic rally car of all time.

485
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,335
If you're one of our
younger viewers or were hoping

486
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:36,415
to watch the Antiques Roadshow but
you can't find the remote, let me
give you a quick history lesson.

487
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:40,975
This tiny machine shocked the rally
world by winning the prestigious

488
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:48,335
Monte Carlo Rally in 1964,
'65 and '67.

489
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:53,455
The 0 - 60 time might have been a
dreary 13 seconds but its light,

490
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:57,256
compact body meant it
cornered like a go-kart.

491
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,736
It's bloody brilliant!

492
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:09,375
Everybody should drive a Mini,
everybody should own a Mini

493
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:12,376
at some point or you're
incomplete as a human being.

494
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:21,055
Now, like any form of motorsport,
rallying needs cars that are
stars in their own right.

495
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:24,415
It's why Formula 1 needs Ferrari.

496
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:28,376
And that's why modern
rallying needs another Mini.

497
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:32,776
And now, at last, it's got one.

498
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:43,056
This is the brand-new
World Rally Championship Mini.

499
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:51,415
But whereas the old car was
something of a giant slayer,
this new one is really...

500
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:55,095
just a bit of a giant and it's
because it's based on this car,

501
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:58,015
the Mini Countryman
which isn't really a Mini at all.

502
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:01,255
It's more of a trendy school-run
car with four-wheel drive.

503
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:06,935
But if you look down here,
you'll see it says Mini.

504
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:08,895
So it must be true.

505
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:12,535
Let's not get bogged down
in that now...

506
00:39:12,536 --> 00:39:16,535
because this is the modern
Mini we're interested in.

507
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:19,976
Yes, what a racket!

508
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:28,255
Whereas the original Mini had 70
horsepower, this one has around 300.

509
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,176
It does 0 - 60 in 3.5 seconds.

510
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:39,175
And this brilliant sequential
gearbox, look at this.

511
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,375
And go!

512
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:45,775
In fact, I got a bit carried away
with the gearbox.

513
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:50,895
Bang! Oh! Go! Yes!

514
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:53,055
Oh! Yee!

515
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:56,495
By the time you watch this film,

516
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:59,695
the Mini will have taken part
in its first proper rally.

517
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,455
No, I've buggered it!

518
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:06,536
But, as I drive it today, it's yet
to turn a wheel in real anger.

519
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:14,815
So, we're here to find out how good
it is and we're going to do that

520
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:21,616
with a typically unscientific
yet informative and hopefully
invigorating Top Gear race.

521
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:27,535
And to do that, we've come back
to one of our old
Top Gear stomping grounds...

522
00:40:27,536 --> 00:40:31,376
the Winter Olympics
site of Lillehammer in Norway...

523
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:38,255
where, several years ago,
we raced a rally car against
Richard Hammond in a bobsleigh.

524
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:42,296
And on that occasion it was the
men in tights who came first.

525
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:50,215
So the motor car was given a
bloody nose and has come back
with a score to settle.

526
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:53,695
And because of that,
the rally mechanics here have told

527
00:40:53,696 --> 00:40:58,415
Captain Paddy Slow to get stuffed
and make way for their driver.

528
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:05,016
He's Kris Meeke, intercontinental
rally champion and quite possibly
the fastest ginger on the planet.

529
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:10,096
And as for the bobsleigh team...

530
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,375
They're not here.

531
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:19,376
Instead, the ice-sliding community
is fielding one of its biggest guns.

532
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:30,136
Olympic skeleton gold
medallist Amy Williams.

533
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:40,215
Right, in case you can't get Dave on
your telly, or for some other reason

534
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:46,535
you haven't seen the original race
between Hammond and me, here is why
Lillehammer is the ideal venue

535
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:49,535
for a rally car versus
skeleton bob shoot-out.

536
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:53,975
We begin here, and this red line
is the bob track,

537
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:59,295
almost two kilometres
of twisting, turning, icy terror.

538
00:41:59,296 --> 00:42:02,695
And this blue line is the road -
almost exactly the same length,

539
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:08,815
nearly two kilometres -
and it too is twisting,
turning, yumping, icy terror.

540
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:13,735
And they both end here
at the finish line.

541
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:17,495
The first person there is
the winner. You realise that
the car must win this one

542
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:19,335
because the car is 1-0 down.

543
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:24,295
The car that has been
around for 125-odd years
now is being challenged by...

544
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:26,175
My two year-old sled.

545
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:30,975
A tea tray. Do you mind if I...?
I don't think people will
have seen one of these close-up.

546
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:33,055
This is a skeleton bob.

547
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:37,215
Your face goes that way. Face
this end and I steer here and here.

548
00:42:37,216 --> 00:42:40,415
By doing what? By pushing my
shoulders in and moving the sled.

549
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,015
So your face is actually
over the end.

550
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:47,415
My chin and head and helmet will be
scratching the ice on the way down.

551
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:50,895
70 mph with your face...
Scraping the ice.

552
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:53,735
Our faces aren't going to
scrape along the road, are they?

553
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:57,655
Hopefully not. That's only if
we're going upside-down,
which we don't plan to do.

554
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,456
Right, let's do it.

555
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:23,775
As Amy imagined her
way down the run,

556
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:29,776
I imagined Kris going too fast in
the dark and the pair of us rolling
end-over-end in a huge fireball.

557
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:41,376
OK, here we go! Three, two, one.

558
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:48,536
And we're off.

559
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,496
Go! Go! Go!

560
00:44:06,616 --> 00:44:09,375
For Amy, the start is everything.

561
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:14,775
Just a tenth to slow at
the top and she'll be two seconds
off the pace at the bottom.

562
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:17,976
Sadly for us, she had a great start.

563
00:44:20,896 --> 00:44:22,656
To the left.

564
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:30,815
No sign of Williams
at the crossover.

565
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:34,216
That's because Williams was ahead.

566
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:40,056
Go! Go! Go!

567
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:52,375
At the halfway point, both Kris
and Amy were losing precious time.

568
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:55,815
Kris because of
the slushy ground,

569
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:59,855
and Amy because of rough ice.

570
00:44:59,856 --> 00:45:02,456
Fortunately, Kris could rise
above the problem.

571
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:23,416
Here we go. Whoa!

572
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:30,216
Less than a kilometre to go,
Kris had closed the gap.

573
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:34,816
Yes, sir! Loving that.

574
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:39,576
Right.

575
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:44,936
Here it is, here we go.

576
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,016
Rrr!

577
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:15,896
Oh, no! What did you get?

578
00:46:18,256 --> 00:46:20,335
Amy Williams, you did it in...

579
00:46:20,336 --> 00:46:22,455
What is it? What is it?

580
00:46:22,456 --> 00:46:26,295
You did it in 61...

581
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:29,975
Point? 61.04. Yeah?

582
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:32,815
We did it in...

583
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,695
59.73! No!

584
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:38,775
Sorry! Fair enough.

585
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:42,495
Congratulations to you too. It's
traditional, I'm really sorry...

586
00:46:42,496 --> 00:46:46,175
It's bad manners, but... loser.

587
00:46:46,176 --> 00:46:48,335
Well done.

588
00:46:48,336 --> 00:46:51,616
Disappointing. Well done, Mini.

589
00:46:55,736 --> 00:46:58,135
I hate snow.

590
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:07,695
So, Kris... Amy! Amy!

591
00:47:07,696 --> 00:47:14,775
Can I first of all just say
what a pleasure it is for me
to have you back here on our show.

592
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:17,975
You always bring...
a touch of joy to my heart.

593
00:47:17,976 --> 00:47:20,095
Thank you.

594
00:47:20,096 --> 00:47:26,015
This steering thing -
you say you use your shoulders -
how does that actually work?

595
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:33,015
So the inside of a sled pretty much
is like a pivot point in the middle
so, if I steer one shoulder there,

596
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,775
the pivot point will move
and the runners grip the ice.

597
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:39,296
Do you have to do that really fast?

598
00:47:41,896 --> 00:47:43,455
Sometimes, yes.

599
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:45,295
Sometimes slow, sometimes fast.

600
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:48,055
Is your hair naturally curly?

601
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:49,695
Yes, this is normal.

602
00:47:49,696 --> 00:47:52,096
It's normal? Very lovely.

603
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:56,855
What's your favourite song?
Oh, for God's sake.

604
00:47:56,856 --> 00:47:59,336
Kris. Sorry, we don't have
time to talk to the man.

605
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:04,015
No, we do have time to talk to
the man. How did it get on, the
Mini, in its first proper rally?

606
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:06,655
Well... Well, there we are, good.
Now I want to talk

607
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:10,335
about planning permission because,
if you want to change your house

608
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:13,975
in this country, you have
to go to the council for permission.

609
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:20,655
This is to stop people putting up
pink conservatories and generally
ruining the heritage of Britain.

610
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:26,416
It all makes sense but I think
the planners have overlooked
an important detail.

611
00:48:28,616 --> 00:48:33,056
This is the pretty little
village of Chilham in Kent.

612
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:41,375
And careful planning means all of
the houses are still very lovely.

613
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,855
But look here. The owner of
this house wouldn't be allowed

614
00:48:44,856 --> 00:48:52,095
by the planners to fit uPVC
windows or stone cladding,
but he's allowed to festoon

615
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:58,295
the parking space outside his house
with a hideous Chrysler PT Cruiser.

616
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:00,256
It makes no sense.

617
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:07,735
If I had my way, only one
car would be allowed in a
village as lovely as this.

618
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:12,175
A car that, this year,
is celebrating its 50th birthday.

619
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:16,535
The beguiling, bewitching, beautiful

620
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,296
E-type Jag.

621
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:28,056
Over the years,
there have been many pretty cars.

622
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:35,416
But Enzo Ferrari described the
E-type as the prettiest of them all.

623
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:43,335
And what makes that extraordinary
is that it was shaped at night

624
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:47,215
in a rudimentary early-days wind
tunnel that used so much electricity

625
00:49:47,216 --> 00:49:51,736
it could only be operated when
the rest of the country was asleep.

626
00:49:54,136 --> 00:49:58,335
And everyone was still asleep
when the car itself was tested

627
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:05,735
because the only place where
they could actually run it
up to its 149 mph top speed

628
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,336
was at 5am on the M1.

629
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:13,695
It was on one of those high-speed
runs they discovered the roof

630
00:50:13,696 --> 00:50:15,255
would flap about so,

631
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:20,215
to weigh it down, a string of
lead shot was sewn into the canvas.

632
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:23,775
And there was a similar
make-do-and-mend attitude
to the rear suspension.

633
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:29,975
The chief engineer was given
just a month to design
an entirely new system.

634
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:34,055
The boss, Sir William Lyons,
bet him a fiver he couldn't do it.

635
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:40,776
He did, and Jag used exactly the
same set-up for the next 25 years.

636
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:46,015
Lyons, in fact,
was completely underwhelmed
by the finished product.

637
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:51,175
He didn't like the look
of the back end and didn't
think it would sell. He was wrong.

638
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:58,215
Because when
the E-type was unveiled at
the Geneva Motor Show in March 1961,

639
00:50:58,216 --> 00:50:59,776
it was an instant hit.

640
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:05,535
Such was demand for test drives
that a second demonstrator

641
00:51:05,536 --> 00:51:09,935
was driven through
the night from the factory
in Coventry to Switzerland.

642
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:13,856
And this is that very car.

643
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:23,335
OK, let's see
what the old girl can do.

644
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:28,495
I know it's genesis,
I know this is the very first
convertible E-type ever,

645
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:32,376
but I have to find out what it's
like when we give it some noise.

646
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:36,016
Oh-ho-ho!

647
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:39,456
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

648
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:45,975
Can you imagine what it must
have been like in 1961?

649
00:51:45,976 --> 00:51:51,135
You've been to the bakery,
you've queued for a week for a loaf
of bread, you're on your way home

650
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:56,735
in black-and-white
in your Humber and you
were overtaken by one of these.

651
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:59,735
It must have been staggering.

652
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:01,296
"What was that?!"

653
00:52:02,696 --> 00:52:07,535
It's the same age, this car
and me, give or take.

654
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:09,135
It has aged better.

655
00:52:09,136 --> 00:52:11,136
Still looks good.

656
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:17,935
But it wasn't just the looks that
astonished everyone back in 1961.

657
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:23,655
Back then, the equivalent
Ferrari or Maserati was £6,000.
A little bit more, in fact.

658
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:28,855
This was £2,098, and this,

659
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:34,576
thanks to its 3.8 litre
straight-six engine, was faster.

660
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:38,336
Oh-ho-ho!

661
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,856
This is just heaven.

662
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:48,416
Even by today's standards,
that's a lot of go.

663
00:52:55,096 --> 00:53:00,055
Small wonder the E-type became a
must-have accessory for the jet set.

664
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:04,935
Princess Grace, Steve McQueen,
Tony Curtis,

665
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:08,215
Britt Ekland, Frank Sinatra,
George Best,

666
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:12,375
Roy Orbison, Charlton Heston,
Count Basie.

667
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,976
They all had E-type Jags.

668
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:22,175
No car before
ever caused such a stir

669
00:53:22,176 --> 00:53:24,256
and no car has since, really.

670
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,296
Until now.

671
00:53:35,176 --> 00:53:38,295
This is called the Eagle Speedster.

672
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:44,135
Made by a small engineering company
in Sussex, it looks like an E-type.

673
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:48,175
It's even based on an E-type
but there have been some changes.

674
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:51,295
The aluminium body is deeper,

675
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:54,775
the windscreen is lower
and more steeply raked.

676
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:58,855
The wheels are new,
and the tyres, and the brakes.

677
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:01,296
And the interior.

678
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:08,375
If someone had come to me asking
for planning permission to alter

679
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:13,175
an E-type Jaguar, I'd have said no,
don't be stupid, you'll mess it up!

680
00:54:13,176 --> 00:54:15,855
But they haven't.

681
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:23,056
I think this, by a long way, is the
most beautiful car I've ever seen.

682
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:29,136
It might actually be the most
beautiful THING I've ever seen.

683
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:36,455
And the surgery isn't just cosmetic.

684
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:41,855
Under the bonnet there's a
fuel-injected 4.7 litre straight-six

685
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:49,336
which sends its power to the rear
wheels through a five-speed gearbox
and an aluminium differential.

686
00:54:53,936 --> 00:54:57,455
As a result of all the aluminium,
which doesn't weigh very much,

687
00:54:57,456 --> 00:55:01,335
this has a better power-to-weight
ratio than a Porsche 911 Turbo,

688
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:05,896
and, as a result of that,
it can do 0 - 60 in 5 seconds.

689
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:10,016
Flat out, it'll do 160.

690
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:17,576
And then there's the noise.

691
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:24,176
Ha-ha-ha!

692
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:28,775
It's spitting fire.

693
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:32,136
It's a spitfire! That's what it is.

694
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:40,936
The looks, the noise!

695
00:55:53,256 --> 00:55:55,815
This, to me, is...

696
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:59,896
absolute perfection.

697
00:56:01,136 --> 00:56:04,015
I'll put my hand on my heart
and say here and now

698
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:09,816
I've never ever driven a car,
ever, that I've wanted more
than this one.

699
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:19,136
I yearn to have it.

700
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:30,735
There is, however, a problem.

701
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:36,695
Because every single piece of this
car, pretty much, was hand-made,

702
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:38,455
the price is fantastic.

703
00:56:38,456 --> 00:56:40,495
Enormous. Eye-watering.

704
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:47,215
I didn't know numbers went this
high, but it turns out they do,
so sit down, I'm going to say it.

705
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,896
Here we go. The Eagle Speedster...

706
00:56:50,976 --> 00:56:56,696
is half a million pounds.
Half a million.

707
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:04,015
That's a lot for a toy.
A car that doesn't even have a roof.

708
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:07,015
But this is more than a toy.

709
00:57:07,016 --> 00:57:10,055
It's a modern take
on the E-type Jag.

710
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:12,855
And the E-type, with
the possible exception of Concorde,

711
00:57:12,856 --> 00:57:17,816
is almost certainly the last
truly great thing Britain made.

712
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:25,375
I think we should be more proud
of it than we actually are.

713
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:31,135
Its 50th birthday was marked
by a small piece on page 16
of the Daily Telegraph

714
00:57:31,136 --> 00:57:36,815
and I don't think that's right,
which is why I've organised
something a little more substantial.

715
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:42,455
I've organised something which
recognises that this is the soul,

716
00:57:42,456 --> 00:57:47,135
the spirit, the beating heart
of all that we can be.

717
00:57:47,136 --> 00:57:55,135
The E-type isn't a plucky Brit
that's happy to come home second, it
wouldn't be humiliated by Barcelona.

718
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:58,295
It wouldn't simply
wave Sebastian Vettel by.

719
00:57:58,296 --> 00:58:02,495
And if you asked an E-type
to organise a royal wedding,

720
00:58:02,496 --> 00:58:06,495
it wouldn't ferry the guests
to Westminster Abbey
in a fleet of minibuses.

721
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:10,855
The E-type doesn't know
what a minibus is.

722
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:13,175
Every country has an icon.

723
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:17,935
The great nation of France
has the big brown pylon
in the middle of Paris.

724
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:19,615
Australia has a rock.

725
00:58:19,616 --> 00:58:22,775
The Belgians have
a urinating infant.

726
00:58:22,776 --> 00:58:25,895
Well this, I put it to you, is ours.

727
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:30,495
Our Jerusalem, our chariot of fire,
the maypole around which the people

728
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:35,415
of this funny little rock
in the North Atlantic can gather,
to remind ourselves

729
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:38,536
that, once upon a time,
we really were as great...

730
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:41,776
as we think we are now.

731
00:59:21,176 --> 00:59:22,935
It won't start.

732
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,175
A stirring but nicely understated
tribute there, I thought.

733
00:59:38,176 --> 00:59:42,175
But you said something that worried
me - with the possible
exception of Concorde,

734
00:59:42,176 --> 00:59:45,575
the E-type was the last great
thing Britain made. Is that right?

735
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:50,615
Can you think of anything
we've made since which you
go, "that's a world-beater"?

736
00:59:50,616 --> 00:59:55,095
The E-type was a third the price
of the Ferrari, as I said,
and faster, and better-looking.

737
00:59:55,096 --> 01:00:00,175
The only thing I can think that even
gets close really is Monty Python,
that moved the world on.

738
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:02,815
What about those vacuum cleaners
with no bags in them?

739
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:05,375
We invented those and they're
pretty good, they're clever.

740
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:08,615
Hammond, I'm not sure that, in 50
years' time, people will be having

741
01:00:08,616 --> 01:00:12,935
a big birthday party on
Beachy Head with people going,
"These Dysons are brilliant!"

742
01:00:12,936 --> 01:00:15,575
I'm not sure that's going to happen.

743
01:00:15,576 --> 01:00:21,175
Moving on, the Eagle Speedster -
is it really that good? Look at it.

744
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:23,575
Seriously, just look at it.

745
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:28,255
It's beautiful to behold, yes,
but how can it really be worth

746
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:31,095
five times more than an
immaculate original E-type?

747
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:32,855
I can demonstrate that, Hammond.

748
01:00:32,856 --> 01:00:36,696
I can demonstrate that because,
if I step in here, OK? Listen.

749
01:00:46,616 --> 01:00:48,215
It starts.

750
01:00:48,216 --> 01:00:50,335
On that bombshell, it's time to end.

751
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:52,696
Thank you very much for watching.
Good night!

752
