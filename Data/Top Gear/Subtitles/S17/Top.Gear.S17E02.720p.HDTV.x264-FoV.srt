1
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:15,284
Tonight,
I find a bicycle in a river...

2
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:18,124
James annoys a dog...

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,045
and Richard jumps over a dyke.

4
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:29,684
Hello!

5
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,484
Hello, good evening!
Hello, everybody.

6
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:34,644
Thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you.

7
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:36,204
Now...

8
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,924
we start tonight on our track.

9
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:44,044
This is a place of screaming
engines and tyre smoke.

10
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:49,164
It is a cathedral to the god of
thunder and the mistress of power.

11
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,805
The natural home, then,
for James May.

12
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:00,685
That is a selection
of sporty Astons.

13
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:16,205
All of them neatly demonstrating
exactly what's wrong with
modern sports cars - handling.

14
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:24,644
The people who make sports cars are
absolutely obsessed with it, to
the exclusion of everything else,

15
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:29,324
like comfort, refinement.
They just give you a racket,
a load of smoke and a bad back.

16
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,884
That is the noise made by idiots -
full of sound and fury

17
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:37,485
and signifying nothing.

18
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:43,044
The reason these Astons
are so unnecessarily hard core

19
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:47,964
is this because of this place -
the Nurburgring.

20
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:52,084
As soon as a car company comes here
to develop a new model,

21
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:54,844
they forget about everything else
except lap times,

22
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:59,005
and that is the ruination of a car.

23
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,844
Of course, those of you who know
your Astons will be saying,

24
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:10,644
"But there is a model for you -
the DB9, the most grown-up
and least sporty Aston of them all."

25
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:16,004
The trouble with this, though, is,
it isn't shaking my teeth out

26
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:19,724
and it's not sending me into
a boiling rage about handling,

27
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:22,084
but it isn't really giving me
the fizz, either.

28
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:25,764
I think this has now gone
a bit too far the other way.

29
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:29,204
There's a slight
whiff of old fart about it.

30
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:34,524
So, what I need is
the comfort of the DB9

31
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:37,965
infused with some of the power
of the red-hot DBS.

32
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,725
And it looks like my prayers
may have been answered...

33
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,165
with this, the new Virage.

34
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:51,204
At first glance, it looks the same
as any of the current Astons.

35
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:56,644
But take a second look
and you'll see that nearly all
the body panels are new,

36
00:02:56,645 --> 00:03:01,324
as are the front grille
and the streamlined headlights.

37
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:06,565
But does it fill the gap
between the DB9 and the DBS?

38
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:13,844
Now, the DBS has 510 horsepower,

39
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:21,484
the DB9 over there has 470,
and the Virage, that has 490.

40
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:24,724
Logically, then, the Virage should
be the second fastest.

41
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,444
I wonder how we can find that out.

42
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:36,644
Well, come on, we've got a runway
and three Astons.
What do you expect us to do?

43
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,565
Go!

44
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:45,725
Taking the DB9...

45
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:51,285
Only just. It's very close.

46
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:55,605
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

47
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:59,444
Yes!

48
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:02,764
The car in the middle
of the power range

49
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,484
came in the middle of the race.
How about that?

50
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:12,044
The Virage uses the same 6-litre V12
you'll find in the DB9 and the DBS,

51
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:15,525
but, again, it's a sort of
in-the-middle version.

52
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:21,245
It's tuned differently
from the DBS engine.

53
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,964
Now it gives 85%
of maximum torque...

54
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,204
it does 1,500 RPM...

55
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:34,845
and it will go on
to 186 miles an hour!

56
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:41,124
And when all this gets a bit much,
you have ceramic brakes as standard.

57
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,564
So...

58
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,445
Phwoar.

59
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,565
Nice.

60
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:53,844
As for the handling - surprise,
surprise - it's sharper than the DB9

61
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:57,404
but not as aggressive as a DBS.

62
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:00,564
So let's move on to the price.

63
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,924
The DBS is £170,000.

64
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:06,724
The DB9 is £125,000.

65
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:11,925
The new Virage is £150,000.
You see - in the middle.

66
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:18,964
So far, then, it's shaping up well,
and it gets better.

67
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,804
This is probably the
best-looking of all the Astons

68
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:24,444
and it has the nicest interior.

69
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:28,525
The stitching is all done
by one seamstress
to keep the weave constant.

70
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:34,644
And, joy of joys, the useless Volvo
sat nav of other Astons

71
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:36,964
has been ditched for one that works.

72
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:40,604
However, before I can give this car
a clean bill of health,

73
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,924
I have to address
the elephant in the room.

74
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:49,004
The worry is, they've made another
track monster.

75
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:53,204
They've fallen for the same
old trick - it's got to go
round the Nurburgring, etc, etc.

76
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:56,364
So I've decided to
do something radical...

77
00:05:56,365 --> 00:06:01,244
leave the track and go for
a potter round our airfield.

78
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:08,324
My idea here is to go on something
a bit like a real road and
see what the ride is actually like,

79
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:14,964
and it will allow me to show you all
the bits of the Top Gear test track
that you never normally see.

80
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:18,084
That's actually our studio.
This is Nigel's garage.

81
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,124
He's a lovely chap.

82
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:24,204
Unfortunately, viewers, I then
had to cancel the rest of the tour

83
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:28,324
because, after just a few hundred
yards, I was too cross to carry on.

84
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:31,604
My God, I don't believe it.
They've done it.

85
00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:37,604
I've got everything turned off, I've
got sport off, the firm suspension
off, but it's still too jiggly.

86
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:42,964
It's been ruined by the ride.
Listen.

87
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:47,005
Rattle, rattle, bang, bang.
That is not necessary.

88
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,404
The Virage, then,
is a missed opportunity.

89
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:57,724
It could, and should, have been
a comfortable gentleman's express.

90
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:02,365
Instead, it's just another pointless
bone-shaking racing car.

91
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,885
What? Right!

92
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:24,204
Is this going to be a
five-minute argument,
or do you want the full half-hour?

93
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:27,164
No, cos I actually agree with you.
No... Oh, for God's sake!

94
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:31,844
Look, the point is, Aston already
make the DBS and the Vantage S

95
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,284
for enthusiasts of the Nurburgring,

96
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:37,444
but there might be somebody who
wants a faster Aston

97
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:41,964
but maybe has, I don't know,
backache, for example!
Yes, I agree with that.

98
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:46,484
Oh, shut up, man! Do you not realise
this could have been that car,

99
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,244
and it isn't,
and that's a tragedy? I know.

100
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:52,084
You are such an idiot! Honestly!

101
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:56,004
Anyway, we must now find out
how fast it goes round our track.

102
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,164
Why?!

103
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:04,844
Because that enables me to
say some ludicrous things about
our tame racing driver.

104
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:09,804
Some say that he can't eat mashed
potato for religious reasons...

105
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:16,564
and that he recently received
47,000 tickets, Olympic tickets,

106
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,725
all of them for the final
of the women's wrestling.

107
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,405
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

108
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:26,524
And he's off.

109
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,525
A nice controlled start there.
And listen to that V12.

110
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,484
OK, coming up to the first corner.

111
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:38,045
It's a heavy car, this, but it
manages to corner surprisingly flat.

112
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,764
Stig listening to the Bangles
there, but in German.

113
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,124
Very off.

114
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,124
One lot of tyre smoke
coming out of Chicago.

115
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:57,964
Coming up to Hammerhead.
Will the big engine upfront
drag the nose wide?

116
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,324
No, it is clinging on,

117
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:04,804
and it is in fact... Yep! It's
the back that's letting go first.

118
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,645
Very neat on the way out, though.

119
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:14,164
OK, into Follow Through.
Really opening up the taps now.

120
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:15,804
You can hear him shift up.

121
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,804
Lifting it, actually,
into the approach to the tyres.

122
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:22,484
That is impressive.
Just two corners left now.

123
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,604
Hard on those ceramic brakes.
Fat Pirelli squealing.

124
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,004
Just Gambon left.

125
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:31,084
Sliding it through there
and across the line!

126
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:41,764
He did it... He did it in 1.24.4,

127
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:46,364
so it's only half a second slower
than the DBS. Yeah.

128
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:50,524
And it would've been
a much better car if it had been
five seconds slower. I agree.

129
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,724
Ah, you're insufferable!

130
00:09:56,845 --> 00:10:02,484
And now we must do the news,
and we start off with news
that since James drove that Virage,

131
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:06,084
Aston Martin have launched
a new car, and here it is.

132
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,804
It's called the V12 Zagato.
There it is.

133
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:12,204
James will be particularly
interested in this, I think. Will I?

134
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:17,364
You will. Because the boss
of the company was quoted this week

135
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:20,924
as saying, "The Nurburgring is
where we sign off every new model

136
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:26,244
"and there could be NO better place
for the new V12 Zagato
to be finally tested,"

137
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:29,924
said the BOSS of Aston Martin.
For crying out loud!

138
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,644
If I'd been in Bomber Command
in 1943,

139
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:37,324
I would have bombed the Nurburgring
every night until it was gone!

140
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:42,404
Am I the only person who thinks
like this? This bad back of yours -
does it make you a bit crabby?

141
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:47,644
It's nothing to do with my bad back.
He's got a bad back as well,
but he won't agree... OK! OK!

142
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:51,884
Ride is important.
All right, all right! Bomb it!

143
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:56,364
It was a bad policy.
Look where we are now.
We no longer have Dresden Cathedral

144
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,404
or all that lovely pottery,
but we do have the Nurburgring,

145
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,284
and under my bombing policy, we
wouldn't have cars that rode badly

146
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,725
and you'd have a nice cathedral
to look at, and better saucers!

147
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,924
Now, have you noticed how
some of the best-looking cars
you can buy these days

148
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:15,964
are, like, ordinary family saloons
or hatchbacks or estates?
I know what you mean. Yeah.

149
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,604
Citroen have sent us
a picture of their new DS5.

150
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:21,164
That is a good-looking
ordinary, mid-size car.

151
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:26,364
It's not alone. What's that Kia
called, from a while back?
The Rooney. Not the Rooney.

152
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:27,804
Rio. Rio.

153
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:30,564
That was an awful-looking car,
but they've launched this,

154
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:34,004
which is called the
something-or-other. The Optic.

155
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:39,444
Optical... Optima. Doesn't matter.
Nobody who watches Top Gear is going
to buy a Kia, but if they did...

156
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,364
All Kia drivers are watching
Countryfile going,

157
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:48,204
"It's Adam's farm in a minute.
We're looking forward to that.
Oh, look at the little baa-lamb."

158
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:52,284
Make a trail for what's
on the other side!
Countryfile's a brilliant show.

159
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:56,964
Particularly when it's cold, and
Julie Bradbury's out in a T-shirt.
Leave it! Leave it!

160
00:11:56,965 --> 00:12:00,204
The Peugeot 508 is a good-looking
car. It is. We've got a picture.

161
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:06,524
What makes that particularly good is
that Peugeots in recent years have
had the big guppy mouths on them.

162
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,924
Yes, that. That is a very good
impersonation of a Peugeot.

163
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:14,445
I can only impersonate a Morgan.

164
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,165
Can you do any other car?

165
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,404
No, I can only do Peugeots, but I
can do any Peugeot you name. 308.

166
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:26,404
207. What's the people-carrier?
Can you do that one?

167
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,765
Yeah, hang on, that's...

168
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,364
I'll stump him.

169
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,804
You know the tiny one, the 1007
with electric sliding doors?

170
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:40,404
Ah... ahh... ahh...
It's exactly like that.

171
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:45,124
And the Vauxhall Insignia.
I was following one the other day.
That's basically a Vectra.

172
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:50,644
Yeah, fabulous. And the great thing
is, it's got positive camber
on its back wheels.

173
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,244
You've got positive camber
and you look ridiculous. He's right.

174
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,965
You have, you have.
We've followed you round
every airport in the world

175
00:12:55,966 --> 00:13:03,844
and you lumber along
with your stupid legs
bending out at the knee, like that.

176
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:07,004
And it's like positive camber,
and you look TERRIBLE.

177
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:13,364
It looks good, positive camber.
You look like a knackered Spitfire.
Yeah. Spitfires are cool.

178
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:17,124
No, a leaky Triumph Spitfire.
That's assuming that's
oil that's leaking out of you.

179
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:21,204
It's cos I'm set up for angling.
You're set up for?!

180
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:23,645
If you could find a 100-metre track
that did that,

181
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:26,764
I could beat Usain Bolt,
cos I could run round corners.

182
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,604
You've been set up for cornering?

183
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:34,724
You can shut up. You look like a
car that's had its wheels nicked.
Well... Now, last week,

184
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,564
we looked at a modern-day
interpretation of the E-Type,
which was fantastic.

185
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,164
Well, now there's another one.
Here it is.

186
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:44,164
I just think that looks
spectacularly good.

187
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:47,364
It starts out in life as
a Jaguar XK, our modern-day car,

188
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:51,884
and then a Swiss company
ups the V8 engine by 100 horsepower

189
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:57,244
and then they fit a - I have
to say - brilliant-looking
carbon fibre and aluminium body,

190
00:13:57,245 --> 00:14:00,244
so it's 200 kilograms lighter.
That's gorgeous. I know.

191
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:03,484
I'm not sure I really like it.
That's cos you're odd.

192
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:09,204
But... but I think there is
a problem with this car...

193
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:12,164
because they've called it
the Growler.

194
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:15,164
Yeah.

195
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:21,205
Now... now, we... we...
we Googled "growler"...

196
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:26,484
and we were quite surprised
and a bit shocked

197
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:28,444
by what it turns out to mean.

198
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:32,124
And do you know, Richard,
I've forgotten what it is.
What does it mean?

199
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,564
Can you tell
the ladies and gentlemen?

200
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:39,684
Well, you know those big welcome mats
you might see on a girl in the '70s?

201
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,285
That's what it is!

202
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,764
Yeah. Why would you name your car
after THAT? Honestly,
James, I don't think they knew.

203
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:50,564
I think they're sitting in Zurich,
or wherever...

204
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:55,204
This is the first time
they've realised that "growler"
means THAT in England.

205
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,924
And they'll be sitting going,
"Gott in Himmel!

206
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:03,045
"Ve have accidentally named
ze car after ein Fraugarten!"

207
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,165
The car, the Growler...

208
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:12,084
is it based on an XK?
Has it got four seats?

209
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,644
No, you can't get in the back.

210
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,204
What? What?!

211
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,924
Everybody's turned over
to Countryfile.

212
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:29,364
I'm not... I'm not sure they're
going to sell very many of those.

213
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:31,964
No, neither do I.
There's another reason why.

214
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:36,084
It costs £670,000. Ouch!

215
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,924
There probably will be
a trimmed-down version later,
but I bet you...

216
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,284
just for the Brazilian market.

217
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,684
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:46,284
It's called a Growler.

219
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:51,045
There's a bloke at some point
going to say, "I'm just going
outside to wax the Growler."

220
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,565
Oh, you dirty bugger!

221
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:04,244
Anyway, that is the end of the news.

222
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:07,804
Yes. Now, on Top Gear,
we love hot hatchbacks.

223
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:13,324
The idea of a sporty car and a
practical car all rolled into one
easy-to-park box is hugely appealing.

224
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:17,604
Yes, it is, but while we all agree
that hot hatchbacks are brilliant,

225
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:20,404
we cannot agree on
which one is best.

226
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:24,484
So the producers decided
we should sort this out on
a European road trip,

227
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:29,164
beginning in the Italian town
of Lucca, which is in Italy.

228
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:45,485
I was the first to arrive and, as
you can see, my choice was superb.

229
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:53,004
This is the Citroen DS3 Racing,
and it does
everything a hot hatchback should.

230
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:59,364
It is bonkers to look at and, with
204 horsepower under the bonnet,
is bonkers to drive as well.

231
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:03,684
But it still has back seats
that fold down. It's still small.

232
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,364
It's still relatively inexpensive.
It's...

233
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:11,845
Ah, it seems Mr May has arrived in
a driving instructor's car!

234
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:19,365
This is a Renault Clio,
but it's the Cup version.

235
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:27,844
And it is, pound for pound,
the most exciting car on sale.

236
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:32,884
Not my words. Not my words.
The words of Autocar magazine.

237
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,404
Autocar? Yes.
The magazine that sacked you?

238
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,724
Yes.

239
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:41,244
And I could point out that it's
£16,000 and yours is, what, 23?

240
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:46,324
Where's your air-con,
cruise control, sat nav? You haven't
got anything. It's got air-con.

241
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:51,324
It's an optional extra. It's
an option that's been selected.
What have you got, 197 horsepower?

242
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:53,004
Yeah. 204.

243
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,444
That's very nearly
as much power as yours.

244
00:17:55,445 --> 00:18:00,604
In the same way that the Egyptian
army is very nearly as
powerful as the American army.

245
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:04,045
197... 'Mercifully, at this point,
Hammond arrived...

246
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,604
'in a car from the 1950s.'

247
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:14,884
Ha-ha! Gentlemen, behold
the Fiat 500 Abarth convertible.

248
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,604
Best hot hatch ever. Well,
apart from a couple of things.
One is, it's not very hot,

249
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:25,524
and two, it's not a hatchback. It
is hot. This has got the SS kit on.

250
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:28,004
It says 158 brake horsepower
in there. Wow!

251
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:30,764
Just a couple of things. Small.

252
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:35,084
Yes, it is. This is enormous.
This is the Clio. Cup. Yes.

253
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:39,004
You've brought one of those
ridiculously gaudy training shoes

254
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:42,284
with springs at the back that go,
"Look at me, robot shoe."

255
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:47,684
Look at it. This would look
good on the deck of
a Nimitz-class aircraft-carrier.

256
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:51,884
We're not on the deck
of a Nimitz-class...

257
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:57,324
We're in a beautiful Italian plaza.
You know what this is? What?
Juvenile.

258
00:18:57,325 --> 00:19:02,604
Juvenile? James, one thing...
This is just a small French car.

259
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:06,764
It also has an optional extra
on it. It has air conditioning, yes.

260
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:08,924
Yes, it has something else.
Ah, yes...

261
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:13,604
But I didn't... What this actually
means in Italian is "bell end".

262
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:17,284
James, just a headline
to sum up the cars.

263
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:20,844
Magnificent, ridiculous...
It's a bit boring, bland.

264
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:26,044
It might look boring...
It isn't boring because...
What are these cars about?

265
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:30,844
They are about the sensation of
driving, and this will give it to me
because it's a small Renault

266
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:36,004
and they're the best in the world at
that. It's about fun and experience.
It looks magnificent. Looks?!

267
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:39,404
You can put the roof back...
But it isn't a hatchback.

268
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:43,644
It's like turning up to do the
Grand National on a cow or a hen.

269
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:45,324
It's not!

270
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:50,644
'Seeing that this was going nowhere,
the producer stepped in
with a challenge.'

271
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:53,564
This is a no-brainer.
A man with a thing...

272
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:57,484
"To see which of your cars works
best in the urban environment,

273
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:00,005
"you will now
leave the city of Lucca."

274
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,964
Is that it?

275
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:06,284
Yep.

276
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:10,765
What, just drive out of a town?
How hard can that be?

277
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:15,164
As it turned out, very hard,

278
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:21,044
because in this medieval
walled city,
the streets were complete maze.

279
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:25,885
Now, I think a left here.
Oh, I can't go down there.

280
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:28,405
I can't go left.

281
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:31,564
Right, but it doesn't
matter too much.

282
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,644
I'll just go along here
and then turn right.

283
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:37,164
Ah, no, there isn't a right.
It's just somebody's drive.

284
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:38,765
I HAVE to go left.

285
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,764
One way. Really?! You don't say!

286
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:51,684
Every single turn you make puts you
in exactly the same road
as the one you've just left.

287
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:57,604
Also, in any other city, the Renault
and the Citroen
would be considered quite small.

288
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:59,484
Cock.

289
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,164
But here, they were huge.

290
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:06,044
And... breathe in...

291
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:07,844
Bloody hell.

292
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,324
That's a squeeze.

293
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:14,444
No, it's not going to fit. Sorry.

294
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:20,084
Since when did the Renault Clio
become an enormous car
with a huge turning circle?

295
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:23,924
Happily, the Fiat was small enough,
but I had another problem.

296
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:26,284
This just isn't working.

297
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:31,564
The visibility in the
C version with the sliding roof,

298
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:35,684
with the roof back, is, you know,
it's good compared to, say,

299
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,244
having a bag on your head
or being blind.

300
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:43,204
Eventually, I decided the best thing
was to abandon ship.

301
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:47,764
Right, I'm leaving the car here.
I'm going to go ahead on foot.

302
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:52,364
I know I can make it on foot,
find the way out, come back,
pick up the car, drive out and win.

303
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:56,884
This... this must be James's
idea of hell.

304
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:59,404
He gets lost in a hotel.

305
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:03,044
That was a curve in that road
which was essentially a right,

306
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:06,365
but now I've gone to a left, so I
must still be going the right way.

307
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:10,005
Driving through
somebody's restaurant.

308
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,525
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:19,404
Hang on a minute...

310
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:23,484
Is this...
Is this the square where I started?

311
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,684
Yes, it is.

312
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:28,404
Hang on.

313
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,884
That... That's the wall.

314
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,204
That's the city wall.

315
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:36,165
I've found it! There it is!

316
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:41,484
A bit of a hill.
Wasn't expecting that. Never mind.

317
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,845
Er...

318
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,284
No, it's that way.

319
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,964
Gearbox works.

320
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:53,964
Reverse, first, both good.

321
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,004
Meanwhile...

322
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:59,044
I think that ramp may have
been a bit of a mistake,

323
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:04,284
because the view from here and the
view over that way of trees

324
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:08,165
suggests I am actually
on top of the wall.
Still, could be worse.

325
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:13,924
Hi.

326
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,404
I recognise you! Yeah!

327
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:22,445
Have you seen a Fiat,
a small black and white Fiat...
on your travels?

328
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:28,924
Nothing to see here.

329
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:33,684
Just a man driving
on top of a historic monument.

330
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:39,005
Eventually, I found my car
and the way back to the city wall.

331
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:46,044
That's the first time since I left
that I've gone fast enough
to activate the central locking.

332
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:50,565
But outside the city gates,
Professor Smug was already there.

333
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:53,924
Yes, there's no missing it, is there?

334
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:56,804
A man standing next
to a child's training shoe.

335
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:58,884
Did you see Lord Lucan?

336
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:01,084
No. Oh, he's there. Shergar.

337
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:02,844
They're all in there.

338
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:07,604
'Even though James wasn't with us,
another challenge then turned up.'

339
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:09,844
Right.

340
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:13,524
"You will now drive
to the town of Canelli,

341
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:16,764
"which is 170 miles away, near Alba.

342
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:21,164
"En route, you must collect
the following items.

343
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:27,444
"A branch of a cedar tree, ice-cubes,
a photo of as many people
as you can getting into your car,

344
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:33,924
"a CD from a service station -
but you may not get
out of your car to get it...

345
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:36,844
"a bicycle, a vine and a dog."

346
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:39,324
A dog?!

347
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:40,924
A vine? A bicycle?

348
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:45,244
Whereabouts on the Riviera
are you going to find...?
And a branch of a cedar tree...

349
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:47,564
Oi! May!

350
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,244
Yeah?

351
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:53,164
What are you doing up there?
I can't find the way down.

352
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:57,964
After the idiot explained
his predicament, we filled him in
on our new challenge.

353
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,084
Dog?!

354
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:02,964
That's what I said, "A dog"!
What's the point of that?

355
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:05,484
It's to see how
practical the car is.

356
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,044
Well, off you go, then.

357
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:09,245
So we did.

358
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:16,125
Autostrada, here we go.

359
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:22,565
And as we headed north, we fell
even more in love with our cars.

360
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:29,284
If you have a big BMW or Mercedes,
it's like an expensive suit,

361
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:33,684
so it has to be a sober colour -
silver, black, grey.

362
00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:36,924
But if you have a hot hatch,
it's like a T-shirt.

363
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:42,484
It can be anything you want -
have writing on it,
it can be orange, anything.

364
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:45,804
That's why the DS3 Racing
is so brilliant,

365
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:49,525
cos they've just taken the
idea of fun and gone mad with it.

366
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:54,564
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Fizzy little car.

367
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:59,964
Just setting the cruise control,
Hammond. Are you able to do that?

368
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:03,684
Sorry, it's a bit windy in here.
I'm just going to close my roof.

369
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:08,044
Have you closed yours already?
Oh, you can't open it!

370
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:12,684
In all fairness, the Fiat and the
Citroen are very similarly equipped.

371
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:16,164
There are more things on the Citroen,
but this has everything you need.

372
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:21,285
Operate the stereo from the
steering wheel, electric windows,
electric roof that opens. Ha-ha!

373
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:27,004
Meanwhile, very far behind,
Captain Sense Of Direction

374
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:29,484
had finally found a way out of Lucca.

375
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:33,205
Bursting out
into the sunlight... now.

376
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:40,364
I don't doubt that the others
will be bleating on

377
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,964
about how they have sat nav
or leather upholstery, or whatever.
But that's not the point.

378
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:50,724
Renault has concentrated on the
things that make this a hot hatch
rather than just a hatchback.

379
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:55,644
They know your money goes on the
engine, this lovely steering wheel,
this fabulous gear change.

380
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:58,884
You get a dull interior.
It is very boring, very basic.

381
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:01,485
But I want this car to drive.

382
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:16,605
Soon, we were in the hills
and ready to start our challenge.

383
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,484
A bicycle, dog.

384
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:23,724
What else have we got? Ice cube.
Get that near the end or it'll melt.

385
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,964
I'm going to pull in the here

386
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:29,764
and attempt to buy a CD
without getting out of the car.

387
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:32,645
Branch of a cedar tree...

388
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,404
A vine.

389
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:40,285
To make life harder,
the producers hadn't given us
any money to buy things.

390
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:48,644
Fortunately, production has
supplied me with some
potential bartering items.

391
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:54,125
I have a CD here of
Robson & Jerome's love songs,
and I've also got this one, the...

392
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,004
A Cockney Christmas
with Chas & Dave.

393
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:02,244
Do you speak English?
A little bit.

394
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:08,884
Um... I may not get out of the car.
Chas & Dave -
molto popolare Inglese... um...

395
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,844
I don't understand.

396
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:18,164
Can you go really far? Really far.
Good, good, good.

397
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:21,204
There's three in the front
rightaway.

398
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,964
OK, let's go.

399
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:26,205
Suspension's gone down a bit.
That's ten.

400
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:29,724
In we go. Oh, thank you, madam,
for helping.

401
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:34,844
Right, I reckon we'll get
another four in the front.
Oh, cyclist! You'll be thin.

402
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:36,804
Skinny as a stick. Yes!

403
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:39,405
Scusi, signora.

404
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:45,525
It's his bottom. You've got
his bottom in your face there.

405
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,884
12.

406
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:50,724
13.

407
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:52,924
It's the 13th.

408
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:57,084
That is 13 people
in a Citroen DS3 Racing.

409
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,884
Beat that, Hammond. Beat that, May.

410
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:02,084
14. Count 'em up!

411
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:05,404
Oh, that is magnificent.
That's for Italy.

412
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,884
If I just do one for Italy, for Fiat.
Ya-ha! We're all excited.

413
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,164
Er...

414
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,685
Chas & Dave?

415
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:16,165
Robson e Jerome? Molto bene.

416
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,804
Since we had to be at
the finishing point by six

417
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:30,164
and there were bonus points
for getting there first,
it became a very busy afternoon.

418
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,844
Yes, that's a vineyard.

419
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:42,004
No, the CD, OK? In the shop?

420
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:45,684
Um, I'm a scientist

421
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:50,044
and I'm investigating the possible
medicinal healing qualities of vines.

422
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:54,284
Now, I am able to offer you
in part exchange

423
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:57,844
this commemorative plate.

424
00:29:57,845 --> 00:30:02,484
This! The swap. OK...

425
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:05,764
For a vine... Si.

426
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:13,125
I can give you molto valuable
Wills and Kate
souvenir wedding bell. Ah, OK.

427
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:22,165
That is a good stereo.

428
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,724
Can I just clarify, I'm not
looking for bicycles to steal.

429
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:34,565
Anyway, there's a policeman there.
But it's a policeman on a bicycle.

430
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:43,765
There you go. Off-roading.

431
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:48,165
Oh! Is that a cedar tree?

432
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:54,684
Citroen - pfff! Renault - ha!
Fiat... Fiat.

433
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,364
Ha! Better.

434
00:30:56,365 --> 00:31:00,284
Very, very good, Fiat.
Yes, exactly.

435
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:03,084
To show very good - bicycle in it.

436
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:07,644
It's a police bike in a Fiat,
it's just better!

437
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:09,125
Hang on.

438
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,244
I'm so hot.

439
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,365
How am I going to get
a bicycle in here as well?

440
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:29,924
Grazie.

441
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:32,164
Thank you. Thank you very much.

442
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:34,925
You don't have police dogs, do you?
Eh? No, never mind.

443
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:41,165
Oh, God! It smells terrible.

444
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:45,244
There were now just 20 minutes left

445
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:48,045
in which to scavenge
our remaining items.

446
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:52,004
I've got to get a cube of ice.
Not difficult.

447
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:54,204
A dog...

448
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:58,485
How do you scavenge a dog?

449
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,884
Come on. Come on.

450
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:09,284
Right, the final thing, ice.

451
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:12,044
Thank you so much for doing this.

452
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:15,924
You are so kind. Tres gentil.

453
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,325
Could you just stay here?
I have to get an ice cube.

454
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:22,725
Uno minuto. OK.

455
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:28,724
Really got to hurry now.
It's melting.

456
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:31,204
Come on.

457
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:33,164
Quicker, little Citroen.

458
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:36,964
Have you ever been in a car with a
tree growing out of the back, Theo?

459
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,885
Probably not.

460
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:43,884
James, too, had found a dog,

461
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:48,365
but sadly his speed was limited by
his ice-cube transportation system.

462
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,925
Which meant there was plenty
of time for conversation.

463
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,085
I like dogs and cats.

464
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:06,564
I've just got a wet seat.

465
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:09,004
That doesn't count.

466
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:11,405
There's one left.

467
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:16,885
Sorry about the noise. It's
the tree dragging on the road.

468
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:19,245
My ice cube is melting.

469
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,765
It's very pretty here, isn't it?

470
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,885
Now, come on. Don't melt.

471
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:35,645
Coming through.

472
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:41,084
Huh? Oh, it's there.

473
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,605
THUD!
Ooh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

474
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,684
Oh, no!

475
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:50,884
Er, that's... OK, yes.

476
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:56,804
That's an actual person.
Yes, yes. First of all, well
done, Hammond. Well done, well done.

477
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:58,924
That's ice, as is that.

478
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:00,524
As is that. Yes, it is.

479
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:03,804
Where's your dog? It's not a dog.
Yes, it is.

480
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:09,684
What this is, it's an acrylic fur
stuffed with industrial waste.
That's no way to talk about a dog.

481
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,044
Yes, it is.
Do you think this is a dog, dog?

482
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:16,965
Look at that.
That's proof enough for me!
You can have that, little friend.

483
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:23,204
James arrived just as
the last of his ice cubes melted.

484
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:25,324
Good evening. Good evening.

485
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:27,484
This is Francesca. Hello, Francesca.

486
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:30,244
Francesca, this is Jeremy
and Richard. Let me guess.

487
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:34,205
Christ, has he made you pregnant?
No. No. You work fast, mate.

488
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:40,765
Thank you.

489
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:45,164
We'll pick that up...

490
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:50,404
We'll pick that up later on,
but now it's time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

491
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,844
My guest tonight is a comedian

492
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:56,804
who spends his weekends with
other men dressed in leather.

493
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:00,444
He's part of a minority group
called motorcyclists.

494
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:04,444
Ladies and gentlemen, Ross Noble.

495
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:09,684
Good to see you, mate. How are you?
I'm very well.

496
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:13,124
Ross Noble, have a seat.
Thank you very much. Thanks.

497
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,844
I just...

498
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:20,044
Yeah, I just wanted to check because
I didn't realise that you actually

499
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:24,604
have a lady wrangler.
You have somebody that just finds
all the good-looking women

500
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,045
and pokes them with a stick.

501
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:28,324
"Get to the front,
get to the front!"

502
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:32,244
There's blokes in the middle
that literally come to this show

503
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:37,045
so that when the ladies move through
they just stand there. "Mmm."

504
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:42,404
I must move on, if we may. OK.

505
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:46,044
I've got a list here of your bikes
that you currently own. Right? Yeah.

506
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:51,924
Triumph Scrambler,
675R, Ducati Streetfighter. Yep.

507
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:57,964
BMW 450, KTM 250, Gas Gas 250
and a 1974 Norton Commando.

508
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:03,004
Why would you have so many, cos
they're all the same? That's quite
funny, cos since your researcher

509
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,924
talked to me about that,
I've bought another one,

510
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:07,805
just to annoy you!
Make bikes live for us.

511
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:11,804
I don't understand. They've
no styling. Why are they different?

512
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:17,564
To me, a car is a big box of metal
with somebody sitting inside it.

513
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:19,964
A bike, it's like you're
part of the bike.

514
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:24,204
You move on a bike
and you look where you want to go
and the bike goes.

515
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:26,524
You see what I mean?
You can move around on it.

516
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:31,804
But do you not get...?
Granted, granted, you can't have
a sandwich while you're doing it

517
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:34,924
but I'm working on that.
I'm going to go on Dragons' Den with

518
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:40,084
some sort of sandwich spring
that I can ride along and go...

519
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:44,284
I can tell you don't like cars
cos I've got a list
of your past car history.

520
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,004
MG Metro, Cavalier.

521
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:52,244
All these cars met with terrible
ends, didn't they, largely?
Yes. I have no...

522
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:56,124
What I like about a bike is,
if you get it wrong, you die.

523
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,244
You see what I mean?

524
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:00,884
What's good about that,
it sort of keeps me on my toes.

525
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,324
Whereas with a car...

526
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:07,644
I've got this Land Rover, I had
a couple of tractors as well

527
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:09,684
cos we still live in the country.

528
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,644
My wife had... You know
those big round bales of hay?

529
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:17,204
She said, "Can you move that into
the bottom field?"
"Yeah, easy enough."

530
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:20,524
I tried pushing it. A bit tricky,
so I thought, "What I'll do

531
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:25,644
"is gently nudge it with a car, the
Land Rover. They're built for it."

532
00:37:25,645 --> 00:37:27,964
So I went...

533
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:31,764
Crunch! And nothing happened.
I thought, "I'm going
to have to go faster."

534
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:35,844
So I floored it into this bale
of hay. I went, "Here we go,"

535
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:42,244
and it went "bang"!
Instead of pushing it,
the car mounted the bale of hay

536
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:47,004
so it just looked like the Land
Rover was humping the bale of hay.

537
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:49,405
Then the second one I wrote off.

538
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,884
I lived on...
It was old gravel roads

539
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:56,724
and I forgot I wasn't Colin McRae.

540
00:37:56,725 --> 00:38:01,724
The back of the car started to sort
of overtake me a bit and I thought,

541
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:03,604
"That can't be good."

542
00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:07,164
As it came round, the car went
up on two wheels

543
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:10,964
and then it went onto its side and
I started sliding down this hill.

544
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:15,364
My wife's lip balm hit me in
the face. There was crap everywhere
and dust.

545
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:19,165
The sat-nav just went,
"Off route, recalculating."

546
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:25,444
I had to crawl out the back.
Was that in Australia? Yes, it was.

547
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:29,804
You were unlucky in Australia
cos you got caught up
in those awful fires,

548
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:32,764
round Melbourne way, wasn't it,
in 2009? That's right.

549
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:38,244
We heard about them on the news
here, these bush fires,
but these were beyond belief.

550
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:42,964
Beyond anything you could possibly
imagine. Literally, it torched...

551
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:47,244
There was nothing left.
Our house was...

552
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:53,564
We had an oven, like one of these
wood-burning stove things.

553
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:57,564
You can heat them up to 2,000
degrees, and that had smashed

554
00:38:57,565 --> 00:39:00,444
and melted on the top.
That gives you an idea.

555
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:03,564
How fast do those fires move?

556
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:08,684
Normally a fire goes...
I think it's a metre a minute

557
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:11,524
and these things just, you know...

558
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:15,524
There were people trying to outrun
it and couldn't do it in cars.

559
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:18,484
So how did you get out?
I wasn't there, luckily.

560
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:23,684
Were the family there?
Yeah, my wife was driving
along with the flames behind her.

561
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:29,724
Yeah. How fast did she have to go?
I don't think she was looking
at the speedo, to be honest!

562
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,684
She absolutely was...?

563
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:36,644
Yeah, there were flames behind her
and it was all coming down.

564
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:41,284
They were horrible and I don't
think we really realise in this
country how horrible.

565
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:45,804
Yeah, it was something like
50 times the Hiroshima bomb,

566
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:51,564
that was the area of destruction.
So you've come back
to live in England now?

567
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:54,404
I have. Down in Kent.
Have you bought some land there?

568
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,964
I have. Is it the country living?
Organic farming?

569
00:39:56,965 --> 00:40:01,884
Oh, yeah. It's all organic,
the whole lot. Cheese-making.
Not really.

570
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:03,964
What have you done
with your paddock?

571
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:10,124
I have bought 150 traffic cones
off the internet and turned it

572
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,724
into a motorcycle racing track.

573
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:16,084
Which the neighbour's not too
happy about, to be honest.

574
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:18,404
Does he overlook your paddock?

575
00:40:18,405 --> 00:40:22,084
He does when he stands on a ladder
and shakes his...

576
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:25,604
I shouldn't be saying this on
the telly. It's a bit of a...

577
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:31,324
But, no. I mean, I love getting
out there and I've got tractors,

578
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:37,004
I've got earth-moving equipment. Oh!
And also, I bought a tank.

579
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:42,044
What sort of tank is yours?
Mine is an Abbot 433.

580
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:45,804
That's a self-propelled gun,
though, isn't it? Listen to you!

581
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:51,244
Military purists would say
that's self-propelled artillery.

582
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:52,365
It looks like a tank.

583
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,285
But when it comes up
behind you down the shops...

584
00:40:57,445 --> 00:41:01,364
This is the thing. It was one of
the best days of my life, actually.

585
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:03,884
When I got the tank delivered -
cos it's massive...

586
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:06,604
and the guy brings it
on a low-loader thing.

587
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:10,884
He turns up and says,
"There's no way that's going to go
up the country lanes.

588
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,644
"We're going to have to get the tank
off and drive it to your house."

589
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:21,604
The tank is there, my car is here,
and this is possibly the greatest
motoring experience of my life.

590
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:24,084
I'm driving along, in me Hilux.
I come through.

591
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:28,284
There are two hedges either side and
I drive halfway through and the tank

592
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,765
is trying to keep up.
He's going as fast as he can.

593
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:34,964
I stop and a little old fellow
comes round the corner.

594
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:37,724
Now I've gone further down
the narrow bit than he has

595
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:40,804
and he stopped.
And I went, "Go back."

596
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,724
And he went, "No."

597
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:48,804
You know when you just think, "I
couldn't have set this up better."

598
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:54,005
I went, "Go back",
and he went, "No." I went...

599
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:59,004
And the gun appeared
and the guy went,

600
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:00,844
"Oh, bloody hell!"

601
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:05,204
Murray Mints flying all over.
Are you actually allowed
to drive it on the road?

602
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:07,884
Not only are you allowed
to drive it on the road,

603
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:12,044
it's congestion-charge exempt.
How good is that?!

604
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:22,204
Oh, I love that. This is great.
I have to say, the lap...

605
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:26,324
Yes. We've heard about your
car history. It's shocking.
So did you crash?

606
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:28,444
Today? Yeah. Yep.

607
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:34,564
Does anybody want to see the clip
of the first attempt?
Yes!

608
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:35,884
Let's have a look.

609
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:40,605
Here we are, coming after the second
to last corner. Here's Gambon.

610
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:50,444
Cutting the corner can help!

611
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:53,724
Who would like to see
the actual lap?

612
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:56,485
Yes!
OK, let's play the tape.

613
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:01,244
That's good. And...

614
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:06,284
It looks like them
Duke boys dumped themselves
in a whole heap of trouble.

615
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:10,284
Right, there we go, first corner.

616
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:11,684
Tortured tyres.

617
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:15,084
Squealing like a pig, boy!
Squeal like a pig.

618
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:17,084
Alice Cooper was talking about pigs.

619
00:43:17,085 --> 00:43:19,885
Drive it like you've stolen it.

620
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,885
That's a wide line.

621
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:30,364
Oh! Ooh!

622
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:34,444
Some valves coming out of the bonnet
now as we turn into the Hammerhead,

623
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,124
keeping it nicely between the lines.
That looks very fast.

624
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,605
You've gone into a trance.

625
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:46,764
Flat out... Flat out through here.
There we go. Woo-hoo!

626
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:57,764
Best to keep your eyes open
on that bit. Well, you know.

627
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,684
Let's have a look. This is...

628
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:01,764
That was absolute bang on.

629
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:05,244
And cutting it again
or have we learned our lesson? No?

630
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:07,844
I say, gosh! That is...

631
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,884
very good.

632
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:12,805
That was a good couple
of last corners there.

633
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:19,244
These are the times.

634
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,964
Where do you think?

635
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:22,884
Who's another biker on there?

636
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:24,684
Eh... Bill Bailey. Is he a biker?

637
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:28,564
No. Do you really want
to see Bill on a bike?

638
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,005
Eh... Um... Oh...

639
00:44:33,685 --> 00:44:37,204
No, I don't, actually. I tell
you what, Tom Cruise is a biker.

640
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:41,284
Oh, yeah. All right, I'll be
one ahead of Tom Cruise then.

641
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,404
Just put me out of my misery.

642
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:46,924
One... Right.

643
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,205
40...

644
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:53,524
Tom Cruise is 1.44.2. Oh, stop it!

645
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:58,364
You're 1.43...
Whoo!

646
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,565
Ladies and gentlemen,
the second fastest man...

647
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:06,644
we've ever had! Ross Noble!

648
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,404
Thank you very much.

649
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:12,245
Bloody hell!

650
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,724
Yeah.

651
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:17,804
I have to say,

652
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:20,124
it's those last two corners.

653
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,364
They were absolutely perfect.

654
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:27,444
Aw, look, I was beaten
by another Northern comic.

655
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:32,644
The Northern comics are the fastest
people in the world,
as it turns out.

656
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:36,124
Yeah. Do you know how quickly
we get home from our gigs?

657
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:42,645
Ladies and gentlemen, nearly
a record-breaker, all-round good
guy, Ross Noble. Thank you.

658
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:53,604
Now, tonight we are reviewing
the boring Renault Clio Cup...

659
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:54,645
It's not boring.

660
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:57,524
Yes, it is.
..the childish Citroen DS3 Racing

661
00:45:57,525 --> 00:46:00,204
and the excellent Fiat 500 Abarth.

662
00:46:00,205 --> 00:46:03,004
So far we've found out
what they're like in town,

663
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:06,084
what they're like at
being hatchbacks, but now it's time

664
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:09,404
to find out what they're like
when you put your foot down.

665
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:12,084
The producers told us
to leave our overnight halt,

666
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:16,445
here in the foothills of the Italian
Alps, and drive to Monaco down here.

667
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:35,404
Right, at last.

668
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,724
A chance to drive this little thing.

669
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:41,084
Steering just feels fabulous.

670
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:44,325
Oh! A little crackle
and bang on the overrun.

671
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:50,604
Oh, yes, this thing grips.

672
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:56,164
The grip is helped, no doubt,
by being short and fat,

673
00:46:56,165 --> 00:46:58,004
so it's square on the road.

674
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:00,004
Oh!

675
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:03,165
I don't think I'd change
anything about this.

676
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:11,084
In a straight line, this is
by far the fastest of the three.

677
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:15,044
0-60, 6.5 seconds.

678
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:19,324
The funny thing is,
even though it's called "the Racing"

679
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:23,604
and it was designed
by Citroen's motorsport division,

680
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:27,004
it doesn't actually feel like
a racing car or a rally car.

681
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:31,124
It feels soft,
it feels very Citroeny, quiet.

682
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,404
And then there's the steering.

683
00:47:33,405 --> 00:47:35,524
There's no feel to it at all.

684
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:40,684
You sort of have to guess how much
lock to put in for each corner.

685
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:42,965
Is it this much? No, more.

686
00:47:49,805 --> 00:47:51,564
Here's a fact.

687
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:55,364
Hammond has a 1.4 litre
turbocharged engine,

688
00:47:55,365 --> 00:47:58,764
Jeremy has a 1.6 litre
turbocharged engine.

689
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:03,964
I have two litres,
no turbocharger, and that's
important because there's no lag.

690
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,804
There you go.
Through the bend, there's the power.

691
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:11,364
The trouble was, though, it wasn't
actually getting me anywhere.

692
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:15,364
Hammond's little boot thing
takes off like a rocket.

693
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,804
He's getting away!

694
00:48:17,805 --> 00:48:21,724
The problem with that Renault is,
brilliant though the suspension is
and so on,

695
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:26,725
it weighs more than the QE2 and you
can see that coming out of
the corners. It doesn't get going.

696
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:32,124
Though that could have
something to do with its driver.

697
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:35,285
An interesting old bell tower
over there.

698
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:39,685
Eventually we reached the Riviera.

699
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:46,324
There's the Mediterranean,
glistening blue, which is amazing

700
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:49,084
considering how many turds
there are in it.

701
00:48:49,085 --> 00:48:54,684
As we approached Monte Carlo,
I heard a familiar sound.

702
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:57,645
Chaps...

703
00:48:59,285 --> 00:49:02,204
I think the Grand Prix is on.

704
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,764
Oh, my God,

705
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:07,965
I think, down there...
Which Grand Prix?

706
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:16,404
Have either of you two ever watched
the Monaco Grand Prix? I think
I watched it in the early '80s.

707
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:18,604
That's the one in the town, right?

708
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:23,404
Never has anyone had to work
with such imbeciles.

709
00:49:23,405 --> 00:49:29,364
In the hills above Monaco, we were
told to pull over for a challenge.

710
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:31,204
I love that sound.

711
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:36,444
"Tomorrow, you will do three laps
of the Monaco Grand Prix track.

712
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:39,924
"Whoever posts
the fastest time wins."

713
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:41,804
The Monaco Grand Prix track?

714
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:44,085
I'm going to drive around... That?!

715
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:50,444
My hair is just... Seriously,
that is just the boyhood dream!

716
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:55,244
Hang on, if we've got to do
hot laps of the actual... That puts
you at a bit of an advantage.

717
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:58,804
Not really. I've never actually
driven round it
when it's a racetrack.

718
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:03,644
I don't know the fastest line
through Rascasse!
I don't know what Rascasse is!

719
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:07,284
I don't know where it goes.
You know how difficult
I find it remembering a track.

720
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:10,884
Am I going to get a go round?
Can I look at a picture of it?
I don't know!

721
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:13,445
Exactly! I'll be driving
around a foreign town.

722
00:50:15,565 --> 00:50:21,764
When the Grand Prix practice was
over, we went in search of some F1
drivers so we could get some tips.

723
00:50:21,765 --> 00:50:24,644
And immediately,
I found David Coulthard.

724
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:30,764
And the key here is speed up the
hill, not speed into St Devote.

725
00:50:30,765 --> 00:50:34,084
Concentrate on
really getting that car turned,

726
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:37,924
early on the power, because what
you gain here, if you get on
the power two metres early,

727
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:40,884
you'll add five kilometres an hour
to your top speed.

728
00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:45,204
So there is a noticeable crest
there? Yes. You'll see as you're
coming over the crest.

729
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:50,124
You've got a lot of grippy tarmac
there. On the apex? On the apex.

730
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,124
Meanwhile, down in the harbour,

731
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,724
my colleagues had been rather
distracted by all the parties.

732
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:59,164
Thank you, gentlemen. Oh!

733
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:02,284
Look confident.
Look like you do this all the time.

734
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:05,444
Grab that woman with the things
on sticks. What?

735
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:08,284
Where would you try
in a road car to go by?

736
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:11,844
A good run through
the tunnel and then on the brakes.
The left-right?

737
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:18,364
So, over the crest, then as soon as
you see his brake lights come on,
count and you're in.

738
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:20,404
And then go on the left, stay left?
Yeah.

739
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:23,644
We're doing a bit of driving
around the track, you know,

740
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,044
analysing some of the corners.

741
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:32,324
So, if you live in Monaco, do you
drive around where the track is?
All the time. Good.

742
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:35,284
What hints have you got for me? I've
got to drive around it tomorrow...

743
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:39,004
Use the kerbs at four and five.
It gives more grip.

744
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:40,604
Four and five? Yeah.

745
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:44,164
And at Rascasse, I can take a lot of
entry speed into that... Yeah.

746
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:46,884
..and then use the front-wheel drive
to wash it off?

747
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:53,524
Well, it's very much a party
sort of place. It has
very elegant properties.

748
00:51:53,525 --> 00:51:59,285
It's like Monaco in many ways,
actually.
Have you ever been to Hammersmith?

749
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:04,644
At the end of the evening,
we met up to compare notes.

750
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:07,964
Have you found anything
about the track out?

751
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:11,884
Yes, I have. It's just over there,
there's all these boats,
and it's really busy.

752
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:16,324
Have you talked to a single
racing driver? Yes, we have. Who?

753
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:20,844
A very nice man called
Tim O'Glock. An Irishman...

754
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:23,365
Timo Glock! Timo Glock, yes.

755
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:35,684
The next morning,
the producers decided that because
the track has no run-off areas,

756
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:40,684
and is very dangerous, none
of us could drive around it unless
we had a bit of tuition first.

757
00:52:40,685 --> 00:52:45,244
Richard's tutor was Red Bull
team boss Christian Horner.

758
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:49,684
I got former Renault boss
Flavio Briatore.

759
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:52,804
And Jeremy was given
an elderly gentleman.

760
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:55,364
Bernie Ecclestone.

761
00:52:55,365 --> 00:53:00,444
Bernie Ecclestone, as I live and
breathe! How are you this morning?
Good. Michel!

762
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:07,444
Bernie? Listen, we need these
other two cars disqualified, huh?
No problem, no problem!

763
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:10,044
It was time to begin.

764
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,764
There's a flag waving.
Oh, we're off.

765
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:16,764
Try and hook a right here.
We have to stay left, I reckon.

766
00:53:16,765 --> 00:53:20,524
No, you have to go there.

767
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:25,924
Bernie, you old cheat!
We gained a bit! We gained a lot!

768
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:28,764
Let's go over to the right a bit,
shall we?

769
00:53:28,765 --> 00:53:33,444
And then... What was that lift,
what was that lift?! I didn't need
to lift there, did I? No!

770
00:53:33,445 --> 00:53:38,764
I have to slow a bit.
Further. Go down with the gears.
Jesus Christ!

771
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:42,604
That's a tight right. Brake, brake,
brake. What are you doing?

772
00:53:42,605 --> 00:53:44,845
Brake. Oh, my God!

773
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:51,804
There are actually people watching
as well. What do they expect,
I wonder.

774
00:53:51,805 --> 00:53:53,605
They expect an accident.

775
00:53:57,845 --> 00:54:02,445
You lifted it! I'm terrified!
I don't know what's going to happen!
Oh, God!

776
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:05,804
It's secondo for this one.

777
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:07,964
Just brake, Jesus Christ.

778
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:11,004
Be careful now, huh? Yep.
Left, right...

779
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:12,564
It's too complicated, this.

780
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:17,364
Get the kerb on the left.
You missed it. Get the curb
on the right. You missed it.

781
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:18,844
Try and get this kerb.

782
00:54:18,845 --> 00:54:21,284
Christ, we missed that one as well!

783
00:54:21,285 --> 00:54:23,604
Now, Rascasse. Brake now.

784
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:26,164
Oh, really late? Accelerate now.

785
00:54:26,165 --> 00:54:29,604
Tuition over,
we ditched the teachers...

786
00:54:29,605 --> 00:54:32,444
That was good. Come on,
that was good! Jesus Christ.

787
00:54:32,445 --> 00:54:35,484
..and set off on our warm-up lap.

788
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:39,844
I am out of my depth to a degree
I've never before experienced.

789
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:44,445
The crowds were beside themselves
as we started our first lap.

790
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:47,565
Here we go.

791
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:52,924
OK.

792
00:54:52,925 --> 00:54:54,565
Now, this creeps up on you.

793
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:03,525
Whoa!

794
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:10,805
I'm struggling, I'm struggling!
Come on, Rich!

795
00:55:15,805 --> 00:55:19,365
Wait till you can see the Armco
before braking. That's now.

796
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:33,965
- Flavio corner.
- Jesus Christ-ah!

797
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:43,765
I caught them up.

798
00:55:45,685 --> 00:55:49,245
Well late going in there.
Get in, get in.

799
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,244
It is simply terrifying.
You just have no...

800
00:55:54,245 --> 00:55:57,925
I mean, look - fine, dead.

801
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:10,564
Oh, dear God. That's Hammond
dealt with in the tunnel.

802
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:13,084
Now, James will not
know where he's going.

803
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:15,524
OK, now we come down
to the chicane, I think.

804
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:18,085
Or is it Raser-ma-casse-er-ma-casse?

805
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:25,245
Jezzer's going to have me
here, I can feel it coming.

806
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:32,325
Under-braking.
Get the grip from the zebra.

807
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:35,845
Got him.

808
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:38,805
Get this kerb.

809
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:45,484
Ooh, this is risky.
I don't know the way!

810
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,404
Hammond, you bugger.

811
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,925
Oh, God almighty!
I may have cocked that up a bit.

812
00:56:54,605 --> 00:56:59,005
We now had just one lap left.
It had to be a fast one.

813
00:57:02,845 --> 00:57:06,044
My last ever lap
of the Monaco Grand Prix track.

814
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:08,484
Don't mess
this corner up again, Jeremy.

815
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:10,005
Whoa!

816
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:18,205
Just leave it in third.

817
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:22,205
Change into second.

818
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:26,045
That was better.

819
00:57:26,046 --> 00:57:29,285
Careful,
the barrier! It comes out-ah.

820
00:57:30,725 --> 00:57:33,045
Get it in now.

821
00:57:44,605 --> 00:57:45,885
Flat, flat, flat!

822
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:49,484
Oh!

823
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:54,205
Aargh! He's getting away!
My mighty Fiat roaring
in the tunnel at Monaco!

824
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:58,485
Topless women. Mustn't look.

825
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:03,525
I can see why racing drivers love
this track. You are just on it.

826
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:14,725
Don't... Oh, God, strewth.

827
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:18,885
I think this is it.

828
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:22,405
Come on, everything you can.

829
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:28,604
Oh, my God!

830
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,804
What an extraordinary day!

831
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:37,324
I have to say,
that's pretty special.

832
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:41,804
What a fantastic moment.

833
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:47,005
Thank you, Bernie. Thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you so much!

834
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:56,085
That was amazing. It was.

835
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:01,204
I really do mean that.

836
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,844
I really do mean that.

837
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:06,444
I've never had a day I've
enjoyed more, working, than that.

838
00:59:06,445 --> 00:59:11,524
It was amazing. I'm not exactly
steeped in F1 folklore, but still,

839
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:15,244
that was the most amazing track
driving experience I've ever had.

840
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:17,724
And I've always thought
the Monaco track worked

841
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:22,884
because of where it was, the harbour
and the palace. But you could pick
it up and put it in a field

842
00:59:22,885 --> 00:59:26,564
in Lancashire, and it would still be
a fantastic thing to drive around.

843
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:31,764
Yeah, absolutely. It would
certainly be better than
the Nurburgring, wouldn't it?

844
00:59:31,765 --> 00:59:35,004
It is now time to work out
which of these cars is best.

845
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:38,324
We begin with the
getting out of Lucca challenge.

846
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:42,444
Jeremy, I believe you arrived first.
Yeah. So you get ten points.

847
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,484
Good. Hammond, you were second,
so you get five points.

848
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:48,964
And I, of course, was last
so I only get two points.

849
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:54,884
However, the producers have said
that any man who loses his car

850
00:59:54,885 --> 00:59:59,644
in the city is actually
disqualified. So, Hammond,
I'm afraid you've got nought.

851
00:59:59,645 --> 01:00:03,964
Oh, I can see where
this is going already.

852
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:06,404
Nought for that.
Now, the scavenger hunt...

853
01:00:06,405 --> 01:00:11,284
er, Hammond, you finished first,
so you get ten points.

854
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:13,404
I was second so I get five.

855
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,484
James, you were last so you get two.

856
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:17,924
However, because your
ice cube had melted,

857
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:20,764
I'm afraid you lose a point for
that so you actually only get one.

858
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:23,844
Oh, dear. Interestingly enough,
Hammond, the producers said

859
01:00:23,845 --> 01:00:29,764
that because your dog wasn't real,
that is minus two points.
Minus two? Yes.

860
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:34,884
And also because your cedar tree
turned out to be a larch,
that's another minus two.

861
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:39,844
Yeah, and finally, you didn't get
a CD. So that's minus...
Oh, let me guess! Is it six?

862
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:43,404
Yes, it is! Is it? Is it really?

863
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:47,164
So, six and two... Is nought.
Yes, it is. Nought for that.

864
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:51,644
People in the car -
James, you got 12.

865
01:00:51,645 --> 01:00:56,204
I got 13 in the Citroen.
And you got nought.

866
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:58,484
I got 14 for that. What?

867
01:00:58,485 --> 01:01:03,764
I got 14! No, the producers have said
that because your people weren't
actually in your convertible,

868
01:01:03,765 --> 01:01:08,404
there were sort of on it, you were
disqualified, so... They were in it!
Oh, for God's sake.

869
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:13,124
Nought. Now, the big one,
the lap times. Hammond...

870
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,124
I did it in the Fiat in
two minutes 20 seconds.

871
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,324
Ooh, two minutes 21.

872
01:01:18,325 --> 01:01:19,364
Close.

873
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:21,044
This is tricky.

874
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:24,804
Well, I've got to look pleased
now, haven't I, without being smug?

875
01:01:24,805 --> 01:01:27,124
You're not pulling that off.

876
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,444
Two minutes 15. Oh, God.

877
01:01:29,445 --> 01:01:32,244
So, I get ten points. Do you?

878
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:36,124
Er, wait a minute, you get...

879
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,044
Well, it can't be nought
this time, can it? I finished!

880
01:01:39,045 --> 01:01:44,164
You get five, and you get...
I'm afraid last again,
so that's another two.

881
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:47,204
OK, so, let's tot up the totals.

882
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:50,924
Jeremy, you have 38.

883
01:01:50,925 --> 01:01:53,244
Excellent. The Citroen has won.

884
01:01:53,245 --> 01:01:59,164
I've got 17, and Hammond, I'm
afraid you have five. Five.

885
01:01:59,165 --> 01:02:02,644
No, you see, he doesn't. Really?
No, because the producer said

886
01:02:02,645 --> 01:02:06,324
it was a test of hot hatchbacks,
and you must have a points deduction

887
01:02:06,325 --> 01:02:08,844
for turning up
in a car that wasn't a hatchback.

888
01:02:08,845 --> 01:02:12,204
Really? How many points does
he lose for that?

889
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:16,004
It's five. Is it really?!

890
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:20,004
So, I get nought... again. Yes.

891
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:24,844
And on that bombshell, it's time
to end. Thank you very much
for watching. Good night!
