1
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:16,104
Tonight, I talk to two old ladies.

2
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:19,545
Richard makes a phone call.

3
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,306
And James sniffs his own armpit.

4
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:27,066
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,587
Good evening, hello.

6
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,227
Hello, everybody.
Thank you so much, thank you.

7
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:37,628
Now...

8
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:41,747
we start tonight with the big one,

9
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:46,629
the all-new, all-British
McLaren MP4-12C.

10
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,308
And there are two questions.

11
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:51,949
One, why have they named it
after a fax machine?

12
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:58,509
And two, how can it possibly
be as good as a Ferrari 458?

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,990
'McLaren themselves admit
that the 458 is a great car.

14
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:14,311
'But they say that,
scientifically and mathematically,

15
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,792
'they can prove that,
in every single measurable way,

16
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,952
'their new car is better.

17
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:58,596
'Well, certainly at £168,000
it is a tiny bit...'

18
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:03,917
I was going to say cheaper,
let's say less expensive
than the Ferrari.

19
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:08,117
'It's also a tiny bit kinder
to the environment,'

20
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:11,958
a tiny bit lighter,
a tiny bit more economical.

21
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,279
'It's also quite a lot
more powerful.'

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,120
The Ferrari has to make do
with just 562 horsepower,

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,601
whereas the twin turbocharged
3.8 litre V8 in this
churns out 592.

24
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:51,602
'The result is simple.

25
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:59,844
'0-60 takes 3.1 seconds.
The top speed is 205.

26
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:03,324
'And though it's close...

27
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:06,084
'the Ferrari cannot live with that.

28
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:09,764
'And it's a similar story
when the going gets twisty.'

29
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:31,888
'I love that Ferrari, and it is
as quick round here...'

30
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,927
as an Enzo.

31
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,767
But I think this is quicker still.

32
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:42,528
Ferrari has been in the Formula One
game longer than anybody,

33
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:47,209
but McLaren, amazingly,
has a higher hit rate.

34
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,249
'They've won one in every four
Grands Prix they've ever entered.

35
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:55,570
'Which shows they certainly
know how to make a car
go round a corner.'

36
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,410
My God, they've
worked their magic with this.

37
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,171
Can you see the Ferrari waggling
its tail there? This isn't.

38
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:15,612
This grips onto the road
like a terrified toddler
grips on to its mother's hand.

39
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:18,493
So, Lewis Hamilton, watch and learn.

40
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:21,413
'This is how you pass a Ferrari...'

41
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:27,173
without crashing into it.
Oh, yes!

42
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:43,215
'One of the reasons
the McLaren is so fast
is its traction control system.

43
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,175
'A system that really
comes into its own in the rain.

44
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:59,657
'It lets you drive hard,
but it won't let you kill yourself.

45
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:04,418
'And that is just the tip
of a technological iceberg.

46
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:12,179
'There's a flap on the back
which raises when you brake hard,

47
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,139
'so you can't see what's about
to crash into the back of you.

48
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,379
'And then we get to the suspension.

49
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,660
'A computer has replaced
the anti-roll bars,

50
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,300
'so all four wheels are truly
independent of one other.

51
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,101
'This gives you better cornering
and, more importantly,
a better ride.'

52
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,662
Over the years, we've seen
the Stig cutting this corner,

53
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:43,062
putting two wheels on the grass
to get the best possible lap times.

54
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:51,583
But if you ride a bump like that

55
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,104
in the sort of hunkered-down,
firmed-up cars
that he drives...

56
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,024
the jolt is horrific.

57
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:03,384
It's like being dipped
in liquid nitrogen and
then hit with a hammer.

58
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:05,024
You just sort of shatter.

59
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,865
'In the McLaren, though,
it's a very different experience.'

60
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:12,865
There we go,
two wheels off the track.

61
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:20,506
You'd get more of a jolt
if you drove a Rolls-Royce
over a Jaffa cake.

62
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,667
'I've never driven a supercar
that's even half

63
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,227
'as comfortable as this.

64
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:31,748
'Or as well-trimmed.

65
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:36,468
'It's all exquisite leather and
stitching and beautiful graphics.

66
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:41,909
'It's a simple, elegant,
a truly lovely place to sit.'

67
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:45,749
So, yes, in every scientific
and mathematical way,

68
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:49,149
this is better than a Ferrari 458.

69
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,390
It'll even do 30 miles
to the gallon.

70
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,710
But there's something missing,
something that can't be measured,

71
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,790
something you can't really
put your finger on.

72
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,031
There's no... zing.

73
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:11,072
'This is the factory
where the McLaren is made.

74
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:14,992
'It's like a laboratory.
It's quiet, ordered,

75
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:18,313
'a magnesium and titanium
Trappist world

76
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,273
'where perfection
isn't quite good enough.

77
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,914
'It's very nice.

78
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:26,393
'But you can't imagine anyone
here has ever put a whoopee cushion

79
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:28,794
'on the managing director's chair.

80
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:36,275
'You sense this lack of joy
when you're behind the wheel.

81
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,915
'When you drive a Lamborghini,'

82
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:43,156
it's like you're operating
a horse with some mustard
stuck up its bottom,

83
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:47,116
'but when you drive this,
it's like you're operating'

84
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:52,357
the sort of machine they use,
I imagine, in ophthalmic surgery.

85
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:56,957
'We see the same problem
with the way the McLaren looks.

86
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:02,438
'There's nothing wrong with it,
but there's no art.

87
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:07,198
'You get the sense it was styled
by software and shaped by science.

88
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:09,479
'Which it probably was.'

89
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,318
I'll give you another example.

90
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,599
You can turn
the traction control off,

91
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,600
but it'd be easier to launch the
missiles from a nuclear submarine.

92
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,000
You have to push that button and
hold it down for 10 seconds,

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
then you push those two
simultaneously,

94
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,641
and I said to one of the engineers,
"Why does it have to be
so complicated?"

95
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,681
He said, "Why would you want to turn
the traction control off?"

96
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,161
I said, "Well, it'd be fun."

97
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:36,322
And you could see him thinking,
"Hmm, fun?

98
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:39,402
"I must look that up
in a dictionary."

99
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:44,803
'The McLaren, then,
is like a pair of tights.

100
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:48,403
'Very practical and very sensible.

101
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:55,524
'The Ferrari, though,
that is a pair of stockings.'

102
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,807
What are you on about?

103
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:25,127
Well, tights and stockings are
designed to do exactly the same job.

104
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,527
But they don't.

105
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,408
I don't know,
I only wear socks, Jeremy.

106
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:33,968
Can we just move on from the hosiery,
chaps, back to the car?

107
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:36,049
Is the ride really that good?

108
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,529
Like a Rolls-Royce.
Unbelievably smooth.

109
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,609
And do you know why?
Wasn't developed at the Nurburgring.

110
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,609
Oh, God, he's off again.

111
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,969
True fact, it was developed,
actually,

112
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,970
at the Top Gear test track,
this car was,

113
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,770
so it should be able to set
a blisteringly fast lap time.

114
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,691
Of course, to find out we have to
give it to our racing driver.

115
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:58,291
Some say that he refuses
to acknowledge

116
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,492
the existence of Nottinghamshire.

117
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,011
LAUGHTER

118
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,051
And that he recently received
a very strong e-mail

119
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,692
from his fiancee's mother

120
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:10,733
saying it's bad manners to sit
at the dinner table in a helmet.

121
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,252
LAUGHTER

122
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:15,053
All we know is
he's called the Stig!

123
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:17,893
'And it's off.

124
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,854

OK.

Here is the Ferrari 458, 1.19.1.
The Ferrari Enzo 1.90.

147
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:38,943
The MP4-12C, 1.16.2.

It is the second fastest car
we've ever had here!

149
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:48,544
Wow! That's amazing.

150
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:53,145
Right, now, we must move on
because it is time for the news,

151
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,545
and we start with news
of an event coming up,

152
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:58,265
the Cholmondeley Pageant of Power.

153
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:01,105
The what?
Cholmondeley Pageant of Power.

154
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:03,986
Excellent. We're the world's
biggest motoring show,

155
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,625
and we begin the news
with an item about a village fete.

156
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,026
No, it's like a northern
Goodwood Festival of Speed.

157
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,706
So a Goodwood with pies
and gravy? No!

158
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:17,187
Anyway, the point is
there's going to be a car
at it I wanted to show you.

159
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:21,107
It's this, it's called the Brutus.

160
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,467
Yeah, it's magnificent.

161
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:27,188
Basically it's a 1908 BMW chassis,
made in the 1920s

162
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:30,909
and it's got a 46 litre
12 cylinder aeroplane...

163
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:34,989
46 litre?! 46 litre 12 cylinders.
Here's the actual engine out of it.

164
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,829
Look at that! Holy cow!

165
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:40,549
It's like a Turner painting,
all this steam, speed and fire.

166
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,429
It's magnificent. I'm going
to send that to Greenpeace
to hang up in their foyer.

167
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:48,910
They'd love it, actually,
because it does 0.18 miles
to the gallon.

168
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,830
You're kidding?

169
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,111
I love the engine,
but what fascinates me
about old cars like this

170
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:58,671
is why people feel compelled
to get into period costume
before driving them.

171
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:01,071
I mean, you live in a 1970s house.

172
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,472
Do you feel the need to wear a shirt
from the 19... Yes, you do.

173
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,592
He does, actually, yes.

174
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:10,353
Anyway, we have more news.

175
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:13,593
A few weeks ago
I held a small birthday party
for the E-Type Jaguar.

176
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,153
Yes, I recall, it was subtle.

177
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:20,074
Somebody else is having one
at Silverstone on
the weekend of 22nd July,

178
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:22,394
and they say 1,000
E-Types will be there.

179
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:27,555
I think what they mean is 1,000
E-Types will attempt to be there.

180
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:32,996
On that particular day,
1,000 E-Types will try and start.
Yeah, some E-Types will be there.

181
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:35,836
Why will they be there?
I've never understood that.

182
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:38,636
You drive hundreds of miles
in your car to look at some cars

183
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:41,997
that are exactly the same
as the car that you
just drove there in?

184
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:44,596
Well, is there anyone here
from a car owners' club?

185
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,317
You are?

186
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:53,597
And this is which club? Marlin.
The what? Marlin. That's a fish.

187
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:57,678
That's a very lonely owners' club.

188
00:13:57,678 --> 00:14:01,119
He goes and stands in a field
all by himself.

189
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,479
Is there anybody here
from a car club that's got
more than one member?

190
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,640
What?

191
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,799
Renault Clio.

192
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,040
Renault Clio owners' club?!
How can there be a club for that?

193
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,360
Do you go and meet
and stand in fields? Car-parks.

194
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,720
Car parks?

195
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Oh, I want to join!

196
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
"I've got a Renault Clio."
"So have I!"

197
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,841
Any other car makers here?

198
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:24,601
Anyone from the MG owners' club?
Not here, obviously.

199
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:28,322
That's a good point,
they won't be here, they'll be
on the A3 going, "Oh, no!"

200
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:32,962
I wonder sometimes,
do people who are MG enthusiasts

201
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:36,482
buy them hoping they break down?

202
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:41,043
They do. They do.
"That way I can get underneath it
and get my fingernails all dirty!"

203
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,923
No, cos if all they wanted
to do was drive around
in an open-topped two-seater

204
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:48,324
they'd buy a Mazda MX-5,
cos that'll always work.
I think they're mad.

205
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:50,405
It's like being an amateur vet
and saying,

206
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,845
"I'm going to deliberately
buy a dog that's poorly

207
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:56,005
"in the hope it goes wrong
and I can fix it."

208
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:57,245
LAUGHTER

209
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,765
Now, there is a new BMW M5, we can
tell you several things about it.

210
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,086
First of all, it'll cost £73,000.

211
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:05,406
Secondly, it's based on
the current 5-Series,

212
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,446
one of the best-looking cars around.
That looks even better.

213
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:12,807
Thirdly, the engine, for the first
time, is turbo-charged
because of some air problem,

214
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:15,207
carbon dioxide,
it has to be cleaner,

215
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:19,288
and it'll also, even though
I haven't driven it,
be fantastic to drive.

216
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:20,647
I know that. It will.

217
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,848
All M5s have always been fantastic,
there's never been a bad one.

218
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:27,648
No, there hasn't. There's a lot
on this as well, a lot of equipment.

219
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,688
It's got a rear-view camera,

220
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:33,849
it's also got a multimedia system
that can bring up Facebook
and Twitter.

221
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,930
I don't want one anymore.

222
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,250
Why would you want that
on your dashboard?

223
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,690
Driving up the A1, "Oh, look,
Lilly Allen's having sardines."

224
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,370
It's not relevant.
Is that necessary?

225
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,251
Do fighter pilots have Twitter
on their dash? Yes.

226
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:52,171
"I'm locked on to target. Oh,
hang on. Stephen Fry's just said
something brainy about a play."

227
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:53,732
You don't need...

228
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:57,211
I really do think we get
too much information
when we're driving now.

229
00:15:57,211 --> 00:16:01,132
Those signs that say
'spray possible', which,
on a nice day in June, it isn't.

230
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:05,373
And you know those posters,
they used to be adverts that said,

231
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:09,613
"Drink food and eat beer,"
or whatever it is on them,
"Use toothpaste".

232
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:12,254
Now they've made them electronic,
and Sky News has one

233
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,974
and it gives you snippets
of news as you drive by.

234
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,654
I drove past one the other day,
it'd be OK if it was short,
but it's quite long,

235
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:24,014
so you're going,
"JK Rowling sacks agent after..."
Not looking where you're going.

236
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:27,335
I drove down the A40 just after you
and the headline was quite brief.

237
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:30,736
It said,
"Clarkson has massive accident."

238
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:34,256
Now, can I just say, as we know,

239
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,776
birds sometimes defecate
on your car.

240
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:40,457
At this time of year
that's bad for the paintwork
cos the lacquer is soft.

241
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,857
What? Where are you going
with this, mate?

242
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:48,218
Where I'm going is this.
A bird defecated on my car
this week. That's terrible.

243
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,578
That's not that unusual.
It'll have happened to people here.

244
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,818
Not like this.

245
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:57,938
OK, I've brought an iPad here,
I know how they work, of course.

246
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:01,139
Here is the bird. Yes, it's some
bird poo on your back window.

247
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,859
That's a significant quantity
of bird poo.

248
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:06,700
You'd say that's a big bird
that did that. Look at this.

249
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,180
LAUGHTER

250
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,181
It gets to there and you think,
"That must be the end."

251
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,181
That is a metre of faeces!

252
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:20,222
What bird can do a metre
of faec...?!

253
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:25,982
I'm two metres tall
and I can't do a metre of faeces!

254
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:29,743
You live in Oxfordshire,
you've got those red kites
there, they're big birds.

255
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:32,062
They are big birds,
and they are carnivores.

256
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:35,743
Now, I examined this faeces,
and there were seven
cherry stones in it.

257
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:41,264
Well, maybe it had a field mouse
in a cherry jus in Oxfordshire?
It didn't!

258
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:44,904
If the cherry stones
were in its gut, it must have
eaten the cherry whole,

259
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:48,825
which means it must've had
a mouth like a Peugeot!

260
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:53,305
What kind of bird can have a gallon
of guano in its gut

261
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:58,905
and still take off and achieve
sufficient altitude to defecate
on my Range Rover?!

262
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:03,466
A big one!
Maybe it was a flying cow. What?

263
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,466
James, you really do live
in Hammersmith, don't you?

264
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:10,627
We should bear in mind this is
the man who believes cows lay eggs,

265
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:13,827
and he does. He said that
on the show. You say that...

266
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,308
I said eggs come from cows.
Well, you see...

267
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:20,788
Can I just say, I want to have
a competition on this.

268
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:24,629
If anybody can find a bigger
piece of bird dirt than that

269
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:29,229
on their car, take a photograph
and send it to us at Top Gear,

270
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:31,669
London, where are we? W12 7TS.

271
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,909
Mark your envelope, "You really
are plumbing new depths this week."

272
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,470
Well, you are!

273
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,350
Now, there is a new Range Rover.

274
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,030
It's not as big as the real thing,
but does it work?

275
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,551
To find out, I went to the
United States. Which is in America.

276
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,353
'This is it.

277
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,033
'It's called the Evoque,

278
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,594
'and even though it's covered
in Range Rover badges,

279
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:13,834
'it doesn't look especially tough
or off-road-y.

280
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:19,035
'Little wonder, when the design
consultant for this car
was Victoria Beckham.'

281
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:23,756
This is one of those luxury
lifestyle off-roaders,

282
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:27,755
which is why the producers
have told me to drive it
to Las Vegas,

283
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:32,556
where I have a job for the evening
chauffeuring the cosmetically
enhanced Cher.

284
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:36,676
However, there is a small
obstacle in the way.

285
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:39,877
'Actually, it's quite a big
obstacle,

286
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,918
'because my starting point
is here.'

287
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,238
'Death Valley, one of the most
inhospitable places on earth,

288
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:56,399
'boasting some of the toughest
terrain a car could ever face.'

289
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,040
So, it's the perfect place
to decide if the new Evoque
is a proper Range Rover

290
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,120
or just a big
designer girl's blouse.

291
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:19,001
'The edge of Death Valley
was 150 miles away,

292
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:23,002
'and to get there I wasn't
allowed to use any tarmaced roads.'

293
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:29,443
Now, this is no small challenge
because the Evoque doesn't have
a massive separate chassis,

294
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:34,323
it doesn't have a low range gearbox,
and it doesn't have a big
fire-breathing V8.

295
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:39,044
What it has is a four cylinder
turbo diesel engine

296
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:40,884
making 187 horsepower,

297
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:44,524
and underneath it's based on
the old Freelander,

298
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:47,645
which is loosely related
to the Ford Mondeo.

299
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:56,966
I think the record temperature
for this area is something like 137.

300
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,126
If the car were to
break down out here,

301
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:04,647
I reckon it would be three,
maybe four minutes

302
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:09,928
before I got into the crew's Range
Rover and went back to the hotel.

303
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,248
'For the first few miles,

304
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:17,168
'the terrain didn't offer
much of a challenge.

305
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:20,929
'But I did find out something
pleasing about the Evoque.'

306
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,289
The ride in this car is excellent.

307
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,009
This surface is actually
quite washboard...

308
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:31,610
but this is soaking it up
marvellously.

309
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,850
'That's because the dampers
are filled with a fluid

310
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,411
'that contains magnetised
iron filings,

311
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:41,171
'which can react in milliseconds
to alter the firmness
of the suspension.'

312
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:45,571
It's the same system, actually,
that they use on the Audi R8,

313
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,571
only in this they can respond
twice as quickly.

314
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:53,212
And if that was you
responsible for that, Mrs Beckham,

315
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,453
then can I say
thank you very much indeed?

316
00:21:57,373 --> 00:21:58,973
'Mrs Beckham's suspension

317
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:01,813
'wafted me towards my appointment
in Las Vegas.'

318
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,494

Stereo's good as well.

321
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:14,934
The interior is very good,
nicely trimmed and everything,

322
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,775
but then it should be because
this may be a baby Range Rover,

323
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:22,095
but even the most basic one
starts at £28,000,

324
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:28,056
and if you have the Prestige model,
like I have here,
then it's about £43,000.

to get much tougher.'

I can use, look, these cameras,
there's five cameras on the car

334
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:14,742
which help me to look out for bits
that I might otherwise hit.

335
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:19,342
Going on this one,
I could miss that rock.

Give me more of that!

343
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:52,266
I have to say,
this is pretty good for a car that,

344
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,066
let's be honest, most people
are going to drive to the shops

345
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:59,707
and occasionally across a field
to a Pony Club meeting

346
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,547

Oh, no.

349
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:17,469
I must be a bit of a chump thinking
I can get up that, must I not?

350
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:20,309
That is officially a small cliff.

351
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:22,589
Still, it's quite a noble effort.

352
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:25,389
I think we'll have to find
a different way round.

353

363
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:14,035

all sorts of things,

00:25:14,035 --> 00:25:16,755
the suspension settings,
the throttle response,

365
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:20,196

I get very peaky power delivery,

Come on, then.

I don't know what the hell
the engines are they've got
in those things,

381

'After they'd stripped the Evoque
of most of its paint...'

384

Thank you.

'..the Death Valley rednecks showed
me the way out of the dunes.'

Well, this is about as fast
as it will go, actually,

391
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,530
cos it's slightly soft.

392
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,691
I can get up to about 75 or so
before the car starts
squirreling around.

393
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:40,892
Again, Mrs Beckham, I have to
commend you on your car.

394
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,853
'As the sun set,
I came upon a marvellous sight.'

395
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:52,933
He-hey!

396
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:56,773
Oh, that's nice.

397
00:27:56,773 --> 00:28:00,014
Mmm, lovely, lovely tarmac.

398
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:06,894
It's like a cool hand passed
across your fevered brow, tarmac.

399
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:10,815
'It also meant
I was out of Death Valley

that Cher is not
going to be interested'

402

in the road test of the Evoque,
so here's a quick sum-up.

403
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,816
'Things I like.'

404
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:25,817
I think it looks excellent,
it's particularly good off-road,
as it turns out.

405
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:29,497
It has a nice, tasteful interior,
and the ride is excellent.

406
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:33,338
Things I don't like,
it's not that spacious in the back,

407
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,778
there are a few too many
buttons on the steering wheel,

408
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,778
and the door mirrors are too big.

409
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:42,218
Anyway, onwards to Cher.

410
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:50,860
'Eventually, my destination
came into view.

411
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,420
'Not that you could miss it.'

412
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,541
I've heard Cher's a bit of a diva,
actually.

413
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,701

she's going to take to...

Hopefully she likes
a bit of stinky rough.

417
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:17,783
'Soon, I arrived at the venue.'

418
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:27,984

comfortable.

Evening.

Are you a bloke?

424
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,829
Um, yeah.

425
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:15,629
So you're not actually...

426
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:17,629
Cher isn't a man?

427
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:21,510
No, I'm a man that plays Cher.

428
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,470

Right. Well, that's my
kind of language.

432
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:32,072
I'll see what I can do, sir/madam.

433
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:42,152
APPLAUSE

434
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,913
Hang on, was that one of those,
um... What are they called?

435
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:53,794
Cross-dressing things? And then that
wasn't really Cher?

436
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:56,674
Yeah. Apparently that Cher
is actually called Steve.

437
00:30:56,674 --> 00:31:01,435
But didn't you spot the difference?
I mean, the Adam's apple and the...

438
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:03,555
Never mind. No.
We'll gloss over that.

439
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:06,475
The Range Rover, is it real?
Does it feel like a proper one?

440
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:09,796
I think it does because it does
work really well off road,

441
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:12,036
and it does have that...
It feels special.

442
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,357
And I have to say, it looks
fantastic. I mean, really brilliant.

443
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:19,397
It does look fantastic
and it looks even better like that.

444
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:23,037
That's the three-door. Yes, that's
true. But there is a problem.

445
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:26,398
So you arrive at it - the
three-door one - with your toddler.

446
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:32,518
It's raining, you've got to get the
toddler in the back, and you pull
the seat forward...

447
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:34,518
Unless you're David Beckham

448
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:38,158
and you could just sort of pop
it in like that...

449
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:40,159
You are a half-wit. Look.

450
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,039
Press that. Oh, yes, still raining,
still holding your toddler, bored,
very bored.

451
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,280
Can't be bothered to wait any more.

452
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,320
Let's move on because
it is time to put a star -
a Grand Prix star, no less -

453
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,121
in our old reasonably-priced car.

454
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:01,682
My guest tonight is a German who won
last year's World Championship.

455
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:06,402
And this year's, he's already
put his towel on that as well.

456
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sebastian Vettel!

457
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:12,282
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

458
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:14,243
Here he is - the World Champion.

459
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:18,243
The World Champion is among us.

460
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:20,964
Have a seat, Sebastian.

461
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,925
Now, obviously, first of all,

462
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:31,565
huge congratulations on your win
this afternoon.

463
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:35,165
The problem is, obviously,
it's Wednesday now...
LAUGHTER

464
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:39,326
but when this goes out
on television...
I see. Now I've got it. OK.

465
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:42,926
I'm usually not that slow.
So we've just run a few options.

466
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,967
What a shame -
pipped at the last moment.

467
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,087
And then that mistake
half a lap to the end.

468
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,967
What were you thinking of, man?!

469
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:59,968
Who could have imagined a giant
meteorite would land on the track

470
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:02,328
and stop the race like that?

471
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:05,208
Now, a lot of people have been
saying it's a boring season,

472
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,409
you know that you're going to
win every time you watch.

473
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:12,529
But it probably isn't boring
from where you're sitting, is it?
Never, no.

474
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:14,370
I mean, I enjoy it, you know.

475
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,330
I think the races are
quite exciting, from what I see.

476
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,850
Obviously I can't follow them live.
Well, it would be tricky.

477
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,611
You probably could. A bit in the
monitors around. Do you actually
watch the screens?

478
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:28,971
Yes. You do? Sometimes, yeah.

479
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:33,852
It's not because I have so much time
and I am so much ahead,

480
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:36,572
but it's sometimes quite useful
to see what's going on.

481
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:43,213
Obviously, when they are
showing some... Crashes.
Some birds, then it's...

482
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:48,574
Valencia was, let's be honest,
a bit boring. I'm afraid
I was fast asleep.

483
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:52,214
Valencia, you just can't help...
May be that comes with age. It is.

484
00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:53,414
APPLAUSE

485
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:01,575
Sunday afternoon nod-off.

486
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:06,215
Anyway, I'll run through some
of your achievements. The
youngest ever world champion.

487
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:11,097
The youngest person ever to win a
Grand Prix, the youngest ever to get
a pole position,

488
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:16,857
the youngest person ever to score
a point, and the youngest person
ever to score a fastest lap.

489
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:19,097
What were you like as a baby?

490
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:25,337
"And the first to use a lavatory..."

491
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:32,739
Were you always a competitive child?
I think I was always competitive.
I'm not sure about the lavatory bit.

492
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,419
I think it took me quite a while
to understand, you know,

493
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,459
where you should
and where you shouldn't...

494
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:42,659
We've got a picture - just to
demonstrate how young you were -

495
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,820
of you meeting our old Stig
for the first time.

496
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,461
There you go, look.

497
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:52,220
I think that's an endearing picture.
What was happening?

498
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,102
1995. You were...? Seven.

499
00:34:57,102 --> 00:35:00,862
There was a championship in Kerpen,
which is Michael's hometown.

500
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:05,862
That must have been a special
moment for a seven-year-old, to meet
Schumacher. Was he world champion?

501
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:10,583
Yes, double world champion.
What's it like know
when you lap him?

502
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:15,343
Do you think, "God, this is
terrible"? I don't think
of this picture, for a start.

503
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:16,984
Is it weird?
It is a bit weird.

504
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:21,984
You know, for me, when I was
karting, Michael was the one
I was looking up to.

505
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,984
So, when you lap him now,
do you go like that?

506
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:31,106
No, I mean... It must be tempting.

507
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:34,106
You know, the thing is,
of course, he's a legend,

508
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:38,466
and there's things I can learn from
people like him, drivers like him.

509
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,466
Can I just ask you to be honest now?

510
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:44,227
How much of your current success
is down to that Red Bull car?

511
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:46,387
The one we've got over there,
in fact.

512
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:51,348
Because Lewis Hamilton said
it's just unbelievably quick
following the Red Bull car.

513
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:56,709
Again, it depends. Our car,
people know, and we know, our
strength is in high-speed corners

514
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:59,229
because we do produce
a lot of downforce.

515
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:04,629
But he didn't talk you through,
probably, other tracks where they
gain more than half a second

516
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:09,109
down the straights. You know
Adrian Newey because he designed
the car that you drive.

517
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:10,670
I got to know him, yeah.

518
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,591
I was at school with him.
He told me that.

519
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:18,110
Yeah, he used to copy me in physics.
Really?

520
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,910
Yeah, it was really annoying.

521
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,991
He didn't mention that bit.
Mention it to him because I remember
coming up with a double diffuser

522
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:27,232
and the KERS system,
just doodling, really.

523
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,752
And he was like... You know those
really annoying people at school?

524
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:33,153
Exactly. You might like to mention
that to him.

525
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:34,873
And you give all your cars names?

526
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,593
The racing cars.
Yeah. What are these names?

527
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:44,233
Brian? No. Not Brian? No. Roger?
No, this year is Kinky Kylie.

528
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:46,234
LAUGHTER

529
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:50,995
It's got a nice back end, you know,
so...

530
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:53,354
Last year it was Luscious Liz.

531
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:57,835
Luscious Liz? Yeah. The year before
it was Kate's Dirty Sister.

532
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:01,236
LAUGHTER

533
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:04,876
Now, you're a big fan,
I understand, of Britain,

534
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:07,117
but British comedy in particular.

535
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,997
Is that right? Correct.

536
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:14,236
At the moment I'm quite into
Little Britain. I think that one
is very popular. Yeah.

537
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:17,597
I even went to London once to
see them live. Did you? Yeah.

538
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:22,238
It was quite funny up to the point
where they tried to play
that game, hide the sausage,

539
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:25,358
and he actually tried to...

540
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,479
And are you a Python fan?
Did somebody tell me you like
Monty Python? Yeah, I do.

541
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:33,719
The first time I saw was
The Life of Brian, the movie.

542
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,880
I saw it in German
and I found it was funny.

543
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,720
And then I saw the English version
and I loved it.

544
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,481
It's the same thing, actually,
this show, they show in Germany now
for a couple of years,

545
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:49,001
but you speaking German.

546
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,481
No!

547
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:53,122
Yeah. And it...

548
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:57,882
No, I won't have that!
German? No!

549
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:00,722
And it just doesn't work, you know?

550
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:04,723
I can sort of believe that.

551
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:10,123
One of the reasons why it's easy to
appreciate British humour is, if you
speak really properly good English,

552
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,363
which you...

553
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:13,044
And you even do accents.

554
00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:17,004
That's a yes, isn't it?
That was just a yes.

555
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:19,004
Not that I kno-ow of.

556
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:20,484
LAUGHTER

557
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:22,244
Can you do Birmingham?

558
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:26,365
Actually, Adrian brought me
close to that Brummie accent

559
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,885
because he told some stories
about Nigel Mansell in the past,

560
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:32,646
about the chicane in Monza where
he was, I don't know,

561
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,886
10 or 20kph quicker than
Piquet at that time.

562
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:41,607
And Piquet didn't understand,
and then Patrick Head went to
Nigel, Adrian obviously was there,

563
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:46,607
asking what he's doing. And he says,
"I just take my hand..."

564
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,488
BRUMMIE ACCENT: "I just turn
my knuckles around the wheel
and just go straight."

565
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,169
APPLAUSE

566
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,889
That's fantastic.

567
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,610
Anyway, obviously you've done
many Formula 1 races

568
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,130
and you've been successful
in a lot of them.

569
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,730
Today is the most important
day of your career so far

570
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,891
because you're here to do our lap.
Yes, yes.

571
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:19,371
How did it go out there?
I have no idea. I don't know.

572
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:23,892
Usually you have reference, people
tell you thumbs up, not so good.

573
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:28,732
Cos they don't tell you how your lap
was. The thing is you have got only
that car and, you know,

574
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:33,493
I cannot come into the pits and say,
"It's rubbish, change this,
change that."

575
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:36,613
You know, I can complain but...
Nobody bothers.

576
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:40,253
You did ask if you could check the
tyre pressures before setting off.

577
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,374
Yes. That's quite German.

578
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:45,614
Nobody else has said,
"Can we check the tyre pressure?"

579
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:50,615
Cos this is the only opportunity,
really, where Formula 1 drivers
get to drive the same car

580
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:53,215
to see how you compare
to all the others.

581
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:54,896
Yeah, so that's why I'm...

582
00:39:57,015 --> 00:40:00,616
Who'd like to see Sebastian's lap?
ALL: Yes!

583
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:03,137
Let's have a look.

584
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:07,296
Lot of wheelspin.

585
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:09,617
Enough power to spin the wheels.

586
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,178
But not much after that.

587
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:14,337
Come on.

588
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:17,058
Must say it's nice to see
the old Liana back.

589
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,218
There we are, look,

590
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:21,418
a Formula 1 driver
again taking the wide line there.

591
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:29,739
Think I could have a cup of tea
before the next corner.

592
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:33,499
Chicago. Not running wide.

593
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,340
Well, it seems stupid...

594
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,260
With these things
you will never be on time!

595
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,381
Obsessed with punctuality
even there.

596
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:46,061
I don't want to say,
"Do you keep it in the lines?"

597
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:48,901
because you are the Formula 1
world champion, and you have.

598
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:54,222
And you manage to keep it under
control on the way out as well,

599
00:40:54,222 --> 00:40:55,382
unsurprisingly.

600
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:57,142
This thing is really slow.

601
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:58,663
It isn't. Listen to it!

602
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:02,142
Tortured tyres.
Going through the follow-through.

603
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:05,224
92, 93, 94 mph.

604
00:41:05,224 --> 00:41:06,544
Pretty quick.

605
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:07,704
Very quick.

606
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,984
Did that hurt? The jolt?

607
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,304
It's a good car.

608
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,944
It is. Superb.

609
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:17,745
And into Gambon.
Any two-wheel action?

610
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:19,105
None at all. There we are.

611
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:21,265
Ladies and gentlemen,
across the line!

612
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:23,866
APPLAUSE

613
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:28,186
What's very funny now...

614
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:32,946
You just leant back,
but you did the interview like that.

615
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:34,266
Then you were like that.

616
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:35,907
Yeah.

617
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,907
Where do you think you've come?

618
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,667
It was very windy, did you see?

619
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,268
LAUGHTER

620
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:45,348
Can you imagine the headwind
accelerating when you have no power?

621
00:41:45,348 --> 00:41:46,947
Any more excuses?

622
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:48,948
I have a couple lined up. Let's see.

623
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:50,788
You're leaning forwards.

624
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:56,989
Well, the fastest we've ever had
is Rubens Barrichello,

625
00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:58,910
who did it in 1.443.

626
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,430
You did it in one minute...

627
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,471
Good start.

628
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:06,910
40...

629
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,430
4...

630
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,151
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

631
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:16,751
Dead.

632
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,072
CHEERING

633
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:19,472
There you go!

634
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,272
Fastest F1 driver we've had!

635
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:31,233
Hang on. Hang on.

636
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,793
Wait. I just had a thought.

637
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:35,914
Why are we all surprised?

638
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:37,593
LAUGHTER

639
00:42:37,593 --> 00:42:39,234
I'm surprised.

640
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:43,275
Come on! That you're faster
than a 62-year-old Brazilian?!

641
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,635
I met the Stig.
I'm faster than the Stig.

642
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:50,475
No, no, this is OLD Stig.
We should get rid of him.

643
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:53,916
New Stig hasn't yet been round.

644
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:54,955
Yeah, he said.

645
00:42:54,955 --> 00:42:58,836
There's a rumour he can do it
in 56-57 seconds. A rumour.

646
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:00,156
Some say, you mean.

647
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:01,516
Some say.

648
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:05,677
APPLAUSE

649
00:43:05,677 --> 00:43:09,317
Ladies and gentlemen...
Now I can lean back.

650
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:11,318
Now I can lean back.

651
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:16,158
You can lean back now.
You can relax. Well done for today.

652
00:43:17,238 --> 00:43:18,718
It's fantastic to meet you.

653
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:22,799
Anglophile, good guy. Ladies
and gentlemen, Sebastian Vettel!

654
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,880
Now, this is the Nissan Pixo

655
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,561
and it is the cheapest car
on sale in the UK right now.

656
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:41,441
It costs just £6,995.

657
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:45,601
It sounds fantastic, but is it?

658
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:47,642
Jeremy decided to find out.

659
00:43:51,002 --> 00:43:52,363
Well, here it is.

660
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:58,003
It's built in India and it has
a one-litre, three-cylinder engine,

661
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,803
so it's very slow.

662
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:04,123
Also it doesn't look very nice,
it isn't very spacious

663
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:08,644
and it comes with less equipment
that a cave.

664
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:12,605
You do get power steering
and anti-lock brakes.

665
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:13,644
Argh, ducks!

666
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:18,045
Missed them. Thank you, anti-lock
brakes. Working well there.

667
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:22,126
You also get a radio, and a dial!

668
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:26,327
But if you want
to get the window down,

669
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:30,807
you have to move this lever
in an anti-clockwise direction.

670
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:34,847
To get it up again, you move it
in a clockwise direction.

671
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,328
And it's a similar story
with the door mirrors.

672
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:40,648
They're operated
by these funny prongs.

673
00:44:41,688 --> 00:44:43,288
You don't even get any carpets.

674
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,928
But if you pay an extra £37,

675
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:48,049
Nissan will sell you what they call

676
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:52,129
luxury velour textile floor mats.

677
00:44:52,129 --> 00:44:55,730
If you spend £3 on top of that,

678
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,290
they will give you
a Nissan-branded toggle bag,

679
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,610
containing both a sponge
and a sachet of car shampoo.

680
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:08,851
Of course, you might say
that for less than £7,000,

681
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:13,572
you should expect to do without
speed and space and looks

682
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:16,291
and electric windows and carpets.

683
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,692
But do you have to?

684
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:22,292
Because what does £6,995 buy you

685
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:26,133
if you're prepared to ferret around
on the second-hand market?

686
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,694
This for a kick-off.

687
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:35,694
This is a Bentley Turbo R.

688
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:40,975
It's 23 years old,
it's done 122,000 miles

689
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:47,855
and this actual car is for sale
right now for £6,995.

690
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:49,296
For all this!

691
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:51,856
I mean, look at it!

692
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:54,056
Not a Nissan, no.

693
00:45:54,056 --> 00:45:58,457
What it is is a Bentley that I'm in,
for the same money.

694
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:03,017
It's got five more cylinders
than the Nissan and a turbocharger,

695
00:46:03,017 --> 00:46:05,097
so it is MUCH faster.

696
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:08,658
And the luxury lambswool mats
are included in the price.

697
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:11,858
If I operate this button,

698
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:14,058
my window goes up and down.

699
00:46:14,058 --> 00:46:17,098
With this button, I can move my seat
backwards and forwards.

700
00:46:17,098 --> 00:46:20,099
With this button, I can adjust
my horns. I can have a twin horn.

701
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,459
HORN BEEPS

702
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:25,060
Very nice. Or a single one. No.
I'll just have a twin one.

703
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:33,661
Back in 1988,
this car cost someone £79,000.

704
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:37,221
Here we are now and you can buy it
for less than a tenth of that.

705
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:40,341
I mean, look!

706
00:46:40,341 --> 00:46:45,301
Leather, leather, leather, leather.
Wood. Leather, leather, leather.

707
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:51,102
Leather. Leather. Leather.

708
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:53,783
It is genuinely unbelievable

709
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:58,024
that that car costs exactly the same
as this car.

710
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,264
Of course, we're not thick.
Well, he is.

711
00:47:00,264 --> 00:47:04,264
But even he knows that the Bentley
was hand-made in England

712
00:47:04,264 --> 00:47:08,185
and saying something was hand-made
in England is just a way of saying

713
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:09,585
the door's going to fall off.

714
00:47:09,585 --> 00:47:12,265
This isn't going to be
as reliable as the Nissan.

715
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:17,786
When stuff does go wrong with this,
the bills are going to be MASSIVE.

716
00:47:17,786 --> 00:47:19,786
They are, they are.
Don't worry though.

717
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:23,866
It turns out
there are many, many alternatives.

718
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:27,747
All of the cars here
are on the market right now

719
00:47:27,747 --> 00:47:31,427
for less than the price
of that Nissan Pixo.

720
00:47:34,587 --> 00:47:37,668
The Honda S2000, for example.

721
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:41,589
This one is now for sale with 47,000
miles on the clock

722
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:44,988
for £6,500.

723
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:46,989
And you could have a Mazda RX8.

724
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,189
Look, four doors,
like the Nissan Pixo.

725
00:47:50,189 --> 00:47:52,749
This one has done 28,000 miles.

726
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:56,349
It's new! It's a brand new car!

727
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:00,310
Subaru Impreza, in budget, in the
correct blue and gold alloys. Lovely.

728
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,550
WRX, this one. It is.

729
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,551
Could you get an STI in budget?

730
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,951
No. P1. No. RB5. Now you're
just saying letters and numbers.

731
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,912
SK1?
That's the postcode for Stockport.

732
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:11,151
It's done 37,000 miles.

733
00:48:11,151 --> 00:48:12,832
What?

734
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:14,873
It's only done 37,000?

735
00:48:14,873 --> 00:48:17,313
It's got everything on it.

736
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:20,233
Electric mirrors, air-con.
Air conditioning.

737
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:21,473
£6,500.

738
00:48:21,473 --> 00:48:22,633
That's fantastic.

739
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:28,473
Of course, some of the cars we found
are cheap because they're rubbish.

740
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:32,394
But most aren't, like this Alpha,
this Jag,

741
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:33,955
all these BMWs.

742
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:36,234
We even found a Porsche.

743
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:44,395
It's done 88,000 miles
and it feels tight as a drum

744
00:48:44,395 --> 00:48:46,915
and you are driving about
in a convertible Porsche.

745
00:48:46,915 --> 00:48:48,116
That's what worries me.

746
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:50,836
Do you think we look a bit... Manly.

747
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:53,516
No. Tough.
No, the opposite of those things.

748
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:54,557
Hello there.

749
00:48:55,757 --> 00:48:57,677
We're talking about football.

750
00:48:57,677 --> 00:49:00,077
I'm just going to spit
out of the window.

751
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:02,357
Can we go and have a look
at some fighter jets?

752
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,798
Ready, go, go, go.

753
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:11,839
ENGINE BLARES

754
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,559
There. It just does
a sort of raaaaah.

755
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,720
It makes a great noise,
they are incredibly well-balanced.

756
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,320
It is hard to think of a better car
for £6,500, or £6,900, than this.

757
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,961
That gave us an idea
for a challenge.

758
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:32,641
Which one of us could buy
the most amazing car

759
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:34,281
for the price of a Nissan Pixo?

760
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:41,762
This is my choice.

761
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:49,483
A Mercedes CL which I found
on the internet for £6,995.

762
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:56,404
What makes that price particularly
extraordinary

763
00:49:56,404 --> 00:49:59,444
is that this is the top-of-the-range
model, the V12.

764
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:01,484
It comes with just about everything.

765
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:04,564
It has a television,
it has radar-guided cruise control

766
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:07,604
that maintains a set distance
to the car in front.

767
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,605
It has voice-activated controls.

768
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:14,165
It has seats that massage you
as you drive along.

769
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:16,726
If you bought the equivalent
of this car today,

770
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:19,926
it would cost you £161,000.

771
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:23,447
And that makes this
the bargain of the century.

772
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:24,567
No, it isn't.

773
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,047
Because THIS is.

774
00:50:26,047 --> 00:50:27,727
The BMW 850ci.

775
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:31,927
It too has a V12 engine.
Not the lesser V8-engined 840.

776
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:36,408
But what makes this car
better than Jeremy's is...

777
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,249
Pop up headlamps.

778
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:39,529
Simple as that.

779
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:43,369
How much did you pay for this?
£6,700. Yours?

780
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:49,490
£6,995. Less! How old is it?
'94... 17 years old.

781
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,210
Ahem, nine. Really?

782
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:56,851
Nine years old.
How many miles has it done? 127.

783
00:50:56,851 --> 00:51:00,051
54,000. Rubbish!

784
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:03,892
Why does it have casters from a sofa
instead of wheels?

785
00:51:03,892 --> 00:51:07,891
OK, it's period.
They were that size in those days.

786
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:10,412
What are they? 17? 16? 16-inch.

787
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:11,852
16-inch wheels.

788
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,732
And you know full well

789
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:16,293
that means fatter tyres
and that means a better ride.

790
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:19,373
It's got Smarties for wheels.
And is that ruched leather?

791
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:22,613
Oh, yes. Yes, it is.

792
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,654
Why do people from Birmingham
like a ruche?!

793
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:29,934
To find out which of us
had bought the best car,

794
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:32,535
we decided to conduct
a series of tests,

795
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:35,575
starting, not unsurprisingly,
with speed.

796
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,816
This is a 1.8 mile runway

797
00:51:40,816 --> 00:51:44,616
and all we wanted to know is
who'd get to the far end first.

798
00:51:46,656 --> 00:51:50,176
Of course, what matters most of all
in a race like this is power

799
00:51:50,176 --> 00:51:52,817
and the simple fact
is I have more of it.

800
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:54,617
A lot more. And more talk.

801
00:51:56,617 --> 00:52:00,738
Because my car has pop-up headlamps,
it is sleeker at the front,

802
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:05,939
more aerodynamic and, in a race
like this, aerodynamics matter.

803
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:09,539
3, 2, 1, go!

804
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:13,020
Yeah! Oh...

805
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:17,579
And that is a goodbye, Hammond.

806
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,500
His car is limited, top speed 155.

807
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,381
BMW, not limited. Top speed, 156.

808
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:31,981
I can still whisper.
130 miles an hour.

809
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:35,142
140.

810
00:52:35,142 --> 00:52:39,502
He's ahead, yes,
but soon he will hit the limiter

811
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:41,743
and I will surge past.

812
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:45,863
155 miles an hour.

813
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,623
But that surging thing
didn't happen.

814
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,783
Kack!

815
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:53,224
What a machine!

816
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:56,184
We pulled over for a post-race chat.

817
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:57,904
MOBILE RINGS

818
00:52:57,904 --> 00:53:02,625
Hello! Hello! Can I just say,
what happened there?

819
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:05,265
Well, obviously the BM lost.

820
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,825
The weirdest thing was, as we
crossed the finishing line
at the end,

821
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:10,346
mine changed up,

822
00:53:10,346 --> 00:53:15,426
so I think given a longer runway,
like 50 miles longer...

823
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,507
Yes, yes, yes. I would have won.

824
00:53:17,507 --> 00:53:20,467
Have you ever run a race
while carrying a television. No.

825
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:24,267
And a sideboard. I've got a
television and a sideboard in here.

826
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:28,148
Can I also say I want one of these
phones on a cord in my car.

827
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:31,068
HE LAUGHS

828
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:35,668
To try and understand
why Hammond's car was so slow,

829
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:39,309
we put it on a machine that would
reveal how many horsepowers

830
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:40,989
had escaped over the years.

831
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:43,150
There's no need to tether it.

832
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,070
Got to shackle this beast down.

833
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,710
It took nearly an hour to get down
that runaway. No, it didn't.

834
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,830
Soon the machine gave us an answer.

835
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,031
How many was it?
296 when it was new.

836
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,231
296 horsepower
for your five-litre engine.

837
00:53:57,231 --> 00:54:02,711
How many years old? 17 years old.
269 at the flywheel.

838
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:05,111
27 horses have escaped.

839
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:08,032
Less than two a year. You could
eat that many horses a year.

840
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:10,272
Perhaps you're just
a rubbish driver.

841
00:54:10,272 --> 00:54:13,353
We then decided
to test the Mercedes.

842
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:17,194
Jet noise. That's not the car!

843
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:23,594
To start with,
362 brake horse power. Yes.

844
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,674
Today, after nine years... Yes.

845
00:54:25,674 --> 00:54:27,154
352.

846
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:28,635
352.

847
00:54:28,635 --> 00:54:31,595
So my car has lost
fewer horsepower than yours,

848
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:34,075
is faster than yours,

849
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:38,156
has much more equipment than yours.

850
00:54:38,156 --> 00:54:41,476
It hasn't got pop-up headlamps
and the leather is NOT ruched!

851
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:46,716
We then checked out
our cars' interiors

852
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,236
using our old friend Mr Manlove

853
00:54:49,236 --> 00:54:52,037
and his team of forensic experts.

854
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:54,997
You know the last time we tested
cars like this on Top Gear,

855
00:54:54,997 --> 00:54:58,718
didn't we find that yours
was full of blood and mucus?

856
00:54:58,718 --> 00:55:00,118
Yeah. And faeces.

857
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:06,558
After a microscopic examination,
Manlove was ready with the results.

858
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:09,159
Why don't you go first,
since you usually lose these.

859
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:10,519
All right then.

860
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:13,520
With the BMW, first of all,
we're lacking faeces this time.

861
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,120
No faeces for me! No faeces.

862
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,241
We do have plenty of saliva,
which you would expect.

863
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:20,481
It's on the car phone.

864
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:23,761
When you talk, obviously little
spatters of saliva...

865
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:24,881
I held it.

866
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:27,002
We also had a lot of material

867
00:55:27,002 --> 00:55:29,761
which looked like
rolled nasal mucus again.

868
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:34,002
What nasal mucus? Rolled.

869
00:55:34,002 --> 00:55:36,642
As in... Picking and flicking.
Absolutely.

870
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:41,162
Finally,
there was an odour of urine.

871
00:55:41,162 --> 00:55:42,763
Somebody has wet themselves.

872
00:55:42,763 --> 00:55:44,723
It was a general pervading aroma.

873
00:55:44,723 --> 00:55:47,404
I'm in another lavatory!

874
00:55:47,404 --> 00:55:49,364
Right, the Mercedes.

875
00:55:49,364 --> 00:55:54,044
There was some white powder found
on tapings,

876
00:55:54,044 --> 00:55:55,964
as was some herbal material

877
00:55:55,964 --> 00:55:58,205
that looked like it had been cut
or chopped.

878
00:55:58,205 --> 00:56:01,605
We didn't do any further testing on
that. White powder sounds like talc.

879
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:03,245
Could be talcum powder. Flour!

880
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:08,326
Moving on to the front passenger
seat, there was a rhinestone.

881
00:56:08,326 --> 00:56:12,967
We had chemical reactions
that we would frequently find

882
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:15,206
if we were examining different
types of cases

883
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:17,447
on potentially vaginal swabs.

884
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:20,088
Vaginal...
Material on the passenger seat.

885
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,008
Mine was a drooling businessman
flicking bogies,

886
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:30,648
wet himself. Yours...
Was an interesting bloke.

887
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:35,289
Could the rhinestone
come from a vajazzle? What's that?

888
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:38,449
They don't have them in
Herefordshire where you live.

889
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:40,769
I'm seeing a magic stick
that you wave at things.

890
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,850
No, it isn't that.

891
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,570
With Manlove's test complete,

892
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:50,451
we took our cars onto the road to
see what they're like on the... road.

893
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:59,291
Oh, yeah. Headlamps popping up.
Ooh, yeah.

894
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,771
I'll put them away.

895
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:05,132
Just feels great.

896
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:08,013
It doesn't feel old-fashioned,
outdated or second hand.

897
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:11,173
There's just not a clue
that this is anything other

898
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:13,013
than an incredibly expensive car.

899
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:17,054
Rear roller blind, yep,
that's working well.

900
00:57:17,054 --> 00:57:20,174
Put it in sport mode, that works.

901
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:24,374
Raise the suspension up, lower it,
turn the traction control off.

902
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,295
Cruise control.

903
00:57:26,295 --> 00:57:29,175
In some ways, it's not really
a rival for the Nissan Pixo,

904
00:57:29,175 --> 00:57:31,895
but it is a rival
for a brand new Mercedes.

905
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:34,896
You do have to ask,
why would you buy one?

906
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:38,736
Let me just try the linguatronic,
make sure that's working OK.

907
00:57:40,216 --> 00:57:41,257
Radio Two.

908
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:49,538
'Capital. Radio 4. News Direct.
Cancel.'

909
00:57:50,778 --> 00:57:52,778
That's working brilliantly.

910
00:57:52,778 --> 00:57:56,658
Exactly like every linguatronic
system I've ever encountered.

911
00:57:56,658 --> 00:57:58,338
Total disobedience!

912
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:03,659
Soon, we pulled over
in the town of Market Harborough

913
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:06,539
to conduct a little experiment.

914
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:13,060
This Mercedes, V12, how much
do you reckon? 20, 25. 20 or 25.

915
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,140
27 grand. 27 grand?

916
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,181
12 or 13. 12 or 13?

917
00:58:17,181 --> 00:58:20,701
It's a V12 BMW, what would you think
that was for sale for

918
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:22,421
if it was for sale today?

919
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:24,742
About 12,000. 12,000?

920
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:26,822
40 to 50,000.

921
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:28,382
What about this car, sir?

922
00:58:28,382 --> 00:58:30,742
It's a V12 also.
It's done 54,000 miles.

923
00:58:30,742 --> 00:58:32,262
20, something like that.

924
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,222
If your neighbour
put that on the drive,

925
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:36,183
you'd think,
"They've done all right."

926
00:58:39,463 --> 00:58:41,063
It's as we thought.

927
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:45,944
People think these cars are worth
far more than we actually paid.

928
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:49,944
So what we have here
are two V12 super coupes,

929
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:52,744
blasting through
the heart of England

930
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:57,745
silently, quickly,
comfortably and cheaply.

931
00:59:05,907 --> 00:59:07,866
If the Nissan's done one thing
for us,

932
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:11,427
it's let us know that these cars are
out there for that kind of money.

933
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:16,788
It's a complete no-brainer.

934
00:59:27,308 --> 00:59:29,589
APPLAUSE

935
00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:33,269
I know. I know.

936
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,109
I honestly believe...

937
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,190
I believe we really are
on to something here.

938
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,630
They are both brilliant. What?!

939
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:44,070
Have you two taken
complete leave of your senses?

940
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,270
Why?! Because anybody who buys
an ancient V12 coupe

941
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:51,352
instead of the economical
three-cylinder little hatchback

942
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:54,151
is going to end up bankrupt
and living in a skip.

943
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:58,032
Listen, Captain Killjoy!
How do you know?

944
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:01,312
A modern Formula 1 car doesn't
break down, so what makes you think

945
01:00:01,312 --> 01:00:05,113
that a relatively modern
road car is going to break down?

946
01:00:05,113 --> 01:00:07,113
Because Formula 1 cars

947
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:10,713
are not owned by people
who fill them with...

948
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:13,193
with snot and lady juice.

949
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,274
Nelson Piquet did.

950
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:17,595
Anyway, we anticipated
your objections

951
01:00:17,595 --> 01:00:21,634
and we didn't just borrow these cars
to drive, we actually bought them.

952
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:23,035
What, with money?

953
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:26,516
Yes, and we're going to run them
for a while and report back

954
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:30,475
and inform the viewers
on just how reliable they are.

955
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:33,836
Really? I am prepared to bet you two
all of my hair

956
01:00:33,836 --> 01:00:36,677
that within two weeks,
one of these has gone bang.

957
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:40,076
James, there will be no bombshell.

958
01:00:41,397 --> 01:00:45,557
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end. I do apologise.

959
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:47,398
Tonight's show has been about cars.

960
01:00:47,398 --> 01:00:49,638
Even the guest.
Even the guest was a driver.

961
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:52,958
Don't worry, next week,
normal service is resumed.

962
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:55,478
There are many accidents
and a light fire.

963
01:00:55,478 --> 01:00:57,039
We'll see them. Good night.

964
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:14,961
