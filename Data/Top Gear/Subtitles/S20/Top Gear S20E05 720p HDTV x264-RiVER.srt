1
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:14,517
Tonight... Richard drives
a new Lamborghini.

2
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:17,353
James and I go on a caravan holiday.

3
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,488
And a rock god
is in our Reasonably Priced Car.

5
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:34,422
Thank you, everybody! Hello! Hello
and welcome. Thank you, everybody.

6
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:38,023
Thank you, thanks. Now...

7
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:46,433
1963 saw the birth of two things
I'm not very interested in.

8
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:50,074
The Porsche 911 and James May.

9
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:55,353
Apparently, however, there is
now a new 911, which won't be new

10
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:59,114
in any way at all,
and James has been driving it.

11
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,713
Here it is. And I agree.

12
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:13,233
In terms of appearance,

13
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:17,274
it's changed rather less
over the last 50 years than I have.

14
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:23,193
The interior may be more ordered,

15
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:26,513
and Porsche nerds will spot
that it's a couple of inches longer.

16
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:30,554
But to normal people,
it looks just like another 911.

17
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:41,913
In truth, though, this is all new.

18
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:45,193
The body, for example,
is now made from aluminium,

19
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:48,714
which means it is much lighter -
and lighter is good.

20
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:54,954
The 3.8 litre flat-six engine
has been upgraded.

21
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:02,953
There's a new seven-speed
manual gearbox.

22
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:05,033
Which is fantastic.

23
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:08,954
And all new suspension,
which does its job impeccably.

24
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:18,113
For 50 years, Porsche have
bloody-mindedly stuck with

25
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:22,074
this daft idea of building a car
with the engine at the back, but...

26
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:28,113
half a century of
consistent fiddling around

27
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,033
and they've made it work
brilliantly.

28
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:35,394
It's so good that it brought on
a temporary attack of yobbishness.

29
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:42,594
Turn in, give it
a little squeeze of power.

30
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:46,234
Feel it all tighten up.

31
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:49,754
How could you not like a 911?

32
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,913
And that question brings me
on to an important point.

33
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:59,914
Strange to say it,
but this car has a big problem.

34
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:05,873
And that problem is
classic 911 enthusiasts.

35
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:09,513
To them,
this car is the work of Satan,

36
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:14,753
and simply because it isn't an old
911. I'll give you a good example.

37
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:18,153
This car has electric
power steering,

38
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,713
and, to be honest,
I'm perfectly happy with it.

39
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,153
So would you be, I'm sure.

40
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,153
And if you put
electric power steering

41
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:28,193
on a Lamborghini or a Maserati,
nobody would bat an eyelid.

42
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:32,353
But on a 911, this simple
technical development has turned

43
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:35,113
the faithful into an angry,
roaring mob,

44
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:39,233
storming up from the village with
pitchforks and blazing effigies,

45
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,714
shouting, "Witchcraft!"

46
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:47,553
What they actually want in
a new 911 is a 911 that's new

47
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:49,553
and yet not new.

48
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,514
What they want is this...

49
00:03:56,714 --> 00:04:00,074
the work of a small Californian
company called Singer.

50
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:04,873
This looks like an old 911,

51
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:09,314
and some of its parts are indeed
cherry-picked from past 911s.

52
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:13,114
But the whole car is custom-built.

53
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:21,674
And, where necessary,
it's peppered with modern touches.

54
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:38,474
The engine is another classic 911
3.8 litre flat-six.

55
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:43,593
But this one has been fettled
by Cosworth in California,

56
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,994
and develops 360 horsepower.

57
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,354
And a lovely buzz.

58
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,873
Gets you in there.

59
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:59,273
And although the body may look like
it's come from a 1960s Porsche,

60
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:02,594
almost all of it has been
remodelled in carbon fibre.

61
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:10,513
The result of that is that this
911 weighs 200 kilograms less

62
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:11,874
than a new one.

63
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:19,113
That's like taking a Harley Davidson
out of the luggage compartment.

64
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:23,434
So, yes, it is a tribute band,
but it can rock like the original.

65
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,194
No, better, actually.

66
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:33,193
The precision on the steering -
you didn't feel that,

67
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:36,874
obviously, because you're not in
here, but it's utterly intuitive.

68
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,073
Look, it's an old 911,
it feels old,

69
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:43,594
and then I get to the hammerhead,
and the brakes are tremendous.

70
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:53,753
0-60 takes 4.5 seconds, and the
top speed is 175 miles an hour.

71
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:57,594
But, actually, in this car,
those figures are irrelevant.

72
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,033
The interesting thing is,
they could've overdone this.

73
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:08,513
I mean, it would be possible to
put the turbo engine in this car,

74
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:11,673
they could have made it ludicrously
powerful, but they haven't.

75
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:15,273
They've concentrated on
the sensation of performance,

76
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,033
the noise, the vibration,
the feel of the steering.

77
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:19,754
That's what actually matters.

78
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:25,193
Before we go any further,

79
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:28,313
you're probably wondering
what all this excellence costs.

80
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:34,914
Well, the bottom line is, it's a
lot. Around £280,000, in fact.

81
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:41,033
Now, that is a lot of money
for a car, I know.

82
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,433
But, then again, £50,000 is a lot
of money for one of those Dior

83
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,473
couture dresses,
until I learned that

84
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:52,753
over 2,000 hours of immaculate
handiwork goes into making it.

85
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:54,793
It's the same with the car.

86
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:59,153
The monks of this monastery of
the 911 have prostrated themselves

87
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:03,154
before their icon and anointed it
with exquisite gifts.

88
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:14,433
Each of these cars
takes 4,000 man-hours to make.

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,753
And each one features unique
touches - like the rev counter

90
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:22,794
in this one, that goes up to 11
as a tribute to Spinal Tap.

91
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:25,953
What this is, in truth,

92
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:30,674
is more than just the perfect bauble
for the devoted 911 enthusiast.

93
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:37,233
What this is... Well, it's a
bit like the Eagle E-Type that

94
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:43,594
Jeremy drove a few series back.
It's a love letter to a car.

95
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,073
Can I just say... Hold on a minute.

96
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:03,393
That steering - what do you
mean you're perfectly happy

97
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:07,673
with the electric steering on the
new 911? I don't think it matters.

98
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:10,953
But the steering was the defining
characteristic of any

99
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:14,073
of the generations of 911.
It's about how it feels.

100
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,553
You said how the steering feels.
I know, you're right.

101
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:18,873
You're talking about
the little patter thing inside.

102
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,393
Well, I know what you mean.
But it's better.

103
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:25,233
But that means they've changed it.
Shut up!

104
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:28,713
All 911s are exactly the same.

105
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:34,633
That's like saying all babies are the
same. They are! They are identical.

106
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,233
And that one that Singer
has modified, that is

107
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:40,313
completely different.
Oh, he's still going on about it.

108
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,473
It's like a sort of 911
greatest hits.

109
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,794
That's like a Showaddywaddy
greatest hits!

110
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:49,553
Can we please stop
talking about the 911?

111
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,193
Please, let's do the news,
let's do the news. OK.

112
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,593
And now, it's time for the news.

113
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:56,993
Porsche has announced a new 911.

114
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,553
Oh, for crying out loud. I'm going.
Oh, this is going to be good!

115
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:06,153
It revs to 9,000rpm. Shut up
about your glorified Beetle!

116
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,273
It's not a Beetle,
it's a magnificent thing.

117
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,753
That is going to be about £100,000,
the end of this year,

118
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:13,673
it'll be here. It's going to be
wonderful. All right, all right.

119
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,953
We'll move it on.

120
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,954
Now, there is a new Porsche 911.

121
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,313
This is the Turbo and the Turbo S.

122
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,513
Clues to identification
begin with that...

123
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:26,513
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Didn't Porsche say a while back

124
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:29,953
they were never going to make
another 911 Turbo?

125
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:33,113
Actually, they did in the '90s,
they did say that. Exactly.

126
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,794
So, not only are they
crap engineers, they're liars.

127
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:41,113
You cannot level crap engineers
at Porsche. Yes, I can. Yes, I can.

128
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,513
They haven't evolved.

129
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,793
They had one idea and
they just produced it

130
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,713
year after year after year.

131
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,834
You've got to move on.
Look at this show...

132
00:09:57,314 --> 00:10:00,673
Maybe we can edit that out.
We'll edit that out.

133
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,313
So, that's interesting.

134
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:06,593
So, what you're saying is, Porsche
had an idea and stuck with it,

135
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:09,034
and I respect them for that.

136
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:19,473
Right, let's move onto proper news.
Oh, now, yes. Bad news.

137
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:24,193
Mr Cameron has decided there should
be a ban on internet pornography.

138
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:25,834
What are you going to do?

139
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:30,473
That means we will no longer be
able to look at pictures like this.

140
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,194
Wait a minute, is this wise?!

141
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:37,673
He hasn't banned it yet. Have a look
at this. Oh, I see what you mean.

142
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,153
Oooh.

143
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:44,153
That is strong pornography. It is.
It's actually a one-off Lamborghini.

144
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:47,233
It's called the Selfish.
It's not called the Selfish.

145
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:49,793
It is. It's called the Egoista.
It's Italian for "selfish".

146
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,833
Anyway,
you won't be able to see that.

147
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,913
And nor will you be
able to see this.

148
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:57,514
In what way is that pornography?
Well, it's orange.

149
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,073
The thing is -
this is a true story, OK?

150
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:04,393
A friend of mine has a website,
and it has an orange backdrop.

151
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:08,313
Now, in various offices and work
places that have this porn filter

152
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:11,913
on the internet, OK, orange
is picked up as a skin tone -

153
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,633
which, of course,
it is in Cheshire, yeah?

154
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:18,393
It's picked up, so it will just
see that as a naked lady with

155
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:21,433
a sort of vajazzle in the shape
of a Renault badge.

156
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,193
And then it won't let anyone see it.

157
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:26,753
So Mr Cameron's porn filter
is just going to stop us

158
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,593
looking at things that are orange?

159
00:11:28,594 --> 00:11:31,193
Yeah, David Dickinson's had it.
He's gone!

160
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:34,393
I think it's a bit more
sophisticated than that.

161
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,593
I think it looks for words and
things as well. On search engines.

162
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:40,513
Certain words? Obviously.

163
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,193
Volvo. They've had it.

164
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,313
Why?

165
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:46,194
Well, it's a bit close to...
Oh, I see!

166
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,793
What about Fuchs alloys?

167
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,553
You're never going to be able
to see a Fuchs alloy.

168
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,194
Bell helmets. No.

169
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:57,313
You can't look at them.

170
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:59,553
You know we were doing
the Africa special last year,

171
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:03,633
and I got my BMW stuck on that
termite mound thing, and I said,

172
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,713
"Right, James, you reverse onto me,

173
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:08,794
"and Hammond tug me
off from behind."

174
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:15,633
I said that. That won't be
showing up on iPlayer.

175
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,594
No, Mr Cameron, don't ban it.

176
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:22,113
Now, Ford has obviously decided
the problem with modern cars

177
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:24,433
is they don't have enough
radiator grilles,

178
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,793
so this is their new one,
this is the EcoSport.

179
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:29,833
It has one, two, three, four,
five radiator grilles.

180
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,993
It's only got a one-litre
engine under there -

181
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:34,273
it's going to need a blanket,
it'll be draughty.

182
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:37,113
It'll be shivering in a corner,
"I'm cold!"

183
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:40,513
That massive car hasn't got
a one-litre engine. No, it's not
massive.

184
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:44,793
It looks it, but it's basically a
Fiesta on stilts, it's a small car.

185
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:48,113
Can I just say,
the thing that baffles me most

186
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:51,193
about this car - I'm going
to quote for you here, OK?

187
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:55,793
It says, "As a first in Europe,
the Ford's SYNC App Link system

188
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:59,953
"will offer drivers voice control
of mobile apps on the move,

189
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,953
"including the music streaming
service Spotify."

190
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:06,394
Does anyone here have the first
idea what any of that means?

191
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:11,513
Does anyone really know? What is it?
Spotify? What is Spotify?

192
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,193
It's a music streaming service,

193
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:17,153
so you can listen to music over
the internet. Any music? Any music.

194
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:20,993
So, if I were just driving along
and I said "Roxanne", it would

195
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:25,673
play Roxanne? Maybe. Well,
hang on, that's not going to work.

196
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:28,713
Because we know the voice
recognition in cars is rubbish -

197
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:31,273
it never works, does it?
So, if you just say, "The Police",

198
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,434
it will probably actually
ring the police.

199
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,393
No, it will! It will, it will!

200
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:39,753
Because this car's got a feature
on it that if you have an accident

201
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:43,233
or get into problems, it calls
the emergency services for you.

202
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,553
Well, that's just
a recipe for disaster.

203
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,273
You'll be sitting there going,
"Right, get the fire brigade,"

204
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,793
and it would play The Move!

205
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:52,393
♪ Get the fire brigade
get the fire brigade! ♪

206
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:55,873
"I'm in trouble, help!"
♪ I need somebody, help! ♪

207
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:58,833
What a terrible way to die,
trapped in your car,

208
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,994
listening to all the embarrassing
rubbish on your iPod.

209
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:05,633
Anyway, so that won't work.
Let's move on.

210
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:08,033
Good news, ladies and gentlemen.

211
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,513
Dacia has announced a special,

212
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:14,593
limited-edition,
black version of the Duster.

213
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,313
Oooh.

214
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,713
No, hang on a minute.

215
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:21,593
I mean, I normally go,
"brilliant" and move on,

216
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,313
but that's black
like a Mercedes 6.2 V8?

217
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,954
No. It's literally black.

218
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:31,193
I was going to say they've
painted it black - actually,

219
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:34,113
they haven't painted it. They've
done a wrap in like a bin liner.

220
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,833
So there's a blue edition and
a yellow edition and a white one.

221
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:41,193
It's just a black car. That's a bit
daft. Now, can I just say something?

222
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:45,553
As we know, the heatwave ended
spectacularly in Britain on Tuesday.

223
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:48,193
Many storms, we've got some
pictures of the aftermath here.

224
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,754
I'm not gloating, but call me Noah.

225
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,713
I mean, this guy, with his BMW,
very proud of it,

226
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,834
but at that moment he's thinking,
"I wish I had that hover van."

227
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,873
I told you!

228
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:02,553
Now, a couple of weeks ago,

229
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:05,753
we drove across Spain
in three budget supercars.

230
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:09,633
Lamborghini then got in touch
and said they'd built one too.

231
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:12,914
Better still, they invited me
over to Italy to drive it.

232
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,754
So, here we are.

233
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:36,594
Budget car, Lamborghini style.
The Aventador Roadster.

234
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:40,673
As you'd expect from Lamborghini,

235
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:45,953
it's basically a roofless wedge
of ginormous numbers.

236
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:48,314
700 horsepower.

237
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:53,833
217 miles an hour, 6.5 litre V12.

238
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:57,673
£289,000. The only small number?

239
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:01,914
0-60 - three seconds.
You get where I'm going.

240
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:09,714
It also handles beautifully,
easily as sharp as the hardtop.

241
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,073
But I'm not going to spend
my time today doing a big,

242
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,233
technical assessment of this car's
driving dynamics and such,

243
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:21,553
because what I'm interested in
is why this car perfectly sums up

244
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:24,994
what's so special about Lamborghini.

245
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,313
You see, most sports car companies,

246
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:39,393
a lot of their appeal
comes down to their heritage.

247
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:44,113
Cars named after famous race tracks,
famous races -

248
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,793
Mille Miglia, Lamont, and the like.

249
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:49,753
But Lamborghini has never
bothered with any of that.

250
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:53,913
Their mission has always been to make
the best bedroom wall poster

251
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:57,594
subjects in the world -
always looking forward.

252
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,273
Never back.

253
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:03,913
Look at this thing.
It's just pure theatre.

254
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,073
Everything is dialled up to 11.

255
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:10,433
It brings out the nine-year-old
inside every 40-year-old.

256
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,393
43... 38.

257
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:15,514
Middle-aged. Early middle-aged man.

258
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,873
What's really astonishing is
they've been pulling off this trick

259
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,513
for 50 years now.

260
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:29,873
That's five decades of unleashing
unique, flamboyant machines,

261
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:33,954
each more outrageous than the last.

262
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,833
The thing is, that's kind of a
high risk strategy, cos how do

263
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:46,833
you keep doing extreme, year after
year after year, for 50 years?

264
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,793
What do you come up with next?

265
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,113
Well, let's find out what, shall we?

266
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:55,313
Because, in truth, this isn't
the car they rang us about.

267
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:59,874
The car they rang us about
makes this look dull.

268
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:26,353
It's called the Sesto Elemento,
Italian for "sixth element".

269
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:31,793
And in the periodic table, that
sixth element is carbon, which is

270
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:35,753
no coincidence, because this thing
is made from little else.

271
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:37,953
The prop shaft, the suspension -

272
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:41,954
even the wheel rims are
all forged from carbon.

273
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:47,753
And the body is made from
a revolutionary blend of plastic

274
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:51,554
and carbon, jointly developed
by Lamborghini and Boeing.

275
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:59,033
Such an extreme car
deserves an extreme location.

276
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,954
Which is why we've returned
to the fearsome Imola racetrack.

277
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:13,033
Right. Last time I was here,
I was in a Noble M600,

278
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:16,314
which, as we know, is no slouch.

279
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:21,953
Let's give it a shot. Three...

280
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,034
Let's just do it.

281
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,714
It's different! That's what it is!

282
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:47,754
It's super fast.

283
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,754
God, it nearly wheelies.

284
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,593
The reason it's so fast is not only

285
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,353
because it's powered by
a 570 horsepower V10,

286
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:03,353
but also because,
despite that massive engine,

287
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:05,913
and a full four-wheel-drive system,

288
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,554
it weighs less than a Ford Fiesta.

289
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:13,794
That means 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds.

290
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:19,113
The same as a Veyron.

291
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,914
Holy moly!

292
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:27,634
Now, there are other supercars
that are fast because they're light.

293
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:34,394
But no car is as extreme as this
in the pursuit of shedding weight.

294
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:39,673
The Sesto Elemento doesn't even have
paint.

295
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:44,274
Instead, its colour comes from flecks
of crystal embedded in the bodywork.

296
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:48,153
And there's more.

297
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:52,193
These seats, they're not actually
seats, they've just made these pads

298
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,473
in a seat shape and stuck them
directly onto the chassis.

299
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:58,113
And the dashboard, there isn't one.

300
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:01,753
Instead you get this exposed
carbon plastic composite

301
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:06,113
but what I love is the way they've
done all this brutal simplicity

302
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:09,113
and weight-saving in an Italian way.

303
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,753
It's beautiful.

304
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:13,794
This central spar looks like it
belongs in a modern art gallery.

305
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,673
Yet despite its many unique
qualities,

306
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:29,433
the Sesto Elemento does share one
thing with other high-end
sports cars.

307
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:32,114
Its ability to empty
your bank account.

308
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:39,233
I think Lamborghini has learned
from Porsche the art of charging
more for less.

309
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:42,433
So this thing, with its missing
dashboard and seats, is,

310
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,553
wait for it,

311
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,074
£1.95 million.

312
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:53,473
However,
there's no time to be shocked by that

313
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:59,514
because right now I'm in a £2 million
hyper car and I've got it all
to myself.

314
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:10,354
That moment when it turns in,
it changes direction,
it turns like a swallow.

315
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,513
Because it's light,
you can break so late

316
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:20,193
and because it's light it can turn so
hard without tearing its own tyres
off.

317
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:22,833
And because it's light,
when you get out of the turn

318
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:26,954
the 570-brake horsepower V10
just catapults it.

319
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:41,714
People talk about being at one
with the car.

320
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:45,314
I've grown a car out of my hands
and feet.

321
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:51,154
Operating the steering is just
a joyous experience!

322
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:58,154
It's the most alive thing I've ever
driven. It's beautiful.

323
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,954
Absolutely dazzling.

324
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:13,233
And when you've finished, you can
get out and remind yourself you've

325
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:16,194
been driving something
that looks like this.

326
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:23,513
I've said for some time that
Pagani have been stealing
Lamborghini's crown

327
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:27,313
when it comes to making
the best bedroom wall poster car

328
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:32,074
but I think the new boys have just
been slapped down.

329
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:48,593
It's amazing.

330
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,074
When you say it's light.
Have you seen the windscreen?

331
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:56,673
That is how light this thing is.
That's not even glass.

332
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:59,673
It was electrifying to drive
because if you think,

333
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:02,473
most supercars are broadly the same.

334
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,673
This just felt different.
It feels like the future.

335
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:08,313
I took it for a spin this morning,
as, you know...

336
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:13,193
And what I loved about it is
because it's just a Gallardo
underneath it's not intimidating.

337
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:16,633
It's just fantastically fast
without being terrifying.

338
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,953
It nimble and sharp, it's beautiful.

339
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:22,313
Anyway, we must now find out how
fast it goes around our track

340
00:24:22,314 --> 00:24:26,593
and that means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

341
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:30,274
Some say he's married to
one of Princess Anne's hats.

342
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:35,993
And that he spent all week standing
outside a hospital in London

343
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:39,313
pretending to be Nicholas Witchell.

344
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,954
All we know he is he's
called The Stig.

345
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:48,913
And away he goes. No weight so it
takes off like a housefly.

346
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:52,833
Coming up to the first corner,
shunting power backwards here

347
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:57,234
to drive it through maintaining
grip. That's controlled.

348
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,714
No stereo
so no TV theme tunes mercifully.

349
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,873
A wiggle through Chicago.

350
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:09,313
Listen to that noise,
it's spectacular.

351
00:25:09,314 --> 00:25:14,153
Will it understeer or oversteer?
No, it won't do either of them.

352
00:25:14,154 --> 00:25:18,074
A bit of a bounce.
Stig is really on it today.

353
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:25,913
Right, follow-through.
All 570-horsepower unleashed here.

354
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:30,993
A bit of a drift. Steady on, Stig.
Wait, he's gone!

355
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:37,633
He's gone, he's lost it. And he's
on the grass. Oh, my giddy aunt!

356
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,113
Ooh, now that is a surprise.

357
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:43,993
That's only the second time
he's ever spun off here.

358
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:47,833
But he did eventually complete a lap
and I have the time here.

359
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:51,353
This is where
the normal Gallardo got.

360
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:54,394
But because this is a little bit
lighter, it's quick.

361
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:59,713
Faster than that.

362
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:03,193
Is it faster than
the Bugatti Veyron?

363
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,434
Yes, it is. No way! You're not...

364
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,354
Wow! That is amazing!

365
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,154
That's what happens
when you lose weight.

366
00:26:19,514 --> 00:26:20,994
So, that...

367
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:28,593
That is where it goes on our board
and now it goes on the floor.

368
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:31,913
No, it must. Sorry because you can't
drive that on the road.

369
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:34,473
The board is for road cars only.
Those are the rules.

370
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:38,793
Absolutely and now we must
move on to the film Armageddon.

371
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:42,273
Ever since I saw that
I've wanted to get the actress

372
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:45,433
Liv Tyler to appear
in the Reasonably Priced Car.

373
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,193
I have nagged and nagged

374
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:51,394
and finally last week she agreed...
to send her dad.

375
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:56,153
Apparently he's a singer in a band
called Aerosmith.

376
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:59,754
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Liv Tyler's dad.

377
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:19,953
I would have preferred your daughter
but you'll do. Have a seat.

378
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:23,553
You'll do. I love you too!

379
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:25,953
They're happy.

380
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:29,313
Now, yesterday
we were trying to get hold of you

381
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,753
and we were told by your people that
you were walking round Stonehenge

382
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:37,434
with the son of God, or, as
we sometimes call him, David Icke.

383
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:41,153
No, David Icke is quite
the character

384
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:44,593
and I wanted to find out what it was
all about so I called him up

385
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:48,033
and said, "Will you take me
around Stonehenge and show me around

386
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,073
"so I can feel the energy
of the place?"

387
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:53,353
I would have taken you around
Silverstone - it would have
been more fun.

388
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:57,313
I'd have to check into rehab
again with you! Yeah, you would.

389
00:27:57,314 --> 00:28:02,353
Are you ever in the UK often? Not as
much as I wish I was. Not as much.

390
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:04,553
The band plays here
and then we are on tour

391
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,353
and we take off and go other places.

392
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:10,233
In the early days, you went
around pretending to be Mick Jagger,
as I understand.

393
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:12,634
Oh, jeez, that was 1967.

394
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:15,873
Actually I pretended
to be his brother

395
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,913
because someone said, "Are you
Mick Jagger?" and I said, "No,

396
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:22,753
"I'm his brother."
And they believed me.

397
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:24,793
They chased me down the beach

398
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:30,393
and I got my first hit of what
it must be like to be a rock star.
And I loved it.

399
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:35,153
Now, from what I understand,
unusually, you're not here

400
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,873
because you're promoting
something or a new album,

401
00:28:37,874 --> 00:28:41,633
you came over because you wanted to
drive our Vauxhall Astra. I did.

402
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:46,313
On Top Gear. I did.
My Hennessy venom was very jealous.

403
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:50,314
You have a Hennessey Venom.
Does anyone here know what that is?

404
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:55,753
There's nodding going on.
In essence it is a Lotus Exige.

405
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:59,633
It is, stretched out and it's the
fastest road car there is right now.

406
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:05,273
I thought it hadn't quite beaten
the Bugatti Veyron
for the ultimate top speed.

407
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:08,713
It was 265 miles an hour,
did the Venom reach?

408
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:13,033
I think it beat all
the records in two miles.
Oh, in two miles...

409
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,753
We've got some footage here of
this car doing this record.

410
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:19,354
You really need to see this.
Here we go.

411
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,434
That's me on Sunset Strip!

412
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:31,633
To be brutally honest,
from that, which is impressive,

413
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,873
we don't get much of an idea
of what the car looks like

414
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:37,873
so we've got a still of it so we can
have a look. Are they sandals?

415
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:41,234
They are. With socks.
With socks. That's right.

416
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:48,793
There's a motorcycle you've got
called a Confederate Hellcat.

417
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:54,673
I mean... Phenomenal looking thing.
Have you ridden it? Oh, yeah.

418
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:58,753
You've got to hold onto
the handlebars for dear life.

419
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:01,594
Anything worth doing is worth
overdoing.

420
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,433
The Spinal Tap mentality.

421
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:07,153
And you have a Lotus Seven as well,
don't you? I have a Super Seven.

422
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:08,513
One of the first things I got.

423
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:12,673
That I get in every spring
with my son and crank Brian...

424
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:14,553
has the top speed, does he?

425
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:17,113
From AC/DC? Brian Johnson? Yeah.

426
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:22,473
Every spring I get in the car
with my son, bom, dun, un, un...

427
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:24,633
Dun, un, unt...

428
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:29,153
So, if you're driving around in that
with AC/DC blaring out,

429
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:32,514
don't people go, "I'm sure that's
the guy from Aerosmith."

430
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,754
It's like me drumming along
watching Fifth Gear.

431
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:42,194
Presumably you can't remember what
you were driving in the '80s?

432
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:49,433
A Porsche. You think? No, I know.
Were you able to drive it ever?

433
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:52,114
Hell, yeah. I just held one eye.

434
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,633
Because you did
a lot of spells in rehab.

435
00:30:55,634 --> 00:31:00,353
Yeah, when you are in a band
that still working it's

436
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:03,433
kind of like living on the tail
of a comet and when you

437
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:08,073
are used to the curtain falling
at Madison Square Garden there is

438
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:13,233
a certain energy that you don't get
playing ping-pong after the show.

439
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:15,593
You want to go back with the twins

440
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:18,593
and drink yourself under the table.

441
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:21,673
We're not at the watershed yet!

442
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:24,873
With some twins
and play table tennis with them.

443
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:28,033
And is Aerosmith coming back,
will we be seeing Aerosmith?

444
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:31,433
We're on tour right now.
We just did Singapore
for the first time

445
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:35,833
and we are off to Japan, China and
South America so we are out. Really?

446
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:39,993
Yeah, yeah. Where'd you think I got
the whatwithal to drive that

447
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:44,673
thing around the track? This is it.
We are coming onto your lap now.
How was it?

448
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:49,393
You know what, my mum used to say
don't ever be afraid,

449
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:55,473
she said amateurs built the Ark
and pros built the Titanic.

450
00:31:55,474 --> 00:31:59,873
Meanwhile, I got in this car
and I was scared to death.

451
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:04,273
I've never been on a racetrack
before ever. Really? Ever. Ever.

452
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:06,113
And I didn't know where I was going.

453
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:10,193
The thing is though I was
actually... Had one ear on the track

454
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,513
and I heard a noise
that sounded biblical.

455
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:18,714
It sounded like you changed first,
second, third, fourth, first.

456
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:21,713
That's what it was.

457
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:25,434
And there was a noise of tremendous
strain and breakage. Yeah.

458
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:30,954
Was it badly damaged?
We had to change cars. You did.

459
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:35,873
Presumably it's because you are used
to driving on the wrong
side of the road.

460
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:40,154
The wrong side... First of all,
I'm listening to The Stig talking
to me like this...

461
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,514
I went, "Right on!"

462
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:49,553
And I got ears in as if I can hear
anyway with the rock'n'roll

463
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:52,153
all these years and I'm on that side
of the car

464
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:56,033
and I'm shifting with this hand.
So I had to pull all that together.

465
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:58,234
Who would like to see Steven's lap?

466
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,753
In the spare car,
let's have a look.

467
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:08,633
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith
in the Vauxhall.

468
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:11,193
Come on, Steve McQueen.

469
00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:14,113
Coming to me, baby. Come on.

470
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:18,314
Looking good there.
Oh, but not fast.

471
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:24,914
And around the first corner.
No accidents there.

472
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:30,273
Did it again.
You don't want to miss a thing.

473
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,394
But you missed third.

474
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:37,354
And you missed the apex.
But here we go. Tragic!

475
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:41,594
But it sure is fun.

476
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:46,273
Here we go, hammerhead.

477
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,513
Understeer, oversteer.
Any speed at all? I'm in the lines.

478
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:53,353
You were between the lines.
That was very tidy.

479
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:57,713
And you've used nearly all the road
apart from these three metres.

480
00:33:57,714 --> 00:34:01,433
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

481
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:03,194
Yeah.

482
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:10,073
Did you keep your foot hard down
through there? You did. Good man.

483
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:14,593
And through there? Yeah.
Stig did that earlier and crashed.

484
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,993
Bet he didn't mention that.

485
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:21,033
Right, another apex not quite here
and what about Gambon?

486
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:23,273
Oh, yes it's wide
but there we are,

487
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:25,794
ladies and gentlemen,
across the line.

488
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:33,514
Well done. Damage report.

489
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,913
Damage report. Damage reports.

490
00:34:38,914 --> 00:34:45,033
Well, in fact we're bookended
by Mike Rutherford out of Genesis,

491
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,993
1.51.5 at the bottom

492
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:49,673
and then Brian at the top
and other people in the middle.

493
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:52,074
I've got the time here.
Let's have a look.

494
00:34:57,274 --> 00:34:58,994
It was a one.

495
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:06,273
Then I'm afraid it was five.

496
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:07,633
Oooh!

497
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:09,953
Then there was another one.

498
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:12,313
But happily for you it was a nought.

499
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:15,994
So, you are not actually
the slowest we've ever had.

500
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:29,673
No wonder The Stig kept saying would
you like to go round one more time?

501
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:35,033
I'm looking for something I can give
you that's a crumb of comfort.

502
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:39,314
You're not the fastest American
because that would be Ron Howard.

503
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:46,273
Not the fastest... You're 65 now,
aren't you? Cor blimey.

504
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:49,233
You're not the fastest pensioner
because that's Brian Johnson,

505
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,673
you're not the fastest...

506
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:54,753
You're just not very good at driving
a Vauxhall Astra. That's all.

507
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:57,873
You should have sent Liv.

508
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:00,793
I should have sent my son, Taj.
Is he good? Oh, he's great.

509
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:02,554
No, you still should have sent Liv.

510
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:07,794
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been
a huge pleasure. Steven Tyler.

511
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:24,113
Now, on this show
we like to test cars for everybody -

512
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:27,953
rock stars,
billionaires, Arab oil sheiks.

513
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:31,593
We like to think we're more
inclusive than the BBC

514
00:36:31,594 --> 00:36:33,114
regional news programme.

515
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:39,193
But there's one group of motorists
that we always ignore. caravannists.

516
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:43,593
Yes, and because there are
half a million caravans in Britain,

517
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:46,593
we buy more caravans
than any other European nation,

518
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:50,353
the producer said that Jeremy
and I should address this issue.

519
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,793
Yes, they told us
to do a proper comparison test

520
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:58,314
like they do in Which? magazine
and they told us not to muck about.

521
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:06,553
These are the cars caravannists
like.

522
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:09,793
Jacked-up diesel hatchbacks
with part-time four-wheel-drive

523
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,034
so we can deal with muddy campsite.

524
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:18,033
They're all terrible.

525
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:21,753
I know they're all terrible
but they're very popular.

526
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:24,673
The Nissan Kumquat is the sixth
bestselling car in Britain.

527
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:28,833
We have to decide which one of these
is best. You mean the least worst.

528
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:30,793
All right, the least worst.

529
00:37:30,794 --> 00:37:34,154
Right, you pick a key and we'll
start with that. Here we go.

530
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:39,233
I think this is how most caravanners
end up with their cars.

531
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:43,874
They just get the keys from
a bowl at a party. Toyota RAV4.

532
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:52,713
Here it is,
it has a 2.2 litre engine,

533
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:58,793
prices start at £22,000. However,
it does sit in a rather high

534
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:00,433
insurance group and for that reason,

535
00:38:00,434 --> 00:38:03,913
because we have to be ruthless,
we must eliminate it straightaway.

536
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,073
Good work, James.
Crisp delivery, full of facts.

537
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:12,833
However, this is a Mitsubishi
Outlander. Is it? It's not a RAV4.

538
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:15,554
They all look exactly the same.

539
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:20,713
To try and find some differences,
we took them all for a spin

540
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:24,194
and very soon
we came to a startling conclusion.

541
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:28,553
They're all exactly the same
to drive as well -

542
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:30,994
they are all very dreary.

543
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:36,553
Let me explain my problem
with cars of this type.

544
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:38,833
This is a Honda Civic,
this is a Honda CRV.

545
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:43,113
They have exactly the same engine,
they seat the same number of

546
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:47,713
people and they have the same level
of crash protection and safety.

547
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:51,833
But caravanners choose the CRV,
which is more expensive to buy,

548
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,153
more expensive to run
and nowhere near as nice to drive

549
00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:58,713
because it suits their annual
holiday requirement.

550
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,993
And that's like clomping
around in ski boots all year

551
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:04,193
because every February you
go to the Alps.

552
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:07,393
I mean, I like snorkelling
but I don't go shopping

553
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:11,193
every day in a face mask because it
saves me the bother of...

554
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:16,073
As Jeremy ranted on, I drew up a big
chart showing all the facts

555
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:18,553
that caravannists care about.

556
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:24,153
Insurance, CO2 emissions,
maximum towing weights and so on.

557
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:27,994
And with this,
we could start to see what's what.

558
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:33,193
This is the chart our researchers
have drawn up.

559
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:35,473
And straightaway
we can see there's a problem with

560
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:40,913
the Peugeot 3008
which is the... blue one.

561
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:45,153
It's the brown one.
Well, whatever. Look here.

562
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:48,553
The maximum towing weight
on average is two tonnes,

563
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:53,273
the Chevrolet two tonnes, the Ford
is 2.1, two tonnes, two tonnes.

564
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:54,473
But the Peugeot,

565
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:58,713
because it's a hybrid, it can only
pull half a tonne.

566
00:39:58,714 --> 00:40:00,673
It couldn't even pull me.

567
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:02,713
It's a good point, it's significant

568
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:06,793
and the Nissan Kumquat may be
the sixth bestselling car in Britain

569
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:10,433
but look, 1.4 tonnes
against generally two tonnes.

570
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,193
We'll eliminate both those...

571
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,633
This is very professional work
we're doing here!

572
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:17,273
And I think we must turn now
to price, because I'm just

573
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:21,473
looking here at the Chevrolet
Captiva, it's over £28,000.

574
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:23,353
And look at its insurance group!

575
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,593
Yes, and the road tax because
it's not that good on emissions.

576
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:29,673
So you'd eliminate the Captiva
for being too expensive?

577
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:32,273
Yes, and I would like to
draw your attention to this,

578
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:33,913
the SsangYong Korando.

579
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,873
Under £19,000, can you see
anything wrong with that?

580
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:38,474
Yes, I'd rather have warts.

581
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:43,833
'We spent several hours
going through all the numbers

582
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:46,913
'in a professional,
caravan club-type way,

583
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:50,873
'until we were left
with just two cars.

584
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:56,394
'The Mazda CX-5 and the
top-selling Volkswagen Tiguan.

585
00:40:58,034 --> 00:41:01,633
'On paper, both are well priced
and both have low emissions

586
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:06,953
'and frugal diesel engines,
but which is the least worst?'

587
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:11,033
To find out, we've devised a
series of caravan-relevant tests,

588
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:12,233
starting with,

589
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:15,433
"Which one can do the best J-turn?"

590
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,393
'The Mazda went first.'

591
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:18,994
OK, here we go.

592
00:41:21,594 --> 00:41:26,073
Ready, brake and spin it
round into first, and away.

593
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:27,393
Not bad.

594
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,833
Not bad at all.

595
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,353
'But before I tried the VW,
there was a problem.'

596
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:35,793
What does he want?

597
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,673
James! He says it's not...

598
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:42,113
What does he want? He says it's
not very relevant to caravanning.

599
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:44,954
What isn't? J-turns.

600
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:50,393
Don't caravanners do J-turns?
He says no.

601
00:41:50,394 --> 00:41:54,793
Well, there we are, so that's not
a relevant test, as it turns out.

602
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:58,073
'To get a better idea of
what tests we should be doing,

603
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:02,954
'we were told to spend a day with
our cars living like caravannists.'

604
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:07,553
Er, right, James is
in the wrong car.

605
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:09,274
Cock!

606
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:15,993
'First of all, we decided to
go to something called the tip,

607
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:20,594
'which we'd been told is
something caravannists do a lot.'

608
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:24,713
There's one there that
you can throw your bra in.

609
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:28,073
Why would you throw your
bras away? Or your clothes?

610
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:31,393
Or your mobile phone, why would you
throw your mobile phone away? Look!

611
00:42:31,394 --> 00:42:34,153
Washing machines! "What shall
we throw away today, darling?"

612
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:36,873
"The spin dryer, shall we throw
that away? "What's for supper?"

613
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:39,553
"I've thrown the cooker away."
Cos that's what they've done.

614
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:41,674
They've just come and
thrown their cookers away.

615
00:42:43,754 --> 00:42:44,994
It's brand new!

616
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:52,473
That man just pulled up in his
Mercedes and threw this away.

617
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:57,993
It's dirty but it even...
Look, barcode!

618
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:03,234
He's just bought this from a shop,
come down here and thrown it away.

619
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,633
She's got something else.
Is it massive?

620
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:07,873
It's the wardrobe door.

621
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:10,713
She's just taken the door off
the wardrobe and thrown it away.

622
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,873
'Before leaving this strange place

623
00:43:12,874 --> 00:43:15,433
'we did something else
caravanners enjoy.

624
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:17,154
'We washed our cars.'

625
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:25,034
'And then we went to
caravannist heaven.'

626
00:43:28,074 --> 00:43:30,554
Is this any good?
Well, there's some chain.

627
00:43:38,194 --> 00:43:40,353
Plastic sheeting.

628
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:42,913
"Suitable for domestic use."
We need a bit more heavy duty.

629
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:44,673
Wait a minute.

630
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:47,073
'Soon our trolley was
full of many things

631
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:49,753
'we thought caravanners might buy.'

632
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:51,673
Quick lines, shovels...

633
00:43:51,674 --> 00:43:53,753
Zinc tub, axes...

634
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:56,674
Duct tape, saws, rope.

635
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:01,593
'We then took all our
new stuff to the tip

636
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:03,194
'and threw it away.'

637
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:08,274
'Having washed our cars again...'

'..we set off for the
garden centre, and on the way,

'I tried to solve a knotty problem.'

640
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:26,033
Last year, in Britain, 10,500
people bought a Volkswagen Tiguan.

641
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:29,393
3,000 bought a Mazda CX-5.

642
00:44:29,394 --> 00:44:32,033
Even though the Mazda is
less expensive to buy,

643
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:34,993
it uses less fuel,
it's cheaper to insure,

644
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:39,233
it's kinder to Johnny Polar Bear,
so the road tax is cheaper.

645
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:40,753
So why? What's wrong with it?

646
00:44:40,754 --> 00:44:44,074
What is it that puts a
caravanner off this car?

647
00:44:45,354 --> 00:44:49,514
'At the garden centre,
I thought I'd found the answer.'

648
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:53,114
What was that?!

649
00:44:55,314 --> 00:44:56,434
What did I just hit?

650
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:00,754
It's got automatic brakes!

651
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,233
It stopped without me asking it to,

652
00:45:05,234 --> 00:45:07,953
cos it thought I was
going to hit the hedge.

653
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:09,793
Get in.

654
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,833
Right. Try and run me down.

655
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,354
Oh, all right.

656
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:21,274
Now, if this doesn't work, you all
heard him say, "Try to run me down."

657
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:24,034
Urgh!

658
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:30,634
'In order to be even more thorough,
I decided to test it on James' car.'

659
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:33,154
Here we go, ready.

660
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,314
'You fooled it.'

661
00:45:41,234 --> 00:45:42,633
'A bit baffled,

662
00:45:42,634 --> 00:45:47,074
'we went back to the job of getting
into a caravanning state of mind.'

663
00:45:51,074 --> 00:45:53,914
Pansies, there we go!
Are those petunias?

664
00:46:11,154 --> 00:46:13,873
Look at that.
That is a duck. That is a duck.

665
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,634
Put it in the book.

666
00:46:21,994 --> 00:46:25,193
'Things were going well,
but as night fell,

667
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:29,993
'I realised the earlier crash
had broken my Mazda's intercooler.'

668
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:33,073
Engine inspection required,
there's an engine warning light,

669
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:34,513
every warning light there is.

670
00:46:34,514 --> 00:46:37,033
Right, this is not going
much further, so I'm going to

671
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:41,194
shove it in that car park over there
and we'll just wait for a tow truck.

672
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,873
'Weirdly, this remote
woodland car park

673
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:48,754
'was full of other cars
just like mine.'

674
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:52,993
Look at this.

675
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:55,233
This is really clever.

676
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:59,233
You can have one
interior light on, or two, or...

677
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:00,553
all four.

678
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:03,953
Dim, bright, dim, bright.

679
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,274
Dim, bright.

680
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,314
This is so dirty.

681
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:22,194
That's got it. There you go.

682
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:27,353
Is that Stan Collymore over there?

683
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:29,474
Flash your lights.

684
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:33,753
Yeah.

685
00:47:33,754 --> 00:47:36,354
No! No, it's Phil Mitchell.

686
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:40,714
'We were waiting in the
car park for quite some time.

687
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:45,874
'And the following morning,
the memories were still with us.'

688
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,433
'But having spent
the day as caravanners,

689
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:57,194
'we did at least know how we
SHOULD be testing our cars.'

690
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:00,633
'So, we put the Stig into the VW,

691
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:02,553
'hitched it up to a caravan

692
00:48:02,554 --> 00:48:04,913
'and asked him to set a lap time.'

693
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:07,434
Three, two, one, go!

694
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:14,474
What just fell over in there?
Scrabble.

695
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,153
We should explain,

696
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:21,633
the Volkswagen has a part-time
four-wheel drive system

697
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:25,954
which will cut in should sensors
detect he's about to lose control.

698
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:29,033
He probably is there.

699
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:32,073
Now there can be feeding power to
the back end as well. He's through.

700
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,593
He's through, he's looking
good there, looking good.

701
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:36,874
Coming up to Chicago.

702
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:40,673
Bit wobbly! He's very wobbly there!

703
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:42,433
Look at that, he's
completely sideways.

704
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:44,313
He's gathered it up
with an armful of oppo,

705
00:48:44,314 --> 00:48:46,154
which is what you
should do if that happens.

706
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:50,274
That's a five-wheel drift!

707
00:48:54,514 --> 00:49:00,553
Top speed of the Tiguan with the
caravan attached is just 70mph.

708
00:49:00,554 --> 00:49:03,633
Whoa! But look at that.

709
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:05,993
This, I think, is an
object lesson for caravanners.

710
00:49:05,994 --> 00:49:08,833
There's no need to dawdle,
you really can get your foot down.

711
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:12,434
The wheel! No! It's come off!

712
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:18,674
He's still going. I know he is!
We should move back.

713
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:24,674
He's coming in a shower of sparks
towards the line.

714
00:49:27,154 --> 00:49:29,273
And across the line!

715
00:49:29,274 --> 00:49:33,994
Two minutes, 15.82. So there we are.

716
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:37,234
'Next, it was the
turn of the Mazda.'

717
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:40,873
Three, two, one...

718
00:49:40,874 --> 00:49:43,154
Oh-h-h-h!

719
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:49,193
Right, now, we should bear in mind

720
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,913
the Mazda has ten more
horse powers than the Volkswagen.

721
00:49:52,914 --> 00:49:55,314
It has 30 or 40 more torques.

722
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:01,593
'In theory, then,
it should be faster.

723
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,073
'However...'

724
00:50:03,074 --> 00:50:06,794
Smoke coming off the brakes.
Smoke pouring off the brakes! Whoa!

725
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:16,913
'Having declared the Tiguan
the victor by default,

726
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:18,793
we took the Stig to the tip

727
00:50:18,794 --> 00:50:20,914
and threw him away.

728
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:26,473
'Then, as we were leaving,
the producers ambushed us

729
00:50:26,474 --> 00:50:27,834
'with a challenge.'

730
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:31,993
"You are stupid idiots."

731
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:34,513
Er, hello! Ooh!

732
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:37,953
"J-turns and high-speed laps
with the Stig are not relevant.

733
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:40,833
"In order to determine which
of your cars is actually best,

734
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:44,913
"YOU will now do some caravanning."

735
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:47,153
Really?
I knew it would come to this. Go on.

736
00:50:47,154 --> 00:50:51,233
"We have booked one luxury space
at an exclusive caravan site

737
00:50:51,234 --> 00:50:53,633
"in the prestigious New Forest.

738
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,754
"The one who arrives last
sleeps the night."

739
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:03,793
'The start point was
several miles away from the site.

740
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,953
'So, while James applied some
comedy stickers to his Hurricane XL

741
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:12,394
'and my Hurricane GTX,
I studied the map.'

742
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:15,633
So, there's the caravan site.

743
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:18,553
Now, I could drive to it
on the roads,

744
00:51:18,554 --> 00:51:21,553
but that would be anti-social,
I would hold people up,

745
00:51:21,554 --> 00:51:24,953
people who are going about
their lawful business.

746
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:28,754
Er, so why don't I just drive
cross-country? I mean, it's...

747
00:51:30,314 --> 00:51:32,834
It's not exactly
the Himalayas, is it?

748
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,954
'With our vans loaded...

749
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:38,674
'we were ready to go.'

750
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,434
Hey!

751
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:49,953
No, no, no, no.

752
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:54,233
Ah-ha-ha! Yes, the mighty...!

753
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:57,594
No! No, no, how's he done that?!

754
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,873
'Annoyingly, James had
not only taken the lead

755
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:05,754
'but he'd also had the same
idea as me about going off-road.'

756
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:08,914
That's tracking straight and true.

757
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:13,873
No way Jeremy can get past here.

758
00:52:13,874 --> 00:52:16,353
Trying for an overtake.

759
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:17,514
Not happening.

760
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:24,034
Come on, May!

761
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:28,553
'Soon, we had different
ideas about which way to go.'

762
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:29,834
Urgh!

763
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:34,394
It's a bit choppy
but I think it's shorter.

764
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:37,753
'And with Mr Slowly out of the way,

765
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:41,034
'I could unleash the
more powerful Mazda.'

766
00:52:42,354 --> 00:52:43,634
Come on!

767
00:52:45,554 --> 00:52:48,234
Ye-e-e-es!

768
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:53,834
Agh!

769
00:52:56,514 --> 00:52:57,834
Up we go.

770
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:06,674
It's amazing the ease with which the
CX-5 is pulling the Hurricane GTX.

771
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:12,674
This is what this car
was designed to do.

772
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:18,313
Get you the best
plot on the campsite.

773
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:20,674
Oh, no! No!

774
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:25,834
'Meanwhile, my shortcut
had got a bit boggy.'

775
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:32,673
So nearly out.

776
00:53:32,674 --> 00:53:36,194
If I could just get it to climb up
onto that other ratty bit...

777
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:41,793
That's coming, here we go.

778
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:44,353
Yes! Ha-ha!

779
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,554
If you've got one of these,
you can do that!

780
00:53:49,314 --> 00:53:53,433
'I, meanwhile, had found a track
where I could go even faster.'

781
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:57,313
Yeah, that is very quick now.
It's good, looking good.

782
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:58,434
'However...'

783
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:07,833
Oh, look at this.

784
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:11,433
The sheer torque of the
2.2 litre turbo-diesel engine

785
00:54:11,434 --> 00:54:13,754
has ripped the front
from the Hurricane.

786
00:54:17,594 --> 00:54:23,393
'And I couldn't back off because
suddenly James was right behind me.'

787
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:25,194
Hee-hee!

788
00:54:26,314 --> 00:54:29,193
Coming up on me, he's gaining!

789
00:54:29,194 --> 00:54:30,634
'And then...'

790
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:35,234
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, no.

791
00:54:40,754 --> 00:54:44,913
This is disastrous, I'm actually
driving through Jeremy's caravan!

792
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:49,233
James, are things as bad back
there as I suspect they are?

793
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:52,073
Well, let me put it this way,
I've run over your left hand wall.

794
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:54,354
Oh, and your portable lavatory!

795
00:54:58,914 --> 00:55:01,673
'Then, things got even worse.'

796
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,354
Now we're on somebody's lawn!

797
00:55:05,114 --> 00:55:09,474
Come on, come on,
mighty 2.2 litre diesel!

798
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:13,354
Oh, no!

799
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:19,514
A very big catastrophe
has befallen me!

800
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:24,233
I could actually overtake now
but this is too amusing.

801
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:26,394
I've got to...!

802
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:34,633
'Sadly, I was laughing so much,

803
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:37,313
'I crashed...into myself.'

804
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:38,874
I've spun!

805
00:55:41,194 --> 00:55:44,193
'This, combined with
Jeremy's drastic weight loss,

806
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:46,754
'meant he could scamper away.'

807
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:57,514
60mph, this is
caravanning at its best.

808
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:04,393
'And by my reckoning, the site was
now just a couple of miles away.'

809
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:10,154
Victory now is mine, I will not be
sleeping in what remains of the van.

810
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:15,794
Whoa, it's a biggie!

811
00:56:18,794 --> 00:56:21,474
'Worried that I might be
sleeping in my van...

812
00:56:23,874 --> 00:56:26,114
'I kept my foot hard down.'

813
00:56:29,194 --> 00:56:31,314
Hurricane XL holding up well.

814
00:56:37,754 --> 00:56:38,914
Ooh, bloody hell!

815
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:43,954
Ha-ha! The XL refuses to die!

816
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:50,753
'I, meanwhile, had
arrived at the site

817
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:54,234
'and was looking for the
prestigious Plot 200.'

818
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:57,674
Where's Plot 200, Plot 200?

819
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:06,554
Yes, in here, by this stagnant pond.

820
00:57:10,354 --> 00:57:14,313
202...201...

821
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:17,833
Plot 200 is vacant,

822
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:22,314
which means
I don't have to stay in it. Yes!

823
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:28,113
So, there we are.

824
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:31,833
After the most exhaustive
caravan test in all of history,

825
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:36,353
we have established that
10,500 people are just plain wrong.

826
00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:40,194
The Volkswagen Tiguan
is NOT the best tow car.

827
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:43,034
Oh, is that James?

828
00:57:53,274 --> 00:57:55,713
No way!

829
00:57:55,714 --> 00:57:59,274
Plot 200, James, it's all yours!

830
00:58:02,394 --> 00:58:05,673
Where's the...?! I claim the
moral victory. Why a moral victory?

831
00:58:05,674 --> 00:58:07,953
I've still got a caravan.
Well, not really!

832
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:11,553
You haven't got a wheel, where's
the wheel gone? Well, what's that?!

833
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:15,594
Anybody like a cup of tea?
Yes? Jolly good.

834
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:27,594
Excellent. Really thorough.

835
00:58:28,994 --> 00:58:31,793
A proper grown-up test.

836
00:58:31,794 --> 00:58:33,753
Guys, I must say,

837
00:58:33,754 --> 00:58:37,233
it was great to see you two
actually being sensible for once.

838
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:40,313
But, if I might have a word,
your conclusion,

839
00:58:40,314 --> 00:58:42,673
you said the Mazda was best.

840
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:46,313
But, let's be honest, a 3mph
impact destroyed its intercooler.

841
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,473
That is true. That did happen, yes.

842
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:50,473
And in fairness, it was so powerful

843
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:54,433
it actually tore a caravan
to pieces. It did, it did.

844
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:57,753
And so, on that basis,
I would have the VW Tiguan.

845
00:58:57,754 --> 00:59:00,073
Well, no, you see,
the thing is, I wouldn't,

846
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:05,073
because a Volkswagen Golf is
£4,000 less expensive than a Tiguan,

847
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,473
so I'd buy one of those.

848
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:10,754
Then I'd take the £4,000 that I'd
saved to the tip and throw it away.

849
00:59:12,074 --> 00:59:15,193
No, what I'd do, actually,
I'd spend the £4,000

850
00:59:15,194 --> 00:59:19,794
on a fortnight's holiday in
the south of France in a HOTEL.

851
00:59:20,794 --> 00:59:23,593
Have we just done some
actual consumer advice there?

852
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:25,233
Yes, I think we have. Yeah, we have.

853
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:28,313
We have also managed to
go through a whole show

854
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,793
without mentioning the Royal baby!

855
00:59:30,794 --> 00:59:32,434
Yes, we have.

856
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:44,473
So, on those two bombshells,
it is time to end.

857
00:59:44,474 --> 00:59:47,874
Thank you very much for coming.
Thank you for watching, good night!

858
00:59:47,899 --> 01:00:16,690
