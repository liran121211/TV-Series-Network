1
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,719
Hello!

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,439
Hello, everybody! Thank you so much.
We're back!

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,600
We are back!

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,799
Yes, however, we're back

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,799
and I'm sure many of you will be
delighted to hear that in this,

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,120
our 20th series, we've slowed down
a little and grown up a lot.

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,599
We have. To show you what I mean,

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,199
we've prepared a montage
which shows what you can expect

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,680
over the coming weeks from
a new, more mature Top Gear.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,560
Gentlemen, the time has come.

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh, you're joking!

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
What I'm saying is, we turn this
town into a street circuit.

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,480
Oh, God. Ow!

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
He's looking good there,
looking good.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,520
Sorry.

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,120
- It's uphill. - Yeah! - Keep going!
- Hell, yeah.

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,720
It is a rampant rabbit.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,079
There has been a crash.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,040
Oooh, in the face!

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,200
I can hear a bike.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
What did we learn, really?

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,559
Not much evidence of maturity there!

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,519
Because there isn't any.
But anyway! That is all to come.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,639
Some of it later on,

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,879
but we begin in the 1980s.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,519
Back then hot hatchbacks
were very, very popular.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,279
Everybody wanted to steal one
and perhaps that's why

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,319
they went away
but now they're coming back,

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,439
and we thought
we ought to see what is what.

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,399
So, Richard Hammond
is your adjudicator

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
and the track is our battleground.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,159
This is the first one to come
charging over the top.

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,960
The Peugeot 208 GTi.

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,279
Righty-oh! What we are looking for
here is something

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
we haven't seen in a long while.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,040
A Peugeot where you can
actually feel its pulse.

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,359
And it is off to a promising start

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,320
because they certainly
have not scrimped on power.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,759
200 Horsepower, that's what you
get from the 1.6 litre turbo,

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,240
and that's quite a generous helping
in a little car.

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,080
0 to 60 is dispatched
in under seven seconds.

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Then comes the torque.
Quite a lot of it, 203 ft-lbs.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,280
It's like surfing a giant wave
of exploding petrol.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,399
The designers have been allowed
to enjoy themselves too.

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,279
Because everywhere you look

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,560
there are little reminders
of the much-loved 205 GTi.

47
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,759
It's good, it shows intent.

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,999
Like this chubby little steering
wheel, it says, "Come on,

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,639
"Let's get on and do something."

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,199
Which brings us neatly to
the most important part of a GTi.

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,519
What happens when you ask it
to go round a corner? Come on,

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,120
little Peugeot, let's see
if you can set my trousers on fire.

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,960
There it is!

54
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
It does eat up corners.

55
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,039
It's light, there's loads of grip
and I swear I am cocking a wheel,

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm sure I am.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,759
That's a wheel in the air.
Bit of that.

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,119
Turn the indicators off
and carry on like you meant it.

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
That's the way to do it.

60
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
There's no doubt about it,
this car is a real return to form

61
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,399
from a company that has been stuck in
a rut of dreary boxes for too long.

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,039
But remember, we are now
in a GTi war and to win it,

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,800
the Peugeot must take on this...

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,360
..the brand-new hot Renault Clio.

65
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,319
Like the Peugeot it doesn't lack
for oomph,

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,800
197 brake horsepower.

67
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,120
From, like the Peugeot,
a 1.6 litre turbo.

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,159
But where the Peugeot
looks back to the old 205,

69
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,600
the Renault is aimed squarely
at today's computer geeks.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,200
This central screen here
I've got gauges, a lot of them.

71
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,319
I've got a G diagram of... my G.

72
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,719
And then this is real
PlayStation stuff, you can

73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,239
actually change
the sound of the engine.

74
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,079
You go into the menu and you can
select the noise from different cars.

75
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,999
Like a Renault Alpine which is an old
classic or even an Nissan GTR.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,640
So I'm going to have... a V6.

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,999
Oooh, that sounds... Yeah!

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,080
If ten-year-olds could drive,
they would love this.

79
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,879
And then when you push this button,
a strangely familiar crash

80
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,080
helmet appears and you can do this...

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,840
It makes the brakes, everything
a lot more hard-core.

82
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh! Come on, that's feeling nice.

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,959
Without doubt,

84
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,240
the computerised Clio has a more
juvenile streak than the Peugeot.

85
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,520
But sadly, it also has
a really annoying problem...

86
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,199
This gearbox, it's about as sharp
as a vicar sweeping up leaves.

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,079
Through the bends, it just
doesn't have the speed to react.

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,519
And there's another problem,

89
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,439
the whole idea of a flappy paddle
gearbox in a hot hatch.

90
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,559
I don't want to sound like James May,
"I prefer the old-fashioned type."

91
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,279
But I do.

92
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,920
Changing gear is a vital form of
self-expression that I am being denied.

93
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,359
It's not like you can opt
for a manual either, because

94
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
with this car it's flappy paddle
or nothing.

95
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,559
The high-tech little Renault is good

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,560
but the stupid gearbox
spoils your fun.

97
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,960
And that leaves it vulnerable
to attack from this...

98
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,120
..the Ford Fiesta ST.

99
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,919
It's been five too long years
since Ford give us a hot Fiesta.

100
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,519
On paper this thing looks to be
going into battle with

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,159
the Frenchies on the back foot
because like the other two

102
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,319
it has a 1.6 litre turbo,
but 20 brake horsepower less.

103
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,280
179.

104
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,919
But here's the thing, the other two
each cost just under 19 grand,

105
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
but this is two grand cheaper.

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,880
Yet despite the reasonable price,
the Fiesta certainly looks the part.

107
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,199
It's got fat 17 inch alloys,
Recaro seats,

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,840
and a full suite of skirts,
spoilers and big exhausts.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,119
All of which is very nice,
but with that 20 horsepower deficit,

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,960
the Fiesta is still likely
to get a pasting in a drag race.

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,999
But you never know, this
is lighter and it has more torque.

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,639
It might win, or come second...

113
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
or third.

114
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,399
Three, two, one.

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
Go!

116
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,400
Changing gear as quickly as I can,
manually. I come down.

117
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,119
Come on, come on, come on, Ford!
Come on!

118
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Oh! Yes, it's done the third thing,
the third option.

119
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,640
But then I took
the Ford for a spot of cornering.

120
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, this is epic!

121
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,479
The others have had their suspension
lowered a bit.

122
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,160
This has had its dropped by
a whole juicy 15 millimetres.

123
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,240
You can feel it. It corners flat.

124
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,359
It's not just about being
nearer the ground.

125
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,919
Everything about the Fiesta,
the steering, the handling,

126
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,640
the responsiveness is peerless.
They've got this bang on right.

127
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
It's brilliant.

128
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,920
When you switch the traction control
off, it really is off.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
Ha, ha!

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,479
Ford have remembered the key
mantra of a hot hatch, it is

131
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,559
not just what it does,

132
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,960
it's how it makes you feel
while it is doing it.

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,440
You can't put a price on that.

134
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,400
Superb!

135
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,079
So, conclusion time. The Peugeot
and the Renault are really very good.

136
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,440
But the Ford,
the Ford is simply brilliant.

137
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,119
It is, though. It is, it's fabulous.

138
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,439
Superb.

139
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,239
It's almost as though all the
planets aligned to make this car.

140
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,319
- Exactly. - Everything was in place.
- Exactly it.

141
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,399
In years to come, this will be looked
back on as an all-time classic.

142
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,959
It's the same way we look back
now on the Sierra Cosworth or

143
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,399
- the RS2000.
- The Mexico. - Lotus Cortina.

144
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,439
That's how good this thing is.

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,759
I mean, the other two are good, very
good, but this thing is just genius.

146
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,679
It is. But is it the fastest
round our track? To find out

147
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,879
we must give them all
to our tame racing driver.

148
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,199
Some say he has
the world's largest

149
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,280
collection of horse eggs.

150
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,559
When he knocked Rafa Nadal out

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,160
this week it wasn't during a game
of tennis.

152
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,160
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

153
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,679
And they're off.
A strong start from the Fiesta,

154
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,159
but the other two soon level up

155
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,480
as they pile down to the first
corner, turbos spinning furiously.

156
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,999
Tyres howling
as they lurch to the left,

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,680
but that is about as dramatic
as it gets so far.

158
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,879
I'm told The Stig was listening
to TV theme tunes there...

159
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,079
It sounded like an accident
in a bric-a-brac shop.

160
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,960
They swing round Chicago, no fuss.

161
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,719
Into the Hammerhead, this should
root out under-steerers,

162
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,119
they're all frontwheel drive.

163
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,039
The Fiesta flashing its hazards
under hard braking,

164
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,799
but they are all bang online.

165
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,440
Very tidy. Impressive stuff.

166
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,519
Stig choosing to reverse round
in the Renault for some reason.

167
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,799
Anyway, is the Fiesta's lack
of power going

168
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,039
to be exposed here?

169
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,720
No, not by the look of it.
Two corners left.

170
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,879
The Peugeot cocking a wheel.

171
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,559
Yes. There we are as we go

172
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,119
to the second-to-last corner,

173
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,919
only Gambon, all three scampering
through there.

174
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,320
Not much between them
and across the line.

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,120
OK, now.

176
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
The Renault... that did it in 1.32.

177
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,319
The Peugeot, 1.33.2.

178
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,399
And the Ford Fiesta, this is
the one we are interested in,

179
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,639
1.32.7, so it's in the middle,
but it doesn't matter.

180
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,199
This is still the one to buy.

181
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,559
I honestly haven't driven
a car as surprising

182
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,319
or as likeable as this
for a very long while.

183
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,199
The only thing I don't like about it
is the name, ST.

184
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,520
Why have they named it
after a lady towel?

185
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,319
And now the news. The news is, you
may have read about this recently,

186
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,959
there are plans to open pubs
in motorway service stations.

187
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,799
- I don't get that.
- I don't get it either.

188
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
Because as it's on a motorway,

189
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,679
you are bound to be driving which
means you can only have one drink.

190
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,279
And when it comes to drink,
one is impossible.

191
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,799
Come on!

192
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,039
What if... What if you're
the passenger? - I see, James,

193
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,759
so I'm driving you. - Mm-hm.

194
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,199
As I fill up with petrol, you say,
"I'm going to get a gin and tonic."

195
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,399
Yes.

196
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,519
Well, if you do that,
you may as well prepare a sign that

197
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,839
says Hammersmith on a bit of card.

198
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,839
Because when you come out,
I will have gone.

199
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,599
I'm not actually that interested in
pubs in motorway service stations,

200
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,959
what bothers me is
why do they sell trousers?

201
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,679
I've never got halfway...

202
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,119
Has anybody ever gone halfway
through a motorway

203
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,159
and thought,
"I've forgot my trousers!

204
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,679
"I had better get these elasticated
beige ones."

205
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,559
I don't understand why people
even stop to eat at motorway

206
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,399
service stations.

207
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,279
There is no car journey in Britain
so long that you would starve

208
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,239
to death before you got
somewhere to eat.

209
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,199
Like the pub thing, it's not
that far to wait for a drink.

210
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,919
You don't think, "I'm so desperate
I'm going to pull over

211
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,879
"and have half a pint of shandy."

212
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,479
Stupid.

213
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,720
I would. - That's cos you're
a raving alcoholic, James.

214
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,279
- Can I move it on?
- We've got off topic here.

215
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,759
Can I talk, please, about potholes?

216
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,999
Where I live in Hertfordshire,
I came to work on my bike

217
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,519
and I hit a pothole.

218
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,519
It was vast, I shot up about 15 feet
in the air off the bike.

219
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,119
By the time I was coming back down,

220
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,279
the bike had hit the opposite wall,
it bounced up,

221
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,839
as I was coming down, it leapt up
and head butted me in the plants.

222
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,719
It was agony.

223
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,799
That's why I was late
to the office, cos

224
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
I had to stop by the side
of the road and massage them.

225
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,279
Let's just get this straight.

226
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,839
You were standing by the side
of a presumably busy main road,

227
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,239
rubbing your testes?

228
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,799
In leather trousers, yeah.

229
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,240
Come to think of it, if you saw that,
that's what was going on.

230
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,239
I tell you what though, Hammond,
the pothole is not the problem.

231
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,919
It's a pothole that has been
repaired by a British worker johnny.

232
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,320
Look at this. Look at that!

233
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,600
How can you stand back and go,
"Yes, I have done a good job there?"

234
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,999
It can't be that difficult
for a solution.

235
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,879
They need to design like a liquid
that you just pour into

236
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,519
potholes everywhere, and then it sets,
so it is self-level and it would...

237
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,439
Why could you not do that?

238
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,319
- It is a brilliant idea.
- Thank you, it's mine! - It's available.

239
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,160
My cheese sauce does that.

240
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,119
James, you know I said
we'd got more mature in this series?

241
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,159
- You've gone straight to dementia.
- No, no, no, no. - Cheese sauce?

242
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,639
When I make cheese sauce, I always
make too much, like everybody does.

243
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,279
So there is like a quarter
of an inch at the bottom of the pan

244
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,839
and when you get up the next day,
that bit is so hard you either

245
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,280
throw the pan away or you treat
that as the new bottom of the pan.

246
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,879
If you put that in the hole,
Bob's your uncle. - Cheese sauce?

247
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,519
- We've solved it.
- Bet you're glad we are back!

248
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,399
How has the world managed without us
for the last few months?

249
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,480
- Can I let you into a little secret?
- Oh, is it time?

250
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,800
I think after 20 series...

251
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,129
No, can I let you into
a little secret?

252
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,329
You know those gantries over
the motorway,

253
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,729
they've got them on the M25
and on the M1, OK?

254
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,409
They have speed limits on them
so that you can temporarily lower

255
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,209
the speed limit to warn drivers
of an accident or congestion ahead.

256
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,009
And then there are speed cameras
on the back of the gantries to

257
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,569
make sure that people do
actually slow down.

258
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,889
Well, now here is my secret.

259
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,609
It turns out the police can turn
those cameras on at

260
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,329
any time they like. - Really?

261
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,129
Which means the Chief Constable
sitting there at his desk,

262
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,249
"I fancy a new car."

263
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,169
Pop the cameras on and after,
I was going to say half an hour,

264
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,810
but probably ten seconds, he's got
enough for a supercharged Jag.

265
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,449
We should point out for reasons
of BBC impartiality that other

266
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,570
luxury cars are available
to bent chiefs of policemen.

267
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,849
- Right, now, can we talk about BMW?
- Yes. - Yes.

268
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,609
They're on a bit of a roll
at the moment,

269
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,129
- they are making some cracking cars.
- Very much so.

270
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,569
Now there's another new one
coming called the 4 Series,

271
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,209
we have a picture of it here.

272
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,169
It is a replacement for the two-door
3 Series Coupe.

273
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,329
I think that looks absolutely
fantastic,

274
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,769
and best of all, there's going
to be a motor sport version.

275
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,570
So that will be called the M4!

276
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,849
So presumably it will be fantastic
at one end and then very dark

277
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,769
and miserable at the other end.

278
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,089
And then you will pay a toll to put
something in the boot

279
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,169
but not to take it out again.

280
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,009
Why are they naming it after the M4 -
because it's awful?!

281
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,169
I have to spend a lot of time on it

282
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,089
and it is the worst motorway in
the world, so call it something else.

283
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,729
Hang on a minute.
If you think the M4

284
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,249
is the worst motorway, why do you

285
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,249
spend all your life
driving up and down it?

286
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,169
Because I live at
the other end of it.

287
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,569
- Why don't you live at our end of it?
- Because my house is at the other end.

288
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,769
- Well, move house.
- I like living there,

289
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,129
I just don't like travelling
there on the motorway.

290
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,009
But that's a large part
of living there.

291
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,529
Yes, but I like being on Top Gear.

292
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,129
I don't like having to talk to you
to get there. - You should live

293
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,849
where Top Gear is made. You can live at our
end, you can do things like have electricity,

294
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,329
sewers, watch television.

295
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,689
I like my end of the M4, I just
don't like the bit in between it

296
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,289
and where you are.

297
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,689
How much of a shock is it to you

298
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,729
to get into a car where we live
and get out the other end,

299
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,449
all you can do is light a candle
and make your own chutney?

300
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,969
I like it.

301
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,449
Anyway, the BMW goes on sale at
the end of the year, prices start at

302
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,489
£31,500, unless of course you live
where Hammond does, in which case

303
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,810
it is 16 groats and an oxen.

304
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,449
Now, moving on,
tonight we are going to have a race

305
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,689
and it is a very important one,
because it is to see which is

306
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,849
fastest, Jeremy in a car,
or me on a sailing boat.

307
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,049
First of all, we needed a course.

308
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,929
The producer suggested
we go from Great Yarmouth

309
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,409
up the North Sea to Edinburgh.

310
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,369
Or perhaps from Aberystwyth
down through the Irish Sea

311
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,649
to the Lizard Point in Cornwall.

312
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,049
But then James
and I had a better idea.

313
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,490
Yes, we did.

314
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:39,729
'Welcome to New Zealand.
The perfect location for our duel.

315
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,689
'Pretty landscapes for Jeremy
to drive through

316
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,490
'and most importantly for me,
sea that's warm.'

317
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,049
So our race -
this is what New Zealand looks like.

318
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,169
This is the bit we are interested
in, blown up for you here.

319
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,889
I shall be starting from this
very beach, here on the map,

320
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,889
and racing up here to the second
most northerly point in New Zealand.

321
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,009
Jeremy, meanwhile,
will have to go down here, through

322
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,689
the centre of Auckland and all the
way up here to reach the same point.

323
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,409
So I only have to cover 220 miles,

324
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,970
Jeremy has to cover 410.

325
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,769
'To make matters even
worse for Jeremy, 35%

326
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,329
'of New Zealand's roads are unpaved,
which would slow him down.

327
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,169
'And this is what
he would be up against.

328
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,889
'It's called an AC45 and it's
the fastest production

329
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,610
'sailing boat in the world.

330
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,609
'With a carbon fibre hull
and a rigid sail as big as the wing

331
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,410
'on a Boeing 737,
it can reach over 30 knots.

332
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,449
'Then there's the crew. All but one
are winners of the America's Cup,

333
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,889
'the most prestigious trophy
in yacht racing.

334
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,569
'And as for the one who isn't,
well, he is Sir Ben Ainslie,

335
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,050
'four times Olympic
sailing gold medallist.

336
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,290
'Put all this together
and Jeremy hasn't got a chance.'

337
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,289
I do realise the enormity
of the challenge I face, which is

338
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,689
why I have gone for the fastest
car in the world.

339
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,169
Here it is.

340
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,729
It's a Toyota Corolla. - Is that what
it is, I haven't looked? Yes, it is.

341
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,529
It's a 1.8 litre Toyota Corolla.

342
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,049
Engine size is irrelevant, James,

343
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,529
because do you know what makes this
so fast?

344
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,049
Look in the window.

345
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,169
I've rented it. - Oh, no. - Yes!
And this is the thing, you see.

346
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,089
The Bugatti Veyron, sometimes
you're using 15 horsepower,

347
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,969
sometimes you're using only ten.

348
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,849
This, you have 140 horsepower
from the moment you start it up

349
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,809
to the moment you crash it.

350
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,209
Did you pick up one of those,
what are they called,

351
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,609
collision damage waiver forms? - No,
I picked up six. I did, actually!

352
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,889
When her back was turned, I thought,
I'll have some of those.

353
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,969
So you are ready? - I am really ready
for this. - Everybody else ready?

354
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,649
Right, this race will start
at precisely 7am

355
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,129
tomorrow morning.

356
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,690
Beer? - Yes, beer.

357
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,770
OK, pre-flight check. Complete.

358
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,049
There is the boat, soon it will be
pointing in the correct direction.

359
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,209
And the race will begin.

360
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,369
'Eventually the boat had done
its jiving and sheeting

361
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,930
'and going about and all the crew
were at their stations.

362
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:56,370
'And so, at precisely 7.11,
the race began.' - Three, two, one...

363
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,570
Go! Come on!

364
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,690
We're racing, we are going.
Go, boys.

365
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,610
Deploy whenever ready.

366
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,890
Power!

367
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,169
This is not simply
a race between a sailing boat

368
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,929
and a little blue hatchback.

369
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,369
I am on a mission from God,

370
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,209
because the world has got it
into its head that wind power is

371
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,050
the solution to everything,
and I just don't think it is.

372
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,209
Wind is just annoying.
Internal combustion is good.

373
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,370
'And at that moment, it looked
like I may have had a point.'

374
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,129
The wrong sail. - What?

375
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,729
When you say the wrong sail,
where is the other sail?

376
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,009
- It's right in front of us.
- In that bag?

377
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,769
'With the sails having to be
swapped over quickly,

378
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,209
'the crew got very shouty with me.'

379
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,050
James, pull that rope.

380
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,969
James, what are you doing there?
Get in and help.

381
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,529
Ah!

382
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,089
'The boat was stationary,
just 200 metres from the start line.

383
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,530
'Things were looking good...
for Jeremy.'

384
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,610
Oh, wow, big one.

385
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,809
It was PJ O'Rourke,
the American author,

386
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,809
who first noticed that hire cars
are the fastest cars in the world,

387
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,490
and he is of course
completely correct.

388
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,209
Because when was the last time you
took your car to the red line?

389
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,209
Or you drove it flat out? Never.

390
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,530
But here, in this now, yes,
because it isn't mine.

391
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,410
Speed!

392
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,529
'Back at sea, the new sail was up,

393
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,170
'but we still weren't going
fast enough.'

394
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,569
12 knots, which is
about 14mph in car terms.

395
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,569
That's not bad, but at that rate,
it would take us 15 hours.

396
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,489
That's no good.

397
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,250
'Despite the gravel roads,
I was going quite a lot faster.'

398
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,810
100km per hour right there,
into fourth.

399
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,609
Maybe going a little too
fast there,

400
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,610
but it's not my car so it
doesn't matter.

401
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,249
I just feel so sorry for James
because he is on a boat, he is

402
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,409
not going to see anything of
New Zealand,

403
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,009
the prettiest country in the...

404
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,970
world!

405
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,130
I hit something.

406
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,409
'After its wonky start,

407
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,369
'the boat was finally starting
to stretch its legs.'

408
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,089
How fast are we going?
25 knots, that's tremendous.

409
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,249
We are about eight miles
from the shore

410
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,009
so we have got 200 miles to run.

411
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,770
'This speed, however,
did have its downsides.'

412
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,010
Oh!

413
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,929
What's my rank on this trip,
skipper?

414
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,929
Am I the coxswain or the bosun
or Roger the cabin boy?

415
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,410
- Right now, you're the cabin boy.
- Cabin boy.

416
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,130
That would be all right
if you had a cabin.

417
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,569
Its accident report form.

418
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,369
"Was Avis vehicle
on correct side of the road?"

419
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,809
Yes, I was.
"Explain how accident occurred."

420
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,010
A maniac came the other way.

421
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,609
"State who in your opinion was
responsible for the accident."

422
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,729
Him! Him! He was mad.

423
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,170
Right, onwards.

424
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,609
OK, three, two, one, diving.

425
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,130
Ooh! Ow!

426
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,690
Come on, James, put some effort in.

427
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,770
This is so catastrophically
uncomfortable as a way to travel.

428
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:25,089
'The £65-a-day hire car and
the £700,000 boat hunkered down

429
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,570
'and pressed on.'

430
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,050
Tarmac, white lines.

431
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,010
- We have covered 36 miles.
- 36? - Course is 310.

432
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,609
'Imagining that I was well in the
lead, I pulled over to call James.'

433
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,889
- Hello? - James May. - Yes, hello?
- What speed you doing?

434
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,009
We have been cracking along at
23 knots plus at some points,

435
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,929
it goes like Stig.

436
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,289
23 knots, wow!
Is it exhausting?

437
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,809
No, I want to say it's bloody
uncomfortable and unpleasant,

438
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,009
but Sir Ben Ainslie is sitting next
to me, so I can't really say that.

439
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,649
Can you congratulate him
for how good he was in both Gandhi

440
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,330
and Sexy Beast?

441
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,409
'At this point, the producers
showed me a tracking device that

442
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,249
'revealed where James actually was.'
Oh, my giddy aunt!

443
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,449
That can't be right. According to
this, you're miles ahead of me.

444
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,889
You still talking to me?
I can't hear you. - Holy cow!

445
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,730
Get off the phone, I'm busy.

446
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,810
Hello?

447
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:58,209
'James was 170 miles from
the finish line, whereas I,

448
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,769
'because of the unique
way New Zealand is shaped,

449
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:05,770
'was still heading in the wrong
direction with 340 miles to go.'

450
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,769
What if I lose this race, people?

451
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,529
If you are campaigning now
to stop the government building

452
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,729
2,500 windmills in your back garden
to provide you

453
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,849
with enough electricity
for the pump in your fish tank

454
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,209
and I lose this,
I can only apologise.

455
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,810
I am trying to help you out here
but I'm losing.

456
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,930
And I'm losing badly.

457
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,489
I'm actually losing.

458
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,330
And I don't like losing.

459
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:57,249
No... That boat is like
being on a trampoline

460
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,089
that's on a trampoline
while somebody throws buckets

461
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,969
of salty water in your face and then
dries you off with a blowtorch.

462
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,169
I know what you mean.

463
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,529
On those gravel roads, the bumpiness
in that car.

464
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,609
No, Jeremy, you don't know
what I mean.

465
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,249
I just wanted to hit a mine,
I wanted it to be over.

466
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,769
Well, we'll find out what happens
later on, OK?

467
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,169
But now, it is time

468
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:21,289
to introduce to you all
a brand-new reasonably priced car.

469
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,969
The old Kia Cee'd has been retired,

470
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,169
probably sold to a little old lady
as an ex-demonstrator.

471
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,569
Low mileage.
And this is what shall replace it.

472
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,569
This is a big moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

473
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,169
The unveiling of what is, after all,

474
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,249
only our fourth
Reasonably Priced Car.

475
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,329
And so...

476
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,170
What do you think of that? Yeah!

477
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,689
It's drawn applause
and I'm not surprised.

478
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,449
Because, ladies and men, this is

479
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,249
a Vauxhall Astra

480
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,729
1.6 Tech Line,

481
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,409
built in Britain

482
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,969
and available for £17,345.

483
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,809
That may not sound like particularly
good value

484
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,089
but you need to know that
the Astra Tech Line...

485
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,369
Remember to go into your local
radio voice here.

486
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,649
..Comes with...

487
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,570
A lifetime warranty.

488
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,769
Now think about that.

489
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,129
If you're 17

490
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,449
and you live to be 95 or even 100...

491
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,649
Aha. - What?

492
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,849
No, it's the lifetime of the car.

493
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,930
Not the owner. It's different.

494
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,769
The car?!

495
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,729
It depends how long the car lives.

496
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,169
It's going to be a lot shorter.

497
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,009
I don't know, it could be
a long-lived car. - Well, whatever,

498
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,169
we decided to launch it

499
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,930
with a star-studded party.

500
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,609
'We arrived at the track bright
and early

501
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,729
'so we could set up the catering
and the hospitality.

502
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,449
'And soon everything was ready
for our distinguished guests.'

503
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,529
We have invited literally everybody

504
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,569
from the world of celebrity.

505
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,049
President Carter, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Moira Stuart.

506
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,169
I've invited just for you,
cos I know you like her,

507
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,209
Joss Stone.

508
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,489
Really?!

509
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,569
Yes!

510
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,409
You'll be rubbish with her.

511
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,929
Hammond is literally the world's
worst human being at small talk.

512
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,049
"Joss, would you like a teabag?"
See, I can do it.

513
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,409
Small talk's really easy, Hammond.

514
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,209
You just be
interested in somebody else.

515
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,889
That's where it falls down, you see.

516
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,569
You want to know where
do their kids go to school. - Why?

517
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,730
Where do they live? - Why?

518
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,649
'My lesson in small talk was
interrupted

519
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,809
'by the arrival of our first guest -

00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,450
'Brian Johnson out of AC/DC.'

Good to see you, me son,
are you all right?

522
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,449
How are you, mate, are you well?

523
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,449
I'm doing good.
Richard, me bonny lad.

524
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,489
Nice to see you. How are you?

525
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,649
I'm fit as a butcher's dog.
And you've got a new car?

526
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,809
Yeah, you are the very first person

527
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,569
to drive the new
Vauxhall Astra Tech Line.

528
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,409
'Since this was the maiden
voyage for our new car,

529

'we decided to give it
a bit of a send-off.'

530
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,249
This is it.

531
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,409
Proud moment.

532
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,529
A new reasonably priced car.

533
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,409
We'll cut the ribbon,
thanks to Brian Johnson!

534

In... three, two, one - GO!

535
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,169
It's got stuck in the car.

00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,649
You stupid idiot!

537
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,089
- What tape have you used?
- It didn't cut it.

538
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,969
What happened? Sorry, Brian.

539
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,689
You back up, Brian.

540
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,729
Edit this out.

541
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,410
In three, two, one... GO!

542
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,569
OK, come on, little boy.

543
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,769
Let's get this
little puppy round it.

round the track...

Where's the other one,
the third member of your team?

He's interested mostly

rather than...

- It is, thank you. - horrible.

You have literally no idea what
we're talking about, do you?

Have you not watched it, Richard?

561
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,089
Yes! - You have? - No.

here in the Chevrolet Lacetti,

you did a 145.9.

Right.

Brilliant.

You're faster than you were before.

There. Yeah.

For the car.

585
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,089
They go on the car. You don't have something like this?
No, but I like the look of them.

586
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,329
You have only got two.

587
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,769
That's all you need, isn't it?
Brake and accelerator.

588
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,570
For an automatic, yeah. It's manual.

589
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,530
Erm, we'll improvise.

an extended clutch pedal.'

He's brought two pedals down.

598

But it's a manual. - Oh, problem!

599
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,169
Yeah. - Problem.

600
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,529
I need to set a good lap time and how can I if
this sort of disintegrates. "Is that his excuse?

excuses, I'm trying to give you

603
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,969
a chance.

604
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,370
Let me sit in there and push that.
Let me push the Pringles.

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,170
OK. Obviously, we need some sort
of... - Oh, hell.

606
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,009
I'm pretty low down here.

Let's see, for argument's sake,
if this is strong enough.

608
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,329
It is strong enough. - Yeah.

609
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,729
But I'm having to sort of steady
it with my foot.

610
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,809
You are doing very well.

611
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,089
'Eventually,
after much experimenting...'

612
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,809
- More bread, yeah?
- That goes behind you.

613
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,850

615
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,490
I can't get in gear. - BLEEP!

- He fancies you.

Nice to meet you!

I have a badge for you here.
What's that? - That's your badge.

621

Oh, good, just in case. Put that on.

622
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,609
- Right, good. - I'll leave the two of you alone.
- OK. - Just to get to know each other.

623
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,009
I can entertain you
with my small talk. OK.

624
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,009
His small talk's not very good.

'Completely oblivious to
Warwick's peril...' - Oh, God!

626
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,970
Oh, bloody hell! Oh!

627
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:51,489
'Mr Smalltalk had completely
forgotten not go on about himself.'

628
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,449
The important thing is not to panic,
cos everyone thinks helicopters

629
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,729
will just fall out the sky if the
engine fails. They won't. Right.

630
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,489
I've had to land
a couple of times for things.

631
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,609
Without engines? Yup.

632
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,250
Lot of skill involved.

633
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,170
You have to be good. There's only so
many people have helicopter licences.

634
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,409
Oh, God! AH!

635
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,409
Hell, bloody hell! Ooh!

'As Warwick went off yet again,
Jimmy Carr arrived.'

637
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,569
You all right?
Very well, how are you?

638
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,769
Very nice to see you.

639
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,969
It has your name on it. Lovely.
That, my friend, is teeth whitening.

640
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,450
- I don't know what you've had done.
- Oh! - That's how that's done.

641
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,889
Hot on Jimmy's heels was world
heavyweight champion David Haye,

642
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,290
who made a beeline
for the boxing machine.

643

00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,689
'When Rachel saw the barbecue,
she claimed she was a vegetarian.

669
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,449
'So I decided to make
her some fish.'

670
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,329
I just need to come in here.

671
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,689
You really are squeezing in.

672
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,729
I know, I just need to come in.
Do you like sushi? - I love sushi.

673
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,129
Excellent, I'll just...

674
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,489
Shall I...? - Brilliant.

675
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,769
Are you a trained sushi chef? - Yeah.

676
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,209
I've got soy sauce all over me.

677
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,569
Yeah, you have.

678
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,169
Sorry, Richard.

679
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,650
'Making the sushi required
a lot of care.'

680
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,049
There we go.

681
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,530
'But the results were worth it.'

682
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,170
Yes.

683
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,050
It's like a bush tucker trial, this.

684
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,209
Do not brake on this corner!
OK... Argh!

685
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,529
'With her laps completed, Hammond
insisted that he should put Joss's

686
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,969
'time on the board.'

687
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,769
Ten years, we've done this show.

688
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,169
Yup. - How many times have you
done that? - Loads.

689
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,129
Never. - I often do
this bit of the show.

690
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,569
Go on, then.

691
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,329
Joss, I have your time
written down over here.

692
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,489
For his sake,
I hope it's not the fastest time

693
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,489
cos he ain't getting it
up there, is he?

694
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,250
Oh, from you(!)

695
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,449
I love it!

696
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,889
Nice(!)

697
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,209
Even from Warwick.

698
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,009
You want to beat
the man from that thing.

699
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,169
- The hand of the king.
- That's the fella.

700
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,689
- Right.
- How fast did she do it?

701
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,969
I'm getting to it!

702
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,129
How fast did Joss do it?

703
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,009
HE did it in 1.48 -
it says on the bloody board!

704
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,289
1.48.8

705
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,169
You did it in...

706
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,209
..1.48...

707
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,369
Oh!

708
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,489
..Point...

709
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,769
Oh, God!

710
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,489
Don't say "nine".

711
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,769
Nine!

712
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,929
Oh, no!

713
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,129
Oh, shit!

714
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,969
Get out of that one, Hammond.

715
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,849
Oh, no, that's so sad!

716
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,850
No, Joss, that was... Oh.

717
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,769
Come on, my son!

718
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,610
'As David Haye set about pummelling
the Astra Tech Line...'

719
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,649
'..Hammond's day got even worse.'

720
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,489
Look who it is.

721
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,129
Who's that?

722
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,289
Mike Rutherford, out of Genesis.

723
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,089
Hammond. Hammond?

724
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,969
Hammond?!

725
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,529
Hammond?! Mike!

726
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,969
- How are you? - Very well. How are you?
- I'm very good.

727
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,009
- It's good to see you.
- Where's the team?

728
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,089
Where's Richard? - Richard?

729
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,369
Yeah. That's odd. He was here
a minute ago.

730
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,889
'Because I have occasionally said

731
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,569
'some unkind things about Genesis

for something on the floor

00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,129
'and let Jeremy handle
the chat stuff.'

734
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,129
- Are you recording at the moment?
- I'm doing some Mike & The Mechanics.

735
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,609
Oh, brilliant!

736
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,449
'Jeremy's chat was then interrupted

737
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,050
'because Dainty David had finished.'

738
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,049
You did 146.8. David Haye,

739
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,409
you did 146.7.

740
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,649
Oh!

741
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,289
Put it there.

742
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,089
A tenth of a second faster.

743
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,289
'With Mike Rutherford
out in the car...'

744
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,209
Avoid the cameraman over there.

745
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,649
I'm doing it.

746
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,690
'..Hammond suddenly re-emerged.'

747
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,929
Where have you been?!

748
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,329
I had something to do.

749
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,089
If you're just hiding from him,
he's one of the nicest people...

750
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,689
- Is he not one of the nicest men...?
- He is really sweet.

751
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,969
He's one of the
top-three guys in Genesis.

752
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,969
I want to know
if Mike can do a lap faster...

753
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,089
Than one of his tracks. - No!

754
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,649
No! Sorry.

755
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,930
'As it turned out,
Hammond wasn't far off.'

756
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,490
151...

757
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,049
Point... - Not that you have to...

758
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:44,130
- Joss, that's not very ladylike.
- Chuffed! Thank you. - Five.

759
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,969
'As Jimmy Carr set about his laps...'

760
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,770
Let's hope this is good.

'..Rachel decided to play the piano.'

762
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,089
It was nice...

..till Jeremy joined in.

764
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,529
If I can keep
it on the road that will help.

765

'Because it had been several years

766

'since Jimmy had driven
a Reasonably Priced Car,

'we thought he might have mellowed.'

768
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,409
I think I might have broken the car.

769
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,769
I'd like to present you,
Jimmy Carr...

770
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:50,809
Grass on the front.

771
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,929
..with these... - Thank you very much.

772
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,129
You know the middle pedal?

773
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,409
There's the clutch
and the accelerator. - Yes.

774
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,929
There's one in-between them.

775
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,129
I know, the footrest.

776
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,129
One day, we've had that, Jimmy!

777
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,529
Do we have a jack?

778
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,649
Warwick, you can lift things, right?

779
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,969
I don't know what super powers
you people have,

780
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,490
but can you lift it?

781
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,729
You just referred to me as a "jack".

782
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,049
'Before Jimmy got us taken off air,

783
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,049
'we rushed him
over to the lap board.'

784
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,450
Where do you think you've come?

785
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,409
I imagine I've beaten him.

786
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,449
I know he does
a lot of racing in his spare time.

787
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,129
It's his hobby, but I think natural
ability... tough to beat.

788
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,729
145.1 to beat.

789
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,569
You did...

790
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,409
145.6.

791
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,529
That's very well done.

792
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,170
It's cost a car!

793
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,930
'With the car eventually mended,
our final guest set off.'

794
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,329
Come on, Reasonably Priced Car!

795
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:55,129
'And Hammond took one last
shot at impressing Joss.'

796
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,689
Ready? Yeah.

797
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,609
That's OK, it's fine.

798
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,769
I can do it faster.

799
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,089
I can do this... Oh!
This is brilliant.

800
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,649
I just wanted to check that was OK.

801
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,210
You didn't last very long.
I did this on a real sheep once.

802
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,690
'At this point,
Joss decided to leave.

803
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,890
'Which meant Richard saw
no point in staying, either.

00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,209
'That left me all alone
with Rachel.'

805
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,170
Ah!

806
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,369
Didn't break the car!

807
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,049
So where do you think you've come?

808
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,769
Definitely in this section.
Definitely in this section.

809
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,489
You did it, actually,

810
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,489
in 1.48.5,

811
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,969
so actually, there you are,

812
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,049
- faster than the Hand of the King.
- Fastest woman!

813
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:56,210
Whoo! I need something to calm down,
some kind of sedative.

814
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,049
'With our work done, we left
the track in my helicopter.'

815
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,810
To the pub? - Pub? - Oh, yeah.

816
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,729
And there it is,
the reasonably priced car,

817
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,050
launched and ready for action!

818
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,289
Anyway,
tonight we are having a race,

819
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,569
up the side of New Zealand
from here to here.

820
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,929
Yep, it's James in
a £700,000 boat versus me

821
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:36,329
in the fastest car in the world,
a £65-a-day rented hatchback.

822
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,089
When we left the action, I was here,

823
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,769
and Jeremy was here.

824
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,089
So I was winning.

825
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,650
But I was very miserable.

826
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,050
All power, hire car!

827
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,890
Splash the caravan.

828
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,250
'Onboard HMS Misery,
life wasn't getting any better.'

829
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,810
This is what I get to eat on the
boat. A melted bar of chocolate...

830
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,970
..and a bag of - BLEEP - nuts, and
you'll have to bleep that word.

831
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,969
'Life in the car, now I was on tarmac
roads, was much more comfortable.'

832
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,369
Radio...

833
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,569
"Always Take the Weather
With You" by Crowded House

834
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,290
Crowded House. Nice. Local band.

835
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,489
Now, let's just try
another radio station.

836
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,770
"Always Take the Weather
With You" by Crowded House

837
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,169
Radio Three.

838
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,610
"Always Take the Weather
With You" by Crowded House

839
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,569
'After 60 miles of Crowded House,

840
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,569

in the right direction.

00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,890

crowded city of Auckland.'

00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:20,090
According to the tracking device,
James is now 100 miles ahead of me.

843
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,770
Dear God, let Auckland be clear.

844
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,090
'Mercifully, it was.'

845
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,810
I'm doing 120 kilometres an hour
on a very smooth road.

846
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,690
Coming to get you, James.

847
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,530
'Out at sea, conditions
were getting even worse.'

848
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,530
Hold on, big fella! All right?

849
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,729
'With the rough seas
slowing us down,

850
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,210
'I decided to use my sat phone
to see where Jeremy was.'

851
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,849
- Oh! That's the end of that!
- What's wrong?

852
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:14,250
That tore it clean out of my hand.
I just couldn't keep hold of it.

853
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:24,729
Please! I'm on a mission from God!

854
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,490
Go, go, go!

855
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,729
Right, last chance with the radio.

856
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,689
'Auckland on 90.2.'

857
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,970
"Always Take the Weather
With You" by Crowded House

858
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,130
'Despite the conditions, the sailors were
pushing the boat to the ragged edge.'

859
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,970
Oh, that's a biggie. Whoa!

860
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,209
Matty, you know
this is bloody madness, mate.

861
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,690
It's not too good at the moment.

862
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,969
We've never sailed these things
in these conditions before.

863
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,809
Now you tell me.

864
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,689
29 degrees, if we do go in,
you have to hang on,

865
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,369
because you're going to be
breaking bones.

866
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,489
So really, James, the best thing
for you to do, mate, is hang on.

867
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,730
Thank you.

868
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,049
'In the little blue hatchback,

869
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,570
'the news from the GPS
tracking device was encouraging.'

870
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:41,290
James May is now only 67 miles
ahead. I'm catching him.

871
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,570
But am I catching him fast enough?
That's the big question.

872
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,849
'I decided to take a shortcut,

873
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,969
'even though it would mean
leaving the tarmac

874
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,650
'and using gravel roads instead.'

875
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,290
This is going to save me 20 miles.

876
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,370
Yeah!

877
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:16,009
'My plan was working well,
but then the gravel ran out.'

878
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,370
There's no track! Oh!

879
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,210
I wouldn't do this in my Mercedes,
put it like that.

880
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:38,770
Oh, dear! I've run into the white
cliffs of Dover, literally.

881
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,290
'Still, could be worse.'

882
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,529
Sir Ben Ainslie, sir? - Yes.

883
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,369
Please don't take this personally,

884
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,769
but this is bloody purgatory!

885
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,850
Can you imagine... Ow!

886
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,610
'Meanwhile, I'd found a track.'

887
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,970
This must take me back to the road.

888
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,970
Oh, my God! Tractor!

889
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,410
Ugh!

890
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,129
Sir Ben Ainslie, sir? - Yes!

891
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,969
What happens if you need
a slash on this boat?

892
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:33,290
- I think there's a bucket somewhere.
- Right. I might just piss myself.

893
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,090
What is the point of sailing?

894
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,649
'The track had indeed taken me
back to the road,

895
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,609
'but the accident with
the tractor meant

896
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:48,210
'I was no longer driving
the fastest car in the world.'

897
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,970
The noise is not good.

898
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,449
It's not going to make it.

899
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,009
It just is not going to make it.

900
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,450
'So there was only one thing
for it.'

901
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,489
Hi. Good afternoon. - I've got
a small problem with my car.

902
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,489
There was a maniacal tractor driver

903
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,250
who was doing 70 kilometres an hour,
I swerved...

904
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:21,170
'In a jiffy, the helpful hire car
lady had me back in the race.'

905
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,329
Now, in one important respect,

906
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:29,130
this car is not the same
as the one I started out with.

907
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,689
But at the finish line,

908
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,770
I suspect James will be so exhausted
he won't notice...

909
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:43,290
..that I set off with a blue car
and ended up with a red one.

910
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:49,689
'And anyway, right now, I had bigger
issues, because I was 100 miles

911
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:54,009
'from the finish line and James
was only 50 miles away.

912
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,490
'To win, then,
I'd have to go twice as fast.

913
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,010
Nice, guv! Lovely work.

914
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,649
Stay vigilant, though, boys!
Stay on it!

915
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,250
- Jeremy, where is he?
- No idea. No comms.

916
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,890
Come on! We've got the fastest car
in the world, now use it.

917
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,849
23 knots.

918
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,930
OK! Three, two, one! Diving!

919
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:39,770
Come on, James, give us a hand!
It's not a bloody love boat.

920
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,810
Come on, Jeremy,
concentrate, concentrate.

921
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,170
Make every corner as crisp
as you can. Come on!

922
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,650
Just ticked over nine hours.

923
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,490
I'm so sick of this.

924
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:10,250
'What I really needed was
a road with no corners.

925
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,489
'And thanks to this
wonderful country,

926
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,530
'that's exactly what I found.'

927
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,930
Yeeha!

928
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:32,609
This is called Ninety Mile Beach,
because it is exactly 55 miles long.

929
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,290
I don't understand that, either.

930
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,529
What I do know and I do understand,

931
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,569
is that it is genuinely
a public highway.

932
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,010
It's a road.

933
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:54,130
No traffic, no corners,
James May, you have had it.

934
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,050
'In the boat, we were about to go
round the very top of New Zealand.'

935
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,169
That is the cape there.

936
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,049
Once we've rounded that,
we think we'll have wind

937
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,769
and a bit of tide with us,
the water will be flat,

938
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,289
then we've got about ten miles
of pleasant sailing,

939
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,090
like in Howards' Way.

940
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,690
It can't come soon enough.

941
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,249
Gah!

942
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,810
Jesus.

943
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,330
Bit wobbly there.

944
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:50,209
Boys, just stay vigilant
for this last six or seven miles.

945
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,650
Not far to go.

946
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,970
'I was now off Ninety Mile Beach.'

947
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,690
Back on gravel.
I wasn't expecting that.

948
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:14,970
Come on, small red hatchback,
whatever you are.

949
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:23,329
I'm doing this now to uphold
the honour of coal, gas and oil,

950
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,570
the cornerstones of civilisation.

951
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,730
Is that our beach there? - Yeah.

952
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:36,689
'The finish line was a chequered
flag at the water's edge,

953
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,249
'but to make my day
even more miserable,

954
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:43,129
'Sir Ben announced that the boat
couldn't actually get there.'

955
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,570
You're going to have to jump off and
swim ashore. - What? You're joking!

956
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,810
There's now only five miles to go.

957
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,290
OK, James.

958
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,570
Don't lose it now.
Do not lose it now!

959
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,610
Go for it, James! Swim!

960
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,250
Come on!

961
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,650
No! No!

962
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,130
Come on! Please!

963
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:47,689
Have I won? Have I won?
Have I won?

964
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:51,850
Man in heaven! Oh, God!

965
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:59,010
Holy cow, have you seen your face?

966
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:04,209
I was just about to conclude
and say, we must now close down

967
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:07,409
all coal and gas-powered
power stations

968
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,289
and switch immediately
to wind power,

969
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,009
because obviously it's better.
But look what it does to you!

970
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:17,529
It's brought me out in boils
and sores and blindness.

971
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:20,689
Did you have to use
any of your insurance waiver forms?

972
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,930
No, none at all. The car got here
without a single scratch.

973
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,689
- It was blue when you set off.
- It wasn't. - Wasn't it? It was blue!

974
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:34,250
- I would have sworn it was blue.
- It was red...

975
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,330
Well done, James May.

976
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:47,529
Can I just say, that boat, the
boat... - Oh, God, he's moaning again!

977
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:52,689
But listen, it's £700,000, OK?
You don't get a cabin.

978
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:57,449
You don't even get a chair or
a table or a radio or even a floor.

979
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:02,489
- Yes, but James, you won.
- I didn't win, Hammond, the crew won.

980
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:05,569
All I did was not fall off
for 12 hours.

981
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,089
Well, anyway, the conclusion is that
wind power is obviously great,

982
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:12,810
but it does give you a face
like a prostitute's front door.

983
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,689
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

984
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,810
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night.

985
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:47,250
