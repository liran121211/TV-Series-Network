1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,880
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

2
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,439
Hello, welcome to Top Gear

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,759
where tonight it's time to slip on
the old Lederhosen,

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,959
grab a Bratwurst

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,519
and wrap it in a pain au chocolat.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,719
Because tonight we're off to France
and Germany.

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,199
You are like a Pound Shop,
Michael Palin.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,599
I'm a man of culture.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,959
Fred, what are we starting with?

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
Supercars,
because here's the thing.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,519
Every time we talk about supercars,

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,239
it's always those big numbers -

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,159
power, speed, price.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,159
Yes, but we got to thinking, surely
the real point in supercars

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,679
is how they make you feel,

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,079
giving the lucky so-and-so behind
the wheel the time of the life.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,119
And for that does bigger,
really mean better?

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,159
So to find out, we pick three cars

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,399
from different points
on the Supercar scale

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
and set out to do some proper
testing in Germany.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,759
To find out if bigger really does
mean better

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,559
in the world of supercars,

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,279
the only way to kick off

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,679
is with a treat from the very top

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
of the supercar tree.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,800
The Pagani Huayra Roadster BC.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,479
I've gone grande,

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,479
I've gone very grande.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,400
Whoa!

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,839
What we've got here is a
790-horsepower

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,239
convertible hypercar

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,600
that costs £3.2 million.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,879
But what does £3.2 million get you?

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,639
Well, the body made of carbotanium,

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,520
which is a mixture
of carbon fibre and titanium.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,399
And with fighter jet spec aero,

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,760
with a bespoke six-litre-twin-turbo
AMGV 12...

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,559
..it'll hit 60 in 3.2 seconds

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,560
and top out at about 230mph.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,279
Sure, the Huayra badge might be ten
years old now,

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,600
but this latest roadster is still
utterly captivating.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,759
This thing is an absolute joy.

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,160
HE LAUGHS

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Unadulterated bliss.

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,079
The question is, though,

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,519
do you really need all that

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,199
when you could save
yourself nearly three million quid

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,280
and still have one of these?

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,279
The 296 GTB,

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,279
the latest, greatest
mid-engine supercar

51
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,639
from the guys who've been making
supercars

52
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,040
longer and better than anyone else.

53
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,800
A new Ferrari supercar is always
a big deal...

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,919
..but the big news with the 296 is
it's pointing the old prancing horse

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,919
towards new, greener pastures.

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,359
Instead of the traditional V8,

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,039
this one's packing a smaller,
cleaner

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
plug-in hybrid V6.

59
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,599
Now, if all that feels a bit
responsible and downsizey

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,239
do not worry.

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,399
This little, sensible Ferrari
produces 818 horsepower,

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,679
all to the rear wheels.

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,199
Nought to 60 under three seconds.

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,359
Top speed, 205 mile an hour.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,000
And this is Ferrari's
entry-level supercar.

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,040
The world has gone officially mad.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh, jeez, jeez.

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
Ah!

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,239
How are you, my friend?

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,719
I'm good, I'm just taking an eyeful

71
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,599
through my rear-view mirror,

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,599
Pagani Huayra.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,279
How much power has it got?

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,599
Just under 800 brakehorse.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,559
So your car cost ten times
more than mine.

76
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,959
And I've got over 800.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,799
It's not always about numbers
and facts and figures, is it?

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
It's about the excitement, the joy.

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,280
I hope you've got comprehensive
insurance, Paddy.

80
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,759
Exactly.

81
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,519
Because the excitement and joy
I brought

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,839
doesn't cost £3 million

83
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,120
or £300,000.

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,799
No.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,559
For a truly extraordinary drive

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,640
half that buys this.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,359
The Porsche Cayman GT4 RS,

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,040
The car, they said, would
never happen.

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,839
Geeks like me have always
wondered

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,879
what a beautiful little mid-engine
Cayman would be like

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,679
with proper power.

92
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,000
The answer is predictably
sensational.

93
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,999
After decades of saying it wouldn't,

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Porsche has finally taken its
smallest mid-engine sports car...

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,119
..and stuffed it with the
500-horsepower flat six

96
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,320
from the 911 GT3.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,639
Well, they were at it,

98
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,279
they added new springs, dampers,
anti-roll bars

99
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,959
and aero,

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,359
plus lightweight carbon body panels

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,359
and air intakes

102
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
just behind your head.

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,479
But even though Porsche
has upgraded pretty much every bit

104
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,519
over the standard GT4,

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,719
it insists this car isn't about
numbers and lap times.

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,639
That's not to ignore the fact
that it's 196mph

107
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,759
and not the 60 in a three and a bit
seconds.

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
So it's still very, very fast.

109
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,279
But the steering's perfection,

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
the size is just right.

111
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,159
The Cayman GT4 is the type
of car that makes you forget

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,879
about your supercars and hypercars
and asks the question

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,159
why do you need anything more?

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
Woohoo!

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,279
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

116
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,079
Christopher, did you not get the
brief?

117
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
Supercars?

118
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,719
"Supercar", "hypercar",
they're just labels.

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,239
What matters is how much
fun you're having.

120
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,559
And this car is a riot.

121
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,159
I can't even see, Chris.

122
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,079
It's being blocked out by a Pagani.

123
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,879
This might be the baby of the bunch,

124
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,399
but it'll still do 196mph,

125
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,800
which I think is ample
for a clown like you.

126
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,719
I've got to say, I feel
a bit left out.

127
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,079
I didn't get the "turn up in
a banana yellow car" memo today.

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,239
I'm just in this grey and black
fighter jet.

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,519
Come on, Pad, be honest.

130
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,079
Since you got in that thing,
have you managed to unclench?

131
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,799
How much is that thing worth?

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,279
£3.2 million, Chris.

133
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,640
Deary me!

134
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,079
With that in mind

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,679
because one of the biggest thrills
a great supercar has to give you

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,079
is real world speed,

137
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,039
to start finding out what this
remarkable trio really had to offer,

138
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,559
we made our first port of call,

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,600
the great driving Mecca, that is...

140
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,880
..the Autobahn.

141
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,039
Chris, show us how it's done.

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,439
Me first time.

143
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,119
Here we go, boys.
Right, have a look at this.

144
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,519
So when you see the magic sign,
it looks a bit like

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,999
the national speed limit sign of the
UK,

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,159
that is when you can go.

147
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,000
There are no limits at that point.

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,799
Yes, when the conditions are right,

149
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,359
on the autobahn,
you're legally allowed to go

150
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,200
as fast as you want.

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,719
I feel like a caged tiger,

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,840
just pacing up and down,
wanting to go.

153
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,359
The only trouble is, in this busy,
modern world of ours,

154
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,160
a lot of the time, the conditions...

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
..are wrong.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,559
I've got to be honest,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,679
I've heard stories about it since
I was a kid, and I'm on it now.

158
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,920
I go faster on the A50.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,240
We're stuck behind a Ford Galaxy.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,799
Sadly, it's all about time of day,
boys

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,519
And we just arrived at
the wrong time of day.

162
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,799
It's Friday, everyone's heading
off for the weekend.

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Yeah, we won't be going more than
70mph on here.

164
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,839
Wow.

165
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,999
This is like flying all the way
to the Seychelles

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and it's 12 degrees and cloudy.

167
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,439
This is like what I do.

168
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,520
Go to McDonald's and get
a vegan burger.

169
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,159
Or like meeting Paddy McGuinness
and realising

170
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,960
he's just not that funny.

171
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,119
Funny.

172
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,159
# I drive my kia
I can see it...#

173
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,959
With the traffic showing no signs
of improving,

174
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,000
we had to chalk up the Autobahn
as unfinished business.

175
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,279
So next we headed for a nearby town

176
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,159
to see what our cars would make

177
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,120
of a bit of urban living.

178
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,919
The only thing I would say
with a Pagani,

179
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,159
driving through these beautiful,
quaint, little roads

180
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,839
with these little cottagey houses,

181
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,839
I feel a little bit...

182
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,120
ooh, a bit, I shouldn't be here.

183
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,759
I think that's progress for you,
Pad.

184
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,159
Usually you just don't care.

185
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,559
What is German for I bet the bloke
that drives that

186
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,519
has got a tiny willy?

187
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,040
It's Herr Chris Harris.

188
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,599
Anyhow, Pad, the active aero

189
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,599
should prove crucial around the

190
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
urban streets of Rosenheim.

191
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,759
I'm starting to feel a bit smug now,
boys.

192
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,479
Because on the open road

193
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,319
I reckon I was having as much,
if not more, fun.

194
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,879
And right now my, um...

195
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,679
..a certain
part of my body isn't biting a hole

196
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,159
in the seat like it is for you two.

197
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm more good at it, Chris.

198
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,119
I'm just going to pop it into
electric mode.

199
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,319
Here we go.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,639
Oh, that is smug, actually.

201
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,959
That's definitely smug.

202
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,160
It's a proper hybrid, the 296.

203
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,360
I get 15 odd miles or so just
pottering about in electric.

204
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
It's responsible, it's green.

205
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,399
Can't be said about that Pagani,
though, can it?

206
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,960
Nothing green about that.

207
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,359
No, there isn't.

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,399
And, as it turns out, there's also
plenty of other reasons

209
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,319
not to take your three million quid
Pagani

210
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,759
into town for a bratwurst.

211
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,239
Oh.

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,239
Narrow here, breathe in, Pad,
breathe in.

213
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
Oh, that's tight.

214
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,840
Rather you than me with that thing.

215
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,320
Well, at least no-one's looking.

216
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,479
I've never been as

217
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,160
self-conscious
and embarrassed in my life.

218
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,239
Do you know what I've just done,
which is really pathetic?

219
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,439
I've turned it off electric then the
engine makes a noise.

220
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,240
How sad is that?

221
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,039
I'm not driving
around in electric gear.

222
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,200
I want to make a noise.
I'm in a Ferrari, bright yellow.

223
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,199
Sad or not, Flintoff had landed
on a crucial point

224
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,999
about the Supercar experience,

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,279
one that needed more discussion over
a sit down

226
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,119
with a sausage.

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
Do you know what I don't understand?
What?

228
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,519
Being in Germany you go with...
Now in the UK,

229
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,360
I'll have that on a brioche roll.

230
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,879
Soft...

231
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,719
..as a crusty cob.

232
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,959
I don't think it goes with
a... It's a great sausage.

233
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,679
I'm not disputing that.

234
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,399
Sitting here, mine does look a bit
undernourished, I have to say.

235
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,799
As I was saying,

236
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,199
that car that's in the middle of
those two

237
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,279
has gone invisible, it's crazy.

238
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,559
I've got to say, though,
the more I look at the Ferrari,
the more I'm enjoying it.

239
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,119
Loved it from the start and it's
getting better, Lovely thing.

240
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,880
It's not fair being next to that,
though.

241
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,759
It looks better than that.
It doesn't draw as much attention,
though, does it, that's the thing.

242
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, why do you want the attention?
It's a supercar.

243
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,159
Supercar, hypercar, whatever you
want to call it,

244
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,039
needs to be like that in my eye.

245
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,359
I'm going to be really honest
here, right.

246
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,719
If you get a car like that... Yeah.

247
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,239
..I don't care what you say,

248
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,759
you want to be seen a little bit.

249
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,639
Of course you do. Even Chris Harris.

250
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,199
It's a £3.2 million car.

251
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,599
You want to show it off a bit.

252
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,760
One thing I've been wondering
about, Paddy....

253
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
..where's the roof on your car?
Where'd you put it?

254
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,119
Great question.

255
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,239
See down at the back there? Yeah.

256
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,959
Under there? Down there.

257
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,399
Now just kind of cast your eye a
bit further across the square

258
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,599
and then right over there, see that
grey van?

259
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
That's where it is.

260
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,559
There's no-where for it? You have a
man following you with the roof?

261
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,959
Yeah, he follows you around,

262
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,479
life's good, and also as well,

263
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
let me show you this,
little extra this.

264
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,799
It comes with a set of exclusive
luggage.

265
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,039
Comes with an absolute pillock
driving it as well.

266
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,159
He thinks this is his car.

267
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,599
Normally I'm doing this, but
normally me man in the van does
this for me.

268
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,319
Pop that open. Yeah.

269
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,159
Beautiful.

270
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,519
That couldn't... Look at your car.

271
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,039
That couldn't look less like your
car. It's so obvious you've never
done that before.

272
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,479
What have you got in there? Make-up?
That's my luggage.

273
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,919
What would you fit in there?

274
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,239
If you want the luggage option,
you're looking at around about an
extra 30 grand.

275
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,119
I know you think that's a lot of
money, but...

276
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,439
I don't think
it is, that's a lot of money.

277
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,839
That's the price of a new car.

278
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,839
We're not finished.
Same set of luggage on this side.

279
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,159
And...

280
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,599
..the key.

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,239
Well, go on, then.
Let's have a look.

282
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,039
What's... What's that?

283
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,079
The exact shape and replica
of the car. Look at it.

284
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,319
Right. You imagine you're out at -

285
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,679
what's a posh restaurant? - Nando's.

286
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,199
Everyone's got their BMW keys.

287
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,559
You go, bosh. "There's my key."

288
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,559
Shape of a car, 20 quid.
No. Yeah.

289
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,919
You're not comparing them two.

290
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,639
Yeah. So when you go to...
Even feel the weight of that.

291
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,159
It's nothing. That's weighty.

292
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,239
It's basically a Corgi toy
in your pocket wherever you go.

293
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,759
The problem with that is,
I've got a two-and-a-half year old.

294
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,679
PADDY MAKES CAR SOUNDS
Invisible.

295
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,719
Invisible.
PADDY MAKES CAR SOUNDS

296
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,759
Love it!

297
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,399
THEY LAUGH

298
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,839
Now just let's sit down and enjoy
our steins of lemonade.

299
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,080
GLASSES CLINK
Cheers. Solid clunk.

300
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,959
Aah! Come on, lads.

301
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,799
What on earth is he made of?

302
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,960
Did you see that?

303
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,599
PADDY BELCHES

304
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,719
How's he done that.

305
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,239
ENGINE REVS

306
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,199
So, it had been an informative
first day in supercar land.

307
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,479
After all, it's reassuring to think
that while the owner of a £3 million

308
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,159
Pagani's life is full of drama,

309
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,399
it's not always
drama of the good kind.

310
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,439
ENGINES ROAR AND EXHAUSTS BURBLE

311
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,159
What I pulled away then, and
that shocked me how quick this was.

312
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,719
And I honestly think I'd have paid
a bit extra for some clean underwear

313
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,919
in the boot cos it does
get a bit twitchy.

314
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,999
Ah-ha!

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,919
And speaking of drama, it's
gratifying to know that the best

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,319
soundtrack of our three doesn't come
from the ultra exclusive Huayra,

317
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,439
or even the Maranello thoroughbred.

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,999
Listen to this.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
Wow!

321
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,280
What a noise!

322
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,679
But with the sun setting
over the foothills of the Alps,

323
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,359
the best part was that our
great super car experiment

324
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,879
was just getting started.

325
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
Lads, do you fancy a trip
on the autobahn on the way back?

326
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,359
Don't see why not.

327
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,520
I think we need a dab of speed.

328
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,519
Oh, yes.

329
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,440
It was time to settle
that unfinished business.

330
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,400
Let's get on with it, boys.
Come on.

331
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
I've got that nervous excitement.

332
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,799
Now, when it comes to running on the
derestricted autobahn,

333
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,520
there's one thing, above all else,
you need to know.

334
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,519
It is a drive that requires
more concentration than any drive

335
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,680
you've ever done in your life.

336
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,559
Derestrict now, boys.

337

Man alive!

342
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
This is incredible.

343
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,199
This car is incredible.

344
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,999
Oh, I'm pleased as punch that
we got to have a proper go.

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,279
I'm pleased as punch.

346
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,800
Imagine coming here and just sitting
in a town square eating sausage.

I felt like a proud dad taking two
young pups for their first run

349
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,079
on the Autobahn. Well done.
Right.

350
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,319
Now, the idea of this film is how
these super cars make you feel.

351
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,239
Yeah. Now, I can tell you on that
autobahn in that Pagani,

352
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,959
I felt bloody terrified.

353
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,999
I mean, in the dark
roof off, so visceral, felt so fast.

354
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,599
Now, it wasn't a competition, but do
you want to know how fast you went?

355
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,759
Oh, yeah.
It's got to be easy 250.

356
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,199
I heard a sonic boom at one point.

357
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
LAUGHTER
Unbelievable.

358
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,639
OK, well, you actually did 167mph.

359
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,719
That'll do. That's all right,
innit.. It felt faster.
..with the roof down?

360
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,119
It felt faster. Now, in the little
Porsche I did 172mph.

361
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,519
Oh, wow. Wow. Again, all legally.

362
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,959
Yeah. Fred, 174mph in the Ferrari.

363
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,159
Still wanted to keep going.

364
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,759
Yeah. It's barely in its stride,
is it?

365
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,399
Because the Ferrari was the
quickest.

366
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,719
But the thing is, it was so serene,
it didn't even feel

367
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,239
like it was breaking a sweat.

368
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,439
I did enough sweating
for all of us in that Pagani.

369
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,159
Shall we move on?
Yes, please do.

370
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,199
We'll get back to our supercars
later in the show.

371
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,199
But now we need to talk
about these - micro cars.

372
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,559
Tiny little pods
designed for busy cities.

373
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,159
Back in the '50s and '60s,
there was a whole rash

374
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,559
of these things, but they never
really caught on.

375
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,079
But now micro cars are back
in a big way.

376
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,359
Well, a small way.

377
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,079
And we decided it was time to run
the magnifying glass over some

378
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,120
of the latest tiniest offerings.

379
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
HORN TOOTS

380
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,239
Where better to explore the brave
new world of electric mini city cars

381
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,280
than that most popular of
mini break cities - Paris?

382
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,799
And because France loves
these microcars more than most,

383
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,240
say a big bienvenue to
the Citroen Ami.

384
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,479
First things first,
this isn't even a car, technically -

385
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,920
it's a quadricycle.

386
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,839
Which means it's about
pure minimalism -

387
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,599
stripping everything out
you don't need,

388
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,759
so there's no rear-view mirror,
no central locking,

389
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,839
there's a very basic fan
and heated front screen.

390
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,320
The seats are just two cushions
plunked on some solid plastic.

391
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,360
BIKE BELL RINGS

392
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,759
It'll do 30mph, flat out.

393
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,639
It's not even allowed on a motorway.

394
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,959
Yeah, it couldn't be more basic.

395
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,840
MOPED REVS

396
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,159
In fact, the Ami's tiny
proportions, limited performance

397
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,039
and simplistic design mean
that here in France you can drive

398
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,320
one from the age of 14.

399
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,959
Quite what that means for the rest
of France's drivers, of course,

400
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,639
remains to be seen.

401
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,840
But around town right now in Paris,
it might just be the perfect fit.

402
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,639
Very nice.

403
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,559
But if you want to get to those
spots your average city car

404
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,919
won't reach,
you'll be wanting one of these.

405
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,480
A Carver.

406
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,799
Now, this three-wheeled wonder
starts at around £12,000.

407
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,039
It comes from the Netherlands,
and it's a very generous tipper.

408
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Whoa-ho-ho!

409
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,639
Carvers have been around
for a long time now.

410
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,279
But this is the new
electric version.

411
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,799
Wah-hey-hey-hey!

412
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,759
Yep, all of the tilt,

413
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,519
none of the guilt.

414
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,519
The only thing with the Carver,
this particular one, is you do need

415
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,480
a bike licence to drive it.

416
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,159
But no crash helmet.

417
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,799
So you're never going to mess
your hair up.

418
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,040
Them were the days.

419
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,999
And besides, if you ever do get
over the sheer joy of how it works

420
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
in this eight horsepower S+ model,
you've also got a 50mph top speed

421
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,919
and a 62-mile range.

422
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,600
That might just make this
the ultimate urban micro machine.

423
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,639
Nipping in and out of traffic,

424
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,519
looking at the sights,

425
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,999
tilting about,

426
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
wonderful.

427
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,199
Maybe.

428
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,519
But if you want a city car
with a proper secret superpower,

429
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,040
there is another way.

430
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,239
The City Transformer CT-1
is made by an Israeli start-up,

431
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,959
and it's packing a mighty
20 horsepower.

432
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,039
And if you think it's not
that ground-breaking,

433
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,640
just have a look at this.

434
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Literally, honey, I shrunk the car.

435
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,360
What you need is narrowness.

436
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,999
But the problem we've really
narrow cars is when you get them

437
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,639
out on the open road and fast
corners, well, they tend

438
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,920
to fall over.

439
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,919
I'll never get bored of that.

440
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,840
It is a proper Transformer.

441
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,559
Well, almost.

442
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:09,279
The CT-1 is so brand-new that this
Transformer's still a prototype,

443
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,519
but it will eventually cost
about 13-grand.

444
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,559
Ooh.

445
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,799
And while that might be more than
the other two,

446
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,119
here you get over 100 miles of
range,

447
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,519
a 56mph top speed,

448
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,319
and plenty of attention.

449
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,360
Hey-hey-hey!

450
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,719
They love it, the Parisians.

451
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,080
Oh, mais oui!

452
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,319
I'm just showing off now.

453
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,799
Here we go.

454
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,839
Tell you what, I am that
focused on my wheels,

455
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,559
I've just noticed the Eiffel Tower
in my mirror behind.

456
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,000
Didn't even see it.

457
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,039
Now, to see how our remarkable micro
cars really took to city living,

458
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,319
we'd agreed to meet up with them
at the Arc de Triomphe,

459
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,159
which, of course,
is also one of Europe's

460
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,759
finest, busiest roundabouts.

461
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,919
HORNS HONK

462
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,319
Oh, that was a good move.

463
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,760
A good move from the Citroen DS.

464
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,879
As long as you keep your eyes
peeled, it's great fun.

465
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
It's like real life dodgems really.

466
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,999
Oh! It's out the way.

467
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,159
My God.

468
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,439
Oh, my word.

469
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,479
You've got to have your wits
about you on here, haven't you?

470
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,839
There's Paddy. All right, Pad?

471
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,119
HORN TOOTS

472
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,000
Get over, you bloody nutter!

473
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,319
Treat it like a game of Mario Kart

474
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,599
and you'll be just about there,
chaps.

475
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,119
Look at this!
There's pedestrians running over!

476
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,119
I tell you what, Fred, that thing
looks like it's about fall over

477
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,199
from where I'm sitting.

478
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,439
HORNS TOOT

479
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,879
Here comes the bus.

480
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,159
Stay there!

481
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,199
HORN BLARES

482
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,439
That was close, Fred.
That was close, that was close.

483
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,559
Deciding that six complete orbits
of the Arc de Triomphe

484
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,999
was probably enough...

485
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,399
I'm getting dizzy.

486
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,239
How do we actually
get off this roundabout?

487
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,519
..we eventually manoeuvred
ourselves out of the chaos...

488
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,479
He's brave bringing that here.
Madness!

489
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,559
..and headed on to
the Champs-Elysees.

490
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,600
MUSIC: Bongo Cha Cha Cha
by Caterina Valente

491
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,479
Watch this, boys. The Transformer.

492
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,119
Are you ready?

493
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,240
THEY CHEER

494
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,479
Oh, yes, my son.
That's fantastic.

495
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,759
Get in!
That's a belter!

496
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,479
HE LAUGHS

497
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,399
Yours tilts, mine transforms.

498
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,959
Lovely stuff!

499
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,359
HE CHUCKLES

500
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,679
# Bongo la, bongo cha cha cha... #

501
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,359
Here we go, lads.
Off the beaten track.

502
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,559
That's the beauty
of these little rascals.

503
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,719
You feel like you're beating
the system, or doing

504
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,920
something you shouldn't -
I really like it.

505
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,720
Fancy a le cafe?

506
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,200
Trois expressos s'il vous plait.

507
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,799
Last car pays, eh, Pad?

508
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,840
It was good? Merci.

509
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,679
French kiss.

510
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,879
And once you've had your fill of
cafe culture,

511
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,919
no Parisian mini break
would be complete without a quick

512
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,159
spin around the shops.

513
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,239
It's not cheap, Paris, is it, Pad?

514
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,920
Jeez, look at the prices!

515
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,320
Oh, we've got gridlock in Givenchy.

516
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
I might have a prang in Prada.

517
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,079
I don't why I'm going like this.
I'm going to have a Fendi bender.

518
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,759
Get it? Fendi bender.

519
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,280
PADDY LAUGHS DISGUSTEDLY

520
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,719
While a bit of windscreen
shopping might be all well

521
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,319
and good, though... Merci.

522
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,719
..to see which of these
miniature miracles

523
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,160
was really best at slicing
through city streets...

524
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,239
..we've been told to head
up to the stunning

525
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,800
Sacre-Coeur Basilica.

526
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,720
Oh, look at this.

527
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,200
Beautiful.

528
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,599
Scissor doors!

529
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,759
Lovely stuff!

530
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,160
It's like a Lamborghini, Fred.

531
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,599
Look at that view.
Look at this. This is lovely.

532
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,759
Oh, yes.

533
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,599
A magnificent view of the city
about to be made that little

534
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,880
bit more...French.

535
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,199
Bonjour. He's giving it all...
He's gabbing on a bit.

536
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,239
No city mini break would be complete
without a bit of celebrity spotting.

537
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,999
You will now race to get as many
selfies as possible with the famous

538
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,119
faces we have placed
around the city.

539
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,319
Be at the Eiffel Tower before time's
up, or you will be disqualified.

540
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,479
Got it.
Spotting celebrities.

541
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,559
Hey, found one. F-...

542
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,999
Oh, no, sorry.

543
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,240
HE LAUGHS

544
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,839
So, in what might politely
be described as an imaginative way

545
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,559
of testing three new
urban microcars,

546
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,519
we would now have two hours
to squeeze through

547
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,839
the bustling Parisian traffic

548
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,919
in a bid to find as many
of the waxworks celebrities

549
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,880
that have been dotted
around the city as possible.

550
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,239
Now, only a few of those
celebrities were living.

551
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,759
Many were French.

552
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,480
Some were none of the above.

553
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,079
So to help us on our way, we'd each
been armed with a map to the stars

554
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,399
to locate them...

555
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,599
Oh, my God.

556
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,799
It's all in bloody French.

557
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,239
..and a sat nav to get us there.

558
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,399
Here we go.

559
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,199
Life is a box of chocolates.

560
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,959
And for a final dusting
of Gallic flavour, the winner

561
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,839
would be the driver that got
to the Eiffel Tower

562
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,120
having bereted and selfied the most
celebs before the two hours were up.

563
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,400
Ooh, very exciting.

564
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,039
Three, two, one,

565
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,919
go!

566
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
Right, we're away.

567
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,759
Oh, he's gone in the little Citroen.

568
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,800
Here we go.

569
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,119
Edith Piaf is actually only 700
yards away, so I'm in for a chance

570
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,200
of striking first blood here.

571
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,519
Oh.

572
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,920
What a day for spotting
famous folk.

573
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,639
I'm going to get into Paris,
I'm going to get in the mixer,

574
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,200
pick them off one by one - Tom
Hanks, Van Gogh, Charles De Gaulle.

575
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,119
An Ami on the cobbled streets
of northern Paris.

576
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,320
Just built this. It's like
a Formula 1 car Spa this is.

577
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,760
Every corner you go around,
you feel like Rossi.

578
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,559
Where is Edith?

579
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,239
I'm going to have to get out
and look for her.

580
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,119
Where's bloody Edith Piaf?

581
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,839
So Harris has got red berets,

582
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,959
Fred's got blue,
and I've got the white ones.

583
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,079
So if I see any blue or red
I know they've got there before me.

584
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,680
Wheels in.

585
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,359
Coming into its own,
this little thing, the Transformer.

586
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,960
Wheels in, I get through
all the gaps.

587
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,320
Oh, my God.

588
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,639
She's very small.

589
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,919
Oh, he's found one.

590
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,519
He's found one. Damn him!

591
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,199
SHUTTER CLICKS

592
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,080
Right, Steve Jobs,
let's be having you.

593
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,320
Right, we're off.

594
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,480
First blood to the Ami.

595
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,839
And while next I set my sights
on influential

596
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,079
novelist Marcel Proust,

597
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,239
so far Flintoff had only found
a street that even his Transformer

598
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,959
couldn't squeeze down.

599
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,679
Come on.

600
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,279
It's gridlock.

601
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,519
I'm in gridlock. Ah!

602
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,439
I'm going down here.
I'm making my own route.

603
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,680
Let's go!

604
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,359
Better still, after 20 minutes
on the move,

605
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,519
McGuinness's hunt for Steve
Jobs was heating up

606
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,040
for all the wrong reasons.

607
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,879
Literally the hottest car on Earth,
and I'm in it.

608
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,159
No aircon, no fans.

609
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,199
Just a massive piece of glass
magnifying the sun's rays

610
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,599
onto the top of my thinning hair!

611
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,640
HORN TOOTS

612
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,719
Plus, over in the prototype
City Transformer,

613
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,079
Flintoff's day was about to
get worse.

614
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,399
It's starting to smell a bit
burny in here.

615
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,399
I'm going to pull in here.

616
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,119
Jeez.

617
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,839
What a disaster.

618
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,999
Absolute disaster.

619
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,439
And as the people who built it
rushed in to diagnose the problem...

620
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,679
It's starting to smell a bit
in here.

621
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,999
..McGuinness might have finally
got the Jobs in hand.

622
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,720
Oh, my God. There's Steve Jobs.
I can see him!

623
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,839
But over at the Place de la
Concorde, the little Ami

624
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,639
and I were already scampering up...

625
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,919
Marcel Proust. There he is.

626
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,999
..to our second celeb.

627
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,439
One of the greats.

628
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,759
SHUTTER CLICKS

629
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,839
Hey, I tell you, that's a good one,
that, n'all.

630
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,959
SHUTTER CLICKS

631
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,439
So that's Ami, two, Carver, one,
Transformer, nil points.

632
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,479
Can you smell it?
Yeah. It's too hot.

633
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,799
Optimus was still getting back
to his prime, and this was starting

634
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,600
to look like a two-horse race.

635
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,800
Tom Hanks, allez.

636
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,919
But while Harris might have had
an early advantage, on the sticky

637
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:50,679
streets of Paris, the little Carver
was just starting to shine.

638
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,719
Oh. Oh-ho. I can see young Mozart.

639
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,159
Look at this lad.

640
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,359
That's literally like
little Chris Harris.

641
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,359
School uniform.

642
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,799
SHUTTER CLICKS

643
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,279
Back with the Transformer,
we were up and running again.

644
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,879
But with time running away,
I needed a new target.

645
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,680
Come on, then, Ryan Gosling.

646
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,159
Hello! What are you...? Go away!

647
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,519
Oh, Flintoff, look at the way
he can get through there.

648
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,239
Oh, that's appalling!

649
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,880
Hey-hey-hey!

650
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,279
Yes, please.

651
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,639
Coming through.

652
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,279
Look at him, he's just wending
his way, he's making an extra lane

653
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,679
for himself.

654
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,839
The Ami is the width of a car.

655
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,519
It may be short,
but I've got this width issue.

656
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,279
And that means
that while your little Citroen

657
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,959
might be stuck in a slow crawl
towards Tom Hanks.

658
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,879
in a Carver you could be bagging
a French Olympian...

659
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,119
Teddy.
SHUTTER CLICKS

660
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,559
..and a former president.

661
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,679
Charles de Gaulle.

662
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,439
I'm going to put it there on his
shoulder on this one. Respect.

663
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,840
SHUTTER CLICKS

664
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,919
Here he is! Ryan Gosling!

665
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,439
La La Land, I'm in it.

666
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,920
Oh, that's a handsome man.

667
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,799
With just half an hour of our city
sprint left to go,

668
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,959
me and my micro car
were finally on the board.

669
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,079
Cheers, Ryan!

670
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,999
But the breakdown had left
us way off the pace.

671
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,639
Run, Forrest, run!

672
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,159
SHUTTER CLICKS

673
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,319
So while the other two
were still fighting for the win...

674
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,839
Van Gogh! Ho-ho!

675
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,839
I've got to give it a go with
Van Gogh, I think.

676
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,919
..me and the Transformer were now

677
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,119
only in reach of Harris's
celebrity leftovers.

678
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,040
Oh, no, he's got a red beret on. No!

679
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,560
There we go.
Desperate measures.

680
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,039
I'm going to go to the Eiffel Tower.

681
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,200
Where are you, Vincent?

682
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,000
Where'd Van Gogh be, then?

683
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,119
My only chance of winning
is getting there first on time

684
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,959
and the lads get stuck.

685
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,560
Oh, you're kidding me.

686
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,200
It's got a hat on it already.

687
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,000
Too late now, son. I've done you!

688
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,639
I think with three, statistically,
I'm all right.

689
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,399
On my way to the finishing line,

690
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,519
but am I going to get
there on time?

691
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,080
Cos if I don't I'll be gutted.

692
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,280
Jeez, this thing shifts!

693
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,639
Oh, I should have gone down there.

694
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,319
Oh, sugar.
I should have gone down there.

695
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,999
Right, I've gone wrong.

696
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,199
There is the Eiffel Tower.

697
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,919
Come on.

698
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,439
Oh, I can see the chequered flag.

699
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,840
I can see the chequered flag.

700
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,919
Here we go.

701
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,639
There's the finish line.

702
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,359
HORN BLARES

703
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,720
Hey!

704
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,479
I'm not seeing any other
vehicles yet.

705
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,199
I'll get us a table
at the restaurant.

706
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,839
Oh, they're both here.
Damn it.

707
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
There he is.

708
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,559
Here he is. Well done, Christles.
Lads.

709
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,119
Bit tight on time. Bit tight
on time. Cutting it fine.

710
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,199
Now, I think I did OK.
I don't think I've won.

711
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,919
Right. So I'll show you.
I'm out, Chris. you're out?

712
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,919
I got Ryan Gosling...
Yeah. ..one... Yeah.

713
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,439
..and I nicked your Marcel.

714
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,879
I took your beret off and put mine
on. So you can have that one.

715
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,239
This worries me cos that means that
- I would have thought,

716
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,760
statistically, I got three...

717
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,719
Oh, and he looks smug. OK.

718
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,879
I do look a little bit smug.
That's Paddy McGuinness.

719
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,279
how many did you get? Cinq.

720
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,359
Five! There we go.

721
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,959
Creme brulee.

722
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,119
Thank you. Beaten into second place.
Thank you.

723
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,519
Well done, Chris.

724
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,999
I do like a treasure hunt, lads.
Can we do more of that?

725
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,119
I enjoyed that.

726
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,639
What we've got to do is get
them waxworks back in

727
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,760
cos in this heat,
they'll be like a 99.

728
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

729
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,279
To sum up, if you want to dash
around Paris sticking berets

730
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,999
on waxworks, the car for the job
is the Carver. Correct.

731
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,079
They'll be putting that in the
brochure.

732
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,919
It's not surprising the Carver won

733
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,879
because what this test has proved,
when it comes to squeezing

734
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,519
through a city, and there's
never a good way to say

735
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,679
this word, everyone,
it's all about girth.

736
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,759
LAUGHTER

737
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,799
What you need is something
a little bit slender.

738
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,919
No, the Ami, that's great,

739
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,759
but it's the same width
as a regular vehicle.

740
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,839
You're stuck in the same
traffic as everyone else,

741
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,479
but with no air con. Yeah.

742
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,879
And, Fred,
the City Transformer - again,

743
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,639
great little car if only it'd
transform into something that works.

744
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,119
Yeah, well, the one I had in Paris
was a prototype, and they reckon now

745
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,639
they've fixed the glitches. Right.

746
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,479
So it seems I was a very important
part of the development process.

747
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,359
OK. You're welcome.

748
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,039
But for now, the Carver
is the clear winner.

749
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,559
Not only is it the best around town,
but it turns every corner

750
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,119
into an event. You're tilting
that way... It's fantastic.

751
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,919
But they could make a couple of
slight improvements, couldn't they?

752
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,999
Take the roof off it,
remove a wheel,

753
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,880
they could call it a motorcycle.

754
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,919
I think he's on to something.

755
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,119
But now it's time to move on from
electric to very petrol

756
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,080
as we get back
to our big supercar adventure.

757
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,999
Our vital humanity-advancing quest
to discover what makes a truly great

758
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,560
supercar had led us into Austria...

759
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,719
..where, having now spent
a good spell behind the wheel,

760
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,319
it has to be said,
over in the more expensive seats

761
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,440
that new-car shine was just starting
to wear off in a couple of places.

762
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,559
Do you know, there's so many things
with this car,

763
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,800
it's so dramatic.

764
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,759
It has a really annoying thing
where if you, say, pull up to

765
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,519
a traffic light and you're sat there
for 30 seconds or so,

766
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,199
it engages neutral automatically.

767
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,599
And then when you put it in first
to set off, there's a little lag

768
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,319
of about a second or so.

769
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,279
But in that second,
the lights are on green,

770
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,799
you've got some tool behind you.
beeping their horn,

771
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,759
"Come on, mate. They're on green."

772
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,920
I'm like, "I know, I'm just putting
it in first gear."

773
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,239
I'm a Ferrari man.
I love them.

774
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,839
I love the brand.
I love the heritage.

775
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,599
But the thing which is getting
on my nerves a bit is all

776
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,679
this touch stuff -
heating, fan, seat.

777
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,879
Ugh. Display.

778
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,479
It's all one touch pads.

779
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,319
And half the time, I'm looking
down here trying to find stuff.

780
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,359
I've got 800 horsepower.

781
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,039
I need my eyes on the road.

782
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,039
I don't want to be looking
down around everywhere.

783
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,560
It's fixing problems for me
that don't exist.

784
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,919
Lads, let's talk rarity.

785
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,759
Firstly, how many of them Ferraris?

786
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,399
Not sure. Probably about 10,000
they're going to make of them.

787
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,199
It's going to be popular, isn't it?
What about yours, Chris?

788
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,759
Fewer, I reckon.
5,000, 6,000 in all.

789
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,559
Big numbers, lads.

790
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,599
The Pagani, 40.

791
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,919
To put that into some
kind of context for you -

792
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,479
there's been 45 US presidents.

793
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,119
Who's told him this information?

794
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,280
45 presidents.

795
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,839
I reckon the people at Pagani would
be happy if there's still 40

796
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,920
of them cars when you finish
today, Paddy.

797
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,840
Well, it was time to
give them a scare.

798
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,839
Because to help us out on our quest,
the producers had told us to stop

799
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,720
off at a local test track.

800
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,680
Wowsers.

801
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,079
If I had to design a circuit that
was least suitable for a Huayra BC

802
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,400
this would be it.

803
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,359
Best of luck, McGuinness.

804
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,479
Here we go.
I'm going to stop here, lads.

805
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,599
There's a fella.

806
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,879
The idea was we'd each stick
on a heart rate monitor,

807
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,959
do a couple of laps
in all three cars...

808
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,999
Danke.

809
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,199
..and whichever caused our heart
rates to spike the highest

810
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,160
would be the most exciting.

811
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,079
Not a bad way to help
decide which supercar gives

812
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,479
you the more thrills.

813
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,039
The only question for the Pagani was
what kind of excitement it'd be.

814
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,559
What do you reckon, boys? Shall we?

815
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,920
Here we go.

816
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,160
ENGINES REV

817
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,320
And we're off.

818
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,959
Come on, McGuinness!

819
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,839
These hypercars are all well and
good until you've got

820
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,080
a narrow circuit.

821
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,200
Whoa! Now watch him go.

822
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,080
Oh-ho-ho! It's gone!

823
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,479
Oh, my God.

824
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,520
BLEEP, BLEEP.

825
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,320
Look at the speed of it!

826
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,159
I put it in track mode and then
I pressed the qualifying button,

827
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,519
which gives me all of the
818 horsepower.

828
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,839
Not recharging the batteries,
nothing.

829
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,600
Just going.

830
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,959
Wow, this thing is bonkers.

831
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,559
TYRES SCREECH

832
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,919
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

833
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,719
There she goes.

834
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,240
CHRIS LAUGHS

835
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,399
Holy Scheisse.

836
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,920
Paddy McGuinness's sphincter
is working overtime in that thing.

837
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,279
Look at the little fella here.

838
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,199
Let's let him have a bit of fun.

839
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,679
Go on, Chris.

840
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,439
Go on.

841
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,159
Ha-ha!

842
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,840
I must catch Flintoff.

843
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,719
TYRES SCREECH

844
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,919
Go on, Chrissy!

845
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,880
He is definitely having fun.

846
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,400
The balance of this car is
just sensational.

847
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,360
Chris is catching me
in the little Porsche.

848
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,759
Here we go, Chris.

849
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,480
Don't even think about it.

850
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,040
Look at it go!

851
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,640
Pull away. Get away! Get away!

852
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,359
Oh, I'm in love!

853
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,480
That Ferrari has got some legs.

854
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,039
First run results were in,
and predictably enough showed

855
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,879
that Flintoff is basically a basking
shark, and the Pagani really does

856
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,399
get the blood pumping.

857
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,720
Time to swap cars...

858
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,760
..and run again.

859
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,759
Wow.

860
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,119
OK. That's just silly.

861
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,800
That's so much faster
than the Porsche.

862
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,680
Oh, my word. Wow!

863
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,840
This is raw. It's visceral.

864
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,040
Come on.

865
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,119
Man alive!

866
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,959
Really interesting getting straight
out of the Porsche into this.

867
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,399
That thing just feels alive.

868
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,359
The steering's wriggling around
in your hand.

869
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,360
In this thing it's a numb device
compared to the Porsche.

870
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,480
I've never driven anything
like this in my life.

871
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,799
I like it. I don't like it.

872
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,159
I'm enjoying it.
I'm scared of it.

873
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,440
I don't really know what's
going on with his car.

874
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,799
Here we go, I put the windscreen
wipers on then and I don't even know

875
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,879
how I did it.

876
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,680
I tell you what, though,
it's something else to drive.

877
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,400
Oh, man!

878
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,639
I think I might be having fun.

879
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,160
ENGINE REVS, TYRES SCREECH

880
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,799
Jeepers creepers!

881
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,840
I tell you what, with all the
traction off this is lively.

882
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,199
This is a really impressive car.

883
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,720
Really impressive.

884
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,199
Impressive enough, it turned out,
to spike Harris's heart rate

885
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,639
by more than 40 beats
over the Porsche.

886
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,559
Wow, wow, wow.

887
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,999
Mr Flintoff, you chose wisely.

888
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,439
Deary me.

889
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,679
And whilst the Cayman had calmed
me down and the Pagani had almost

890
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,839
woken Fred up, there was now
just the small matter

891
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,680
of one more swamp.

892
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,199
Oh, my God.

893
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,800
That is ridiculous.

894
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:39,199
I've just got out of two cars with
800 horsepower into one with 500.

895
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,320
It's a completely different drive.

896
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,160
That does not mean, though,
it's not a hell of a lot of fun.

897
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,280
Wow.

898
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,559
Wow.

899
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,600
Oh-ho-ho.

900
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,839
Yeah, I've missed the point
a bit it here, haven't I?

901
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,679
This isn't about how fast it goes

902
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,240
but about the event.

903
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,800
Ho-ho-ho!

904
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,880
There he goes.
Look at Harris go in the Pagani.

905
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,040
Hello, Pagani, my old friend.

906
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,960
Bit sideways there.

907
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,639
I love this Porsche.

908
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,279
I understand it now,
Chrissy Harris.

909
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,719
I understand the Porsche.

910
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,439
Amazing. I'm in a full hypercar,

911
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,759
and it really isn't much quicker
in a straight line

912
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,360
than the baby Ferrari.

913
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,719
Half the price of the Ferrari.

914
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,000
5% of the price of the Pagani.

915
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,000
I've got to say,
it's so much fun.

916
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,479
Maybe just a bit too much fun.

917
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,680
Here we go.
Let's give it some now.

918
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,360
That was pretty special.

919
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,039
We're missing a cricket player.
Oh, dear.

920
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,039
Oh, this is the...
This is the drive of shame.

921
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,599
Here he is. What's happened?

922
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,160
Nothing. He was just
enjoying himself.

923
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,479
Everything OK?
Yeah.

924
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,559
Just a bit of off-roading,
you know what I mean?

925
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,559
I can see all that grass there.
What did you do?

926
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,519
Well, I came round,
it started going sideways,

927
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,799
I didn't catch it,
so I slid down the bank.

928
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,639
You've actually come down the bank?
Yeah. And I just carried on again.

929
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,759
Oh, that's nice. I had another
go at it. Right, so...

930
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,959
Oh, 99. Gone down.

931
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,519
130.

932
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,919
130?

933
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,679
Is that less than that?

934
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,319
It was less than that, yes.

935
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,279
I wasn't confident enough to slide
that around.

936
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,079
But still, it's an event. And I've
also got McGuinness in front of me,

937
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,519
which is always going to make me
nervous. What was yours? 77.

938
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,079
Oh, that's not even alive! What,
even after all that? As I came down
the bank. Yeah. Yeah.

939
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,639
..I got to 115. Nice.

940
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,279
..and then I got back to the bank
and I was back to 75.

941
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,559
So do you always get nervous
when you off road?

942
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,719
When it's off-road unintentionally.

943
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,239
So clearly, Pagani's the winner
because everyone's heart rate
went up.

944
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,199
No, I was highest in that, 147.

945
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,079
Yeah, and you were lowest in that. I
was lowest in that having more fun.

946
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,879
Hang on, I'm just trying to
compute this.

947
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,159
I'm enjoying myself at my most
when I'm calm... Yeah.

948
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,639
..and I'm in it
and I'm just relaxed.

949
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,319
I was that in the Porsche.

950
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,119
What I rate more fun for me.

951
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,039
Hang on, so your heart rate goes
up when you're not having fun

952
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,279
and when you're really happy
and having fun,

953
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,239
your heart rate goes down.
I'm calm. I'm calm. Yeah.

954
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,599
Oh.

955
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,719
Danke.

956
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,359
Bit harsh.

957
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,839
You will now head to the
Grossglockner Pass,

958
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,439
one of the greatest driving
roads in the world.

959
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,199
Please decide between you
who is taking which car.

960
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,239
Can I first of all say, I don't want
to go in that? I'm with you.

961
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,879
I don't want either of you to go in
that because that's what

962
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,159
I'm going in. Love it.

963
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,759
Erm...

964
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,879
Never thought I'd say it,
but do you fancy swapping?

965
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,920
Yes, please.

966
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,879
Now, look, when you're given the
chance to drive

967
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,679
a £3.2 million Pagani,

968
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,359
however intense, maybe even
sometimes stressful

969
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,519
that experience might be,

970
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,199
the thing is, you always know
that soon enough, you're going to

971
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,279
have to give it back.

972
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,759
And having been lucky enough
to spend some time with one,

973
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,760
I was going to make the most
of every last minute.

974
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,759
I knew those two would swap.
Car buddies.

975
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,960
But, I'm glad.

976
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,280
I really love this car.

977
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,920
I love the theatre.
I love the drama.

978
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,760
I love everything about it.

979
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,040
Quite clear that Fred really enjoyed
the GT4 RS, as did I.

980
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,439
The fact that Fred enjoyed it,
I just thought,

981
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,639
share the wealth, Chris.

982
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,280
Share the wealth.

983
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,759
I've chosen to drive this
sensational 800-horsepower Ferrari

984
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,799
through altruism alone.

985
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,520
I'm just being generous.

986
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,840
The Ferrari's rapid,
it's comfortable, it's beautiful.

987
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,839
But this was the one.

988
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,880
Giving up the new Ferrari
for a Porsche half the price.

989
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,520
And do you know what?
That suits me just fine.

990
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,839
Here we go, lads, the Grossglockner.

991
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,039
Genuinely excited by this.

992
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,919
My heart rate might touch 80!

993

MUSIC: Outro
by M83

994
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:59,799
36 hairpin bends draped across
48km of pristine tarmac.

995
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,759
Winding through the heart of one
of the most stunning landscapes

996
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,080
in central Europe.

997
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,679
The Grossglockner Pass isn't just
the highest road in Austria.

998
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,360
It's one of the most awe-inspiring
drives anywhere on the planet.

999
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,399
And in an open top Pagani, it can
also be one of the most refreshing.

1000
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,600
Oh, dear.

1001
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,759
Should have give the man with
a van a call. Whack my roof on.

1002
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,240
I'm not sure this is Huayra BC
Roadster conditions now.

1003
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,400
You'd be absolutely correct.

1004
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,679
This car is outrageous.

1005
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,639
So much torque.
I'm in third gear on a hairpin,

1006
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,079
and the traction control's
coming in.

1007
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,120
Wow.

1008
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,439
This is incredible.

1009
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,919
What a road this is.

1010
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,039
ENGINE REVS

1011
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,439
This is the car.

1012
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,520
This is the car for this road.

1013
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,239
As we climbed higher,
the clouds began to part.

1014
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,519
The supercar gods were smiling,
and Paddy and his Pagani came back

1015
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,319
to the party.

1016
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,879
Oh, this is good.

1017
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,679
# Now and forever... #

1018
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,279
What a road.

1019
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,639
# I'm your king. #

1020
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,440
Whoo-ho-ho!

1021
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Wow. What a piece of tarmac, boys.

1022
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,919
Wow. Look at that view.

1023
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,000
What a treat this has been.

1024
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,840
The cars, the roads, the scenery.

1025
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,680
Amazing.

1026
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,240
I think we're near the top, boys.
I think we're near the top.

1027
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,919
That's the summit.

1028
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,160
Oh!

1029
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,719
First things first.
Is your handbrake on?

1030
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,519
Yes.
Is your handbrake on?

1031
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,799
The handbrakes are on.
Everything's on.

1032
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,639
Wow. Unbelievable.

1033
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,479
Never driven anything like it.

1034
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,959
Look at that.

1035
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,080
That is sensational.

1036
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,159
Autobahn, racetrack, Grossglockner.
Magic.

1037
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,480
What a trip.

1038
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,679
Same cars on the way down, boys?

1039
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,120
Yes, please.

1040
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,279
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1041
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,320
You still think it's yours!

1042
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,359
No.

1043
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,719
Now, we have to reach some
conclusions here, lads.

1044
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,159
Now remember, we set out to find out
how these cars made us feel.

1045
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,279
Paddy, did you enjoy driving
your Pagani?

1046
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,559
Well, don't get me wrong,
I love this car, love it,

1047
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,759
and it had the power to make
Ferraris invisible. I agree, yeah.

1048
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,879
And every time I got out of it,
I was in a good mood.

1049
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,759
So did you enjoy it?

1050
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,519
Well, I was in a good mood
cos I'd survived.

1051
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,279
I was just happy all my body parts
were where they should be, really.

1052
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,359
It was not so much happy,
more relief.

1053
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,999
It was a happy ending.

1054
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,559
LAUGHTER

1055
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,719
Don't go there. Don't go there.

1056
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,079
Fred. Yeah?

1057
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,239
It's important we talk
about our feelings. Mm.

1058
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,559
How did that Ferrari make you feel?

1059
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,079
That's the question, isn't it?

1060
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,039
It's so fast, but also
a bit sterile. Mm. All right?

1061
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,719
And it's about, not the speed,
like you say, how it made us feel.

1062
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,639
And I can't believe I'm saying
this about a Ferrari.

1063
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,559
I didn't feel much.
I felt a little bit numb.

1064
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,119
But that Porsche -
punching way above its weight.

1065
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,199
Just a fantastic car, isn't it?
I just loved every minute of it.

1066
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,799
And each time you both drove it,
you got out smiling.

1067
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,919
I loved it.

1068
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,919
So obviously you two
are going for the Porsche.

1069
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,319
We know that. Yep.

1070
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,079
But if I had to pick one
as a daily...

1071
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,679
Yeah.

1072
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,399
..it'd be the Porsche as well.

1073
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,479
It really would.

1074
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,239
But I tell you what, I'd save
the Pagani for little weekends

1075
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,719
out round Morecambe.

1076
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,759
Love that. Morecambe?
Love that, yes.

1077
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,119
So all in all,
a very successful research trip.

1078
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,439
Absolutely.
And that's it for tonight.

1079
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,879
But we've not done with the exotic
metal because in next week's show,

1080
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,279
Chris Harris has a go in Mercedes'
F1 car for the road, and trust me...

1081
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,399
AUDIENCE CHEERS

1082
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,159
..you do not want to miss that.

1083
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,600
Thanks for watching.
See you, then. Goodnight!
