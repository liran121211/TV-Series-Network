00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,799
Hello. Welcome to Top Gear,

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,519
where tonight we're mixing it up.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,119
We're going to do the show
a little bit differently.

5
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,559
It's in 3D. Raargh!

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,759
No, I'm only joking.
Fred, take it away.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,239
Because we're not kicking off
with him skidding around

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,479
in a shiny supercar.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,639
Or trying to kill Fred
in new and inventive ways.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,799
No, we're kicking off with
a question - what if?

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,039
What if we could actually make a
genuine difference to a few lives,

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,359
give a bit back?

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,000
So we're kicking off with
a little experiment.

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,999
In the world of motorsports, life
at the top is fast, glamorous

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
and very exclusive.

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,719
No matter how talented you might be,
the simple truth is that,

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,479
without the right connections
and a whole heap of cash,

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,080
it's nigh on impossible to crack.

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,559
So here's the experiment.

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,479
What would happen if we developed
our very own race team,

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,239
a race team of young drivers and
mechanics,

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,039
who haven't got the connections
and who haven't got the cash,

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,120
and dropped them right in at the
deep end?

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,079
That deep end looks like this -

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,639
contesting a round of the
prestigious GT Cup race series...

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,560
..at Donington Park.

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,079
800 hopefuls applied

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,279
and, from them, we selected 13
of the brightest young talents

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,840
in the UK...

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,400
..and set up a test day to see
what they were made of.

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,759
Today means a lot to me because it's
given me an opportunity

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,239
that I didn't think I'd ever have.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,279
I'm meeting a lot of people,
learning a lot from other people.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,559
I started racing when I was an
11-year-old.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,040
I've been driving since I was three.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,599
I'm here for a bit of mechanics
today, working on the MX-5 here,

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
do a bit of bolt and grease.

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,880
The Top Gear race team needs
two mechanics and two drivers.

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,079
So, to help choose them and then
train them up,

40
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,320
I called in professional
race team Paddock Motorsport.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,199
Well, today we're looking for a
diamond in the rough, basically.

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,159
We're not looking
for a finished article.

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,919
We just want somebody who's
good at taking instruction

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,719
and is very mouldable.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,399
These guys are going to come
in with experience from other

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,039
disciplines, so it's very important
that we can understand

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,880
how to take that forward.

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Louis, take your time with the
gears, buddy. Don't rush it.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,280
All right, mate. If you want to
crack into it. The tools are here.

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,399
A good mechanic needs a very good
attention to detail,

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,959
basically for fault-finding,

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,080
anything that's happened on the
circuit.

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,679
I love being a mechanic
because you spend so much time

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
and energy working on this one thing
to get that little bit faster.

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,679
The youngsters are a talented bunch,

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,199
one that knows all too well
that skill alone isn't enough

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,639
to get to the top.

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,199
I haven't got loads of money
just to chuck at a car.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,359
I'd say money plays a big part in
it, yeah,

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Money and opportunity, definitely.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,319
With so much to play for,

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Paddock Motorsport can only choose
those that show the most potential.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,520
And, once the dust settles,
we have our four.

64
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,160
In the garage, mechanics Lillie
and Callum.

65
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,760
Out on track,
drivers Louis and Ollie.

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,240
With the race team assembled,
now it was time to train them.

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,279
Boot camp starts just a few days
later,

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,120
at Pembrey racetrack in
Carmarthenshire...

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,560
..where Louis is straight out on
track with driving coach Michael.

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,839
Open that up wider.

71
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
Good lad.

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Not messing around, is he?
No, going for it.

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,799
Back in his hometown of Croydon,

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,399
our first young driver's racing
career has so far played out

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,080
at the local rental karting centre.

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,079
At the moment, I'm working at
Gatwick Airport as a ramp agent,

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,759
where we handle people's suitcases.

78
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,239
It's usually me saving up my weekly
pay

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,679
and just putting it aside for
go-karting.

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,799
Louis has the raw potential,

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
but this experiment
will be a big test.

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,519
When I got the phone call
saying I'm in the team,

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,039
I was just so over the moon.

84
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,160
Just got to make the most of it.

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,999
Mate, really good. Really good.
Good lad.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,439
Feeling all right? Yeah, good.

87
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
Totally different to karting.

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,519
It might be new territory for Louis,
but the Paddock race engineers

89
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,279
reveal he's already had
a promising start.

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,119
Yeah. On your last lap there, Louis,

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,399
you were... You got yourself to
within five seconds of Martin.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,079
Wow.

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,000
Can you just slow it down
a little bit, like, this...?!

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,559
It's a good start, guys.

95
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,999
In the garage, meanwhile, mechanics
Lillie and Callum

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,599
are already well
into their engineering crash course

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,760
on Paddock's second race-spec MX-5.

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,999
These coils commonly fail
due to the heat.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
That's why after every session
we take them out.

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,399
Two kids coming in as apprentices
will not even get within touching

101
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,919
distance of a car on a team for the
first three or even four years.

102
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,799
So the guys out there driving,

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,519
you can actually be in a car
driving one quicker

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,399
than you can be a mechanic
out here in the pit lane.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,719
Absolutely. I mean, the biggest
thing to remember

106
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,279
is the responsibility.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,800
One mistake, one missed
bolt - it's someone's life.

108
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,799
That's totally shocked me,

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,239
the three or four-year thing.

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,960
I never realised that, myself.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,079
Our young mechanics are definitely
in at the deep end

112
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,999
but Cornwall-based Lillie
and Lincolnshire lad Callum

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,639
have both grown up with that
mechanical mind-set

114
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,039
that might just help them swim.

115
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,240
Excellent stuff.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,999
I like living in my lorry
because it's quiet.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,799
No-one's around and I can do
whatever I want, really,

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,919
be in the shed on the cars
till whatever time.

119
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,319
Recently bought a couple
of bangers, got to strip them

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,519
and then build them
ready for racing.

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,599
First of all, before she'd done
the mechanics,

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,039
she used to do show jumping.

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,079
She came back from a show and said,
"I don't want to do this any more.

124
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,879
"I want to do bangers."

125
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,639
Started at 11 doing banger racing.

126
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,599
Pretty much smash everyone else

127
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,279
up and hope you don't hurt yourself,
really!

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,679
Every time we'd blow up an engine,

129
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,719
me and my brother would change
engines together.

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,799
I love being a mechanic because
you find a problem, you fix it,

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,560
you get dirty and it's satisfying.

132
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,720
At 16, I started here as a HGV
mechanic apprentice.

133
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,279
Morning, Kev. Morning!

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,799
I worked in the garage
with my dad and his friend.

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,439
It was brilliant.
It's a good atmosphere.

136
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,559
After school, I went to college
and got an apprenticeship.

137
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,880
I did two years in a
Land Rover garage.

138
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,239
It seems to come easy.

139
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,599
If you kind of think about it
logically, it all clicks together.

140
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,040
Just something I really enjoy.

141
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,159
Back out on track,

142
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,240
driver Ollie's training with Michael
is now also well under way.

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Close the car in. Cross those arms.

144
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,959
And back home, in North Yorkshire,

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,479
this is a young man who spends every
spare minute in or around race cars.

146
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,559
I've never really been an academic
lad.

147
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,639
I'd much rather spend my evenings
in the garage with my dad,

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,040
tinkering with the cars.

149
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,439
Ollie, his dad, mum and brother
all compete on the dirt oval tracks

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,040
of National Autograss racing.

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,120
And, to help pay his way, Ollie
works full-time building generators.

152
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,399
The money that goes into the car
comes in your pocket

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,759
and goes out the next minute.

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,279
What else would you want
to spend your money on at 19?

155
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,080
Not many nights out are allowed, but
yeah, it's good.

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,039
There's lots of other sacrifices
as well.

157
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,599
It's like we don't do foreign
holidays.

158
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,239
Our holidays are spent in a camper
van, racing Saturday and Sunday,

159
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,919
back home and back to work

160
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,840
to earn some more pennies
to do it all again next week.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,919
A former junior and open champion,

162
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,959
Ollie has plenty of race experience.

163
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,119
Down to quarter to three

164
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,759
and cross your arms,
if you need a bit more lock.

165
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,280
But the move from dirt to tarmac
is not to be underestimated.

166
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
What was he saying about feeding
the wheel?

167
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,519
Was that a habit from
grass-tracking?

168
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,279
Basically, because we only
go around an oval,

169
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,559
I don't cross my arms.

170
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,559
I've never crossed my arms because
that's quite slow in our sport.

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,959
The reason he's saying that is,
if you keep your hands there,

172
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,199
you know which way the steering
wheel is pointing. Yeah.

173
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,719
So, if ever you get out of shape,
you know, you just point

174
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,639
and that's kind of where you're
pointing.

175
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,120
To get you out of trouble. Yeah.

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,519
It's been an intensive first
day for the team,

177
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,519
but then, with the challenge
that lies ahead of them,

178
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,959
it needed to be.

179
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,279
Seven weeks' time,

180
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,799
they're going to be on track
with professional drivers. Yeah.

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,759
When you tell me things
like that and I think about it,

182
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,439
I get very anxious.

183
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,319
Seven weeks, seven weeks!

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,800
It's not a lot of time, is it?
It's a tall order.

185
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,479
By doing something like this,
we're giving them a chance to sort

186
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,519
of fulfil their dreams,
but also to show their talents.

187
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,439
For me, personally, it's a real
passion project because it's nice

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,679
to be in a position to give
them that chance now

189
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,879
and to watch them grow.

190
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,800
The dream for me in doing the film
like this is someone notices them.

191
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,319
While the mechanics spend the next
week getting stuck in at Paddock HQ,

192
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,120
driver coaching steps up a gear.

193
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,439
Louis and Ollie have been studying
hard to get their race licences.

194
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
Your chariot awaits, sir.

195
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,959
And now, out on track,

196
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,560
it's their first ever go
on a live circuit in the MX-5.

197
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,999
My only concern for them today
would be

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
if the nerves got the better of
them.

199
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,160
Fast cars coming
up and overtaking them...

200
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,959
OK. Stay on your line, buddy.
Stay on your line.

201
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,199
Michael takes each driver out
on track for tuition.

202
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,960
But, in busy traffic, mistakes are
made.

203
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,839
Get the line right, mate,
before we try and carry the speed.

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,679
You're trying to carry the
speed too soon.

205
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
Let it flow. Let it come to you.

206
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,639
All too soon,

207
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,680
the team will be back at Donington
for the GT Cup.

208
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,480
There's no choice but to dust
off and keep pushing forward.

209
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,959
Training reaches the halfway point

210
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,480
and the team are at
Cadwell Park in Lincolnshire.

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,759
The Paddock experts need to see
how they're shaping up

212
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,039
by giving them their first race
together in the Mazda SuperCup.

213
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,279
Cadwell couldn't be a more difficult
place to bring two newbies

214
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,080
for their first ever race weekend
in a car they're unfamiliar with.

215
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,559
It's tight, it's narrow,
it's undulating, it's unsighted.

216
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,199
Mazda weekends, you never know
what can get thrown at you,

217
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
so anything can happen.

218
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,800
The team has been practising
at Cadwell for a couple of days.

219
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,239
And the challenging circuit hasn't
just been a test for the drivers.

220
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,679
First practice, he broke his
gearbox,

221
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,080
so came back in and changed that.

222
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,879
He went out again and then went
in the wall

223
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,640
and bent his steering rack,
so we had to change that.

224
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,919
Gearbox weren't too bad. The
steering rack's just fiddly.

225
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,599
Cos the radiator's in the way.

226
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,439
all the belts and everything.

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,959
Don't break the car.
We haven't got any more.

228
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeah, try not to.

229
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,119
But, as the more relaxed practice
sessions end, the mood shifts.

230
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,240
The focus is now on the team's
first ever competitive race.

231
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,679
It ain't right. Oh, BLEEP this
all. No need, is there?

232
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,399
All right, buddy, you ready? Yeah.

233
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,480
Forget about yesterday. Yeah.

234
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,319
Focus on today, all right? All
right.

235
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,599
You'll be fine. Good luck.

236
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,160
All the best. Thank you.

237
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,320
Louis and Ollie join a 27-car grid,
one that's split into two classes.

238
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,039
Pros starting towards the front
and the amateur club class

239
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,759
that the boys have qualified
in the middle of

240
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,680
makes up the back of the field.

241
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,159
I'm nervous. I just started
getting a little bit of butterflies

242
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
in the stomach for them.

243
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,520
Five-second...

244
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
Come on.

245
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
Lights on.

246
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,160
And we're off. Go!

247
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,040
Go, my boys!

248
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,559
Whoa! Whoo!

249
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,439
The first corner, here we go.

250
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
Got to watch this.

251
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,400
They're round. They're OK.

252
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,759
I've driven round here.

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,439
It's a tricky circuit.

254
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,160
It is. There's no room for error.

255
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,119
He's done him. He's gone back in
front, yeah.

256
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,959
Good lad, Louis.

257
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,920
First overtake. Come on, man.

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,880
Louis is chasing Ollie down now.

259
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,879
He's trying, he's trying!

260
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,719
Louis now has got to be careful
because he's trying to attack Ollie

261
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,800
but he's also going to get
under pressure from the car behind.

262
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,719
Ah, they've muscled him out.

263
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,319
Yeah, and he's lost two spots there.

264
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,480
Oh, no, no.

265
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,120
That's the inexperience,
though, you know.

266
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,120
Ugh!

267
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,239
The boys are training to
be a two-driver team, though.

268
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,679
And up the field, Ollie is going
from strength to strength.

269
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,079
Ollie is running two seconds
a lap quicker than

270
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,519
the cars in front of him, so he's
gaining on that pack. Fantastic.

271
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,159
Go on, Ollie! Go on, Ollie!
Go on, son!

272
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,199
They're out there, they're racing,
they're mixing it up with people

273
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,079
who've been doing this for years.
Yep.

274
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,399
Chequered flag.

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,559
Yeah, well done, Ollie!

276
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,359
With neither driver having
raced on a tarmac circuit before,

277
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,559
it's a solid debut.

278
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,839
Ollie crossing the line
sixth in class...

279
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,559
Go on, Louis!

280
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,599
..and Louis coming in eighth.

281
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,920
Well done!

282
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,359
Heart rate was going for a bit.

283
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,919
No, it was good.

284
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,999
Got your first race start under the
belt,

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,559
you've been overtaking people,
you've been getting stuck in.

286
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,439
I can tell you're not happy.

287
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,079
But I'm happy that you're not happy,

288
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,759
because if you were happy then
there's something wrong.

289
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,559
If you've got that driver mentality,
you always want more.

290
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,399
You can come in and win the race and
you'll be wanting more. Yeah.

291
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,759
So tomorrow, we go again.

292
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,960
Well done, boys.
Well done, well done, well done.

293
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,399
Literally, I just want to
go out right now and just race,

294
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,199
to get all my frustration out.

295
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,119
There's no time
to dwell on mistakes,

296
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,960
training for the drivers
is constant.

297
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,319
Every time they get
behind the wheel, it's followed up

298
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,319
by a full analysis of the drive with
the Paddock coaching team.

299
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,879
I think where you were getting
a little bit frustrated,

300
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,639
where you had your bit of a moment,

301
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,719
I think there, was just trying
to go just too deep.

302
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,879
Going through the data
has been amazing.

303
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,879
Giving me them tips,
just where I can find

304
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,719
that last few tenth of a second to
improve my overall lap.

305
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,879
I know what to do for my
races tomorrow.

306
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,840
So, hopefully, I have no
problems and it'll be a good race.

307
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,479
With the two races left to run that
weekend, the next morning,

308
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,240
Louis and Ollie set out to put
the theory into practice.

309
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,359
There goes Oliver Hall up
the inside, that was a late move.

310
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,959
Can he hold the inside line?

311
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,119
He's later on the brakes and
he will slip through.

312
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,559
Proving a very spectacular driver
to watch, is Oliver.

313
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,919
The first race gets under way well,

314
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,239
with Ollie maintaining his
impressive form.

315
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,600
Oliver Hall,
very quick reactions there.

316
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,560
As the race progresses, though,
the real star student is Louis.

317
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,759
And Louis Smithen has got himself
ahead of Oliver Hall, look.

318
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,480
Really coming on strong in the
second half of the race.

319
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,839
After a hard-fought
battle to the line...

320
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,039
Oh, big contact!

321
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,399
And that's Oliver Hall involved.

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,960
..Ollie hangs on to finish
fourth in class.

323
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,799
And with Louis a place ahead of him,
Team Top Gear has its first podium.

324
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,199
Well done, Louis. Come on, lad.
Get in there! Well done. Thank you.

325
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,959
Good stuff.

326
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,639
It's a huge boost for the team.

327
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,920
And Louis isn't done yet.

328
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,199
The lights go out,
we're away and racing.

329
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,599
In the last battle of the weekend,
a mistake from Ollie sees him

330
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
playing catch-up from the off.

331
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
But Louis is in the zone.

332
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,079
Turning all that data,

333
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,279
the analysis and the coaching
into a clean race to the finish.

334
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,760
A really impressive end
to his MX-5 SuperCup debut.

335
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,399
The second podium of the weekend,
Louis Smithen!

336
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,600
It's an incredible
result for the Croydon karter.

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,919
While, for team-mate Ollie,
Cadwell has given him

338
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,319
another important lesson
about the roller-coaster of racing.

339
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,439
Yeah, I'm devastated.

340
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,359
Missed second gear out of the start.

341
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,319
Let the pressure get to me, maybe.

342
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,599
For the whole team,

343
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,240
this first race meeting has been
a massive step forward.

344
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,079
To keep the momentum going, a few
days later, I organise an outing.

345
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,719
The aim is to give the team
the inspiration they'll need to

346
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,200
push on as the stakes get higher.

347
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,199
The place is the home
of the McLaren Formula 1 team.

348
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,639
Is that Senna's car? Yeah.

349
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,640
This is one of the most successful
cars in race history.

350
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
For more than six decades,

351
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,680
McLaren has been
a leader in world motorsport.

352
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,519
James Hunt, Niki Lauda,
Senna, Hamilton,

353
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,199
all raced and won with McLaren.

354
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,519
If you want to be the best, you've
got to learn from

355
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,719
the absolute best, so I've got a
special guest for you to meet today.

356
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,239
Current McLaren F1 driver and
all-round superstar,

357
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,799
Lando Norris.

358
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,399
Oh, my gosh. Here he is!

359
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,759
Good morning.

360
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,559
We've got Callum, Lando.
Nice to meet you.

361
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,679
Lillie. Good to meet you, hello.
Hello. How are you?

362
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,159
Ollie. Nice to meet you, mate.
And Louis. All right?

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,599
They're our drivers.

364
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,279
These two keep the team alive,
these are the mechanics.

365
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,319
Fantastic. The important ones.

366
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,639
First of all, congrats,

367
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,479
I heard there was some silverware
from the weekend.

368
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,959
Yeah, thank you. Not bad, not bad.

369
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,439
Louis started in the karting,
that's where you started?

370
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,599
I did start karting. Karting's
probably the place you learn

371
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,119
most of your skills you
need for racing.

372
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,759
You don't have to do it, there's
a lot of drivers who didn't do it,

373
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,840
but karting's
one of the funnest as well.

374
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,159
They're posher than the ones
at bangers, aren't they? Yeah.

375
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,039
They're all plastic ones.

376
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,479
We should have brought yours,
stuck it in here, Louis.

377
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,159
Hide it in there,
no-one'll know. Yeah.

378
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,679
Your first F1 race, what
was going through your mind?

379
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,839
Oh, so much.

380
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,719
I was so nervous back then. Yeah.

381
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,999
Bit of a twitchy bum?
Oh, definitely, definitely!

382
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,559
A lot of it is just pressure
you put on yourself.

383
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,119
You know you'll be able to do well
if you just go out there

384
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,199
and do your job. You've done a race,
you've not done particularly well,

385
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,359
how do you shake that off?

386
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,039
You can't just do it yourself,
you've got to ask the people

387
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,999
who are there for you,
how can I do it better next time?

388
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,319
As soon as you've reviewed it,

389
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,119
you just kind of put it behind
and you look ahead to the next one.

390
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,639
And I believe you've got a
bit of something lined up

391
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,199
for all of our team today? I do.

392
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,039
So, two drivers coming with me,

393
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,919
we're going to have a
bit of session driving.

394
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,079
I was going to say,
when you say a bit a session,

395
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,719
these young people think you're
on about drinking.

396
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,079
It's a driving session,
not a drinking session.

397
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,119
And, Lillie and Callum, you're going
to be going with the engineers.

398
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,760
This is going to be mega today.

399
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,319
For Louis and Ollie, Lando
is going to be coaching them

400
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,039
on one of the most important tools
available to a modern racing driver.

401
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,479
Sim training is crucial. For me,
it's been a big part of my life.

402
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,439
Growing up, I spent a lot of
time on simulators.

403
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,959
Oh, look at this, lads.

404
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,239
Especially starting off, when you're
new into the world of racing

405
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,759
and you're learning different cars,
you're learning different tracks.

406
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,439
There's nothing new in F1 using
simulators for driving training.

407
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,319
What's really remarkable is that
home-gaming racing sims

408
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,680
are now also so accurate that teams
like McLaren are embracing them too.

409
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,679
In their dedicated eSports studio,

410
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,159
Lando has loaded up the Donington
circuit that Louis and Ollie

411
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,279
will be driving in the GT Cup.

412
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,080
And he's using a McLaren GT4 racer
to lay down a benchmark lap time.

413
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,160
Makes it look easy, don't he?
I know, yeah.

414
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,639
So, that was my lap.

415
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,239
My one lap.

416
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,719
A 1:38.520.

417
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,359
Not my best lap I've ever done
but it was pretty good.

418
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,399
I mean, you made that look quite
straightforward

419
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,119
but I'm pretty sure it's not.

420
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,560
Thank you. It's my job.

421
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,839
So, if you get around this lap time,

422
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,720
you'll be in a good place.

423
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,080
Deeper in the bowels of
the McLaren Technology Centre...

424
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,719
..Lillie and Callum are with
the F1 pit crew

425
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,399
for a unique look at the mechanic's
role at the very top of the game.

426
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,199
There's between two and six stops
over the race, normally.

427
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,599
So, this is where the mechanics can
make the difference between

428
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,440
winning a race and losing a race.

429
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,799
How the BLEEP are we going
to do that?

430
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,879
So, guys, that one was a 2.3,
that time.

431
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
So, yeah, over to you guys.

432
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,479
Back in the sim, Louis and Ollie are
chasing Lando's 1:38 lap time.

433
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,119
There are a few things which you can
just never feel in the sim.

434
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,519
One is fear. Yeah.

435
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,839
And also the G-force is the
one other thing which

436
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,799
you just don't feel. You don't feel
the physical attributes.

437
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,479
How much seat time on a sim
do you do a week?

438
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,160
A day at least on the simulator,
preparing for every weekend.

439
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
So, when you're stepping in,
instead of leaving this leg

440
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,720
back here, bring it in and use
your whole body to drive it home.

441
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,079
Nice work.

442
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,799
Nice work, guys.

443
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,920
Great job.

444
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,399
But their car control's good.

445
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,119
What do we have at the moment?

446
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,919
1:44, Ollie. 1:43?

447
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,639
1:43, Louis.

448
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,599
Which is not bad.
Adapting to a new car,

449
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,959
a quicker car than what they're
used to driving.

450
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,760
Good work, lads, good work.

451
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,719
The team's been given
a taste of the big leagues,

452
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,000
and have shown real spirit doing it.

453
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,040
It's the spirit they'll need
for this experiment's final test.

454
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,159
There's one last thing
I want to show you.

455
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,039
Because you've done amazing
in the MX-5s,

456
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,359
but Donington, different gravy.

457
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,719
I want to introduce you to the
car you're going to be driving.

458
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,400
Lando, if you'll do the
honours on that corner, pal.

459
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,840
570S GT4.

460
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,999
450hp, 3.8l,

461
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,199
north of 180mph.

462
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,719
I'm lost for words.

463
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,039
The MX-5s were brilliant,

464
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,200
and now we've gone the complete
opposite end.

465
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,039
Excitement, nerves,
the opportunity's amazing.

466
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,359
I can't believe I'm actually
going to drive it.

467
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,519
Just want to get out there,
do my best.

468
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,399
Yeah, I've got a new challenge.

469
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,119
They're a bit crazy for trusting
Ollie and Louis with it.

470
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,319
But I'm excited to see
how they get on with it.

471
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,759
Lando, thank you
so much for coming down today,

472
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,799
really appreciate you giving
up your time for us.

473
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,759
All right, go on, you lot, skedad.

474
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,840
Cheers, mate. Cheers.

475
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,279
The team has gathered for their
first chance to get to grips

476
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,200
with the new car on track.

477
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,479
A lot more at stake, a lot less
margin for error and a lot

478
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,919
more room for big mistakes,
big accidents and potentially

479
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,999
injuries, so it's a massive step up
from what they've done before.

480
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,799
The McLaren is a daunting
prospect for them all.

481
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,919
But while Lillie and Callum are now
supported by a bigger pit crew,

482
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,399
Louis and Ollie
will be on their own.

483
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,239
More pressure on the drivers.

484
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,960
We can't crash it, they can.

485
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,440
And first behind the wheel
of the £220,000 racer is Louis.

486
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,399
I think it's a bit of a reality
check, we've been talking about it,

487
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,719
we've been about driving a GT car,

488
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,199
now the guys are actually in a GT
car for the first time

489
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,600
and it's real.

490
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,319
The car looks an animal.

491
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,799
So, I'm looking forward,
a bit nervous.

492
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,079
When the guys get in these cars
for the first time,

493
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,279
there's always a lot of emotion
and overthinking going on.

494
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,759
And through the day,
they'll just iron that out.

495
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
So, we'll get there,
we'll work through with them.

496
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,479
Despite not being a whole
lot heavier, the McLaren is over

497
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,200
three times as powerful as the MX-5s
the lads have been racing.

498
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,879
The forces involved in just
driving it

499
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,959
prove to be a serious wake-up call.

500
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,319
My vision was going blurry.

501
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,239
Because of the G-force of braking
I'm not used to.

502
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,640
I thought the Mazda was bad,
this is just ten times worse.

503
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,519
Ollie, what do you reckon?

504
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,239
How did that feel? I didn't know
what I were doing, really.

505
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,439
Didn't know what you were doing?
No. No?

506
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,999
All that training, all that prep...

507
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,319
Yeah, it went out the window.
Went out the window, OK.

508
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,599
Just overwhelmed by the whole
experience? Yeah. Yeah?

509
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,479
In what way?
Everything, everything.

510
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,399
I want to start from scratch
and work my way back up.

511
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,880
Yeah.

512
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

513
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,319
As experiments go, Pad,
that's a hefty one.

514
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,799
Talk about a wake-up call.

515
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,039
They knew it wasn't going
to be easy, but I don't think

516
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,319
they realised how tough
it was going to be.

517
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,959
A bunch of novices racing
in GT Cup in a McLaren?

518
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,879
That's in at the deep end, boss.
Yeah.

519
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,759
Me and Chris raced in that series
and let me tell you, it's proper.

520
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,199
Chris didn't even finish.
You broke the car! Bad workman.

521
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,959
Leave it, lads. We'll see...
What? Leave it!

522
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,719
We'll see whether our race team
can cut it in the big league

523
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,959
later on in the show.

524
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,919
But now, we must move on
to talk about hot hatches,

525
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,239
isn't that right, Christopher?
It is, Patrick.

526
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,519
And the hot hatch we need to talk
about is this one -

527
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,639
the Honda Civic Type R,

528
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,359
which, for a long time, has been
the most in-your-face hot hatch

529
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,319
of the lot, getting fightier and
angrier generation on generation.

530
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,480
And now, buckle up, because
there's a new one on the scene.

531
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,479
Well, here's a turn-up
for the books.

532
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
This is the new Honda Civic Type R

533
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,879
and in a break with tradition,

534
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,360
it doesn't look like it should be
wearing an ankle tag. In fact...

535
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,719
..the world's most thuggish
hot hatch

536
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,280
looks like it's gone a bit grown-up.

537
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,799
But fear not,

538
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,319
because under that sensible new
suit, the Civic Type R is still...

539
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,399
ENGINE REVS

540
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,160
TYRES SQUEAL

541
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,760
..an absolute delinquent!

542
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,159
It's got more power
than ever before.

543
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,679
324 horsepower from a two-litre
turbo-charged engine.

544
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,639
OK, that's only a few more
horsepower than the old one,

545
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,639
but it'll still do 170mph.

546
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,880
0-60 in five seconds.

547
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,719
I mean, how much more do you want?

548
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,440
That's immense
for a little hot hatchback.

549
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,279
And while more and more fast
hatchbacks are turning up

550
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,239
with sensible four-wheel drive
these days,

551
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,520
the Civic remains
defiantly old school.

552
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,559
Hot Hatches should, in my book,
be front wheel drive.

553
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,399
That's the whole point of them.

554
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,439
What's the upside?
Weight is the upside.

555
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,119
Probably 200kg less than
a four-wheel-drive equivalent.

556
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,119
TYRES SQUEAL

557
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,559
Look at this.
It's got a proper manual gearbox.

558
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,599
Third, second.

559
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,759
Honda are masters
at these manual shifts.

560
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,639
Describe this new one...

561
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,279
It is exceptionally rigid,
yet smooth,

562
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,320
and that is not remotely amusing.

563
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,199
And this car reminds us what a hot
hatch should be like inside.

564
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,159
It's basic. Not too much going on,
but the seat is just exquisite.

565
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,359
I think it's the best seat
I've ever sat, in a fast car.

566
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,719
I've got dials everywhere.
I've got Honda quality.

567
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,439
But it's not trying to be grown-up.
It's not trying to be a luxury car.

568
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,040
It shouts -
"Get in me and thrash me!"

569
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,840
Which isn't remotely amusing,
either.

570
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,839
What is amusing is just how much
work Honda has put in

571
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,199
to the bits
that no-one will ever notice.

572
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,639
They're very proud
of the turbocharger,

573
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,679
which is 3% more efficient.

574
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,319
Now, that might not sound like much
to you and I,

575
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,720
but to some Honda engineer,
that was four years of hard work.

576
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,439
Exhaust flow improved 13%.

577
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,519
Torsional rigidity improved 15%.

578
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,159
These are all tiny improvements,
but lumped together,

579
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,719
they result in a driving experience

580
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,159
that's just brighter and sharper
than ever before.

581
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,799
Just feels so alive.

582
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,720
A car that makes you smile.

583
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,199
Ha-ha-ha!

584
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
This reminds me
of being young and stupid.

585
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,799
In fact, there's only
one real issue here,

586
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,999
and it's not with the car.

587
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,199
Hot hatches are not designed
for big, open airfields.

588
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,479
They're about cross-country
point-to-point pace.

589
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,760
They're about B-roads.

590
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,919
But the trouble with B-roads is that
they come with real world problems

591
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,839
like speed limits and speed cameras
and other traffic.

592
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,120
Well, not any more.

593
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,959
Introducing the B-Road-a-Matic 3000

594
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,759
for when you simply must add
interest to your desolate airfield.

595
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,039
I know it may look like a tractor
with a couple of pots of paint

596
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,359
strapped to the back

597
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,599
but it's actually a very technical
piece of equipment

598
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,839
developed over many, many months,

599
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,120
and I'm extremely proud of it.

600
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,479
And with my very own B-road
now open for business,

601
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,680
it's time to release the Civic
back into its natural habitat.

602
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,399
Already it feels just right.

603
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
What a thing!

604
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,879
It's so impressive.

605
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,360
You'd swear it was four-wheel drive.

606
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,360
Pitch it in.

607
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,280
Just yobbery at its finest.

608
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,399
This is why these cars were made -
for these conditions. It's so agile.

609
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,759
The front of the car is just superb.

610
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,999
It's so obedient.
You just turn, it goes.

611
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,719
And best of all, I don't feel
totally ashamed driving it

612
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,759
because it wasn't styled
by a seven-year-old.

613
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,959
Honda has nailed it with this thing.

614
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
It's a proper hot hatch.

615
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,399
Hello-hello?

616
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Look at this lot.

617
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,039
Hello. Andrew. To what do I owe this
pleasure? What a line-up.

618
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,719
I have assembled all these classic
hot hatches just to let you know

619
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,039
what they're all about.

620
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,119
But, firstly, what's that like?
Fantastic, mate.

621
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,319
They've smashed it out of the park.
Really, really good car.

622
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,239
It's a bit more subtle
than the last one.

623
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,519
Better to drive. It's wonderful.

624
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,919
I'm sure it's lovely to drive.

625
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,839
Is it a hot hatch? Well,
it's got a hatchback and it's hot.

626
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,279
But...

627
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,920
..it's massive.

628
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,599
You see, whether it's the classic
Citroen AX GT...

629
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,399
Honestly, you wouldn't believe
how agile and fast that is.

630
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,959
..the iconic
Renault Clio Williams...

631
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,679
Do you know what, when I was a kid,
we used to see the odd one of these

632
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,959
knocking about and you thought,
"I want one of these."

633
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,959
..the original VW Golf GTI...

634
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,759
When you think of the original hot
hatchback, the Golf is it, isn't it?

635
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,679
..or even the last truly
game-changing Civic Type R...

636
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,959
Now we're talking.
This moved the game on completely.

637
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,319
..what this line-up of greats
shows is that true hot hatches

638
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,679
all share the same simple,
lightweight, compact DNA.

639
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,359
It's a fantastic line-up, Fred,
I have to say, it makes me smile,

640
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,279
but also a bit wistful for the past
because, well, it makes you realise

641
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,279
how sort of big and bloated
things have become, really. Yeah.

642
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,599
Because the problem is, Fred,
all this old stuff is all very well

643
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,719
but you can't have an old-style
hot hatch that's new.

644
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,519
You can. You can have that.
No, you can't. You can.

645
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,080
You can thank me later.

646
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,359
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

647
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,479
the new OLD Peugeot 205 GTI.

648
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,400
Oh-oh-oh!

649
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,479
It's the work of a British
company called Tolman.

650
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,799
You take an old 205 GTI,

651
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,959
strip it down to the bare bones,

652
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,040
and regenerate it
better than ever before.

653
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,159
This is what they call a Restomod.

654
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,879
And, yeah, we've seen
Restomods before,

655
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,200
but they've always been
unbelievably expensive.

656
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,399
This 205 is about 45 grand

657
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,639
and, don't get me wrong,
I know that that's a lot of cash,

658
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,839
but, at the same time, it's a
similar price to Chris' Civic.

659
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,440
And I've got to say,
this is a lot more special.

660
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,199
Tolman's gone to town
on every inch of this Peugeot.

661
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,759
The engine's
been totally overhauled.

662
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,279
There's stronger brakes,
new suspension.

663
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,600
They've even updated
the old interior.

664
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,159
OK, so what they didn't manage to do
was find any more space.

665
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,519
If you're my height, 6'4",

666
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,199
you're not exactly
sitting in the car.

667
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,320
I feel like I'm wearing it.

668
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,559
But I've got electric windows.
I've got power steering.

669
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,760
I've got a DAB radio!

670
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,959
And the real genius

671
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,400
is the Tolman 205 doesn't feel like
a new car in old clothes.

672
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,399
It's still shot through with
that classic hot hatch spirit.

673
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,799
Only got 130 horsepower,

674
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,039
which is less than your average
family car nowadays.

675
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,879
But I'm only shifting 900kg,

676
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,719
so it's light, it's nimble,

677
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,559
it's fun!

678
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,160
It is fun. What a car!

679
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,079
Chris, I'm so pleased
you came out to play.

680
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,199
Admit it, you're jealous.

681
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,759
It's absolutely stunning.
It's the perfect hot hatch shape.

682
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,720
Let's see what it can do.
Make it dance. Come on!

683
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,439
It's not particularly quick,
but it's nimble

684
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,039
and it is so much fun.

685
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,119
Oh, here we go.

686
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,479
Tell you what, Fred,
it looks so good I'm already sold.

687
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,799
Where do I write the cheque?
Look at it.

688
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,599
I've got to say, I wanted one
of these when I was about 20

689
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,919
and I've never driven one
up until today

690
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,360
and this thing is not disappointing.

691
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,039
I can't shake you off, though,
that is for sure.

692
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,680
I suppose I'd better demonstrate
where the progress is now.

693
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,519
Oh, ta-ra, Chris!

694
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,559
That's what 30 years does.

695
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,280
That is what it does.

696
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,519
The truth is, though,
there are no losers here.

697
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,079
Whether you fancy a lovingly-updated
classic or the very best that

698
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,599
modern engineering prowess can
produce, you can't really go wrong.

699
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,479
What we're saying is, then,
if you're into hot hatches,

700
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,879
it's a good time to be alive.

701
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,800
Happy days. Which reminds me,
I've got something to show you.

702
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,760
I've built a B-road!

703
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,319
Oh, it's perfect. Yes!

704
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,920
This is what this car was made for.

705
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,359
This is some road, Christopher.
Congratulations.

706
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,360
It's about smiles, not speed,
Andrew. Smiles, not speed.

707
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,559
Roundabout. Roundabout. Oh, yes.

708
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,640
Do you mind if I go again?
One more time.

709
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,759
What a car.

710
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,640
The Peugeot 205 GTI Tolman.

711
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,240
Thank you.

712
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,199
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

713
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,159
That...

714
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,679
..is a really good car.
It is. So is that, though.

715
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,679
Do you know what,
seeing them both side by side,

716
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,359
it's amazing the size difference.

717
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,279
I mean, how the hell in the '80s,
did we fit in them?

718
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,599
Cos in the '80s, Paddy, we were
kids. We were smaller.

719
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,399
You were never that small. You're
like Donkey Kong in Mario Kart.

720
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,759
You driving around in one
of them is unbelievable.

721
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,399
So go on, then, Pad, fresh pair
of eyes on it, which one you having?

722
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,199
It's a tricky one because

723
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,559
17-year-old Pad would
have loved one of them. I get that.

724
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,959
On the other hand, 17-year-old Pad
would have loved one of them.

725
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,599
Similar prices?
Well, same ballpark.

726
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,479
Oh, it's a tricky one.
They're both so good.

727
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,359
I'm going to have to
go for the Civic. Yeah.

728
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,039
I'm going to have to go
for the Civic

729
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,799
but I'd pop the Peugeot in the boot
for a blast down memory lane

730
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,719
every now and again.
Perfect two-car garage.

731
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,799
Right, that's that sorted. Now we
must get back to our young race team

732
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,240
where things
were about to get really serious.

733
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,359
Just seven weeks since our young
team first came together,

734
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,680
this bold experiment
is reaching its conclusion.

735
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,199
A band of talented drivers
and mechanics

736
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,720
whose racing ambitions
could never have reached so far...

737
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,039
..are now going wheel-to-wheel
with a multimillion pound grid

738
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,519
of hardened racers in the GT Cup.

739
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,999
It's extremely tough. They really
have to soak up everything

740
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,759
that we say like a sponge, not get
overwhelmed by the whole experience.

741
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,599
From what we've seen of them
in the car so far,

742
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,599
you know, they're adapting to it
very, very well

743
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,360
and taking it on board very quickly.

744
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,999
It's pre-race practice.

745
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,399
Louis and Ollie have had two weeks
intensive training with the car

746
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,759
and now it's their last chance
to prepare.

747
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,359
We've got brand-new brakes
on the front...

748
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,159
30% brake pressure, 50%, 70.

749
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,759
The warm-up session doesn't
just give them the chance

750
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,999
to set the car up for the track,

751
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,399
it's also the driver's
one opportunity

752
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,199
to rehearse crucial moments
of the race to come.

753
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
I want you to practise
the driver chain

754
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,519
as they come into the pits hot.

755
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,999
Hit your marks on the board. Get out
the car as quick as can, Louis,

756
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,759
then you're jumping in,
waiting for the push back.

757
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,919
Remember, once the lollipop
releases you,

758
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,359
you've got to mash that throttle.

759
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,760
Full faith on him. You just got to
go into the fast lane and go.

760
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,119
For mechanics Lillie and Callum,
meanwhile,

761
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,679
working with the McLaren
has meant finding their place

762
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,599
in a professional pit crew.
Lillie and Callum have gelled well

763
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,519
with their team.
They get on with everybody.

764
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,319
They've stepped up to the next
level, checking suspension,

765
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,479
you know, we changed brakes
yesterday

766
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,240
and I think they'll do
really well today.

767
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,119
The whole team
has raised their game.

768
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,719
But as practice comes to an end,

769
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,879
the real test starts now.

770
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,880
Just, uh...

771
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,399
..keeping everything crossed.

772
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,359
We've got 20 minutes
and then we're out.

773
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,079
So the call for the tyres will be
a little bit earlier. Yeah. Yeah.

774
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,919
So I want you guys out. You got
gloves? I'll get some now. Yeah.

775
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,719
You want good ones. Yeah? Cos the
pull for the tyres will strain you.

776
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,399
All right. Yeah. Yeah?

777
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,560
You good? Yeah. Thank you.

778
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,799
The incredible field that makes up
the GT Cup grid

779
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,759
is divided into six
competitive categories.

780
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,319
Team Top Gear is competing
in the GTH class

781
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,000
against nine other McLarens,
Porsches and AMG Mercs.

782
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,799
As a team endurance event,

783
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,319
both drivers will have to
prove themselves.

784
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,360
First with the qualifying rounds.

785
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,839
On new tyres, low fuel,

786
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,560
he's going to get about three laps
to do a time.

787
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,399
My boy.

788
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,679
Yeah, he's my
little gentle giant.

789
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,999
I know he's in a really,
really fast car.

790
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,720
Yeah, my heart should be
palpitating.

791
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,120
But I've got confidence in him
and he's a confident lad as well.

792
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,199
Do you believe how mad it is
from karting to doing this?

793
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,279
I mean, it's mad, isn't it?
It is crazy.

794
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,760
Oh, I'm buzzing for you.
Buzzing for you.

795
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,719
I can't believe that my boy

796
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,799
is competing at this level.

797
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,080
I just couldn't be more proud.

798
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,559
The opportunity which he's had here
is something that's unobtainable

799
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,079
to the working man.
You can't afford to race a McLaren.

800
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,400
You can't afford to sit
in a McLaren.

801
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,199
Louis and Ollie's first-ever
competitive performance in the car

802
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,079
is enough to qualify them
8th in class.

803
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,399
And now the end of the road
for Team Top Gear

804
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:19,000
lies on the other side of
a 50-minute endurance race.

805
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,839
A race where each driver
gets a stint,

806
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,159
swapping midway
with a full team pit stop.

807
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,319
Competing right through to the
chequered flag would need them

808
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,040
ALL to be on their game.

809
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,599
Right, guys,
it's time to get serious now.

810
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,839
This whole journey is pointed
to the GT Cup race.

811
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,399
50-minute race.
I want Louis to start

812
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,359
and then for you, Ollie, to bring
home the chequered flag. Perfect.

813
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,440
Come on, lads. Let's do it.

814
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,839
I'm more nervous
watching this than...

815
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,279
I know, it's the thing, isn't it?

816
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,319
You just want them to be safe,
don't you? They're like your kids.

817
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,559
Our stomachs are in knots. Imagine
what their bloody dads are like.

818
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,399
Louis is approaching the end
of the formation lap,

819
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,479
and the rolling start
is just seconds away.

820
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,559
It's time to find out
how this team reacts

821
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,999
when he comes to the big moment.

822
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,840
Lights are on on the gantry.
They go out now.

823
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,159
And we get Round 20 of the 2022
Championship season under way

824
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,480
for GT Cup.

825
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,439
Come on! Come on, Louis!

826
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,160
It looks as though everybody
is safely through the first corner.

827
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,439
Louis came on the radio and says,

828
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,680
"The car in front
is slowing me down."

829
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,919
It takes a bit of skill,
a bit of experience.

830
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,399
So you've got to work out
where you are quicker during the lap

831
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,160
and then pick your moment.

832
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,600
Has he got him? Yeah, got him.

833
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,679
Pace is really good.
Faster than that car in front.

834
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,000
That car is running top three
in the points.

835
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,440
Louis is making his mark
as he claws away at the field.

836
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,199
All the while in the garage,

837
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,319
the team's pit stop strategy
is being calculated.

838
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,839
If he's got a bit of traffic,
we might get Ollie in to try

839
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,079
and do an undercut to try
and overtake during the pit stops.

840
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,839
Or if Louis is in clean air,
just keep him out there.

841
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,279
Just keep going.

842
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,399
Get yourself ready, warmed up.

843
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,600
Do something to me as well.

844
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,119
Out on track, the battles
and drama continue...

845
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,919
Whoa! Uh-oh! Oh!

846
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,239
..but Louis is holding his own.

847
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,159
There he is, there he is.

848
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,200
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

849
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,439
What do you think about his position
at the minute? You happy?

850
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,159
Yeah, he's doing a good job.

851
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,240
We're holding P7 right now.

852
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,599
So this is number 25 car...
Go on, Louis!

853
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,999
..going well in the hands of
Louis Smithen making his debut

854
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,920
in the Championship, scheduled
to hand the car over to Ollie Hall.

855
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,359
The pit stop window opens

856
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,559
and the team in the garage
get ready to go to work.

857
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,640
How long till he's in?
Three minutes.

858
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,680
Whatever happens, happens. Do your
best, that's all we can ask for.

859
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,680
Oh!

860
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,120
Go on, Ol.

861
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,080
Please confirm...

862
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,040
Let's do it.

863
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,760
Get out, go, go.

864
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,000
Here we go.

865
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,479
Where are we?

866
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,560
Go.

867
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,920
Good job, good job, good job.

868
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,039
What happened with
the safety car, then?

869
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,079
So, Car 17 crashed out.

870
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,119
Safety car came out just as
we were coming into the pit,

871
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,800
so I think that may have played
out in our favour.

872
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,879
How was it? It was fun.

873
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,399
So much fun, yeah.
You looked great out there.

874
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,799
I could hear you saying the guy
in front of you was slower.

875
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,079
You got past. Yeah. Oh!

876
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,719
Louis held 7th place
at the handover

877
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,199
and, as the safety car pits,

878
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,559
the race resumes. Here we go.

879
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,480
Ollie now has just over ten minutes
to bring it home for the team.

880
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,480
Go on!

881
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,080
Two more laps to go.

882
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,480
Go on, Ol, push!

883
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,680
Come on, Ollie, bring it home, son.
Bring it home.

884
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,360
Yes! Yeah, boy.

885
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,159
Good lad.

886
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,679
Well done, lad.
P7. Well done, mate.

887
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,959
Good job. Thank you.
Fantastic. Fantastic.

888
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,600
Well done. You believe that?
No. Can you believe that? Eh?

889
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,719
Yes, come on, Ollie!

890
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,120
CHEERING

891
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,999
Yes. Oh, mate!

892
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,239
Few beers tonight?

893
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,279
Oh, that was just probably
the best day of my life.

894
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,959
I'm just so happy that we got
a good result for the team.

895
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,199
Yeah, I'm just amazed.

896
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,679
Wow, it's been incredible. We didn't
start out as racing drivers,

897
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,679
but we've definitely finished
as one.

898
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,679
It's been so incredible.

899
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,199
It's like something
you're never going to forget,

900
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,199
being here, doing all of this.

901
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,199
The paddock team
has just been amazing.

902
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,039
I just want to thank them
so much for looking after me.

903
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,719
The mechanics, especially,
for getting the car set up for me.

904
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,679
Callum and Lillie, me two mechanics,
we have been on a journey.

905
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,879
We've got some amazing memories
together

906
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,560
and memories
that we'll cherish forever.

907
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,959
It's just been amazing
from start to finish.

908
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,599
The dream for me is basically to do
what I've done the last couple

909
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,439
of months, just as a living.

910
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,440
The dream for the future will be to
continue in any form of motorsport.

911
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,519
There we go.

912
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,239
A couple of months ago,
we had an idea.

913
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,119
Could we get four young people
together and get into racing,

914
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,999
people who would never get a shot?

915
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,520
And if we could, what would happen?

916
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,079
There's your answer.

917
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,239
And it just goes to show
the talent's out there.

918
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,840
All they need is a chance.

919
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

920
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,680
Give it up for Lillie,
Callum, Ollie and Louis!

921
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,199
Amazing. Respect to all of you.

922
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,319
Eight weeks from a standing start
to racing in GT Cup,

923
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,039
that is a hell of an effort.
Fantastic.

924
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,599
I tell you what, when that flag
dropped at Donington,

925
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,359
all the nerves kicked in.

926
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,119
For me, it was like sending
your kids off to school

927
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,599
for the first time,
but this time the kids are driving

928
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,279
220-grand McLarens!
And I'll tell you what else.

929
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,439
After only two months on the job,
they've already done better than us.

930
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,039
They've actually managed to finish
a race without breaking down

931
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,879
or smashing up a car.
Well done. Amazing.

932
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,839
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

933
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,119
And it goes to prove that there's
real talent out there

934
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,079
and I'm very proud
of that young team.

935
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,759
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Team Top Gear!

936
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,279
CHEERING

937
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,319
Again! You're milking it now.
Milking it.

938
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,199
And that's it for us tonight
and for the next few weeks,

939
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,559
because we're off your screens
for something called the World Cup.

940
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,599
Come on, England!

941
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,839
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

942
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,119
And Wales!

943
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,359
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

944
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,840
Thanks so much for watching.
See you in a few weeks. Goodnight.
