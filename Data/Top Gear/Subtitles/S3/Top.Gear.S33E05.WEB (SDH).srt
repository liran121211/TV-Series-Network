1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,400
(orchestral music)

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,640
(upbeat rock music)

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,520
(upbeat rock music continues)

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,920
(audience applauding)

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,120
(audience applauding continues)

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
- Hello, welcome to "Top Gear."

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,520
We're back from our World Cup break.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,360
And, to be honest,

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,480
we've found ourselves in
a little bit of a pickle.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,320
- See, the thing is,

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,240
we have to record this week's
episode way in advance.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,160
So we've got no idea who's won.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,000
- Not a clue.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,040
So we're gonna read you our bets.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,400
First, let's go with the favourites.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Congratulations, Brazil.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,000
Well done.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,520
(audience applauding)

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,840
You've got it again.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,240
You've got it again.
(Freddie laughing)

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,440
Who else?

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,640
- Congratulations, Germany.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,640
(audience booing and laughing)

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,800
- Ooh.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,640
No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Too soon?

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,480
Presume penalties?

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,440
(Freddie and Chris laughing)

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,680
- And I guess, everyone,
there's always a chance.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,160
It might have happened.

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,760
England!

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,000
(audience cheering)

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,480
- It's not, is it?
- It's not, it's not.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,320
- It's not, it's not.
- It is not.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
- Lads, don't forget Wales.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
- What?
- Don't forget Wales.

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,720
- Let's not go mad.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,560
(audience laughing)

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800
Right, what we do know is,

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,440
it's our last episode of the
series and it's a belter.

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
Later on, we're gonna give you

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,640
some useful curb-buying advice,

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,280
but we kick off with the
best noise in the world.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,120
(gentle music)

44
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,960
(engine zooming)

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,800
(gentle music continues)

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,640
(engine zooming)

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,640
(engine roaring)

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,160
That is the sound of a Ferrari V12.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,440
(exhales) That is the sound of Italy.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
And what sound it is.

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,920
(engine roaring)

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,600
A sound that lives in the heart

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
of the Daytona SP3.

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,800
(engine roaring)

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Oh, come on.

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
(rock music)

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,480
Born out of the Prancing
Horse's special project stable,

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Maranello's latest cost
1.8 million pounds.

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,280
And its only purpose in life

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,360
is to celebrate this glorious
marque's glorious history.

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,080
The V12 is Ferrari.

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,520
The first ever road car
they built some 75 years ago

63
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,760
was powered by a V12,

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,560
and they've been building them ever since.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,760
This one is the most powerful of the lot.

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,080
829 horsepower.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Don't mind if I do.

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,240
(engine roaring)
(intense orchestral music)

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Whoa, whoa.

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Listen to that.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,520
As celebrations go, that is a good start.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,240
(gentle music)

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,120
But where the real surprise comes

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,480
is in the way they've
put this car together.

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,960
There are no turbos,
batteries, or e-motors here.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,400
No four-wheel drive, either.

77
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,880
Nor even the usual floppy
bits of active aero.

78
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,560
No, the Daytona is unusually old school.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,880
(engine zooming)
(light orchestral music)

80
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,040
This is Ferrari getting
a little bit nostalgic,

81
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,000
which, to be honest, isn't very Ferrari.

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
They're all about the
future and advancement

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,640
and developing the next bit of tech.

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,480
But just this once,

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,320
they've took a little
trip down memory lane.

86
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,720
Sure, 0 to 60 in less than three seconds,

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
and a 211-mile-an-hour top speed

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
are all very modern numbers.

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,840
Dear me.

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,760
But the attitude of the car

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,600
is much more old-fashioned.

92
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
The steering is a little bit weightier

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
than the usual Ferrari

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,360
and they've engineered a bit
of a thump on the gear change,

95
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,200
but it gives it a real old school feel.

96
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
And check this out for retro.

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Pop-up headlights.

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,240
(Paddy chuckles)

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,720
I mean, it's close enough, isn't it?

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,440
Come on.

101
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,480
(engine zooming)

102
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,160
And as for the rest of
the way the Daytona looks,

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,400
that all comes from Ferrari's deep dive

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,240
into the old family albums.

105
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,280
(sweeping orchestral music)

106
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,360
First, you've got that
futuristic slatted tail,

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,640
borrowed from the 250 P5 concept of 1968.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,720
The bulging wings with those
side mirrors pushed on top,

109
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,520
a pure historic endurance racer.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,880
In fact, the name, basic shape,
even bits of the interior,

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,640
all lead back to the
legendary P330 series cars

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,920
that, back in 1967, took
a one, two, three finish

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
at the 24 Hours of Daytona.

114
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,840
And look at that view over the bonnet.

115
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,680
It makes you feel like
a proper racing driver

116
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
from back in the day.

117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,520
Pop on a crash helmet, a pair of overalls,

118
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,560
couple of laps of Italy,

119
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,680
then back home to England
for tea and crumpets.

120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,520
(engine roaring)

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,400
But while there's no denying
the sense of occasion

122
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,520
the Daytona's stripped-back
retro racer vibes deliver,

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
in a couple of places,

124
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,160
they might have taken it a bit too far.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
For starters, take these seats.

126
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,800
Now when you buy a Daytona,
Ferrari measure you up

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,240
and then glue some cushions to the chassis

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,680
in the exact right position.

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,520
But what happens if your
partner or your mates

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,480
doesn't have the exact
same size hips as you?

131
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,080
It's gonna be a very uncomfortable ride.

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,680
And then we've got the carbon fibre roof.

133
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,720
Once that's off, it's off.

134
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,040
So if the weather turns
and it starts to rain,

135
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
you're gonna get wet,

136
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,400
unless you pop this on,

137
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,960
which isn't very Ferrari.

138
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,800
It's more like you're
going on a camping trip.

139
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,240
Doesn't scream 1.8 million quid, does it?

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,360
If we're being honest, though,

141
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,520
none of that actually matters.

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
(light piano music)

143
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,200
The Daytona's not meant to be practical

144
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,920
in the same way it's not
meant to be the fastest

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,320
or the most cutting-edge supercar going.

146
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,320
Really, the best way to think of it

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,720
is as a 1.8-million-pound work of art.

148
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,320
It's a portal to another time.

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,720
It makes people smile.

150
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,960
And it certainly makes me smile.

151
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,560
(Paddy laughs)
(engine roaring)

152
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,680
But like so many works of art,

153
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,240
the real sadness is that most people

154
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,640
will never get to experience the Daytona.

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
The 600-odd that Ferrari's building

156
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,880
will all be locked away in
climate-controlled garages,

157
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,160
doomed to be passed
around the 0.1-percenters

158
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,680
as nothing more than investments.

159
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,080
And that is an absolute travesty.

160
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,560
So while I've still got the Daytona

161
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
for another couple of hours,

162
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,960
it's time to give a little bit back.

163
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,200
It's time to let the people enjoy it.

164
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,680
(folk music)

165
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh, yes.

166
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
You can forget UberLUX.

167
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,960
It's time to say ciao to Pad's Cabs.

168
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
(sighs) Let's wait for a fare now.

169
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,480
Ciao, ciao.

170
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Hello, yes, grazie.

171
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,960
Well, could be my first
bit of business here.

172
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,560
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

173
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,240
Taxi?
- Grazie.

174
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,280
- In you come, there you go.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
Ferrari Daytona.

176
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
- Wow.

177
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
(engine purrs)

178
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
Okay, you ready?

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
- Ready.

180
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,000
Wow, wow!
(engine roaring)

181
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
- Ooh. (laughs)

182
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,600
(Paddy and passenger laughing)

183
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
- Ooh, a man of the cloth.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
- Taxi?
- Si, Father.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
In, get in.
- Grazie.

186
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,480
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

187
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,840
- Here we go.

188
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
(engine roaring)

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
(Paddy laughs)

190
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
So that's two happy
customers up and running.

191
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,440
- Wow.

192
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
- I love Ferrari.

193
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
- Ah.

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
- The third, though...

196
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,560
Taxi?

197
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,560
(passenger speaking in Italian)

198
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
- [Paddy] Will take a
bit more winning over.

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,800
It's a bit of a squeeze to get in.

200
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
Ah, way.

201
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Whoa. (chuckles)

202
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
(passenger speaking in Italian)

203
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,640
- Shall we?

204
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
- Si, si, si, si, si.

205
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,960
- Oh, god, that's not gonna...

206
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,800
That's not...

207
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
That's not gonna work.

208
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,280
(passenger sighs)

209
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
All right.

210
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Like all supercars, boot space
in the Daytona is an issue.

211
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
(passenger speaking in Italian)

212
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,120
But no nonna can resist the Ferrari V12.

213
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,000
(engine purrs)

214
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
Ooh.

215
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,080
(passenger speaking in Italian)

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
- Exactly.

217
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,720
Hold on tight.

218
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
(engine roaring)
- Ah!

219
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
(passenger speaking in Italian)

220
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,200
(Paddy chuckling)

221
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,320
- But then, of course,

222
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,080
driving a cab through
a town you don't know,

223
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
in a country whose
language you don't speak,

224
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,240
does present a few more challenges.

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,080
Um, (speaks in Italian).

226
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
(passenger speaking in Italian)

227
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,880
- Uh...

228
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
- The market.

229
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
- Market, si.

230
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Directionie?

231
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,800
- Piazza Duomo.

232
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,720
- Piazza?
- Duomo.

233
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,480
- Duomo.
- Duomo.

234
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,080
- Duomo.
- Duomo.

235
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,080
- Duomo. (chuckles)

236
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,400
(Father speaking in Italian)

237
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
- San Bernadino, okay.

238
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
Sono Paddy.

239
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
- Paddy?
- Paddy.

240
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Sono Paddy.

241
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,280
Name, my name.
- Oh.

242
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,720
- Father, Paddy.

243
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
My Italian's coming on a treat.

244
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,600
This is kind of the point of it all,

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,880
because with the Daytona,

246
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,760
it really doesn't matter
where you're going.

247
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,840
This car makes any
journey properly special.

248
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
This car?
- Si.

249
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,960
- [Paddy] 2 million euros.

250
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
- Woo.
- Ooh.

251
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,960
- Oh.

252
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,080
very expense.

253
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,960
- Oh, very. (whistles)

254
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,280
- Too much for common people.
- Too much, too much.

255
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
(Paddy and passenger laughing)

256
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,640
0 to 60 miles per hour in
less than three seconds.

257
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
- Wow.
- Yeah.

258
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,760
(engine roaring)

259
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,000
- Wow.

260
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,880
Wow.

261
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,120
Ah! (giggling)

262
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,560
- Whoa. (laughing)

263
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,280
- It's so crazy. (laughing)

264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
- [Paddy] It's quick.

265
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,480
- It's a crazy taxi.

266
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,080
- Yeah, it is a crazy taxi, yeah.

267
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,640
(jazzy music)

268
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,600
And this crazy taxi
gets a five-star rating.

269
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,400
- To be in a Ferrari, it's a lovely dream.

270
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
- It is beautiful.

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,240
- Good to hear.

272
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,800
- I love so much this car.

273
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,960
I fall in love with this car.

274
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,760
- Yeah, I love this car as well.

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,160
And here we go.

276
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,160
Fantastic.

277
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,520
- Oh, oh.
- Car seat, here we go.

278
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,360
That's the one.

279
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Oh, watch your head, watch your head.

280
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,840
There we go.

281
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
You got everything?

282
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,760
Oh, uh, basket, shopping.

283
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,560
(passenger speaking in Italian)

284
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,600
- Si, two minutes.

285
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,880
Okay, here we go.

286
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,600
(engine roaring)

287
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,280
(Paddy speaking in Italian)

288
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,200
(sweeping orchestral music)

289
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,520
There we go.

290
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,760
Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much.

291
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,280
- Oh, lovely.
- Bye-bye, thank you.

292
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,400
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.

293
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
(engine roaring)

294
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
(Father speaking in Italian)

295
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,480
- It's okay?
- Grazie, grazie.

296
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Thank you, Father, thank you.

297
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,600
So the good people of L'Aquila

298
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,400
have experienced the joy of the Daytona.

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
Here we go.

300
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,800
- Grazie, grazie, grazie.

301
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,920
Grazie.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
(uplifting orchestral music)

303
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,600
And now, there's just one job left to do.

304
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
And that's to take this work of art

305
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,680
back to its climate-controlled garage

306
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,640
300 miles away.

307
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,400
Avanti.

308
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,440
(audience applauding)

309
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,880
- That's a lovely car.
- It's nice, that one.

310
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,680
- Ooh.

311
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,920
- Come on, I'm jealous.
- What a Ferrari.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
- Jealous, jealous.
- Beautiful car.

313
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
Beautiful car.

314
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,760
And honestly, the attention
it got was unbelievable.

315
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,000
- But do you think the looks are enhanced

316
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,760
by the plastic taxi triangle
that you slapped to the roof?

317
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,560
(audience laughing)

318
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,160
- That's just the cherry
on top of the cake, Chris.

319
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,560
And let me tell you, Pads
Cabs did a roaring trade.

320
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,920
You might not arrive with your luggage,

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,920
but you'll get there very, very quickly.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
(audience laughing)

323
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,320
- Well, Paddy, 1.8 million quid.

324
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,720
I don't think cabbies
are gonna be going out

325
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,280
ditching the Priuses just yet.

326
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,280
- No, no, it is bonkers money,

327
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
but, listen, everything's
bonkers money these days.

328
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,080
Look at the price of a pint in London.

329
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,120
He knows, he'll tell you.
(audience laughing)

330
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
You need a drink after you've
paid for one, mate, don't you?

331
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,840
(audience laughing)
You're right,

332
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
but there's still one vehicle
that's doing a booming trade.

333
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,320
And that's the humble van.

334
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Because thanks to the flourishing business

335
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,680
of online deliveries,

336
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,840
it's all happening in the
world of vans right now.

337
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,840
You want a new one?

338
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,120
You spoiled for choice.

339
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
What have we got, lads?

340
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,400
- I love this, the ID. Buzz Cargo.

341
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,400
The van version of the
new electric VW love bus.

342
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,240
I'll admit it.

343
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,480
Not the cheapest, not the biggest.

344
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
But look at it, it's far more interesting

345
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,640
than a boring diesel box.

346
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,200
- Lovely looking thing, yeah.

347
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,520
- Crystals, what about you?

348
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,960
- Mercedes eVito.

349
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,240
Again, all electric, 160 miles of range.

350
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,720
Much, much clever inside
than your average white van.

351
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,520
- Yeah.

352
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
And we've got, everyone,

353
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
a Ford Transit Custom.
- There she is.

354
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,200
- Come on, enjoy it.

355
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,720
(audience applauding)

356
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,840
Last year, this was the
best-selling vehicle in the UK.

357
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
Not the best-selling van,

358
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,080
the best-selling vehicle.

359
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,040
It outsold Fiestas, Focuses,
Corsairs, Golfs, the lot.

360
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,880
Amazing.

361
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
- But here's the issue,

362
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,600
because a shiny van like
this doesn't come cheap.

363
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,120
Apparently, this one, 41 grand.

364
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,160
- [Audience] Ooh.

365
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
- I know, I know it is crazy,

366
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,160
but what if you want to
get into the delivery game

367
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,000
on a budget?

368
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,800
- Well, to find out,

369
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
the producers gave us each three grand

370
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,840
and told us to buy ourselves a van,

371
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,960
give it a proper delivery
company paint job,

372
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,200
and prepare for some challenges.

373
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
(suspenseful music)

374
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,600
At the risk of making this piece

375
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
of consumer testing rather brief,

376
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,920
getting into the delivery
game on a budget is simple.

377
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,640
When it comes to vans, you
can't beat the original.

378
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,240
The best, the Ford Transit.

379
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,880
Not only British-built, but
pretty much built Britain.

380
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
(elegant orchestral music)

381
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,640
It's part of the fabric of our nation.

382
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,720
And I've got myself a minter
here, just 230,000 miles.

383
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
It's barely run in.

384
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,320
If you're going to deliver stuff,

385
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,800
I don't know why you'd
deliver in anything else.

386
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,360
- [Freddie] Unless, that is,
you want it delivered faster.

387
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,840
(rock music)

388
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,560
- Yeah, I really don't why
you'd choose anything...

389
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
A sprightly entry?

390
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,320
- Hello.

391
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,880
- First of all, Fred-
- What?

392
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,840
- No notes on the name.

393
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
Absolutely superb, bang on.

394
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,040
- Smashed it, I know.
- You have.

395
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,040
- Smashed it.
- I can't complain.

396
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,960
That's superb.

397
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,840
One question.

398
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,040
The brief said, "Buy a van."

399
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,160
You bought a family estate
car with no windows.

400
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,480
- This is an Astravan.

401
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,600
In the cities, you wanna
be fast, get your parcels,

402
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,480
you wanna be nimble,
you wanna park it easy.

403
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,440
This does all that and looks great.

404
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,360
- Okay, let's talk performance.

405
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
Engine?

406
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,880
- It's a 1.9.
- Yep.

407
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,280
- Diesel.
- Yeah, cool.

408
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,160
- [Freddie] I got some new rims.

409
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
I've got a spoiler on the back.

410
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
It looks the part, Chris.

411
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
- Scenario.
- Yeah.

412
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,240
- Hi, FredEX, I want to
deliver a sofa, please.

413
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
- Yes, I will sort that out.

414
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,240
Then I'll put the phone down.

415
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280
- Yep.

416
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,080
- Hi, Chris.

417
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,640
I hear you've got a Transit
van down at Purple Sector.

418
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,560
(Chris and Freddie laughing)

419
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,680
Could you deliver a couch for me?

420
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,320
I started speaking and then
I saw the name. (laughing)

421
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,280
The Purple Sector.

422
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
- Let me talk you through
Purple Sector Delivery, okay?

423
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,920
- Yeah.

424
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,960
- If you want fast, accurate deliveries,

425
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,480
Purple Sector is all about motorsport.

426
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,800
'Cause when you go quickest
in a sector on a racetrack,

427
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,280
you go purple.

428
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,400
This is about speed.

429
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
This is about being the quickest.

430
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,240
- Speed?

431
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,040
It's a Transit van.

432
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,880
This is about speed.

433
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,720
- I reckon, in a straight
line, that would toast that.

434
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,600
- Shut up.

435
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,440
- It would.

436
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,400
- A Transit van?

437
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,200
- It's a winner.

438
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,040
Come on, it's a winner.

439
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
- So are are you gonna be

440
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,560
the quintessential Transit van driver?

441
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
- I'm an aggressive little
man in a Transit van.

442
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,520
- Wow.

443
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,360
(upbeat music)

444
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
- [Paddy] Come on.

445
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Do you want those cowboys
knocking at your door?

446
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,560
Would you prefer a more reliable service?

447
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
- [Chris] Oh my lord.

448
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,440
- I can't wait for this.

449
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,560
Come on then.

450
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,920
(Freddie chuckling)

451
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
- Good morning, gentlemen.

452
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,000
- Good morning.
- How are we?

453
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,280
- Is it Postman Pat or Postman Pad?

454
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,160
- I'm going back to an era

455
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,920
when the postal service was respected.

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
(Freddie chuckling)

457
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,040
You two look like you've come
off the set of "SeaBabies."

458
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
- What? (laughs)
- Coming from you? (laughs)

459
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,240
- Right, there's a lot
to take in here, Pad.

460
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,800
First of all-
- Do start, Chris.

461
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,720
- The choice of van, VW Caddy.

462
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,640
Paddy in a Caddy.

463
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,200
- Based on the old Volkswagen
Golf, handles fantastically.

464
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
700 kilos in the back.

465
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,200
Look at it.

466
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
It's a beauty.

467
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,680
Don't it not make you smile,
a bright red van like that?

468
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,320
- You got one thing missing, though.

469
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,360
- What?

470
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,160
- Where's Jess?
- Wait.

471
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,280
- Where's Jess? (chuckles)
- Wait.

472
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,320
- He's not-
- I don't wanna know.

473
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,960
- He's not got a cat in the back of it.

474
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,640
- [Paddy] Here she is.

475
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,480
(Freddie laughing)

476
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,600
- [Chris] Okay, that's not acceptable.

477
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,160
- [Freddie] There's nothing
right about that. (laughs)

478
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,680
- Who said, officially?

479
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
- No, it can't. (laughs)

480
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,600
Now it's just staring at me.

481
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,440
It's just not

482
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,600
a real cat, is it.
- I can't deal with this.

483
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,440
- Careful.
- Is it a real cat?

484
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,880
- She's a bit funny with strangers.

485
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,760
- No, that was someone's pet.

486
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,720
- Still is, it's mine.

487
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,760
(Chris and Freddie laughing)

488
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,040
- [Chris] So this day had
gone weird unusually quickly.

489
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,440
But nevertheless, we'd
been told it was time

490
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,200
to put our delivery vans to the test

491
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
at a nearby mystery location.

492
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,680
A mystery location happily
located somewhere beyond the end

493
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,400
of this runway.

494
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,720
- [Paddy] Go on, Purple
Member, start us off.

495
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,680
- Purple Sector.

496
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,600
- Sorry.

497
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,960
- Three, two, one, go.

498
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,640
(brakes screeching)

499
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,800
(upbeat rock music)

500
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,120
- Oh, boy, I'm the Astravan man.

501
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,960
- Oh, look at this.

502
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,240
I'm being taken down by the Astra.

503
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,360
- Ooh.

504
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,160
- Oh, look at it.

505
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,520
And the bloody Paddy as well.

506
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
Oh.

507
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,360
(upbeat rock music)

508
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,720
I'm getting hammered here.

509
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,040
- I already said it was gonna happen here.

510
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,760
This is the future of deliveries.

511
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,200
- I was quietly confident
that the rear-wheel drive,

512
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,880
very lightweight, empty Transit
van would do quite well,

513
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
but I was absolutely thumped there.

514
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,200
(upbeat rock music)

515
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,160
- Exactly.

516
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,680
In the world of deliveries,

517
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,240
most of the time, it's
not size that's important.

518
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
It's speed.

519
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,160
All these huge delivery
vans tooling around town,

520
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,600
if you look at them,
they're never full of stuff.

521
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,360
You know, people order socks,
charging cables, small things.

522
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,560
This is all you need, one of these.

523
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,280
Won't delay in this, I'll be there early.

524
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm bringing a bit of
sportiness to the van world.

525
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,600
- Now this particular
generation of Transit

526
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,720
was one of the last to be built in the UK.

527
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,280
And being a Ford,

528
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,800
it actually drives a lot
better than it needs to.

529
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,200
The steering's good, the brakes are good,

530
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,320
the gearshift is fine.

531
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,880
And I tell you what, it is fun to drive.

532
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,280
(upbeat rock music)

533
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
And when you're spending

534
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,160
your whole working week behind the wheel,

535
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,640
that is frankly much more important

536
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
than where you put your stuffed cat.

537
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
- You cool enough, my love?

538
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,280
You know, there's something lovely

539
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,120
about seeing a bright red
van coming down the road.

540
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,640
That little nod back to
happy, innocent times.

541
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,000
There used to be a time when
people would look forward

542
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,680
to seeing the postie.

543
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,560
Any odd jobs you need
me to do while I'm here?

544
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,400
No?

545
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,800
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

546
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,200
Lovely.

547
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,840
Now it's all parcels
thrown into your bushes.

548
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,080
I'm bringing back the personal touch

549
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
in the bright red van.

550
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
Royal Male.

551
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,640
- [Chris] But it was time to
decide who'd really solved

552
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,360
the great secondhand delivery van dilemma.

553
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,120
Pulling up to the state-of-the-art

554
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,560
"Top Gear" rapid parcel delivery

555
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
assault course test facility

556
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,400
centre.

557
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,480
(suspenseful music)

558
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
(Paddy clears throat)

559
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,760
(Freddie chuckling)

560
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,960
You will now tackle a
challenging handling circuit,

561
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,160
delivering packages as you go.

562
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,520
Fastest to complete the round wins.

563
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,680
P.S. Beware of the dog.

564
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
- I didn't even listen to the challenge.

565
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,360
I was just looking at that cat.

566
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,280
(suspenseful music)

567
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,440
- [Chris] For Flintoff and
everyone else's benefit, then,

568
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,080
this thorough test of
our delivery vehicles

569
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,600
would now see us take
turns driving a course

570
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,920
specifically designed to
include all the challenges

571
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,520
a busy driver might encounter on a shift.

572
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,120
(dog barking)

573
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,720
- You all right, Jess?

574
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,560
(imitates cat meowing) Shut up.

575
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,320
(Freddie laughing)

576
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,760
Let's deliver.

577
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,000
- And as Postman Pad would now
demonstrate by going first...

578
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,560
Three, two, one, go.

579
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,800
- Oh, oh, hurry.

580
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,240
- [Chris] Those challenges are varied.

581
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,360
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey. (chuckles)

582
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,120
- [Chris] With a handy
sat nav directing us

583
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,880
to the full range of
typical delivery locations.

584
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,040
- [Sat Nav] In 50 metres, turn left.

585
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,440
- [Chris] The course begins
on tight urban streets.

586
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
- Ooh, my god.

587
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,800
Geez, these deliveries are everywhere.

588
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
- And, of course, for
a delivery to count...

589
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,440
This is quite nice.

590
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,480
- He's going to do it properly, isn't he?

591
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,360
- [Chris] It must be left
in the designated area.

592
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,400
- Thank you.

593
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,120
- [Sat Nav] (beeps) Delivery successful.

594
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,960
- I like that.
- No, I do.

595
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
- No, no, I like that.

596
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,680
Next, the course throws up
the dreaded first-floor test.

597
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,120
- Flip the hat, though.

598
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
- [Chris] A sweaty dash upstairs

599
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
to really get the blood pumping.

600
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
- [Sat Nav] (beeps) Delivery successful.

601
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,240
(engine roaring)

602
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,440
- Woohoo!

603
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,680
You all right there, then, Jess?

604
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,640
- [Freddie] He's keen, Pat, isn't he?

605
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,760
- [Chris] As well he should be.

606
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,880
Because it's time for the multi drop zone.

607
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,080
Three addresses, just a few doors apart.

608
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
- [Sat Nav] Drop three.

609
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,160
- [Chris] Each one just
begging the question,

610
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,880
do you drive between them?

611
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,160
- [Sat Nav] (beeps) Delivery successful.

612
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,200
- [Chris] Or attack them all on foot?

613
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,440
- [Sat Nav] Drop four.

614
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,600
- Oh, he's dropping them off-

615
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,440
Oh, there he is.

616
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,440
- Yes, he's gonna be tired after this.

617
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
- [Paddy] One more stop.

618
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,480
(brakes screeching)

619
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,840
- This is like a really weird
version of "Challenge Anneka."

620
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,000
- [Paddy] Last one.

621
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
Get on that.

622
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,240
- Delivery successful.
- This is rigorous.

623
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
I think he's got them all so far.

624
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,240
With just two drops remaining,

625
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,480
the course heads out of town,

626
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,480
aiming to test our van's
rural capabilities.

627
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,600
- Drop six.
- Not good.

628
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,800
- Static caravan.
- Ouch, wrong way.

629
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
(banana squeaks)
What the (beep)?

630
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,880
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh, that could have done it.

631
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
That could have done it.

632
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,480
- A freaking banana.

633
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,000
- [Chris] Pulling up at the caravan,

634
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,880
no run would be complete

635
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,600
without the always awkward big screen TV.

636
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
- [Paddy] One plasma coming up.

637
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,760
- That's in the box.

638
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
That's neat and tidy.

639
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,600
And with this textbook run
now drawing to a close,

640
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,160
all that remains is the final drop.

641
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,480
- Come on.

642
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,280
- [Chris] Complete with
every delivery driver's

643
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,400
worst nightmare.

644
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,920
- [Sat Nav] Drop seven.

645
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,160
Warning: Untethered
animal loose on premises.

646
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,480
(Paddy grunts)

647
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,600
- [Paddy] Where's that bloody dog?

648
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,080
Bloody hell, the weight of it.

649
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,920
- Here he goes, here he goes.

650
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
- Oh, you got it, Pat.
- Hat's on, hat's on.

651
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,280
- [Freddie] Oh, he's having a go. (laughs)

652
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,440
- [Chris] He's got Jess the cat with him.

653
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,280
- Nice pace, Chris.

654
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,960
He's moving quite well, though.

655
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,320
- [Chris] Now, it's worth mentioning

656
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,400
that any misdeliveries earn
a 20-second time penalty.

657
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,720
(beep)

658
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,520
(Chris and Freddie laughing)

659
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,520
But that was of no concern to Postman Pat.

660
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,520
(dog barking)
- God, there's the dog.

661
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,040
Save yourself, Jess!

662
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
(dog barks)
(Paddy gasps)

663
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,040
(dog snarling)
(Paddy grunting)

664
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,800
- Oh, he's got him.
- He's taken down.

665
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,680
(Chris and Freddie laughing)

666
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,840
- [Chris] With a clean sweep of drops,

667
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,560
McGuinness had posted
a very respectable time

668
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,520
of five minutes, 51 seconds.

669
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,240
- [Paddy] Royal Male, son.

670
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,960
We always deliver.

671
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,560
(upbeat music)

672
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,360
- [Chris] A time that
I would now aim to beat

673
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,760
in the Transit.

674
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,920
- Okay, Purple Member,

675
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,360
three, two, one, go.

676
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
(brakes screeching)

677
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,640
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

678
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
- Whoa.

679
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,840
- [Paddy] Hope there's
no glassware in there.

680
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
- [Sat Nav] Drop number one.

681
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,000
- [Paddy] Rear-wheel drive,

682
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,360
that's where he's got
the advantage, you see.

683
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,920
- [Freddie] But where he
didn't have the advantage...

684
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
- [Chris] In you go.

685
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,880
- [Sat Nav] Delivery successful.

686
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,640
- [Freddie] Was when the going got tight.

687
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,920
- Oh, that's two.

688
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,720
Three?

689
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
- The Transit is a bit bigger than theirs.

690
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,480
There we go.

691
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,080
- Ooh, is it the house?
- That's four.

692
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,880
- It's the other way.

693
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,520
Feel your way into it, Chris.

694
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,080
- Why is it-
(Paddy and Freddie laughing)

695
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,040
(brakes screeching)

696
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,200
- Six-point turn.

697
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,760
(suspenseful music)

698
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,560
- [Freddie] And as for
the first floor test...

699
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,400
- [Chris] Two.

700
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,560
- [Freddie] That wasn't
much to look at either.

701
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,800
(package crashes)
- Oh!

702
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,920
- He's not got it on.

703
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,920
- He's now throwing it, yeah.
- Oh, he's gone.

704
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,920
He's attempted it, though,

705
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,480
and I reckon you can place, huh.

706
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,320
- [Freddie] You reckon?

707
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,360
- I reckon you can just
give it one of them.

708
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,200
(package crashes)
- Oh.

709
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,160
- [Sat Nav] Delivery successful.

710
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,960
- How's he gonna get it?

711
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,000
He's gonna reverse it.

712
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,800
(brakes screeching)

713
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,360
- The Transit's good at going over curbs.

714
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,560
- Oh.
- No, you can't do that.

715
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,400
That'd be a letter to the company, that.

716
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,880
(engine roaring)

717
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
Where the old Purple Sector Delivery

718
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
really dropped the ball, though,

719
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
was in the multi drop zone.

720
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,680
- Oh, he's missed.

721
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
It's in the next guy's drive.

722
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
- [Sat Nav] (beeps) Delivery unsuccessful.

723
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,160
20-second penalty.

724
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,120
- [Freddie] Oh, he's trying to lob it in.

725
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,280
- Bollocks.
- Delivery unsuccessful.

726
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,120
- Hell of a mess.

727
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,000
- He's having an absolute nightmare.

728
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,400
- [Sat Nav] Drop five.

729
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,520
(beeps) Delivery unsuccessful.

730
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,760
- Oh, he's missed another.

731
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,160
(rock music)

732
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,800
With the clock ticking away,

733
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,320
Harris bounced out into the countryside,

734
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,760
hoping to redeem himself with
the flat-screen telly drop.

735
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,160
- Now you don't want this
dropping on the floor

736
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,600
by your delivery driver.

737
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,560
This is your plasma.

738
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,000
You've saved up for this.

739
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,360
4K, the lot.

740
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,160
(TV crashes)

741
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,000
Oh my God.

742
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Look at that.
- Oh, no.

743
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,880
- [Sat Nav] (beeps) Delivery successful.

744
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
- I'm blowing now.

745
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,280
(Chris sighs)

746
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,480
- [Freddie] To round off
this delivery disaster,

747
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,000
it was just a case of waiting
for our canine friend...

748
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
- Where's the dog?

749
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,640
- [Freddie] To put him...

750
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
- Where's the dog?

751
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,560
- [Freddie] Out of his misery.

752
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,800
- Where's the dog?

753
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,840
Where's the dog?
- Look how he's running.

754
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,120
- [Freddie] He's got his
shoelaces tied together.

755
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,120
- He's actually running
like he's pooed himself.

756
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,240
- [Freddie] Don't think
about the dog, Chris.

757
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,520
- [Sat Nav] (beeps) Delivery successful.

758
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,080
- Ooh, ooh.

759
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Oh, he's terrified.

760
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,480
(dog barking)

761
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,320
Oh my god, we got it, Chris.

762
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
Come on, Harris.
- Finish it.

763
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
- He's gonna pull you down.
- Oh no, he got his-

764
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,680
- Ouch.

765
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,240
(dog snarling)
(Chris whimpering)

766
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,120
- Oh.
- Jesus.

767
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,160
- Do you want a bone?

768
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,040
Would you like a Bonio?

769
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,840
Bonio?

770
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
- What we've got here from Chris Harris

771
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,040
is a second-class delivery.

772
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,520
(dog snarling)

773
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,320
- [Chris] How about a steak?

774
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,760
Okay, with three missed deliveries

775
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,200
resulting in a seven
minute, 26 second run,

776
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,240
it'd be fair to say I hadn't
gone purple in every sector.

777
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,320
(upbeat music)

778
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,960
So with Paddy in his Caddy
still the team to beat,

779
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,560
could FredEx in his sporty
Astra deliver the goods?

780
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
(suspenseful music)

781
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,760
- Now, remember, that is a plasma.

782
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,160
- The way it's
ratchet-strapped to the roof,

783
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,720
it's now three plasmas.

784
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,120
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

785
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,640
- FredEx.
(vehicle roaring)

786
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Three, two, one, deliver.

787
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,760
- Go, Fred.
- FredEx, hey.

788
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Oh, oh.

789
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,600
(brakes screeching)

790
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,440
- Ooh, no, this is done.
- Here we go.

791
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
- This is it.
- Is he gonna give it some?

792
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,640
- Ooh, it's tight.

793
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,520
Wait a minute, look at the street.

794
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,280
Some dodgy parking 'round here.

795
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
(brakes screech)

796
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,200
- [Paddy] Ooh, he hit the house.

797
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
- He's just driven straight into a house.

798
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,680
- Where's my parcel?

799
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Where's the numbers?

800
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,160
One.

801
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
(package crashing)

802
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
- Should he leave his
name and number there?

803
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
- [Paddy] A nervy start
from the boy racer,

804
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,520
but let's be honest, the next drop...

805
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,440
- [Freddie] Oh, I'm not going up there.

806
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,480
- Was right up his street.

807
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Oh, he's on the roof.

808
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
(package crashing)

809
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,120
- Delivery successful.
- Hey.

810
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,920
- He's got it in a box still, though.

811
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
What a swine.

812
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
(suspenseful music)

813
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,360
- [Paddy] Oh, yes,

814
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,640
at FredEx, speed is everything.

815
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
(engine roaring)

816
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,960
- Whoa, slow down.

817
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,640
There's something in the
back wouldn't like that.

818
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,960
- [Paddy] And with two
drops done already...

819
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,800
- Six.

820
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,240
- Next up was the multi drop masterclass.

821
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,360
Now he's got the arm.

822
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
- Ooh.
- Look.

823
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,160
Oh, he's got that in as well.

824
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
- [Freddie] Delivery.

825
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,720
- That's in as well.
- Delivery successful.

826
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
- Delivery.

827
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,160
That'll do.

828
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,200
- [Sat Nav] (beep) Delivery unsuccessful.

829
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,400
- He hasn't got that
one in as well, has he?

830
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,720
- [Paddy] He hadn't.

831
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,520
But sprinting out of town...

832
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,960
- Ooh.
- Like a rough ride.

833
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,560
- I gotta get the ratchet off.

834
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,480
- [Paddy] Flintoff was soon
dispatching the big screen TV

835
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,400
with the now customary FredEx touch.

836
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
(TV crashes)
- Oh my god.

837
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,040
- Delivery successful.
- It's in the box.

838
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
(Paddy chuckling)
- What was that?

839
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,000
- [Paddy] And pulling up to the final drop

840
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,040
with a couple of penalties against him...

841
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,600
- Loving those ratchet straps.

842
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,600
- [Paddy] Stealing the
delivery driver top spot

843
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,600
would need every ounce of
that trademark FredEx pace.

844
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,880
- [Sat Nav] Delivery successful.

845
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,880
(suspenseful music)

846
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,000
- Here we go.
- Look at his face.

847
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,960
(dog barking)
- I've got this.

848
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I've got it.

849
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,040
(dog snarling)
Oh no.

850
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Oh, you win, you win.

851
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
(Chris laughing)

852
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,080
Look, you win.

853
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,920
Good boy.

854
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Good boy.

855
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,200
(audience applauding)

856
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,400
- I'm not happy about this.

857
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
No, I'm not happy about this.
- It's okay.

858
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,080
- No, I'm not.
- You wouldn't do it again.

859
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,840
- You gotta know.
(Freddie laughing)

860
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,520
You gotta know.

861
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,480
So I know the question on everyone's lips-

862
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,480
- Have we totally lost our minds?

863
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,880
- Not that, no.
(audience laughing)

864
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,520
Who takes the delivery
driver bragging rights?

865
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,760
Did FredEx manage to beat Postman Pad?

866
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,640
Well, I've got the results here, folks.

867
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,520
(audience applauding)

868
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,360
- No. (chuckles)

869
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,640
- No, we can forget Purple Sector.

870
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,560
You are a nightmare.

871
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,560
You out of the running.

872
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
We know that.
(audience laughing)

873
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,080
It's down to me and you, Fred.

874
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,560
Right, I've got the times here.

875
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,360
I managed five minutes, 51
seconds with no missed drops.

876
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

877
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,120
(audience applauding)

878
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,320
Fred, you managed four
minutes, 47 seconds,

879
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
but two missed drops.
- Ooh.

880
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,240
- What does that mean?

881
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,560
what does that mean?

882
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,560
- Resulting in a time
of also five minutes,

883
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,280
27 seconds.

884
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,680
FredEx delivers.

885
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,400
(audience applauding)

886
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,640
- Thank you.

887
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,480
Thank you, Pad.

888
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,720
Thank you, Postman.

889
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,560
Thank you.

890
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,000
- I'm sorry, stop it.
- It's fine, it's fine.

891
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,360
- This is absolutely outrageous.

892
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,920
Half your packages were destroyed.

893
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,880
- Exactly, only half.

894
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,880
Big delivery companies
could learn a thing or two

895
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,560
from my care and attention.

896
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,880
- So what have we learned here?

897
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,720
- If you want a cheap van to
deliver very small packages,

898
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,600
and you're not too fussed if
they get there in one piece,

899
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,920
get yourself an Astra.

900
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,720
- And the most important lesson.

901
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,680
Taxidermy cats, utterly terrifying.

902
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,600
Stuff of nightmares.
- Yes, horrendous.

903
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,320
- Whoa.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

904
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,760
- Don't you ever, ever
speak about Jess like that.

905
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,200
- Oh. (laughs)
(audience laughing)

906
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,640
Right, that is not right.

907
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,160
That is not right.

908
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,200
- She has got feelings.

909
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,840
(Freddie laughs)

910
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,200
Go on, Jess, run free.

911
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
(Paddy and Freddie laughing)

912
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,880
(audience applauding)

913
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,280
Anyhow, we've got to move on to something

914
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,640
a little less weird,

915
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,960
because to end this series,

916
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,160
we're taking on our
biggest challenge today.

917
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,560
We're gonna give you some advice

918
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,160
that's actually useful in the real world.

919
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,120
- Easy, Pad, don't scare the horses.

920
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
- Chris, take it away.

921
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,560
- Family cars.

922
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
There's hundreds out there to choose from.

923
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,280
But if you're in the market for a new one,

924
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,640
how do you even start to make a choice?

925
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,200
- Well, fear you not because
"Top Gear" is here to help.

926
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,720
(wind rustling)
(birds chirping)

927
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,880
(airy orchestral music)

928
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,160
Nowadays, when it comes to family cars,

929
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,400
the range of options out
there is frankly baffling.

930
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,120
From your practical,
battery-powered spaceships,

931
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
like the Kia EV6.

932
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
- Here we go.

933
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,600
- [Paddy] To seven-seat
Dacia people-carriers

934
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,880
that cost less than
your average supermini.

935
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,440
All this room for 16 grand.

936
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,480
I mean, crikey, there
are even estate cars,

937
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,640
like this Alpina B3,

938
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,760
solely designed for families
that prefer to arrive sideways.

939
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,520
(brakes screeching)

940
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,760
There she goes. (laughs)

941
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,320
It just brings out your inner child.

942
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,520
The point is,

943
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,080
there are now more to choose
from than ever before.

944
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,880
So with the producers helping to gather

945
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,200
a 50-strong assortment

946
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,400
of the newest, most interesting,

947
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
and best-selling examples on the market.

948
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,200
- [Freddie] That's a lot of family cars.

949
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
- [Paddy] Our job is to find you

950
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,320
the best of the lot.

951
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,880
- [Chris] Suits you, sir.

952
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
- Oh, look at this.

953
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,680
Family cars for every
taste, every occasion.

954
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,520
- [Chris] That's what it says.

955
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,560
A bit of a mixed bag, isn't there?

956
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,160
- It is a mixed bag.
- I'm gonna go for a rootle.

957
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
- A rootle?
- Ooh, I like that.

958
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,680
- Right, where we going here?

959
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,600
Where are we going?

960
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,400
- I've seen where I'm going straight away.

961
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,960
I've had a couple of these over the years.

962
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,000
They're not the cheapest of things.

963
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,840
But I tell you what,

964
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,760
Loads of space, loads of room in the back.

965
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,480
You can throw all the kids in.

966
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,480
They can kick the seats.

967
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,640
They can do what they want.

968
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,480
It's fine.

969
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,000
It's a Disco.

970
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,040
- Look at this little Peugeot thing here.

971
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,840
Look at that.

972
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
That's a great-looking car.

973
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,480
508 with three yellow lines,

974
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,680
which must denote some sportiness.

975
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,480
- [Freddie] This is
bordering on midlife crisis.

976
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
- It is.
- But you get your family in.

977
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I like it. (laughs)

978
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,800
- So do I.

979
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,000
- How much is it?
- It's 56 grand.

980
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,080
- Stop it.
- 56 grand for a Peugeot.

981
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,040
- All right, let's have a look.

982
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,600
What else have we got here?

983
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,600
Here we go.

984
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,440
- Can we just stop and say how
good Kias look at the moment?

985
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,640
- I've always been a fan of the Kia.

986
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,200
- [Chris] But these were
a joke 15 years ago.

987
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Now they look better than
all the German stuff.

988
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,680
- Now I'm just speaking for the dads now.

989
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,640
Every dad wants to rock up at school,

990
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,480
knowing they can absolutely

991
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,200
blast the back doors off anything.

992
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,960
That sounds wrong, but
you know what I mean.

993
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,600
And this is what we've
got with the old M5 Comp.

994
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,240
But when you get inside
it, not very practical.

995
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,440
Cup holders are quite small.

996
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,640
Side bin's tiny.

997
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,200
- [Chris] Oldest family
car maker, Vauxhall.

998
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,800
- What's the family, the Borrowers?

999
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,760
(Chris laughs)

1000
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,320
Where do you put your family in that?

1001
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,280
- Here we go.

1002
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,240
I mean, just look at the storage in here.

1003
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Look at that.

1004
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120
- Come on, this is all you need.

1005
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,480
It's massive, it's comfortable.

1006
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,320
- It is.

1007
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,840
And I know it's a Volvo,
but it does nothing for me.

1008
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,520
(Paddy sighs)

1009
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
- That's what you want.

1010
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,080
- We gotta do something about this.

1011
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,920
There's too many cars here.

1012
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,080
- Where'd you go with it?
- I don't know.

1013
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,320
Pad?

1014
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
- There's something very reassuring

1015
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,320
about the knobs on a Volvo.
- Don't do that.

1016
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,440
- Just lovely action on them.
- Don't do that. (chuckles)

1017
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,600
- Everything's good in the world.

1018
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,400
You get in a Volvo,

1019
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,720
you get out and you go,
"Actually, we're all right."

1020
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,920
- Right, we got too many cars here.

1021
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,320
We need to find a way of removing some.

1022
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,640
We need to get some perspective, okay?

1023
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,520
- [Paddy] Huh?

1024
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,280
- [Chris] We need to get some
height on it, over there.

1025
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,480
- Height?
- Straight to the point.

1026
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,640
- Chris Harris, what do you know?

1027
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,480
(crane whirring)

1028
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,720
Chris, what are we doing up here?

1029
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,080
- We're about to do some whittling.

1030
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Not woodwork, either.

1031
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,000
Right, so the starting
point here surely has to be

1032
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,760
anything over 40 grand's gotta go

1033
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,040
because that's not an
affordable family car

1034
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,480
that can be used most of the time, is it?

1035
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,480
- 40 grand?
- But for the price of cars,

1036
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,240
that's gonna be a lot of cars.
- Yeah.

1037
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,640
- Also, 40 grand is when the posh car tax,

1038
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,280
the premium car tax comes in.

1039
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,120
- Cost of living crisis,
gotta think practical.

1040
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,960
Stand back.
- Yeah.

1041
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,000
- Right, get rid of the 40 grand-plus's.

1042
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,600
Are you okay?

1043
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,480
- Whoa! (beep)

1044
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,280
(Freddie and Paddy laughing)

1045
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,360
(upbeat music)

1046
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
- Oh, the Taycan's gone.
- Oh, wow, Exodus.

1047
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,040
- Giulia's gone, one Rover.
- Oh.

1048
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,160
- There's the M5, Chris.
- Oh.

1049
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,240
- Wave a goodbye kiss.
- Oh no.

1050
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,240
- It's like a giant game
of "Guess Who?" isn't it?

1051
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,120
- It is.

1052
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,440
It is like "Guess Who?"
- Just drive off.

1053
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,240
- In an important copyright sense,

1054
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,920
it's quite unlike "Guess Who?"

1055
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,760
you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1056
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,360
Yeah, it is, yeah.
- Certainly.

1057
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,200
Right, okay.

1058
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
- Now, I gotta be honest,

1059
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,720
I do love a whittle.
- You do?

1060
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,560
- (laughs) You're a whittler.

1061
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,480
- I love a whittle.
(Freddie laughs)

1062
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
Can I have a go at it?
- Yes.

1063
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,600
- I'm getting into it now.
- Yes.

1064
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,440
- All right.

1065
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,160
I love this.

1066
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,560
Honda Jazz, that's gone.

1067
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,400
- [Freddie] What?

1068
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,520
- What criteria are you using
to get rid of the Honda Jazz?

1069
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,960
- I just hate it.

1070
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,640
- You can't get rid of
cars 'cause you hate them.

1071
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,040
It's not how it works.

1072
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,680
- Hatering's not a category, hatering?

1073
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,560
- No, no it's not.

1074
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,760
- Well, I'll tell you what, then.

1075
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,720
Real-world running costs.

1076
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
- Yes.
- It's all about the MPG.

1077
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,640
- Yep.
- You're a family.

1078
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,000
Petrol prices, diesel prices,
they're through the roof.

1079
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,840
Gotta keep them down.

1080
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,680
So I'm looking minimum
50 miles per gallon.

1081
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
- What about electric?

1082
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,280
- Yeah, that's a good point.

1083
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,080
- By definition,

1084
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,000
it has to be more efficient.
- Exactly, electric can stay.

1085
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,400
- So anything over 50 MPG
and electric can stay.

1086
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,520
- Electric's staying?
- Okay.

1087
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,920
- Electric's staying, yeah.
- Okay, got you.

1088
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
- Right, okay.
- Got them?

1089
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,600
- Anything under 50 miles
to the gallon can go.

1090
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,560
(upbeat music)

1091
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,600
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Whoa.

1092
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,840
- The Dacia Jogger's gone.
- The Jogger's gone?

1093
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,880
- Goodbye, the Jogger.
- Why's the jogger gone?

1094
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,480
- 50 MPG.
- Disco's gone.

1095
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,400
Disco's a great family car.

1096
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,280
- Ooh, ooh.
- Another Honda gone.

1097
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,120
- Aw.
- That's a surprise.

1098
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,000
- [Paddy] So the Jazz has stayed,

1099
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,440
but that Honda, the CR-V's gone.

1100
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,800
- [Freddie] You can't get rid
of that Jazz, Pad. (laughs)

1101
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,600
- Wrong Honda.

1102
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,040
- Oh.
- I want that Berlingo gone,

1103
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,640
but I think it's staying.
- Yeah.

1104
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
- The Berlingo's gonna be
here for the whole day.

1105
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,840
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

1106
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,720
That is some very strong culling.

1107
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,640
But now over to Fred.

1108
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,600
What is your whittle?

1109
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
- Now I need space, not just for myself.

1110
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,800
Kids' cricket bags, I need boot space.

1111
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm gonna say anything under
500-liters boot space is off.

1112
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
- [Chris] But that is a harsh cull.

1113
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,760
- Anything under 500-liters boot space,

1114
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,000
hit the road, Jack.

1115
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,840
Come on, Jazz.

1116
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,040
- Yes! (laughs)
- It's gone.

1117
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,520
- Get out of here.
- Oh.

1118
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,680
Where are they all going?
- Wow.

1119
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,800
- Ooh, dear me.

1120
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,200
- [Paddy] You have decimated

1121
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,320
the field there, Andrew. (whistles)

1122
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,720
- When I whittle, Chris, it this whittle.

1123
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,000
- Complete carnage.
- And, well,

1124
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,320
science has spoken gentlemen.

1125
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,920
We are not left with much.

1126
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,880
(jazzy music)

1127
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,880
- [Freddie] What we are left with, though,

1128
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,680
are nine very tidy options.

1129
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,800
From the ever-popular Nissan Qashqai,

1130
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,080
to the clue's-in-the-title Skoda Superb,

1131
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,640
or even the much-harder-to-love
Citroen Berlingo.

1132
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,320
These are all cars with a
generous amount of boot space

1133
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,120
that start at less than 40 grand,

1134
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,160
and a spec that'll do north
of 50 miles to the gallon.

1135
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,000
But we're not done yet.

1136
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,640
(suspenseful music)

1137
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,800
Because to whittle it down some more,

1138
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,920
I'd come up with a drag
race with a difference.

1139
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,640
- [Chris] Fred, why are you so
much further forward than me?

1140
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,360
- Because this, Christopher,
is a price handicap.

1141
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,680
The cheapest car at the front.

1142
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,760
The more expensive the car,
the further back you start.

1143
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,240
- Did you choose the car you're in?

1144
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,720
- [Freddie] No, this car chose me.

1145
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,560
(Chris laughing)

1146
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,480
- [Paddy] Yes, in a surprise to us all,

1147
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,280
Flintoff had come up
with a rather elegant way

1148
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,200
of testing which of
our nine remaining cars

1149
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,200
represent the best balance
of price and performance.

1150
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,360
A half-mile drag race

1151
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,120
where the most expensive
contender is tested,

1152
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,640
the Skoda Enyaq iV
would start at the back.

1153
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,760
The rest of the field then
receiving a 10-meter headstart

1154
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,720
for every thousand
pounds cheaper they cost.

1155
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,880
Last three to cross the
line are eliminated.

1156
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,960
(suspenseful music)

1157
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,840
(engine roaring)

1158
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
Three, two, one, go.

1159
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,240
Whoa.

1160
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,080
There we go.

1161
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,520
The Arkana's off.

1162
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
- Go on, the Hyundai.

1163
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,720
Bye-bye, Superb.

1164
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,760
- I'll be screaming past them.

1165
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,280
- Go, go, nothing at me.

1166
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,080
- Done the Skoda.

1167
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,360
- So I'm going backwards here.

1168
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,400
This is just a day out.

1169
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,240
Paddy's gone.

1170
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,040
- There's Flintoff. (laughs)

1171
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,680
Wowzers, this thing flies.

1172
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,480
- Oh, the Berlingo, that is embarrassing.

1173
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,720
I've been passed by a Berlingo and Harris

1174
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,800
on the outside in the Skoda.

1175
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,320
- We've got the Renault.

1176
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,640
- Come on, we're over the line.

1177
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Doom the Qashi.

1178
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,760
(cars zooming)

1179
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,640
Doom the Qashi.

1180
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,240
Go on.

1181
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,480
- [Chris] Third, we'll take third.

1182
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,840
- [Freddie] Not last.

1183
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,800
I started at the front, I'm last.

1184
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,240
- A nice victory there for the Tucson.

1185
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,560
- This thing's got some
heart, I'm telling you.

1186
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,200
- I've gotta say, the
Arkana just doesn't go.

1187
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,360
By the time I get the
lads to cricket in this,

1188
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,040
we'd have Blair turnovers.

1189
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,200
(Chris laughing)

1190
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,080
(upbeat music)

1191
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,920
So the bang-for-your-buck drag race

1192
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,160
had eliminated the electric Skoda Enyaq,

1193
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,480
the Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace,

1194
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,840
and the Renault Arkana.

1195
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,240
Now we needed to get six down to three.

1196
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,600
And with the pack so tightly matched,

1197
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,920
the only way to do that was by unleashing

1198
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,920
the motoring journalist
- Hi, lads.

1199
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,880
- Oh, god, he's got clipboards.

1200
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
- [Freddie] He's got three of them.

1201
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,880
- Let's get down to the
nitty-gritty of car testing.

1202
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,000
This is the real stuff.

1203
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,760
- All right.
- Okay.

1204
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,560
- Clipboard each.
- Thank you.

1205
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,280
- Always leave the pen under there

1206
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,600
with the nib at the bottom.

1207
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,920
- Oh god.
- Better access.

1208
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,200
- Okay.
- Right, here we go.

1209
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,080
Legroom.

1210
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,920
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1211
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,200
- Oh. I'd say the-
- I need legroom.

1212
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
- Exactly, we've got the
perfect dummy for this.

1213
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,120
- Yes.
- Okay?

1214
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,040
- So I'm a dummy?
- I'd say standard

1215
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,200
legroom test should be a Flintoff
sitting behind a Flintoff.

1216
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,640
Would you agree?
- I like that.

1217
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,480
I like that.
- Okay.

1218
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay, the Skoda Superb
is known to be a leader

1219
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
in this field.
- Ooh.

1220
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,320
- I don't like the way
you're holding that.

1221
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,160
That is too low.

1222
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,840
I want it here and I want it here.

1223
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,680
- That's where I go.
- Right.

1224
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
Now, out you come, Mr. Flintoff, please.

1225
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,880
In the back now.

1226
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,960
Okay, not every family comes from

1227
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,240
the Flintoff end of the gene pool.

1228
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,400
- Kids 6'4", 6'3".

1229
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,560
- [Chris] But we all know legroom is key

1230
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
to a happy backseat.

1231
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,400
- [Paddy] Are you comfortable?

1232
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
- [Freddie] Tell you what,
that's not bad, that.

1233
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,240
That's all right, that.

1234
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,160
- That is dead impressive, Andrew.

1235
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,000
- Do you know what?

1236
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,600
Even head room's fine.
- That is four.

1237
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,400
- I'll give them that.
- Four points.

1238
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,320
And you'd be surprised how
often the posher badges

1239
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,120
trade this crucial detail
for sleeker styling.

1240
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,360
- I'm just...

1241
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,160
I can't...

1242
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,200
No, I can't get in it.
- Come on, get in.

1243
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,040
- No, I can't, look.

1244
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,800
- In we go, right.
- Yeah.

1245
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,360
- How far could you travel like that?

1246
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,600
- [Freddie] I don't wanna
travel anywhere like this.

1247
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,480
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1248
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,400
- There's headroom, no legroom.

1249
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,840
- That's not really working, is it?

1250
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,320
- Not a chance.

1251
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
- [Freddie] Not a chance.

1252
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,400
Next on Harris's clipboard of truth

1253
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,840
was that great leveller,
Isofix child seats.

1254
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
- Let's choose this little
Skoda here, the Octavia.

1255
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,000
- [Freddie] I'm on my
fourth kid with these.

1256
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,480
- It's great, you're in.
- I'm in?

1257
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,680
- You know, that's the
easiest one I've ever put in.

1258
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,600
- Is it?
- Oh, let's get a five

1259
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,960
on that.
- Seriously, bar none.

1260
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,400
- Get a five on that.

1261
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,520
Now do you want us to pop one
of them in the driving seat

1262
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,800
for future challenges?

1263
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,720
- There's no need for that at all.

1264
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,720
Right, next car.

1265
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,920
- [Freddie] With the Octavia
taking the Isofix top spot,

1266
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,240
second place went to the
mercurial Audi Q3 Sportback.

1267
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,160
- I'm straight in there.

1268
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I'm already at the McDonald's drive-thru

1269
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,760
buying a kid's meal right now.

1270
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
My children are so happy.

1271
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,520
- [Freddie] And rounding
out the top three,

1272
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,920
our drag race winner, the Hyundai Tucson.

1273
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,080
- Here it is.
- Go on, then.

1274
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,080
- [Paddy] There she goes.

1275
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,320
- [Freddie] Closing in
on the big decision,

1276
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,960
Harris had one more trick up his clipboard

1277
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,600
to get us over the line.

1278
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,240
- This is arguably the most
important test of the lot,

1279
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,760
starting with the Qashqai.

1280
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,360
Okay, you're in a car park.

1281
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,600
You try and get your mobile
phone out of your pocket

1282
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,400
and you drop it between the seat

1283
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
and centre console.
- Oh, no, you don't.

1284
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,760
- You now have to show us
how easy or difficult it is

1285
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,720
to retrieve that phone.

1286
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,640
This is critical to all car purchases.

1287
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,480
Ready?

1288
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,320
Three, two, one, and go, Andrew.

1289
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,840
Show us what you can do.

1290
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,640
- Retrieved.

1291
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,560
- That's incredible.

1292
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,080
For a hand that size in a car like this,

1293
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,720
I think that's superb.

1294
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,560
- Oh, look at this.
- Are you ready, Chris?

1295
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,640
- [Chris] Yep, let's go.

1296
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,040
- [Freddie] This isn't too easy.

1297
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,440
- [Paddy] I've gotta say
the Berlingo's a five.

1298
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,760
- It's a five.
- On the strength of that,

1299
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,760
would you buy a Berlingo?

1300
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,600
- Yes.

1301
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,480
Here we go.

1302
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,320
Ready?

1303
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,480
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?

1304
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,560
- Yeah.

1305
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,680
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

1306
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,880
You've done me there.

1307
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,040
- I'm known to be fingers.

1308
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,520
- Oh my god.
- It's gone now.

1309
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,960
- No.
- Oh, it's a nightmare.

1310
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,960
It's a nightmare.
- That's a one.

1311
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,240
- Oh, no.
- That's a one.

1312
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,680
- Zero.
- Zero, mark it down.

1313
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,920
- Zero.
- No, no, no, no.

1314
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,720
- Paddy, you can keep the form.

1315
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,400
- Geez, I can't even get my hand back.

1316
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
Is that in there?

1317
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,160
- Chaps?
- Yeah.

1318
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,840
- Science is over.
- Mm.

1319
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,840
- Okay, we've now gotta whittle
down to the final three.

1320
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,080
Are we in agreement

1321
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,480
that the Hyundai is in the
top three for all of us?

1322
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

1323
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,520
- So that goes through.
- Done.

1324
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,800
- The Skoda Octavia is in my top three.

1325
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,880
Is it in yours?

1326
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,720
- Yes.

1327
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,560
- [Chris] Is it in yours?

1328
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,560
- Yes.

1329
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
- Ooh, this is fantastic.

1330
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,560
This is what happens-
- It's good.

1331
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,400
- I think we're gonna struggle now.

1332
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,880
We've got a Skoda in already,
so we don't need two.

1333
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,160
- [Paddy] Can I throw a curve ball in?

1334
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,000
- Yeah.
- Go on.

1335
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,800
- Berlingo.

1336
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,640
- Why?
- Get in the-

1337
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,480
- Hear me out, hear me out.
- Okay, go on.

1338
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,960
- It's the only car
we've got that's full EV.

1339
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,000
- Yeah.
- That's important.

1340
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,840
That's important.

1341
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,440
- The phone test, five out of five.

1342
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,960
These are the ones where when
you're in a car with the kids,

1343
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,480
them are the problems you have.

1344
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,720
- That is a strong argument.

1345
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,240
- Loads of boot space.
- I'll give you the

1346
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,760
practicality.
- Yep.

1347
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,720
- All over it.
- Yep.

1348
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,840
Also, we've not mentioned this.

1349
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,720
- Sliding door.
- Wonderful, practical.

1350
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,560
- I know.

1351
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,160
Okay, I'm gonna go with McGuinness.

1352
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,640
The Berlingo stays in.

1353
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,600
It's the quirky choice.
- Right.

1354
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1355
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,280
- So we've got them.

1356
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,560
We've got our three.

1357
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,360
- Science, science.

1358
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,600
(upbeat music)

1359
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,960
- [Chris] Now that, ladies and gentlemen,

1360
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
is how you use a clipboard.

1361
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,440
Because whether it's
the perfectly practical

1362
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,920
diesel Skoda Octavia estate,

1363
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,880
the really rather handsome
hybrid Hyundai Tucson,

1364
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,840
or the staggeringly
spacious Citroen e-Berlingo,

1365
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,480
pick one of these for your next family car

1366
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,560
and you won't be disappointed.

1367
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,000
But we tasked ourselves
with picking a winner.

1368
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,040
And to do that,

1369
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,760
McGuinness reckoned he'd
come up with the ideal test.

1370
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,160
- So the last one, real-world experience.

1371
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,480
Life on the road with
your family in the car.

1372
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,560
That's the next test.

1373
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,080
- What's that test?

1374
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,360
- Glad you asked.

1375
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,720
It's a classic seat-switch race.

1376
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,280
We're gonna set up from here.

1377
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,680
You've got a stopwatch, start that.

1378
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,160
I'm gonna go around to
the little box over there,

1379
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,840
I'm gonna stop in the box,

1380
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,240
then we're gonna swap round,
in the car, anti-clockwise.

1381
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,240
Me, you, you here.

1382
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,640
Then you set off driving

1383
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,600
all the way back around
over the finish line,

1384
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,680
stop the watch.

1385
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,040
- How often does the child

1386
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,560
come from the back and drive the car?

1387
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,160
- Well, every time when Pad's driving.

1388
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,000
- Correct.

1389
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,960
It's the easiest way.

1390
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,320
You can have a beer then, can't you?

1391
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,160
(Freddie laughing)

1392
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,160
Right, come on, kids.

1393
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,600
Great.
- Ready?

1394
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,880
- Three, two, one, go.
- Let's go.

1395
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,880
(upbeat music)

1396
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,200
- [Paddy] Let's face it,

1397
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,560
the very best family journeys

1398
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,920
are the ones that are over and done with

1399
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
as fast as possible.

1400
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,120
- Could go to this thing,

1401
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,480
doesn't it?
- Oh, wow, yes.

1402
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,320
That's all right, that.

1403
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,000
- [Paddy] And to keep
the peace along the way,

1404
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,200
you really need as much room
for everyone as you can get.

1405
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,160
- Paddy.
- Switch it.

1406
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,040
- Swap, go.
- I don't like this at all.

1407
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,880
- You come back here.

1408
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,120
You come back here.
(Chris laughing)

1409
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,360
You're too big and you tickle people.

1410
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,200
- Don't do that.
- Let's do that.

1411
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
- Don't do that.
- Grab my foot. (laughs)

1412
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,440
Grab my foot.
- Ow. (laughs)

1413
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,680
Ow.
- Okay, come on. (laughs)

1414
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,000
What if you've got my foot?
- Ah.

1415
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,520
- Actually got my other one.
- Hang on, the seatbelt.

1416
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,120
- Oh.
- Whoa, that's quick.

1417
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,960
- [Chris] There she goes.

1418
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,760
- [Paddy] And that's why
when it comes to finding

1419
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,640
the ultimate family car...

1420
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,600
She's lively.

1421
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,320
She really is the quickest of the lot.

1422
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,960
You want to be looking
out for that magic place

1423
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,560
where space meets pace.

1424
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,320
- You better get in that.
- Oh no.

1425
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,520
- Oh my god, here we go.
- Oh, stop.

1426
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,000
- I'm a child, I'm a child.
- Oh. (laughing)

1427
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,440
- Stop it, stop it.
- I like you down there.

1428
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,640
- [Chris] Here we go.

1429
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,240
Quick.

1430
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,080
Stop.

1431
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,960
(stopwatch beeps)

1432
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,920
What's the time?

1433
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,240
- 1:34:16.
- Ooh.

1434
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,320
- Tell you what, I am mighty
impressed by this thing.

1435
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,200
At just over a minute 1/2 to get round,

1436
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,280
the hybrid Tucson had laid
down a serious benchmark.

1437
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,880
The only question now was,

1438
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,440
could it be beaten by the e-Berlingo?

1439
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,920
- Three, two, one.

1440
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,760
(stopwatch beeps)

1441
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,120
- Ooh.
- Oh, it's flat on then.

1442
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,520
- What's going, Fred?

1443
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,560
- Flat on.
- Let it go.

1444
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,640
Or the Octavia.

1445
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,120
- Go.
(stopwatch beeps)

1446
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,120
- Stalled at the line.
- Oh, you think so?

1447
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,600
(rock music)

1448
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,880
- [Freddie] Oh, it's a roller, isn't it?

1449
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,680
Oh.

1450
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,400
- It's anything but a roller.

1451
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,560
- Oh, oh.
- Oh.

1452
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,480
- Use all the track,

1453
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,320
get her out there.
- All right,

1454
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
well, we're gonna get
a little nibble there.

1455
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,320
- Get her out there.

1456
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,480
Get her out there.

1457
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,720
(suspenseful music)

1458
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
- Right, now can you stop in the box.

1459
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,600
- I like it.
- Ah.

1460
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,280
- We can walk around this car.

1461
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,120
- I'm not sure about this.

1462
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,200
We're about to get into it.

1463
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,160
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

1464
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,200
- Oh, I missed it.
- Oh, you missed the box,

1465
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,920
you idiot.
- You missed it.

1466
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,320
(elegant orchestral music)

1467
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,480
- I'm gonna gonna come back to you.

1468
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,480
I'm gonna come back to you.
- That's not a problem.

1469
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,320
- Come on, get in there.
- Look at that.

1470
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,160
- I'll just move over.
- There we go, Pad.

1471
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,920
- That is just quality.
- There we go.

1472
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,240
- That is lovely stuff.
- May we, may we.

1473
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,080
- That is.

1474
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,680
That's a demonstration of
the Berlingo's real talent.

1475
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,480
- Move over.
- You go first, you go first.

1476
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,480
- I'll move over.
(Paddy laughing)

1477
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,960
- Get off.
- Come on, son.

1478
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,760
(Freddie and Paddy laughing)

1479
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,440
(upbeat music)

1480
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,080
No, no. (laughs)
- Ah, no. (laughs)

1481
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,560
- Oh, my undies have gone.

1482
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,720
Oh, my undies have gone. (laughs)

1483
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,080
(car horn blaring)

1484
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,000
No, look.

1485
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,760
Look at my undies.
(Paddy laughing)

1486
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,880
You don't do that to your kids.

1487
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,000
We're off.

1488
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,960
(upbeat music)

1489
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,760
- [Paddy] After a very
revealing seat swap...

1490
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,800
- I'm not even bothered now.

1491
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,160
I've got my pants around my ankles.

1492
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,440
Look where my pants are.

1493
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,280
- [Paddy] It was now just
a short sprint to the line.

1494
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,120
- Come on.

1495
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
- Berlingo, go, go.

1496
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,120
- [Paddy] To discover
which of our finalists

1497
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,800
would take family car glory.

1498
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,080
(stopwatch beeps)

1499
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,560
(Chris sighs)
(Paddy groans)

1500
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,440
- He has flesh on that seat.

1501
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,080
(orchestral music)

1502
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,680
And with a time of one minute 41,

1503
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,560
and just over two minutes respectively,

1504
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,880
neither the palatial but
ponderous e-Berlingo,

1505
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,800
nor the speedy but snug Octavia estate

1506
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,560
had quite done enough

1507
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,920
to knock the perfectly-pitched
Tucson hybrid

1508
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
off the top spot.

1509
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,200
Which meant, after what
can only be described

1510
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,360
as a pretty rigorous day's testing...

1511
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,440
- Look at his.
(Paddy laughing)

1512
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,480
Look. (laughs)

1513
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,600
- No, it's not funny.
- Oh.

1514
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,320
- [Paddy] In the end, there
could be only one conclusion.

1515
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,760
- That Hyundai is the best car.

1516
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,200
- Yeah, that's what science says.

1517
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,160
- You wouldn't have anything else.

1518
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,400
- Yep, exactly.
- For that money,

1519
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,640
with those criteria.
- Yeah.

1520
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,120
Is that how you did it on Auto Car?

1521
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,400
- Not quite, no.

1522
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,920
(grand orchestral music)

1523
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,840
(audience applauding)

1524
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,920
- That was a very good car.
- Very, very good.

1525
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
- Love it, love it.

1526
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,440
- No complaints.

1527
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,440
No complaints.

1528
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,720
- I'll admit, a wrestling
match in the back of a Hyundai,

1529
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,240
it's not the most conventional way

1530
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,160
to decide between a bunch of family cars.

1531
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,960
(audience laughing)

1532
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,880
But I think we all agree on this one.

1533
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,240
We actually came up with the right answer.

1534
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,400
The car we'd recommend
is the Hyundai Tucson.

1535
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,800
(audience applauding)

1536
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,640
- So I tell you what,

1537
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,160
we may be mavericks, but we get results.

1538
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,000
- Correct.

1539
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,880
It's a very good car.

1540
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,920
And it's further evidence

1541
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,840
that Hyundai is smashing it at the moment,

1542
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,720
making proper hot hatches,
interesting electric cars,

1543
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,240
worthy family cars.

1544
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,200
They're on a roll.

1545
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,040
- Well, what a way to sign off.

1546
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,560
Because that's the end of
the show, and the series.

1547
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,560
- [Audience] Aw.

1548
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,640
- But we'll see you all next year.

1549
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,840
- [Audience] Yay.

1550
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,640
- Thanks a bunch for watching.

1551
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,560
Goodnight.
(audience applauding)

1552
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,640
(upbeat rock music)

1553
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,480
(upbeat rock music continues)

1554
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,200
(upbeat rock music continues)

1555
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,560
(no audio)
