1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,999
Hello and welcome to Top Gear, where
tonight us three are putting

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,599
our bodies on the line in the name
of research.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,199
Chris Harris pops on the old
fireproof pants for a wrestle

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,839
with Mercedes' new F1 car
for the road,

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,359
Freddie Flintoff straps
on the old crash helmet as he takes

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,879
on motorsport's answer to cage
fighting,

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,319
and I slip on the old smoking jacket
and slippers for a waft

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,199
around in the super swanky
new Range Rover.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,359
Taking one for the team,
there, Pad. Selfless, Fred.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,959
But we kick off by talking
about good intentions.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,639
Explain, Christopher.

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,559
So, you know sometimes, maybe late
in an evening after a small shandy,

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,439
you make a rash promise to do
something important and worthy,

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,759
like join the gym.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,839
Or reading Paddy's autobiography
forced on you six months ago.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,359
Keep it, Fred.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,879
Still plenty left.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Whey!

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,039
No likey, no likey.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,799
Exactly. Fascinating!

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,719
You wake up in the morning
and think,

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,919
"What have I got myself into here?"

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,520
Well, Mercedes knows the feeling.

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,959
Five years ago, Mercedes
announced it was going to do

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,479
something properly exciting -

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,919
take the engine from Lewis
Hamilton's Formula 1 car,

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
and put it into a road car.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,079
A great idea but, as Merc quickly
found out,

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,519
almost impossible to actually
achieve.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,239
The project's been a bit
of a disaster.

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,559
Years have gone by,

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,319
deadlines came and went,

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,519
CEOs were shown the door
and then everything went quiet.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,479
Until recently, when Mercedes phoned
and said,

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,039
"Remember that road car
we put Lewis's F1 engine in?

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,960
"Well, it's finished."

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,840
Here at long last is the AMG One.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,279
Fashionably late to the tune
of three years.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,839
This is Â£2.5 million worth
of Mercedes F1 know-how

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,240
poured into a car that you can
legally drive on the road.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,399
Ooh...

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,279
The car that many thought would
never happen is finally here.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,479
Wow!

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,399
And the only question now
is,

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
"What on earth is it
like from behind the wheel?"

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
So I've just started off in full
electric mode.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,880
Here we go.
Going out on the track.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,679
In a car with a modern...

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,439
ENGINE ROARS

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,760
There's the engine.

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,719
Tell you what, it's noisy in here.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,599
Much noisier inside than outside.

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,359
ENGINE ROARS

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,359
There it goes.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,399
Just keeps revving.

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,159
ENGINE REVS

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,920
The noise is sensational.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,840
It's a mighty, mighty experience.

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,399
F1 rules state that teams can only
use 1.6 litre V6 engines,

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,039
so that's what's sitting
at the heart of the AMG One -

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,360
a V6 engine that can spin
up to a stratospheric 11,000 RPM.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,679
So I have about 560 horsepower
from the engine

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,719
and the rest, which adds up to over
1,000 horsepower,

64
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,800
is coming from electric motors.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,719
0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds, top speed
219 mph.

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,479
They sound enormous numbers,
don't they?

67
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,279
But, of course, that's not
much quicker than some

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,599
high-end supercars.

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,559
The One hasn't been conceived
to sit at the top of a deck

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,359
of Top Trumps, though.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,280
Think of it instead as a challenge.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,119
With the AMG One you actually have
five motors.

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,719
You've got that internal
combustion engine - that's a motor.

74
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,719
Two motors on the front wheels and a
motor coming off the crank as well.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,079
And the fifth one's actually
in the turbocharger to help

76
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,000
it reduce lag.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,119
Putting all of this together
is pretty much

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
automotive Everest, an engineering
mountain so great

79
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,160
that Mercedes engineers
just had to see if they could.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,319
It's not like anything I've
driven before.

81
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,680
ENGINE ROARS

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,319
CAR POWERS DOWN

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,479
So the power just stopped,

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,760
the engine stopped and then just
restarted itself.

85
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,879
Assuming Mercedes engineers
weren't intending unexpected

86
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,759
pit stops to be part of the owner
experience, the early signs

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,399
were that there was still a bit
of mountain left to climb.

88
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
So the problem was twice, during
full braking

89
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,479
when I was on a downshift
and the revs went high,

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,279
the auto blip would blip the
throttle

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,559
and then the engine
would just cut.

92
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,439
Quite why the engine is cutting out
under braking

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,640
turns out to be a tricky problem to
diagnose.

94
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,639
So much so, in fact, that Mercedes
wheels out a second car to get us

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,120
back up and running.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
So where were we?

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,639
Racing cars have to comply
with a million regulations,

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,479
but road cars, well, they have to
comply with a million

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,839
totally different regulations.

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,279
Put the two together,

101
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,759
this must be the most complicated
road car ever made.

102
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,239
No wonder it's having some
teething problems now.

103
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,719
The chassis is the bit that
I'm finding a little bit

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,719
tricky at the moment.

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,319
Whatever I do, I've got
this understeer.

106
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,440
I can't really get rid of it.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,879
And the bigger problem is,
while they've been trying to get

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,879
it all working out on track, you get
the feeling Mercedes hasn't

109
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,039
had the chance to sort all the other
stuff

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,320
that makes a road car liveable.

111
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,679
The noise, again I come back to it,

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,839
it's so extreme
I've actually put some earplugs in.

113
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,599
I'm just bolted straight
to the chassis and the engine's

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,039
bolted to that, so I'm kind of
connected to the vehicle in a way

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,959
you aren't in most supercars.

116
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,759
The steering wheel is a strange
shape,

117
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,639
the seating position, I'm not so
sure, really.

118
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,239
The seat is fixed, the pedals move,

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,119
but someone tall is going
to struggle in this thing,

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,360
and the seat, there's not much
support kind of moving around it in.

121
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,959
How do you maintain a Formula 1
engine on the road?

122
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,079
Well, Mercedes are saying
that you'll need

123
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,319
an engine rebuild every 30,000
miles.

124
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,319
Doesn't seem unreasonable,

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,200
but it will cost you Â£700,000.

126
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,880
Or at least it will
if you get that far.

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,439
Oh, right. Well, the aero limit is
now coming on,

128
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,240
so it just stops at 145k.

129
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,599
Oh, dear.

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,759
I'll tell you what,

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,359
it's not been an easy day
for the MG One.

132
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,719
The second car now has an issue with
the sensor on its active rear wing,

133
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,159
which in turn has triggered
a speed limiter on the engine.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,199
I tell you what, if you paid
2.5 million quid for it,

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,519
you wouldn't be over the moon.

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,879
But after a lot more head scratching
to get around all the bugs

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,119
in the drivetrain and aero
systems,

138
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
the fix that the engineers
come up with is a promising one.

139
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,399
Putting the AMG One into its most
extreme drive mode would force

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,639
the car to deploy maximum aero
and maximum performance

141
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,320
for one last run.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,479
That mode is the same one Lewis
Hamilton uses in F1 qualifying,

143
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,040
and it's called Strat 2.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,000
ENGINE ROARS

145
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
That's quite serious.

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,479
God, it's fast through there.

147
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,479
Whoo!

148
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,679
That's where the aero really is
working.

149
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,359
The concept just makes me grin while
I'm sitting here.

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,639
This is the engine that genuinely

151
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,599
won World Championships.

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,319
And that noise.

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,079
Whoa.

154
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,720
What a noise!

155
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,079
When that incredible engine and
those ridiculously aggressive wings

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,759
actually start working
together,

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,880
this car finally starts to make some
sort of sense.

158
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,199
Do you know what? Once you're in
it, it feels so much more special.

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,319
That engine is unlike anything
I've ever driven before.

160
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,519
And it's 1.6 litres.

161
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,080
Get your head round that!

162
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,119
And I love the fact that it
revs to 11.

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,680
Nothing revs to 11!

164
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,999
The AMG One, then, might well
be a flawed machine,

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,359
but that doesn't stop it being one
of the most fascinating, intriguing

166
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,280
cars I've ever driven.

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,959
There was a word for this sort of
project years ago.

168
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,279
It was called a folly.

169
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,959
Something that was just so fraught
with difficulties

170
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,439
you'd wonder why someone would
bother.

171
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,639
I suppose I have to ask myself,
do I think it was worth it?

172
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,759
Because it's not the best driving
or fastest supercar I've driven,

173
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,399
let alone hypercar.

174
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,479
But there's just something so
appealing about it

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,079
when it's up and running -

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,679
WHEN it's up and running.

177
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,080
It's unlike any other driving
experience I've had.

178
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,079
And at the end of it all,

179
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,840
this is an engine from a Formula 1
car.

180
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,319
And that...

181
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,520
That's probably enough for me.

182
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

183
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,159
So it didn't work?

184
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,679
It didn't work some of the time.

185
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,879
But when it wasn't not working,

186
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,119
well, it was just fascinating.

187
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,399
It's amazing looking.

188
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,279
Yeah, but, Chris, it didn't work.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,519
Now ambition's a great thing,
Christopher,

190
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,119
but you've got to accept
if something's not working,

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,159
it's not working.

192
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,719
Back in the '90s, I got a perm.

193
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,159
LAUGHTER

194
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,999
Stop it!
I woke up the next day,

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,439
I looked like Barbra Streisand.

196
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,679
Didn't work.

197
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,479
I bet that perm didn't cost you
2.5 million quid, though, did it?

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,359
No, it didn't. Only with you two
could I get into a conversation

199
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,039
around this wonderful car
and his hair.

200
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,839
It's a wonderful vehicle.
It really is.

201
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,799
And isn't sort of heroic
failure so much more romantic

202
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,039
than unheroic success?

203
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,079
I've had a few myself, Chris,
yeah.

204
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,119
But, honestly, I love the concept.

205
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,319
I love the fact they had
the ambition to go and do it.

206
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,959
Mercedes-Benz of all companies
asked,

207
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,279
"Why not put a Formula 1 engine in
a road car?" I love it.

208
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,079
Well, I think they've given
us a few reasons why not,

209
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,319
but we're moving on.

210
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,919
Fred, what's the news?

211
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,479
So last year I got my race license
and since then I've been badgering

212
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,439
the producers to let me get stuck
into some proper serious motorsport.

213
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,559
The other day they said, "How do you
fancy doing a bit of F1?" Ooh...

214
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,999
"Well, if you think I'm up to it,
why not?"

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,880
And they said, "No, not that F1 -
this F1."

216
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,679
F1 Stock Cars.

217
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
Established right here in the UK,

218
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,520
it's billed as the world's toughest
full contact motorsport.

219
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,559
An oval racing series where fighting
your way through the field

220
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,960
takes on a whole new meaning.

221
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,479
First impressions?

222
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,239
I don't think it's your Jenson
Buttons, this, is it?

223
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,239
And, you know, your Lando Norrises.

224
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,039
This is, like, men with big
hands and dirty outfits

225
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,560
and overalls and mud.

226
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,520
My debut...

227
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,399
Oh!

228
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
..will be in less than 48 hours.

229
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,080
Why did I not expect it
to be that fast?

230
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,799
So it was just as well

231
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,959
the man tasked with getting me
across the line

232
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,480
was F1 Stock Car legend
Frankie Wainman Jr.

233
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,799
With three World Championships
and eight British titles

234
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,599
under his belt, there is no-one more
qualified to get me race ready

235
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,040
than Frankie Jr.

236
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,879
Nice to meet you, Freddie. Frankie
Wainman.

237
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,239
I was right about the hands, they're
like sausages.

238
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
I don't know where to start.

239
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,799
I've seen a little bit of it
on YouTube,

240
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,559
didn't know what to expect. Right.

241
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,439
But then when I've seen it just now,
it's an eyeful, isn't it?

242
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,199
Yep. This is the easy bit.

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,519
Seriously? It's the other cars
that's the problem.

244
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,999
We'll worry about them after,
but this car.

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,479
it's not even straight.

246
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,000
Obviously, everything's
built just to go left.

247
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
These cars are built for purpose.

248
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,399
Heavy-duty roll and impact
protection bars keep everything

249
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,240
in place when the racing
gets physical.

250
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,199
Underneath the armour,

251
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,119
a naturally aspirated, race tuned
Chevy V8

252
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,559
sends a whopping 740 horsepower

253
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,040
through a simple two speed gearbox.

254
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,479
Helping to keep that all planted
firmly on the track,

255
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,400
that massive wing set up high on
the roof.

256
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,839
What type of speeds are you getting
up to? Depending on the size
of the track,

257
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,319
probably 80, 90 mile an hour.
Really? Yeah.

258
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,159
And bear in mind this is full
contact,

259
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,479
so you're not only doing
them speeds, but somebody

260
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,559
could just punt you off the end
at that speed.

261
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,639
Have you hurt yourself doing
this, Frankie?

262
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,159
Just bangs and knocks, really.

263
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,999
I mean, I've been at the front
of this job for 35 years,

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,399
I've been and done everything.

265
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,559
And so when the two guys
are squabbling at the top to win

266
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,319
the championships, you get
put in the wall.

267
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,959
Yeah? Yeah.
No, the cars are built to take it.

268
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,199
Yeah, you'd be winded for a few
laps, but you'd just get on with it,
and...

269
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,240
Right.

270
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,839
Full contact could wait.

271
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,599
ENGINE REVS
Wow!

272
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,760
The first job was to head out solo
and try to get a feel for the car.

273
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,240
Whoa! Unbelievable!

274
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,240
Just find my feet.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,439
That's it, Fred. Just nice and
steady. You'll feel your way round.

276
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,480
Wow, there's some power in this.

277
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,759
A quick lap in F1 stock cars...

278
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,959
Right. Come on.

279
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,920
..is all down to the drift.

280
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,599
Whoa!

281
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,959
Argh! Chief!

282
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
ENGINE STARTS

283
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,599
The oval track's loose, slippery
surface means you have to carry

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,239
as much speed as possible
into the corners

285
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,280
while keeping a smooth line as you
slide around for a fast exit.

286
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,800
This is absolutely bonkers.

287
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,799
I don't know if I'm enjoying it,
liking it or what.

288
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,799
And I'm only on my own on the track.

289
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,479
When I got my race licence,

290
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,440
I was driving a lightweight,
modern GT car.

291
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,479
Getting to grips with a crude,
no-frills stock car...

292
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,919
Argh!

293
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,319
..was totally different.

294
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,159
The car's not
built for someone my size,

295
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
I'm on loose ground,

296
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,239
I can't really change the gears
properly.

297
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,879
GEARS GRIND

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,279
I can't move because I'm
strapped in that tight.

299
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,439
Yeah. Some people pay good money for
that.

300
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,560
Not this fella.

301
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,439
Piling on the practice laps, though,

302
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,559
sliding the big V8 pile
of scaffolding around the track

303
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,079
was just starting to feel
more familiar.

304
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,079
There she goes, there she goes!

305
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
Kind of enjoying it.

306
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
I'm not even going to style it out.

307
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,679
I'm kind of petrified as well.

308
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,879
And I'm finding, like it is with
anything with this racing lark,

309
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,200
smooth is best.

310
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,199
That's better, you're picking up the
throttle a bit slower,

311
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,319
and that's more control.

312
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,800
But more control means more speed.

313
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,640
And that means when the mistakes do
happen, they hit hard.

314
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,279
Whey!

315
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,320
Whoa!

316
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,319
HIGHâPITCHED RINGING

317
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,639
Oh.

318
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
ENGINE STARTS

319
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,039
Wow.

320
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,519
Oh, whoa.

321
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,679
BLEEP!
Winded.

322
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,199
Jeez!

323
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,559
That's one dent in the fence.

324
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,919
Whoo!

325
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,239
The moment you think, "You know,
I've got this,"

326
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,719
that's when you come unstuck.

327
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,079
I see what you mean about contact.
Yes!

328
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,319
You feel that? Yeah, I did.
Yeah?

329
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,759
It hit me, and then here,
and then head as well.

330
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,319
FRANKIE CHUCKLES

331
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,439
It's a dangerous spot.

332
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,479
You know, if you want to win,
you've got to get hurt.

333
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,399
That's just life, unfortunately.

334
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,599
But it's brutal.

335
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,719
It is brutal.

336
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,719
To get me back on track,

337
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,040
Frankie took to his own car
to lead me round.

338
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,559
Here we go.

339
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,199
Nice and smooth.

340
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,519
And with an expert's line to
follow...

341
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,959
That's better. ..things finally

342
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,319
started to click.

343
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,599
Nice.

344
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
Totally different now.

345
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,319
Turning the car with the brake.

346
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,240
But before I was trying to use the
accelerator.

347
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,639
Even the crashes got better.

348
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,079
Wahey!

349
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,959
Oh. all, good, all good.

350
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,559
Ready for the effect.

351
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,720
It's all right if you brace
yourself.

352
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,199
End of day one,

353
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,040
it's a bit mixed to be honest.

354
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,359
I feel I'm getting better,

355
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,759
but I'm acutely aware

356
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,919
of what I'm getting myself into now
I think.

357
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,679
Come on, keep going.

358
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,599
Keep concentrating.

359
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,919
Driving the track solo is one thing.

360
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,600
The next job was to find out
what it was like with competition.

361
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,440
Keep driving, keep driving.

362
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,879
This is King's Lynn's
Adrian Flux Arena,

363
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,920
the epicentre of the F1
stock car universe.

364
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,799
Yeah, I think this is up a level
from the last person.

365
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,759
That was like a training track,
put your stabilisers on,

366
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,960
and now this is the real deal.

367
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,479
With my first race now just a few
hours away,

368
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,519
Frankie was stepping the training
up a gear

369
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,759
and to give me a bit of
inspiration...

370
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,959
Hey, look.

371
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,280
Oh-ho!

372
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,479
Overnight his team

373
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
had been busy on my car.

374
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,519
Look at it. It's amazing.

375
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,199
HE LAUGHS

376
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,959
No guessing who's in this then.

377
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,759
Just in case it isn't. Wow!

378
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,999
I'll tell you what if you're behind
this, you're going to be
embarrassed in the race, aren't you?

379
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,079
Look at that. Three lions.

380
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,239
That's lovely, Frank. Good.

381
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,559
Right. Right, I'll get my kit on.
Get yourself suited up.

382
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,640
We'll get you some laps.
Make the most of track time.

383
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
Reunited with my old shirt number

384
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,199
and with my own custom livery,

385
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,840
I was definitely starting
to look like a competitor.

386
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,479
Now I needed to know how to drive
like one.

387
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,799
Here we go.

388
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,959
Onto the King's Lynn track.

389
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,959
And to do that, Frankie Junior

390
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,000
had drafted in some help
from a fellow racer...

391
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,079
I can hear another car coming in.

392
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,399
..his son, Frankie Junior Junior.

393
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,719
Bloomin' heck.

394
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,639
Two Frankies and a Fred.

395
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,360
Oh, nice to meet you too.

396
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,040
Let's go then.

397
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,399
Whoa...

398
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,919
BANG

399
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,160
He's not messing about,
Frankie Junior.

400
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,599
What you've got to remember, Fred,
this is a full contact sport.

401
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,559
You've got your lines and everything
good, now we've got some speed.

402
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,679
This is completely different.

403
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm just trying to be smooth.

404
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,799
We just need to look at a few
of the manoeuvres

405
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,039
that you might be receiving
or you might need to give

406
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,999
passing slower cars. Yeah.

407
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,079
First of all, we've got the push.
Yeah.

408
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,279
Which is into the corner, hit

409
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,400
and then up the inside and go.

410
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,639
Whoa! Bloomin' heck!

411
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,080
So you've got to hit them?
Yeah, physical contact.

412
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,479
Whoa! All right, then.

413
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,439
It's a father and son tag team.

414
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,079
Do you want some?

415
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,560
I'll go and get my daddy.

416
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,319
Next one is the nerf into the side
rail middle of the corner.

417
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,599
So these cars sit here,

418
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,919
just a hit on the middle of the
side rail there. Yeah.

419
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,720
Just unbalances their car
and then you're through.

420
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,760
You're pushing me.

421
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,359
You're using them for your
position. Correct.

422
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,520
Right, next one we have the last
bender, which is... Yeah.

423
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,439
You go into this car that's
winning the race.

424
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,679
You've got to have a dive.

425
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,000
You have to? Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,279
Well, that was the heavy hit.

427
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,959
Whoa, this is a rough sport!

428
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,199
It's easy with these, though, isn't
it? Oh, yeah, it don't hurt
or anything.

429
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,199
Yeah. You good? Yeah, good. Can I
have that car? Yes.

430
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,679
Thank you. That's you. Thanks.

431
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,039
FRANKIE LAUGHS

432
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,639
Put it into practice.

433
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,279
He's going to be up against 30
cars in a race.

434
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,280
You know, they're going
to be eating him,
he's going to be eating them.

435
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,119
It's a rough ride.

436
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,839
He needs to get used to a bit of
contact.

437
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,759
This is racing now.

438
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,199
Come on, Frank.

439
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,760
Let's be having you.

440
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
It's getting rough, this.

441
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,239
It's getting proper tasty.

442
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,439
This is so good.

443
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,999
That last session then,

444
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
for about six or seven laps...

445
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,799
..I wasn't worrying about the car
or my position

446
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,639
or anything else apart from racing,

447
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,720
and I felt in it.

448
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,799
Whoa, let's roll at it.

449
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,999
I don't think it's something you'll
ever get used to,
a car crashing into you,

450
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,959
but I think I was learning
how to handle it better,
I was keeping me line.

451
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,439
I was managing to control the car
and keeping it pretty much

452
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,159
where I wanted it to be.

453
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,239
Oh, get away, get away.

454
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,879
And I think giving enough back

455
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,880
so that people know when I'm around
I'm not going to get pushed about.

456
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,519
Go away!

457
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,119
Not today, Fred.

458
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,039
You were getting in there then
proper, weren't you?
I was enjoying it.

459
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,919
I actually felt in it. Yeah, yeah.

460
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,599
And racing, and actually for the
first time since I've been here,

461
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,719
I was looking.

462
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,199
Yeah. I wasn't...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,719
From watching you then, you could
see that you were more intent

464
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,079
on racing us than the car,
if that makes sense. Yeah.

465
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,119
You knew where to go around the
track, and you wanted to beat us.

466
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,639
And that's how it should be.
Yeah, it's good.

467
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,239
Part of me thinks, yeah, if I can
drive like that, I'm going to

468
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,119
be all right in a race.

469
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,879
Part of me thinks as well there's
going to be far more cars out there.

470
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,720
There's a target on my back.

471
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,879
But I could spend the next
three days going around

472
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,399
and I don't know if I'd be ready.

473
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,479
I think I've just got to
get into it now.

474
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,360
Training was done.

475
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,679
The stock car carnival was rolling
into King's Lynn

476
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,360
and things were getting real.

477
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,479
It's a bit different,
you've got the crowd here.

478
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,719
People hanging round the car
everywhere you go.

479
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,879
I just have to concentrate
on my drive

480
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,279
and not get too worried
about the cars around me.

481
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,999
If I get hit, I get hit.

482
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,999
But just concentrate on
what I'm doing, that's my plan.

483
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,399
I've got a gum shield as well
this time.

484
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,799
Everyone was asking do I want
a gum shield, so I said, why?

485
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,880
They said, so you don't bite
your tongue off. I like my tongue.

486
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,039
As a rookie, I'd be starting out
with a 16-lap race

487
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,400
against a field of 15 drivers.

488
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,959
And as the least experienced
of the lot,

489
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,680
I'd be starting
at the front of the grid.

490
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,199
It's quite handy here, because
all the crowd and everyone knows

491
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,599
what class the drivers are.

492
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,999
You know, you start with
the red tops for the best drivers.

493
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,199
Then you go blue.
Then it's yellow.

494
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,719
And then this is my category.

495
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,919
Complete novices are white tops,
so I'm hoping I can hold me own.

496
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480
Maybe catch a few yellows.

497
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,719
Here we go!

498
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,039
Up to now, my racing career
had been plagued

499
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,719
with mechanical failures.

500
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,199
I was praying that this would be
the race where, for once,

501
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,639
I'd see the chequered flag.

502
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,319
Here we go. We're in it now.

503
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,919
Good afternoon, everyone.

504
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,759
Welcome here
to the Adrian Flux Arena.

505
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,759
And taking part in the meeting

506
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,999
this Saturday and out there
in car number 11,

507
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,279
it is none other than
Freddie Flintoff.

508
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,279
Nearly time. Nearly time.

509
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,359
The waiting's the worst bit.
The worst bit.

510
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,160
Waiting to race, waiting to bat,
waiting for anything.

511
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,479
We are all set to go.
It's over to you, Mr Starter.

512
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,639
Here we go.

513
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,439
To avoid a massive pile-up
on Turn 1,

514
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,479
F1 stock car races
have rolling starts.

515
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,279
Here we go!

516
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,839
Little bit nervous.

517
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,279
We're on the rolling lap now.

518
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,000
Needs to slow down a little bit.

519
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,240
He looks a bit keen.

520
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,279
It's green, that flag
out on the raceway.

521
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,520
Away we go.
It's green, they're going.

522
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
Get round, get round, get round.

523
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,079
There we go!

524
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,199
Flintoff leading the way...

525
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,279
319 in second.

526
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,720
Got good pace there.

527
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,639
This is a different proposition.

528
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,759
Get round, get round.

529
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,000
That's it, that's it.

530
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,199
Flintoff leads at the end
of the opening lap.

531
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,439
As starts go, it's been a good 'un.

532
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,000
Not just keeping the lead,
but starting to build it.

533
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,239
He's actually pulling away.
If he can steady up a little bit.

534
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,119
Steady, steady.

535
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,999
That's it, that's it.

536
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Go, go, go!

537
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,279
Oh, BLEEP.

538
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,839
Too early.

539
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,560
Never mind, get round, get round.

540
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,119
Whoa, whoa.

541
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,159
Well, Flintoff
rattles round the wall.

542
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
Pretty good.

543
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,160
It's speed!

544
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,119
Six laps in,
this was turning into...

545
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,239
Go, go, go!

546
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,359
..the drive of my life.

547
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,199
He's keeping real good pace.
Real good pace.

548
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,239
OK, it wasn't perfect...

549
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,720
Use the wall!

550
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,999
Using the wall.

551
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,719
But it was getting the job done.

552
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,479
What's what I need.

553
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,799
The trouble with starting from the
front of a packed grid, though...

554
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,439
Go on! Come on!

555
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,039
..is that even
the smallest mistake...

556
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,439
Keep it smooth!

557
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,960
..can mean disaster.

558
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,200
Oh, and he's flipped himself
heavily, Flintoff. Agh!

559
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,199
No!

560
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,160
The spin was bad enough.

561
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,039
But it was the T-bone
that followed...

562
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,639
..that sealed the deal.

563
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,879
So it's all kicking off
at King's Lynn...

564
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,600
Whoa!

565
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,200
The car has gone. Car's gone.

566
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,359
BLEEP

567
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,080
The car's BLEEP gone.

568
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,559
No, please!
ENGINE TURNS OVER

569
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,919
He led that proper then
for at least six laps.

570
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,040
Really good. So annoying!

571
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,439
I was having it as well.

572
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,159
I was out in front,
I had one mistake,

573
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,320
I was still in it
and me car's cut out again!

574
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,840
My first stock car race had ended
like the rest of them.

575
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,839
Back at the pits with nothing to
show for it but another DNF.

576
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,559
It's always a mechanical with me,
isn't it? Always a mechanical.

577
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Baja, mechanical.
Ginetta, mechanical.

578
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,959
Ah, always a mechanical. Ah, well.

579
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,520
I might go and sit down for a bit.
Me head's banging.

580
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,359
But I couldn't rest for long.

581
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,279
Keen to race again,

582
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,439
and having led for half my first
race, Frankie thought I was safe

583
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,879
enough to get a taste
of the big leagues.

584
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,679
So while Team Wainman raced
to fix the damage to my car,

585
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,240
and the evening's race meet
gathered pace...

586
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,640
..I headed down the paddock
in search of inspiration.

587
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,999
How old are you? I'm 20.
20. A world champion? Yeah.

588
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,439
You can't stop smiling, can you?
And why not? No, I can't.

589
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,559
Why not? Any tips?

590
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,559
Try and race your own race. Yeah.
That's what you got to do.

591
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,079
That's the thing. You get
sucked in about other cars. Yeah.

592
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,919
You forget what you're doing.

593
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,719
Just try and get round.

594
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,319
Concentrate on what's in front
of you. Keep the car straight.

595
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,439
And be gentle with that throttle.
It's a lot of power under you.

596
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,599
Just hit everything
in front of you.

597
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,159
Hit everything in front of me? Yeah.

598
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,519
I tried that
but it's usually a wall.

599
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,039
Yeah, and me, but...

600
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,320
Just keep your wheels straight
and you'll be fine.

601
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,559
With a head full of advice,

602
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,519
it was time to get ready to race.

603
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,239
The last round of the night
would be a ten-lap sprint

604
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,719
where, a solo rookie,

605
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,439
I'd be lining up on a mixed grid
of intermediates and pros,

606
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,040
including both Frankies.

607
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,119
This wouldn't be a battle
for podiums or silverware.

608
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,200
For me, this battle
had a much simpler goal.

609
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,999
I want to finish a race
and then walk away.

610
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,919
Ideally in one piece, car's in one
piece, with a grin on my face.

611
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,880
No chance, is there?
Not a chance.

612
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,319
We are ready to go with this one.

613
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,840
Over to you, Mr Starter!

614
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,879
Here we go again.

615
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,879
Come on, Freddie lad.

616
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,839
Let's see what you've got.

617
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,079
Having been drawn in fourth place,

618
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,039
this would be my first start
from the middle of the pack.

619
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,039
Or to put it another way,
right in the thick of it.

620
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,720
The green is out.

621
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
We are away and racing.

622
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,999
Get round, get round.

623
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,919
Freddie Flintoff in 11
in fourth at the moment.

624
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,400
Bit wide. We're all right, though.

625
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,639
Surrounded by top-flight
racers like Frankie,

626
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,239
I just had to race my race,
hold my nerve...

627
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,319
Come on, concentrate!

628
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
..and hope for the best.

629
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,559
Hold your line!

630
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,839
This is crazy.
Frankie's right behind me.

631
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,200
Whoa, got a nudge.

632
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,000
He's going!

633
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,719
He gets through. Passes Flintoff.

634
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,839
Flintoff coming back at him
on the inside,

635
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,720
can't quite make it stick that side.

636
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,480
Cars were spinning out
all over the field.

637
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,399
But a bit of skill...

638
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,720
Whoa!

639
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,279
..and a lot of luck...

640
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,760
Bloomin' heck, that was close.

641
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,319
..somehow kept me clear
of the carnage.

642
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,800
That was a smart one.

643
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,479
Go on, then

644
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,359
As the laps counted down,

645
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,600
I couldn't drop my guard
for a second.

646
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,159
Concentrate.

647
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,280
A spin or a crash now
was not an option.

648
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,159
Go on, go on.

649
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,680
All right, you got this.

650
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,040
Keep going.
Do not give it away now.

651
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,399
Do not give it away!

652
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,560
So, back through we go,
the last lap.

653
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,760
This is the last lap.
Come on, you got this.

654
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm getting there,
I'm getting there, come on!

655
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,280
Last corner, last corner.

656
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,440
Here it is, the chequered flag!

657
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,679
And the chequered flag out
on the raceway.

658
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,799
Whoa, I finished!
I finished a race!

659
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
First time in my history.

660
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,480
Yes, please. I'll take that.

661
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,879
All day long.

662
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,759
Every day of the week.

663
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,479
And twice on a Tuesday.

664
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,120
APPLAUSE

665
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,959
All right.

666
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,880
As ambitions go, it hadn't been
an especially grand one.

667
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,399
But walking away
from F1 stock cars with a finish

668
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,759
had been plenty good enough for me.

669
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,359
Thanks so much. You're a legend.

670
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,440
Come here, you.

671
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,960
CHEERING

672
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,279
That looked utterly brutal.

673
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,719
So in your sporting career,

674
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,439
you've had cricket balls bowled
at your head by angry Australians,

675
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,159
you've been punched in the head
by an angry American boxer.

676
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,759
And you've been headbutted
by a Norwegian bobsleigh run.

677
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,519
Where does this sort of rank
on your personal pain scale?

678
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,879
This'll come in at number two.

679
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,559
Cricket's still the most painful.

680
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,239
But that's mainly emotional.

681
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,759
It's harder than boxing.

682
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,639
When I hit the wall for the first
time, my shoulder, my head

683
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,519
and my ribs hurt more
than any punch that I felt.

684
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,719
Honestly, it is
the most brutal thing.

685
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,199
I've got to say, watching it,
though, it was amazing.

686
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,359
Forget sensible F1,
I'm into the bonkers F1.

687
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,519
Drive to hopefully survive.

688
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,439
And I'm not sure I would have done
without the help of these two.

689
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,439
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up for Frankie Junior
and Frankie Junior Junior.

690
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,959
CHEERING

691
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,240
Without you, I was done.

692
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,959
I've got to say,
I'm glad I've done it.

693
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,479
But now I've done it, I'm done.
I'm retiring from another sport.

694
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,999
A short but glorious career.

695
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,279
Feller on cameras.

696
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,839
Come with me for a little walk,
because I want to talk about this.

697
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,759
The Range Rover, this one's
been knocking around for a decade

698
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,439
now, and it's still
the absolute business.

699
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,399
But that hasn't stopped
Land Rover cooking up a new one.

700
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,760
And they say it's even better.

701
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,000
Introducing the all-new Range Rover.

702
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,240
And straight away,
you'll notice it looks...

703
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,800
..like a Range Rover.

704
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,919
But they reckon this Range Rover now
has more luxury and more refinement

705
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,160
than ever before.

706
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,280
This is a car, then,
with plenty to shout about.

707
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
Thing is, though.

708
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,039
It doesn't.

709
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Listen to that.

710
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,960
You've got to listen carefully.

711
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,200
Can you hear it?

712
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,519
Exactly.

713
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,799
Nothing.

714
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,439
Complete silence.

715
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,799
That's because the good people
at Land Rover have pulled out

716
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,000
all the stops to make this
the quietest Range Rover ever.

717
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,719
Take the exterior.

718
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,719
Every millimetre of the bodywork
has been smoothed out

719
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,120
to reduce wind noise.

720
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,239
While the structure has been made
stiffer than ever before,

721
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,680
to reduce vibration.

722
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,399
And if any sound at all
does make its way into the cab,

723
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,559
you've got 35 noise-cancelling
speakers in here.

724
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,759
There's even a couple
in the headrest.

725
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,200
There could be an earthquake
going on out there.

726
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,479
You'd be totally oblivious.

727
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,959
In fact, the Range Rover
will keep you isolated

728
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,039
from just about anything
the noisy, dirty outside world

729
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,440
can throw at you.

730
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,919
Every time you put the news on
these days,

731
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,719
there's another virus
out there to get us.

732
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,839
What we need is a weapons-grade
air con system that filters out

733
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,359
all those nasty bacteria
and viruses, which is exactly

734
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,880
what this has got.

735
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,999
Nothing is getting in here.

736
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,479
I am not kidding, either.

737
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,440
This car will stop Covid.

738
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,959
And when it comes to
what powers the world's most

739
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,679
comfortable face mask,

740
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,359
you won't be surprised to hear
there are plenty of options.

741
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,039
Petrol, diesel, a plug-in
hybrid that'll do 50-odd miles

742
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,519
on battery power alone.

743
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,599
There's even an all-electric
version due out soon.

744
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,439
But from the driver's seat,
it doesn't really matter

745
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,239
what you've got under the bonnet.

746
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,720
It's all very quiet
and all very peaceful.

747
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,639
Once you've got past
all the ways they've tried to make

748
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,000
the new Range Rover feel as
un-carlike as possible, though...

749
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,839
It turns out they've also done some
work on the small matter of actually

750
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,400
driving the thing.

751
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,639
The sat nav is constantly talking
to the suspension

752
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,839
to warn about any lumps and bumps
in the road ahead so it can engage

753
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,520
the anti-roll system.

754
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,999
It isn't exactly a Lotus.

755
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,319
But as far as two-and-a-half-tonne
cruise liners go,

756
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,399
this is pretty impressive.

757
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,079
As is the rear wheel steer,
which gives this thing

758
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,079
a turning circle
of under 11 metres.

759
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,120
That's Volkswagen Golf Territory.

760
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,119
But what definitely isn't
Volkswagen Golf Territory

761
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,719
is what this cleverer,
posher-than-ever Range Rover
now costs.

762
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,880
These start at Â£100,000.

763
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,320
Start.

764
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,199
Now, if you chuck in
a juicier engine

765
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,479
and smatter it
with all the trimmings,

766
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
you could be north of Â£200,000.

767
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,360
Â£200,000 for a Range Rover.

768
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,799
The world's gone mad.

769
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,199
Especially as however much it costs,
because it's a Range Rover,

770
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,399
this sharp-suited city slicker
still needs to do the business

771
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,280
when the going gets tough.

772
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,359
So to put it through its paces,

773
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,559
I headed to Wales
to meet up with Harris

774
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,000
for a spot of light off-roading.

775
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,000
This is the King of Britain.

776
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,720
The toughest all-terrain
competition in the country.

777
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,559
A race where custom-built,
high-performance buggies

778
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,520
tackle a torture chamber
of extreme terrain.

779
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,439
And rocking up on warm-up
day ahead of the big race,

780
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,399
it was just the place to see
what the Range Rover

781
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,039
is really made of.

782
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,639
What's the total bill for this?
A couple hundred grand, or more?

783
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,199
Oh, there he is.

784
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,879
The big lad.

785
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,599
Just talking to men in overalls.

786
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,959
He could not be happier.

787
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,439
Is it a spec chassis? Yeah.

788
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,320
That's what they call
a pro chassis. Yeah.

789
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,519
Good morning.

790
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,279
What have you got us into here,
Patrick?

791
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,439
What?

792
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,679
What are you playing at?

793
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,480
Just the King of Britain.

794
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,199
The toughest off-roader there is.

795
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,879
Look, I'm aware of what it is.
Utterly brutal. Yeah.

796
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,039
How are we planning
to get round that in this?

797
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,039
I'll put some off-road tyres
on her. That's it? That's the one.

798
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,199
And I've been swanning
around all morning,

799
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,999
so you can drive. In you get.

800
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,800
These things struggle.
Whatever. Just get yourself in.

801
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,519
So the course that the King
of Britain runners would be spending

802
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,159
the next day hammering around

803
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,759
covers gravel tracks,
muddy crawls, boulder fields

804
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,320
and water crossings.

805
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,639
And with the pros already out
giving it all a good look,

806
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,679
McGuinness's plan was
that we would now also try to tackle

807
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,280
one lap of the course.

808
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,239
As off-road tests go,
it would be a thorough one.

809
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,919
Fail, and we'd have to conclude
that Land Rover's mighty flagship

810
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,720
is now just too posh and too plush.

811
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,599
Right, now, before we set off,
let's get the seat coolers on.

812
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,959
Oh, yes. Nice and cool.
That's lovely. Bottom of the back.

813
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,320
But anyhow, we've got
the V8 in, 500 horsepower.

814
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,560
Let's see what she can do.

815
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,480
Jesus, it goes! Oh, ho, ho, does it!

816
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,599
0 to 60, 4.4 seconds,
top whack around about 150.

817
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
It's a beast, this thing.

818
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,679
Thing about the Range Rover is,

819
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,039
it's always made off-roading
feel like you're in a Rolls-Royce.

820
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,839
That's it, isn't it? You're not
aware of what's going on outside.

821
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,000
Although I'm not sure about this
interior for off-roading. Oh, sh...

822
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,280
Oh, there we are. That'll get it.

823
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,199
It's just effortless, mate.

824
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,279
Beautiful. Effortless.
And... You hear that?

825
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,720
What? Exactly.

826
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,439
Gravel tracks
are easy pickings, though.

827
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,879
With the course now heading down
through the trees,

828
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,839
we could start exploring the Range
Rover's arsenal of off-road tech.

829
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,239
Here we go. 14 inches of ground
clearance

830
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,280
this will give us, Chris.
Handy for the school run.

831
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,480
Ooh. That was a big scrape.

832
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,600
There we go.

833
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,360
So far, so good.

834
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,159
Oh, my Lord, Pad, this looks a bit
steep. What's this?

835
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,519
I can't even see down there.
What is it? Stop, stop, stop.

836
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,160
El descent mode.

837
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,599
Look at that, wahey!

838
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,119
It'll never go above 2mph there now.

839
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,359
That is... That is heaven.

840
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,799
I love technology.

841
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,600
Nothing's testing it yet.

842
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,559
Do you know what I've not checked
on this, actually?

843
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,879
What? It's got the old massage
seats. Has it? Shall we have a look?

844
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,719
Oh. There it is.

845
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,119
Massage.

846
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,719
Now, are you ready, sir?

847
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,919
Oh! Oh!

848
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,079
Oh!

849
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,799
Oh! Oh! Oh!

850
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,639
The King of Britain.

851
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,159
In fact, what with the onboard
rubdown, and the Rangy so quietly

852
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,639
going about its business
outside, so far,

853
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,120
it was easy to forget that we were
off-roading at all.

854
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,279
Do you ever remember an old
Hammer horror episode?

855
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,799
They were driving down the road
like this and all of a sudden it

856
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,359
gets really foggy and they're in
this village and everyone's

857
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,719
like you and Flintoff,
teeth are all messed up and yellow,

858
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,039
and the escape in the end.

859
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,759
And they drive out through the fog,
and they're like, "Thank God."

860
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,039
And they're away... They were from
The Damned.

861
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,559
Have you never seen that? No.
Oh, it's a belter.

862
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,799
But before I could regale Harris
with any more horror classics,

863
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,039
the King of Britain circuit
decided it was time we head

864
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,639
down a dried-up stream.

865
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,399
Just pop the old rock crawl on.

866
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,719
That's that. And change the camera
angles for you.

867
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,839
So there is a camera
underneath the car? Yeah.

868
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,839
Some engineer has come up
with that, some boffin.

869
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,600
No-one will ever use it.

870
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,959
No-one's ever going to come
up to you and go,

871
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,559
"Good job on that. I use that."

872
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,360
Yeah, but they have done
an amazing job, though!

873
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,759
It's a lovely plant, innit?

874
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,639
What is that? Is it a plant or a
tree, that?

875
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,079
It's a buddleia. A buddleia.

876
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,719
How do you know all these things?

877
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,999
They're beautiful, but they're...
They're rampant.

878
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,639
They're like you on television,
once they start off...

879
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,999
You can't stop them. ..they are
everywhere. Yeah.

880
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,399
Once again, we had to concede
that Land Rover's luxobarge

881
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,679
was taking the course in its stride.

882
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,920
It's so impressive, this thing.

883
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,199
But, while the rest of the King
of Britain runners tore their way

884
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,119
through the Welsh hills ahead of us,
that dried-up stream turned

885
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,920
into a dried-up river.

886
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,880
We are not going in that.
It can't go down there.

887
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,240
We can't be going down.

888
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,279
Hold on, before you go, I'm going to
have to do a bit of spotting.

889
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,119
I know we've got the underneath
camera...

890
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,799
What you're saying is you'd rather
be out of the vehicle? Yes.

891
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,119
Right, let's do it.

892
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh, God. Do you want to swap?
No, thanks.

893
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,960
Right... Oh, dear.

894
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,839
Can you hear me? Yes.

895
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,559
It's never going down there, is it?

896
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,160
No, no, you're all right.

897
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,319
Left hand down.

898
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,039
Whoa, not too much.
Right hand. Yeah, keep coming.

899
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,400
Go on.

900
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,559
All right, just a little look back.
Keep coming.

901
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,519
That sounded horrible!

902
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,640
Yeah, keep coming. You're all right.

903
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,239
Go on.

904
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,959
You passed it there. Straighten
up. Whoa, whoa!

905
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,279
Straight there now, come on.

906
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,959
You're looking the wrong way.

907
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,719
I have to move out your way.

908
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,439
Go on, you're clear.

909
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,199
Keep coming at that.

910
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,799
Tell you what, it's amazing, this.

911
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,919
Left hand down?

912
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,960
Come on.

913
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,560
Go on, yes! Go on!

914
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,399
Whoa, don't go too far back.

915
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,920
This is horrendous. Go on, Chris.

916
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,280
You're up. Oh, Jesus.

917
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,639
The Rangy was holding its own.

918
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,079
Over here, over you come.

919
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,679
Right hand down, son.

920
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,879
But our crawl through the rocks
was taking time.

921
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,959
That's horrendous!

922
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, that's a... That's a fair old
bit.

923
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,599
Enough time, it turned out,
for the proper racers to start

924
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,559
coming around again.
ENGINE ROARS

925
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,599
What's that noise?

926
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,200
What the hell is that?

927
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,400
Where is he going?

928
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,600
CAR HORN BLARES

929
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,120
Geez!

930
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,759
Hey.

931
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,960
Has he got cooling seats?
No, he has not. Up you get.

932
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,359
Give it some. Give it some, Chris.
Give it some, go on!

933
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,559
CAR SCRAPES GROUND

934
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,799
Whoa, there we go.

935
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,279
There we go! There she goes!

936
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,759
That's the one!

937
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,119
I cannot believe it got up there!
I can't believe it got up there!

938
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,320
Fantastic.

939
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,040
So rock crawl mode definitely works.

940
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,639
And deciding it was best we clear
out the way before any more Kings

941
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,559
of Britain came galloping past,

942
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,159
we got back on the gravel
and set off for the last stage

943
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,639
of the course.

944
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,880
Look at that, 50mph.

945
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,360
You're barely aware of it, are you?
50mph... I know, on rough ground.

946
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,119
Little bit of splash.

947
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,839
Yes! Go on! They're just so capable,
aren't they?

948
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,000
It's outrageous how good it is.

949
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,799
But if you are an engineer
at Land Rover and you're putting

950
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,039
in the long hours developing stuff
and you're thinking,

951
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,599
"Never going to
get used." I know. It's crazy.

952
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,399
It's like your rich barrel
of humour -

953
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,719
you only give us a little bit of it.

954
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,520
Most of it is just not
necessary. Oh, dear, dear, dear!

955
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,799
Whether it ever gets used or not,
though, the truth is the Range Rover

956
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,479
had cleared every hurdle
we'd thrown at it.

957
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,439
And, with one last obstacle to
conquer, the time had come to take

958
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,239
back the reins.

959
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,599
Now, look, you've done
the lion's share of the driving.

960
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,719
I don't think you fully appreciate
everything about this motor.

961
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,279
I'm saying, "Get yourself
in business class."

962
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,359
Leave this bit to McGuinty.
Let's go, come on.

963
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,239
Who's McGuinty? That is me.

964
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,879
You've been grafting there.

965
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,680
Time for you to relax in business
class, my friend. Oh.

966
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,799
Oh, yes. Right.

967
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,640
Oh, it's good to be back.

968
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,160
Here we go.

969
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,840
This is steep.

970
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,639
Oh, don't worry about that.

971
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,919
Oh, you're having a laugh, Paddy.
Have you seen this?

972
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,639
Look at this. Look at this. Look at
this.

973
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,399
Er, I'm a bit preoccupied at the
minute.

974
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,799
You just keep off-roading.

975
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,680
I've got... I've got a screen.
Oh, my word.

976
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,480
Oh, ho, ho! Look at that!

977
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,280
Electric cup holders.

978
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,760
Roll up your tights, madam,
we're going in! Wahey! Whoa!

979
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,280
What have you done there?!
Oh, ho, ho! The old wipers on.

980
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,640
If it keeps going like that,
that's amazing.

981
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,479
Oh, look at that! It's your
great-grandad.

982
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,959
This is a great-looking car, but
that's still the best-looking, mate.

983
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,600
Look at that! Wahey! Fantastic!

984
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,599
Right, finish line, McGuiness.

985
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,640
Come on. Here we go! Not far now!

986
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,039
So there you have it.

987
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,959
Can the most expensive, most
luxurious Range Rover ever made

988
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,240
still cut it in the great outdoors?

989
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,120
Well, you'd have to say
the results speak for themselves.

990
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,279
Here we go! There it is!

991
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,759
Over the line!
Over the line! Come on!

992
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,320
Wahey! There we go!

993
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,679
That is remarkable.

994
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,600
What a machine this is.

995
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,279
Can we also be vaguely patriotic?

996
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,679
We don't do many things better
than everyone else,

997
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,599
but we still make the best four by
four in the world, don't we?

998
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,680
100%.

999
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,839
Strong work, lads,
and the Range Rover did you proud.

1000
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,399
I've got one tiny issue.

1001
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,279
How much is this one as tested?

1002
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,359
150 grand.
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

1003
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,999
Whoa, that's a lot of money!

1004
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,959
That is a lot of money. But it's an
off-roader and it's a limo.

1005
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,999
It's two cars for the price of one.

1006
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,639
And price aside, it is the very best
of British. If you can afford it,

1007
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,199
nothing does the job better
than a Range Rover.

1008
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,319
Absolutely. And we can all agree on
that one.

1009
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,879
Well, that's it for tonight.

1010
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,279
But tune in next week,

1011
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,119
when him and him mess around in a
bunch of hot hatches

1012
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,719
and I conduct a
little experiment with the help

1013
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,599
of F1 ace Lando Norris.

1014
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,719
COUGHING: Name-dropper.

1015
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,759
I'll just pick that up. Oh, ho, ho!

1016
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,840
See you then. Thanks for watching.
Goodnight.
