three ancient lorries...'

to build to support my truck?

About 1,000 tonnes.

Sliding badly.

we stay in Burmese truck stops...'

into houses.'

There is a very good reason
why it's so secretive in there.

You see, the travel companies
would have you believe that

the special agriculture -
that is in the Shan.

44
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,658
Apparently, some of the special
agriculture is known as horse,

45
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,658
they're obviously growing horses
somehow. I shall look for those.

Fields of horses growing in them.

welcome, this is it. This is it.

the Western world.

"What was it like in the Shan?"

67
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:58,658
We'll have to go, "I don't know,
we were racing lorries."

Think about it.

If you were North Korea, and you
wanted to portray to your people

how lumpen and useless the West was,
you'd invite us three, wouldn't you?

Yeah.

90
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,658
Because we'd wander about
and the North Koreans would go,

"Why would we want to be Western?
Look at them. They're dreadful."

92

You've got bird poo on
your shoulder. I have.

93

So what the government is
essentially saying to these

94
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,658
people is, why would you want to
live like they do in the West?

95
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,658
Look at them. There's another
thing that we're doing.

96
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,658
This is just an incidental service.

97
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,658
They haven't seen many
Westerners here.

98
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,658
We are at least showing...
They're not going to end up saying,

99
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,658
"They all look the same to me,"
are they? With us three.

100
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,658
That's just blatantly racist.

101
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,658
No... Clearly. Yes, you are.
You are.

102
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,658
You're assuming that they think
we all look the same

103
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,658
because we think
they all look the same.

104
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,658
Now you're making a leap,
I didn't...

105
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,658
You're completing something
that I didn't put in.

106
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,659
Yes, we are,
but it's quite good fun.

107
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:23,659
'Keen to see more of the Shan,
we moved on.'

108
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:43,658
Chaps, check out the driver of this
tuk-tuk. What's he done?

109
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,659
I don't know what it was,
but he's done a lot of it.

110
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,659
He's off his face. Oh, dear.

111
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,659
Oh, Lord, I see what you mean.

112
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:00,658
James, do you see any fields
where they are growing horses?

113
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,659
No, I haven't seen a single
horse plantation yet.

114
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,658
'What we did see, however,
was evidence of what is officially

'the world's longest running
civil war.'

116
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,659

less important things on his mind.'

Time to try out my water
brake cooling system.

119
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,659
I'm ready. A little switch.

120
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,050
I think it works.

121
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,658
Cock.

122
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,659
My steering has just locked up.

123
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:07,658
I'm not sure that's a good idea,
James, is it? Blocking the Army?

124
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:13,659
'The problem was a big one.
The front axle had broken.'

125
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,659
There's only one thing I can think
to play at a time like this.

126
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:31,659
Well, off you go. Goodbye.
That's a bad one, isn't it? See you.

127
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,658

deeper into the Shan,

Argh!

131
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:09,659
'And the reason why soon
became clear.'

132

That was an actual baby there,
building the road.

133
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,659
It's not a good policy, because
the road surface is dreadful.

134

Babies are no good at
building roads, look.

Hammond's heavy lumber bus.'

No. Grind, grind, grind.

And when we get to the end,

140
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,659
we have to build a bridge
over the River Kwai.

we had to rest our weary bones,

00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,658
You know, in a village like this,

00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:27,658
it really is possible
they don't know the West exists.

145

They will never have seen
faces like ours. No.

146

I'm amazed they're not more amazed.

147
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,658
I think it's a cultural thing,
it would be rude to show it. Yeah.

148

It's sort of...

149
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,659
Definitely the first white faces
they've ever seen.

00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,659
I hate my lorry.

dog's egg with a crane on the back.

We're supposed to be
frightened to death.

162

It's not frightening though,
is it? It's lovely.

out we've been invited to a party.

fighting are coming together tonight

00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,658
to welcome us here
to the Shan state.

170
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,658
You know the Good Friday Agreement
where they got Major,

171
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,658
Gerry Adams and Paisley all in
one room and it was amazing?

172
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:25,658
Well, apparently this
is as amazing as that in Burma.

173
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:29,658
Who do they think we are?
I don't know.

174
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:33,658
Probably Richard Dimbleby,
James McNulty and Jeremy Paxman.

175
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,658
They're not familiar with Top Gear,
are they? Evidently not.

176
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,658
The only thing I'm speculating on
is I don't think

177
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,658
we should turn up looking like this.
No. I have no formal wear with me.

178
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,659
Naked would be better than that.

179
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,658
'As Hammond wouldn't let us
use his shower,

180
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,659
'James and I had to go native.'

181
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:10,659
Women go there, and men go here.

182
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,659
'As we finished our ablutions...

183
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,659
'..the various factions
started to arrive.

184
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:28,658
'And Jeremy invited us over
for pre-dinner cocktails.'

185
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:33,658
Listen, help yourselves to a drink,
because I've had a thought.

186
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:39,658
It's possible MI6 or the DEA or
some intelligence agency will want

187
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:44,658
to talk to us when
we get back about here. Right.

188
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,658
So, manners - polite, British,
representatives of the BBC,

189
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,658
but pay attention.

190
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:54,658
But don't make it obvious that you're
finding things out, just be...

191
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,658
'With a final word of warning
to Hammond...'

192
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,658
Don't get drunk.

193
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,659
I'll just have one before I go.
'..we headed off to the party.'

194
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:07,658
From Britain, BBC television.

195
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:11,658
'Where we were offered
some local delicacies...'

196
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:12,658
It's a caterpillar?

197
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,658
That's right, that's right,
caterpillar. Caterpillar.

198
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:17,658
Goodbye, caterpillar.

199
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,658
'As caterpillars weren't
to Hammond's taste,

200
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:22,659
'he went off to find something
that was.'

201
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:33,658
Hello, hello. Hello, yes.
I can do that. Yes, I could do that.

202
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,658
This is all right.
I'm coming in, I like this.

203
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,658
'As the food kept coming...'

204
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:40,658
This is a cicada, a cricket.

205
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,658
'..I was discovering that
the region's special agriculture

206
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:50,658
'didn't seem to be that special.'

207
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,300
So it's sunflower seeds, soya bean,
nothing else. Nothing, nothing.

208
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,659
'Still, I was learning
more than James...

00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,659
'..or Hammond.'

Who's got any Whiskey?
Have you got any Scotch?

'By midnight, I'd been through
every single crop in the area.'

212
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,658
Sesame seeds. Sesame seeds,
yeah, yeah. Maize.

213
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,658
'So, I took a leaf
out of Hammond's book...'

214
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,658
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

215
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:31,659
'..and, along with May and half
the film crew, joined the party.'

and I'm acting cool,

♪ Got a cheerleader here... ♪

218
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:14,658
Well, one thing is for sure.

219
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,658
There are absolutely no drugs
in this part of Burma. No, none.

220
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:20,658
I talked to everybody and...

221
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:25,658
I talked to people involved
in the sales and distribution

222
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,658
of stationery, I talked to
farmers, Army people, Colonel Kurtz.

223
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:35,658
I spoke to Colonel Kurtz,
he was in vegetables.

224
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:39,659
we can say, "You're looking
in the wrong place."

225
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,658
Have you seen...
Our colleague is not well.

226
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:49,658
We've got a lot of time to kill this
morning before that is capable

227
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:50,659
of driving a lorry.

228
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,659
'Many, many hours later,
we were back on the road.'

229
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:07,659
I think I punched a colonel.

230
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:11,658
Or kissed him.

231
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,658
Hammond? Yeah? What was
your whiskey called again?

232
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,658
Hankie Banister.

233
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,659
"Hankie Banister. Third-best
Whiskey in northern Burma."

234
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,658
'Soon, though, the memories of our
summit at the end of Apocalypse Now

235
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:36,659
'were eclipsed by the sheer beauty
of this untouched paradise.'

236
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:49,658
I've never taken more landscape
photographs in my entire life.

237
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:50,659
It's just...

238
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,659
You've got to come here.
You have got to come and see this.

239
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,658
'James would have enjoyed
the view, too,

240
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,659
'but predictably he'd had yet
another breakdown.'

241
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:24,658
Cock. The problem is - well,
I don't know what the problem is,

242
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,658
on two, then it was definitely only
running on one cylinder, because it

243
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,659
sounded like the sort of generator
people put on in the night.

244
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:34,659
Ah, BLEEP.

245
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,659
Non-BBC Two word.

246
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,658
'Once I'd fixed the problem,
which was wonky fuel injectors,

00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,659
'I was on the move again.'

248
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,659
God, this lorry is appalling.

249
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,658
'And it didn't take long
to catch the others,

250
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,659
'because the road was steep,
and Hammond was in front.'

251
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,659
First gear. Bad.

252
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,659
Literally the slowest
I've ever been.

253
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,658
Hammond, I haven't got
any more gears left.

254
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:15,658
I can't get out the way,
the road's too narrow,

255
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,659
I can't go any faster,
I'm in a lorry.

256
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,659
It's pretty much vertical.

257
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:34,659
God, look at the smoke now.
I've got a mining lung disease.

258
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:39,659
I'm starting to imagine what Hammond
might look like without any skin on.

259
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:45,659
Now what?

260
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,659
I think if we all back up,
he can come in here.

261
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:55,659
Hammond, we can't -
there's nothing to be gained by...

262
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,659
Hammond, you idiot, you've
reversed into the sports lorry!

263
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,659
You've broken it. I didn't know.
Genuinely, that was an accident.

264
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:11,659
Don't just drive off, Hammond.
Hammond! Hammond!

265
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:20,659
He's broken my headlights, radiator.
My bull bar is broken. The mirror.

266
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,658
What, you just reverse and hope?

267
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,658
Where did you think I was?!
All day, I have been behind you.

268
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,658
I didn't think you were
that close behind me.

269
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,658
I now know why they have those
stickers for lorry drivers -

270
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,659
"If you can't see my mirrors,
I can't see you."

271
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:41,658
'Even though the incident had been
technically my fault,

272
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:43,659
'I still followed
the standard procedure.'

273
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,659
What? He knows the rules.
Live by the sword, you must...

274
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,659
I can't remember. Whatever.
Something to do with swords.

275
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,658
Held me up all day,
then he reversed into me,

276
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:06,659
so I think tonight Hammond's
other wrist might break.

277
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:12,658
However, when I reached
the overnight holds,

278
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,658
I came up with a more fiendish idea.

279
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,658
An idea that involved the bucket
Hammond had fitted to collect

280
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,659
rainwater for his shower.

281
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,659
I think this does pay him back
for holding us up all day long. Yep.

282
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,659
Oh, there's more. Part two.

283
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,658
'I then began to work
on my lorry's waterworks.'

284
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,659
Massive nuts holding the radiator
on. 22 millimetres. Yeah.

285
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,659
Oh, it's warm.
So warm, fresh rainwater.

286
00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:00,659
Golden rain. I can taste
the goodness. The outdoors.

287
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,659
And neither of you two
thought of this.

288
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,658
'After dining on roast grasshopper,

289
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,659
'we spent the evening playing
with my Chinese lanterns.'

290
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,658
Are you going to set them off here?
Why not?

291
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:27,658
I should say in a country where a lot
of people live in houses made of...

292
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,658
What is it, dried grass? Oh, relax.
That's not going to be a problem.

293
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,658
The chances of you getting one
of those things to work...

294
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,659
There, let it fly.

295
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,658
Yes. Hammond, ye of little faith.

296
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:43,658
Go find a barn or a thatched roof.

297
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,658
Now, let's just... I'm going to get
a beer and savour the moment.

298
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,658
This is a... It's a mobile bonfire.
It is.

299
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,658
If it were to land in a field
of poppies, for example,

300
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:55,659
imagine how beautiful that would be.

301
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:02,659
'Feeling content and happy, we
went to bed. Well, one of us did.'

302
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:08,658
What do you think
the chances are of waking him?

303
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:10,795
You won't wake him,
he sleeps the sleep of the dead.

304
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,659
That's in neutral.

305
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:29,659
Jesus Christ!

306
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,659
'Jeremy hit the road
in a fractious mood.'

307
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,659
Why did you tip me out of my lorry?

308
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,658
Because you swung me
around in my tent.

309
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,658
You deserved that because you're
irritating. I'm never irritating.

310
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,658
It's a good point Jeremy raises,
I feel quite bad about it now,

311
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:03,659
because when has he
ever been irritating?

312
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,658
'To make my mood even worse,

313
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:12,659
'the endless hard going had had
a catastrophic effect on my brakes.'

314
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:17,658
I think they're only working
now on the left-hand side.

315
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:20,658
Nothing, everything.

316
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:22,699
You move your foot that much,
that's the difference.

317
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,658
Fortunately, we were now only 80
miles from the border with Thailand.

318
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:33,659
But, unfortunately,
none of those miles would be gentle.

319
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:45,659
Oh, it's bad in here and it will be
worse in Jeremy's lorry.

320
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,658
'It was desperately uncomfortable,
and hot,

321
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,659
'and ahead of us lay
the biggest mountain range yet.'

322
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,659
This climb is exactly what you need
in a lorry with a leaky radiator.

323
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:34,659
Oh, that is a
trouser-threatening drop.

324
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,659
James May is a man
who does not like heights.

325
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,658
He is also a man whose lorry has
its front axle held on with

326
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:45,659
a bit of string.

327
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,658
How's your vertigo, May?
I'm not looking.

328
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,659
But thanks for reminding me.

329
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:59,658
'Progress was extremely slow

330
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,659
'as I had to keep stopping to
refill my radiator.'

Pouring out from exactly
where the araldite was.

332
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,658
Fairly convinced this is an
old wives' tale, but we shall see.

333
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:17,659
'Meanwhile, James was having
his first breakdown of the day.'

334
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:22,659
Oh, BLEEP.

335
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,659
Nope.

336
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,658
'This time, it was the transfer box,

337
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,658
'which had burst
free from its mountings.'

338
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:38,658
That's the transfer box, that's
the bracket where it's bolted on,

339
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:41,658
those two bolts have been
shaken out.

340
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,659
Oh, cock.

341
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:52,659
Still going on,
still more mountains.

342
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,659
When will this end?

343
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,658
Oh, my God, it gets steep.

344
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:03,658
I've got to keep moving,

345
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:09,658
if I stop, pulling away will
kill the clutch, I'm sure of that.

346
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,658
OK, my temperature gauge is now
really very high.

347
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,658
I'm looking for a little stream.

348
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,658
'Still, at least the mood
was more cheerful than it

349
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,659
'was at the back of the convoy.'

350
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:34,658
BLEEP.

351
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,659
BLEEPING second gear failed, and now
the engine has BLEEP BLEEP arse.

352
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,659
You piece of BLEEP.

353
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:49,658
'With some careful nursing,
Jeremy and I eventually reached

354
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:54,659
'the summit, where there was
one hell of a reward.'

355
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:00,659
That is insane.

356
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,658
Never seen views like it. Not as
extensive. Not all at the same time.

357
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,658
What have we got here?
Himalayas. Yeah. Austria.

358
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:31,658
Bit of Scotland going on there. Quite
a bit of Scotland. And the sky.

359
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:36,659
Enormous. Like a sky from Texas.
Texas sky. But bigger. Much bigger.

360
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,659
Absolutely staggering.

361
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:48,659
'Sadly, though, the piece
of the moment was then shattered.'

362
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,064
The A-MAY van has arrived.

363
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,659
He's in a rile.

364
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,658
Mate, you've got the crane here.

365
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:07,659
BLEEP! Heap of dog BLEEP!

366
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,658
Don't say anything.
I don't think he's very happy.

367
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:15,658
You know the old Buddhist
expression, don't you?

368
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,659
He who tips a man out of his lorry
will suffer from many breakdowns.

369
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:26,658
From here to the border
with Thailand it was downhill

370
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,658
all the way.

371
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,658
Which for me, at least,
was a bit alarming.

372
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,659
Oh, God. Look at that road now.

373
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,659
No brakes, no brakes.

374
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:42,658
If your brakes went entirely
would you stay with it

375
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,658
and hope you could sort it out
or would you bail out?

376
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:49,659
I'm actually sitting here
planning that very thing.

377
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,658
I've planned my bailout already.

378
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:57,658
I've even practised
lunging for the door handle.

379
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,658
I've got an image of James
punching his lorry all

380
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,659
the way down the slopes as they fell.

381
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:17,658
Amazingly, we all made it to the
bottom of the mountain in one piece.

382
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:19,659
Nearly.

383
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,659
And now we were
only 40 miles from the Thai border.

384
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:31,659
Oh, this is it.
We are about to leave Burma.

385
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,659
I'm gonna miss it.

386
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:16,658
Soon we cross the border
into Thailand and this meant

387
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:22,658
we were now just 90 miles from our
finishing line at the River Kwai.

388
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,659
19 miles of easy-going
on smooth roads.

389
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,658
Oh, it's hammered your tyre!
Your tyre is...

390
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,659
It's detonating, mate.

391
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,659
It's hard to explain to you...

392
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:55,659
I'm not giving up. I'm not stopping.
How many wheels do I need?

393
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:04,659
Happily, the rest of my tyres stayed
inflated and as darkness fell...

394
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,659
..we finally reached our destination.

395
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,658
I believe we are at the River Kwai.

396
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:18,659
The crane is here, everybody.

397
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:24,658
It's bolted onto a BLEEP lorry
but never mind that.

398
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,659
My brain is frazzled.

399
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:35,658
to the lorry struggling and screaming
and straining to climb another hill.

400
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:37,659
Ah, ah, ah!

401
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:42,659
I am going to sleep for 1,000 years.

402
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,658
Has my spine come out
of the top of my head?

403
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,658
I can't see because my eyes
have been shaken loose.

404
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:56,658
I think my pelvis has
moved around in my body.

405
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,658
I'm not surprised in your lorry.
It doesn't work.

406
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:01,658
Your pedals are all different.

407
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:04,658
Releasing the clutch is that.

408
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:07,658
It's like a Masonic dance thing
that I have to do every time.

409
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,659
You know those power plates in gyms
that make you stupid?

410
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,658
There's also a psychological thing,

411
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,658
every time I hear a diesel engine
start I have a nervous twitch.

412
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,658
Manual gearboxes. What?

413
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,658
You have ruined me and my life.

414
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,659
The gearbox is too far...

415
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,658
"The Prisoners Of War
walked to their bridge site,

416
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,659
"you have driven here so shut up."

417
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,659
"Work on the bridge starts at 0500."
What?!

418
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,658
"0500 and you can't go home

419
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:50,658
"until all three lorries
have driven over it."

420
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,658
0500. What's the point?
We're not still in the war.

421
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,659
What's the point of 0500?
It will only be a little river.

422
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:06,658
The next morning at precisely 0500..
and 11,

423
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:09,659
we discovered just how wrong
we were.

424
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:27,658
It is much wider than I thought
it was going to be.

425
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:33,659
I thought it would be a comedic
gully. I did. It's 100 times wider.

426
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:41,658
We were going to need a 60m bridge
so James went off to make plans

427
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:46,658
and Hammond and I decided to measure
the depth of the water.

428
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:49,659
Well, when I say Hammond and I...

429
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,658
I'm approaching plumb depth.

430
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,659
Ah! Broach the plumb... Oh! Ah!

431
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,658
It's ever so cold.

432
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,658
I hate my job!

433
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:05,658
In Bridge On The River Kwai
did Alec Guinness go,

434
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:07,658
"Oh, it's ever so cold!"

435
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:11,659
I bet he did in reality.
Oh! I bet he did in reality.

436
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:17,658
Oh! Sadly, at this point my colleague
was carried away by the current.

437
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,658
Swim, man!

438
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:20,658
I am!

439
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:23,658
You're the weakest swimmer
in the world.

440
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:27,658
And since he was providing
no useful feedback,

441
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,658
I went to check on James's plans.

442
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,658
This is what I was thinking.

443
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:35,658
The bank goes down at each
side obviously,

444
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,658
we build up the approach area
with these baskets of stones,

445
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:42,658
make vertical piles out of bamboo
like this, these longerons

446
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,658
I'm calling them, they are bamboo
lashed together,

447
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:47,658
these will go this way...

448
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:50,658
Two tracks for the wheels,
the rest is immaterial

449
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:53,658
and then a superstructure like this

450
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:54,658
all adding strength.

451
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:59,658
You know the sort of thing so
that it looks a bit like the film.

452
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,658
Basically we need to start
with rocks

453
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:04,658
and some wire mesh to make boxes
to put them in.

454
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,658
Where are we getting rocks from?

455
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:09,659
That's your job
because you have the tipper lorry.

456
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:13,658
I set about making
the wire mesh baskets,

457
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:17,659
freed up the space in Jeremy's
cargo bay...

458
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,658
May, you imbecile!

459
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:23,658
And when Hammond finally returned,

460
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:27,659
I sent them both off to a nearby
quarry to get the rocks.

461
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:33,658
You've put them in the front
of this one.

462
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,658
Yeah, stick them in the front.

463
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:38,659
Let's have these ones here.

464
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:43,658
Jeremy...
Are you going to do anything?

465
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:48,659
What can I do? Load the trucks.
He's loading them!

466
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:54,658
With the trucks loaded,
Jeremy finally got off his backside

467
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:57,658
and immediately started to shout
at me.

468
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:00,658
Hammond! You idiot.

469
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,658
What?

470
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,659
You put about 400 tonnes of rocks
and it is stuck.

471
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:12,658
I woke you to say are you going to
help with the loading?

472
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,658
Your words were,
"There's nothing to do!"

473
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,658
That's exactly the kind of issue
you should have been awake for.

474
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:21,658
How do I know what your load is?
I don't know.

475
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:24,659
The only solution was to tip
some of the rocks out.

476
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:30,658
Oh, no, no, no!

477
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:34,659
Oh, my. That's a remarkable accident.
Look...

478
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:38,658
Oh, jeez, no.

479
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:44,659
Your windscreen has come out.

480
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,659
The breeze will be nice!

481
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:55,659
Predictably, when we got back, James
was overflowing with sympathy.

482
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:07,659
Did you head-butt it? But look...

483
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:15,659
Richard and James began to load
their basket by hand.

484
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,658
Oh, that's a big rock.

485
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:22,659
But I'm allergic to manual labour
so I used horsepower instead.

486
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:30,659
And then I went into town
to buy supper.

487
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:34,659
Is this a marrow?

488
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,658
A...? Name...

489
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:45,659
This is... Crikey, is it?
I thought it was a marrow.

490
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,658
That's something you learn. In
Thailand, the word for... Yes, that.

491
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,659
That's the word for marrow.

492
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:59,659
When I returned, I brought with me
a gang of local labourers.

493
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:01,658
What are you doing?

494
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:05,658
There's no way we're going to be
able to build this bridge
by ourselves, let's be reasonable.

495
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:07,658
He's right, Hammond.

496
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:11,658
You and I are not going to be able
to build this bridge by ourselves.

497
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,658
I know.
Hello, officers won't work.

498
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:17,658
Alec Guinness made that very
plain in Bridge On The River Kwai

499
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,658
in the film.

500
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:22,658
That was the whole premise of the
story is that officers won't work.

501
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:28,658
You're an officer?
Of course I'm an officer.

502
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,659
Because you've got a stick.
That stick may disappear quite soon.

503
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:40,659
With the local chaps helping, James
and I started to make good progress.

504
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:01,658
As we toiled away,

505
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:07,659
the self-appointed officer seemed to
be setting up a children's tea party.

506
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:12,658
What are you doing now?

507
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:18,658
Well, it's a trick I learnt from
the British in Burma in the 19th century,

508
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:23,658
they would employ some local young
chap, cover him in jam,

509
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:26,658
he would follow them around all day
and he'd attract the insects.

510
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,658
They called him a jam boy.

511
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,658
This is my jam bear.
It doesn't seem very fair.

512
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:36,659
It was, it was because at the end
of the day he got to keep the jam.

513
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:47,658
At the end of our long difficult
day, I produced my delicious supper.

514
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:50,658
It smells very good, Clarkson,
what is it?

515
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:54,658
Mm, I'll whisper it to you because I
can't say it in front of the viewers.

516
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,658
What? She just looked at me
and went...

517
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:02,658
What did you say? Steady on!

518
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,658
I'd even prepared a treat
for Hammond.

519
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:08,659
For afters I've got you something
very special indeed. What?

520
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:14,658
I know you're partial to
a bit of Black Cock. Oh, yes.

521
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:17,658
And so I've managed to find...

522
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:19,658
Oh, you hero.

523
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:23,658
Oh, well done. Black Cock.
Stiff one? Yes, please.

524
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:27,658
Get that down your neck.
Cheers.

525
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:29,658
Bottoms up.

526
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,658
I'll tell you what, I'm going
to sleep tonight. Absolutely.

527
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:34,659
I am worn out.

528
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:42,658
The next morning, the dawn light
reveals just how little

529
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:43,659
we had achieved.

530
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:50,659
So, before the morning mist had
cleared, everyone was hard at work.

531
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:53,659
Well, when I say everyone...

532
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:21,659
Morning, May. Good morning. Are you
actually going to do any work today?

533
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:27,658
I have explained this to you
until I'm blue in the face.

534
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:30,659
Officers won't work.

535
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:39,659
Guys!

536
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:43,658
May?

537
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:45,659
Can you hear something?

538
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:48,658
I need a poo!

539
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:53,659
Guys, I've had a thought.
It turns out officers will work.

540
00:43:55,659 --> 00:44:00,658
After they released me...
Right, work. Remains available.

541
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:05,658
I immediately decided we needed more
labour-saving machinery so I rented

542
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:10,659
a digger for Hammond and I went for
something that would humiliate May.

543
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:25,659
James has totally wasted his time
bringing that crane here.

544
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:30,659
Go on, son!

545
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:33,659
Oh, no!

546
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,659
BLEEP! BLEEP!

547
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:49,658
What was that? It fell over, James.
What have you done?

548
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:52,658
Hold on a minute! Did you see
where the end of your jib landed?

549
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:55,658
I had only walked back
to see where the pile was.

550
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,658
If I'd still been standing there,
it would have taken my head off!
It fell over! It almost killed me!

551
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:02,658
What do you mean, "It fell over"?
They don't fall over, crane lorries!

552
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,658
They don't fall
over on the motorway!

553
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:06,658
What do you mean,
it doesn't fall over?

554
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:09,658
You knocked it over!
Your crane is too small,

555
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:12,658
so, I've got a bigger one
to reach further into the river.

556
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,659
Right. My crane is too small.
That's punishable by death, is it?

557
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:21,658
After James had calmed down a bit,
we decided to solve the problem

558
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:26,658
by using the combined power of
Richard's digger and the A-May Van.

559
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:30,658
In three, two, one...

560
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:32,659
Lift away!

561
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:48,658
Oh!

562
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,658
Yeah!

563
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:54,659
But, with stronger cables, we soon
had my crane the right way up.

564
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:58,659
Excellent. And back to work.

565
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,659
Just use this as
an enormous hammer so...

566
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,659
Just delicacy, this.

567
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,658
Oi!

568
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,658
That little insect that he's dragged
all the way here

569
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,659
is simply getting in our way.

570
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:35,659
Oh, well done, Hammond.

571
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:37,659
Hang on.

572
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:42,659
That's the ticket! Hammond!
Come on, James, out you come.

573
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:47,658
Spiky things!

574
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:50,658
Even though we were now
working as a team, and the bridge

575
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:55,659
was starting to take shape, we were
still way behind James' schedule.

576
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,658
This side, the blue pegs, represents
how far we should have got by now.

577
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:04,658
The red pegs show how far
we actually have got.

578
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:05,658
Obviously not far enough.

579
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,659
It's worse than I thought.

580
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,658
So, the three of us worked
on into the night.

581
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:14,658
This long? This is long.

582
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:16,658
That's to go to Hammond.

583
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:19,658
Whoa, stop there. A bit further.
I've got it, I've got it.

584
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:23,659
And even though we went to bed
exhausted...

585
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:28,659
..Sleep for Jeremy and I was
impossible.

586
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,659
Clarkson!

587
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:46,659
Funny!

588
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:49,659
You funny man!

589
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,658
We were even funnier
getting him back in.

590
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:57,658
I think it's the red one.
Is it the red one? I don't know.

591
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:00,658
Right, so, hang on,
I've got one with, like, a circle.

592
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:01,658
This one looks like an alien.

593
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,659
That bottom one swivels. Jeez...

594
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:07,658
No, the bottom one!

595
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:08,659
Waargh!

596
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,659
James, you're falling out your tent!

597
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,658
He's fallen in!

598
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,658
Help!

599
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:20,659
That's an alarm clock, isn't it?!
Oh, sorry, James!

600
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:25,658
The bottom of this river's
made out of turds. I know.

601
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:27,659
Yeah.
Try not to drink more than a pint.

602
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:32,658
As I was carried away
by the current, I noticed

603
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,658
that the end of the bridge was
now beyond the reach of our cranes.

604
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:39,659
So when I returned,
we built a home-made piledriver.

605
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:46,658
Mounted it to a home-made barge...

606
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,659
And kept right on going.

607
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:56,659
Oh, no!

608
00:48:58,659 --> 00:48:59,659
BLEEP!

609
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:03,658
Get it, stop it, stop it! James!

610
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:05,658
I can't stop it!

611
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:08,658
Get it, get it.

612
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:09,658
Our bridge! Our bridge!

613
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:10,659
Whoa!

614
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,658
Quickly, go! Let's get it.

615
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:17,658
Took hours!

616
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,658
I've got it!

617
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,659
Hold on!

618
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:27,658
Oh, no! No! No!

619
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:30,658
That was a deep bit!
I'm drowning in BLEEP!

620
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:31,659
Oh, no!

621
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:36,659
Man overboard!

622
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:39,658
How the hell are we
ever going to...?

623
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:41,658
This is worse!

624
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:44,659
Abandon bridge! I'm getting back...
BLEEP!

625
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:46,659
BLEEP!

626
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:52,659
Once we were back ashore, we
gathered for an emergency meeting.

627
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,658
I presume it was one of these
that gave way.

628
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:01,658
The piling. But why did it?

629
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:02,658
Come on.

630
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:06,658
Would it help focus our minds
more on the problem

631
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:09,658
if we had a shot of Hong Thong?

632
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:12,658
Yes. Or we could have a Red Cock.

633
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:14,658
We haven't had that.

634
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:15,658
You got any white spirit?

635
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:17,658
Yes, I have.

636
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:20,658
I just don't get it.

637
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:23,659
If one of the piers was wrong,
that would do it.

638
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:32,658
If we used... What if we used more of
those whatever you call them,

639
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,659
those bags of...

640
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:42,658
I'm not helping him cough. What if
we use more of those bags of stones

641
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:47,658
to protect the bamboo
pillars from the current?

642
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:51,658
That White Spirit, by the way,
actually IS white spirit!

643
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:53,659
You're kidding?! What?
It's for cleaning brushes.

644
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:01,658
'We carried on with the build
and as the long, hot days passed,

645
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,658
'the bridge inched closer to the
opposite bank.'

646
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:08,659
There you go.

647
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:14,659
Oh! He's gone through the ramp.

648
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,658
Who here would like
an ice cold beer?

649
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,659
Oh, yes, please.

650
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:32,658
'But, as we passed the two
thirds point,

651
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:36,659
'I was forced to call another
emergency meeting.'

652
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:40,658
What's the matter?

653
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:43,658
Well, you know, we thought
we were building a bridge over

654
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:45,658
the River Kwai, which is noble?

655
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:47,658
We are. We're not.

656
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:49,659
The name of THAT river...

657
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:56,659
The Kok?

658
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:01,659
Top Gear is building a bridge
over the River Kok.

659
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,658
It's actually memorable.

660
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:11,658
It is, you wouldn't order the wrong
film from an Internet website.

661
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,658
You'd be very careful if you
were. How is BBC presentation...

662
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:16,658
You know the woman at the beginning
of every programme.

663
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:19,658
"And tonight, Jeremy, James
and Richard build a bridge

664
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:20,659
"over the River Kok"...

665
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:24,659
Well, we're not moving it!

666
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:30,658
'At this point we had been
at the site

667
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:32,658
'for what seemed like an eternity

668
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:34,658
'and we were desperate to get home

669
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:37,658
'so we were working
round the clock.'

670
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:39,658
Got it? Yeah. That's a heavy...

671
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,659
That's a bit denser, that one.

672
00:52:44,659 --> 00:52:45,658
I hate bamboo.

673
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:46,658
I hate bamboo.

674
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:48,659
So much.

675
00:52:58,659 --> 00:52:59,658
You know,

676
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:02,658
after that drive through Burma,

677
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,658
I was left with

678
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:08,658
an enormous amount of respect
for long-distance lorry drivers.

679
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:09,658
But...

680
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,658
Here, now,

681
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:14,658
I have even more respect for those
prisoners of war...

682
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,658
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

683
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:19,658
I mean, let's be honest,
shall we,

684
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:21,658
we are eat eating here at night.
Yeah.

685
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:25,658
We haven't got dysentery
and we haven't got cholera. No.

686
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:28,658
And we're not been beaten, daily.
No, no.

687
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:31,658
This is difficult, hard, hot work...

688
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:35,658
But nothing... No... at all...

689
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:38,658
You know that metal box. Yeah.

690
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:42,658
There was a guy called
Captain Drauer

691
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:46,658
who broke the camp commandant's
table.

692
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:49,658
He was sentenced to life underground
and they buried him

693
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,658
in one of those metal boxes with
a metal roof exposed to the sun

694
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:56,658
and he was in there for 76 days.
Oh, God.

695
00:53:56,659 --> 00:54:00,658
He had a broken arm when they put
him in and when they got him out

696
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:02,659
the rats had eaten most of one
of his feet.

697
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,659
It just beggars belief.

698
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:27,658
'As the sun rose on the 15th day,

699
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:31,658
'after the hardest work any of us
had ever done,

700
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:33,659
'the bridge was finished.'

701
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:46,658
That is a proud moment.

702
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,658
But...

703
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:50,659
There's a slope on it.

704
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:54,659
You're right.
It's definitely higher on that side.

705
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:00,658
'We decided to ignore the slope

706
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:03,658
'and move straight to the
opening ceremony.'

707
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:06,658
In three, two, one...

708
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:07,659
I declare...

709
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:10,659
..the bridge open.

710
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:14,658
What a moment.

711
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,658
And James May,
you shall cross it first.

712
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:18,658
Why am I crossing it first?

713
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:21,658
Because I just said, "James May,
you shall cross it first".

714
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:24,659
He did, he said that. I did, didn't I?
You did, you said that. Definitely.

715
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,658
Right...

716
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:33,658
Lucky elephant, lucky owl,

717
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:35,659
Buddha, here we go.

718
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,659
Oh, yeah.

719
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:55,659
I on the bridge over the River Kok.

720
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:08,658
This is genuinely the most nerve
wracking thing I've ever done.

721
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:12,658
James, you are perilously...
Does he realise?

722
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:14,658
He's a long way over to the right.

723
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:16,658
Just keep calm,

724
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:18,658
keep calm.

725
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:21,659
Oh, my God! It's squirreling.

726
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:26,659
Oh! They're bending.

727
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:30,001
I'm more than halfway across.

728
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,659
BLEEP

729
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:40,658
All I've got to do is get down here.

730
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:43,658
I just got to get down here.

731
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:45,658
I've almost done it.

732
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:47,659
Please...

733
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:55,659
I'm over the River Kok
on our own bridge!

734
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:00,658
Yee-ha!

735
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:01,659
Come on!

736
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:04,658
Can you go next?

737
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:07,658
Yes, I will go next. Yes?

738
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:10,659
Yes, because your lorry is a lot heavier
than my lorry and will weaken it.

739
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:13,659
I didn't think of that.

740
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:22,658
I have a policy here,
speed and power.

741
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:25,658
Because, in my mind,

742
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:26,659
speed makes you lighter.

743
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:31,057
I'm approaching the bridge now.

744
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:34,658
Here we go.

745
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:39,658
Taking your first ever gear change
on the bridge over the River Kok

746
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:40,659
and I bolst it up!

747
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,659
Getting to close to the middle.

748
00:57:49,659 --> 00:57:51,659
Oh, the splintering noises.

749
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:56,659
I'm weakening it for Hammond!

750
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:01,659
Yes! Come on sports lorry!

751
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:05,658
Yes!

752
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:08,658
My sports lorry has broken its door

753
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:13,658
but it is across and is bouncing to
celebrate the moment.

754
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:16,659
Yes!

755
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:22,659
'Now it was the turn of the heaviest
lorry of the lot.'

756
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:27,659
Oh, dear God.

757
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:33,658
This is a bridge that we built.

758
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:37,658
I mean, obviously, I want him to
fall into the Kok.

759
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:38,658
Yes...

760
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:41,658
But, if he does, we can't go home.

761
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,659
The challenge said all three
lorries doing it. I know.

762
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:50,658
This struck is supposed
to weigh 7.5 tonnes.

763
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:53,658
I don't know if that takes
into consideration

764
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,658
all the extra bits on top!

765
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:56,658
Oh, my God!

766
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,659
Oh, oh!

767
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:04,658
Oh!

768
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:06,658
Oh, I can hear it crushing.

769
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:08,659
I can feel it moving.

770
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:11,658
Oh, no, what's happened?

771
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:15,658
Oh, no!

772
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:17,658
What have I done?

773
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:20,658
It's going at this end, as well.

774
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:23,658
It's losing structure!

775
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:25,658
Oh!

776
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:27,658
It's breaking apart!

777
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:29,658
Oh!

778
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:30,886
Don't rush to the end, Rich.

779
00:59:30,887 --> 00:59:32,658
Just go in your own...

780
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:36,658
Oh!

781
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:37,659
Just tiptoe.

782
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,658
Just tread lightly.

783
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:43,658
Just tiptoe your way across.

784
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:46,658
That's it. That's it.

785
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:47,658
Light thoughts.

786
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:49,659
This way, this way.

787
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:57,658
This way a bit. This way a bit.

788
00:59:57,659 --> 00:59:59,658
This way a bit.

789
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:01,658
This way, this way,
you're going to fall off.

790
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:03,659
You're going to fall in!

791
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:09,659
Yeah!

792
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,658
Wo-ha-ha!

793
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:15,658
Yes!

794
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:17,658
Richard Hammond!

795
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,658
I've never been
glad to see you alive before

796
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:20,658
but I am now.

797
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,658
You were so close.

798
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:25,658
We did it. We did it.

799
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,658
Ow! Sorry.

800
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:28,659
Mate...

801
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:34,658
Do you know how close you were to
falling into the middle at the end?

802
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:36,658
Half a tyre.

803
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:38,658
Half a tyre over the edge.

804
01:00:38,659 --> 01:00:40,658
The fact is, though...

805
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:42,658
All three of us have done it.

806
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:45,658
With our trucks, over the river.

807
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:46,658
Here we are.

808
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:49,658
1,200 miles, built a bridge... Yeah.

809
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:51,658
..drove all three lorries across it.
Yeah.

810
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:54,359
It worked.

811
01:00:54,387 --> 01:00:58,387
Unlike the real film,
Bridge On The River Kwai...

812
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,066
...there is no bombshell.

813
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:02,066
No. No.

814
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:05,066
But there is an ending.

815
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:07,066
Thanks very much for watching.
Thanks for watching.

816
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:09,066
What a journey!

817
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:11,067
God, you were close.
