1
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,096
Tonight, 
Richard opens a glove box,

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,216
James pulls a face,

3
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,416
and I ask an important question.

4
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,057
Have you ever put
toothpaste on your testicles?

5
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:29,496
Thank you. Hello. Good evening!

6
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,536
Thank you very much, everybody.

7
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:34,816
It is a big crowd tonight.

8
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,776
Thanks very much. Thank you. Now...

9
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:41,376
last year, the big three
German car-makers,

10
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:44,376
Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW,

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,536
all brought out new hot hatchbacks.

12
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,456
And since this is a top consumer
programme

13
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,736
full of helpful buying advice,

14
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:57,577
I thought it would be a good idea
to see which one of them is best.

15
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:06,017
Well, not the Mercedes,
that's for sure.

16
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:11,897
This is the new four-wheel-drive
A45 and it's extremely powerful...

17
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:17,176
extremely nice to drive
and handsome as well.

18
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,977
But it is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

19
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:27,536
This car, with a few
options on it, is £46,000 and that,

20
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:30,576
for a hatchback, is idiotic.

21
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:33,336
It's like charging 100 quid
for a sardine.

22
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:35,976
"Oh, it is a very good sardine,
sir." I don't care how good it is.

23
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,857
I'm not paying 100 quid for a fish.

24
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:42,936
If, then, you have even half
a droplet of common sense,

25
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:47,136
you will be choosing
between these two.

26
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,297
The BMW M135...

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,576
and Volkswagen's latest Golf GTI.

28
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:57,497
Both cost around £30,000.

29
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:01,617
Both are available with three
or five doors.

30
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:05,417
Both come as standard
with many things.

31
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:12,616
And both will be as reliable and as
long-lasting as Edinburgh Castle.

32
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:15,416
You might think, then,
that they are pretty similar.

33
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,176
But they're not,
which is why I am in the BMW.

34
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:22,216
You see, the Golf has a two-litre
four-cylinder

35
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:25,976
turbocharged engine
and that's very nice.

36
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:32,016
But the BMW has a three-litre
six-cylinder turbocharged engine.

37
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:34,537
And that's even nicer.

38
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,577
Yes, the Golf is lighter.

39
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:46,657
But that is not enough to offset
the 90-horsepower disadvantage.

40
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:51,417
A point I shall now demonstrate
with a small race.

41
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:03,536
Front-wheel drive Golf is
clinging on jolly well

42
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:05,817
but frankly, it's pointless.

43
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:13,297
I can overtake any time I like.
I have the power.

44
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:21,057
And I have an eight-speed gearbox
compared to his paltry six.

45
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,816
Yes, the Prussian aristocrat

46
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:28,937
is trampling all over
the lumpen people's car.

47
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,416
There we go. Power!

48
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,057
Come on!

49
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:42,857
And there we are in front.

50
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,977
'The BMW, then, really is very
fast.'

51
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:53,616
What's more, because this is
the first hot hatchback

52
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:58,977
for 30 years to have rear-wheel
drive, you can do this.

53
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,217
Whoo-ha!

54
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,497
'So far, then, the BMW is running
rings round the Golf.

55
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:17,737
'But I then line them up for
a simple straight-line drag race.

56
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,496
'And there was a problem.

57
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,256
'A big one.'

58
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,136
Three...

59
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,816
two...

60
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:30,257
one!

61
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:39,817
Good noise!

62
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,337
With this in reverse...

63
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:52,616
'At this point,
I was feeling confident.

64
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:55,017
'But, as I hit 120mph...'

65
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:57,376
This really is...

66
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,897
Oh, BLEEP BLEEP!

67
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:20,577
Yeah, you see, the Golf won that
because this, well, it lost control.

68
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:24,256
That's what happened there.

69
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,697
Whoo!

70
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:30,617
'After this incident,
I switched to the Golf GTI.

71
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:38,456
'And I decided immediately it was
a lot better in every single way.

72
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:41,696
'Not only was it able to travel
in a straight line

73
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,696
'without spinning off..,

74
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,896
'but, thanks to its smaller engine,

75
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:48,256
'it is a lot more economical
than the BMW.

76
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:50,856
'And a lot cheaper to insure.'

77
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:54,296
In fact, because Volkswagen has
fitted this with a forward-facing

78
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:58,656
radar system that won't let
you have a low-speed crash,

79
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:05,176
this GTI is in an insurance group
five down from the previous model.

80
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:09,816
It would be more expensive
to insure a pencil sharpener.

81
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,336
'So the GTI is cheaper to run
and cheaper to buy

82
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:15,337
'and much better in
a straight line than the BMW.

83
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:19,937
'But what if you want to transport
a nuclear warhead?'

84
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:26,136
Well, what we have got here in the
boot of the Volkswagen is a warhead.

85
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,696
And as you can see,
it fits perfectly.

86
00:06:28,697 --> 00:06:35,736
But will it fit in the boot
of the BMW?

87
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:39,777
Oh, dear. Oh, dearie me.

88
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:45,176
See, this is the problem really with
rear-wheel drive.

89
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:46,616
It does rob space.

90
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:49,136
So you would have to
drive along like that.

91
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:53,137
And somebody is going to notice.
Hans Blick is, for sure.

92
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:58,816
'Things are much the same
when it comes to space in the cabin.

93
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:02,057
'The Golf can handle three
people on the back seat easily.'

94
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:06,616
But the only way you're going to get
three people in the back

95
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:10,457
of the BMW is by sawing
their legs off with a hammer.

96
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:16,176
This is not only
complicated and messy

97
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:20,856
but, in Britain at least,
it's currently against the law.

98
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,257
Come on! The bone!

99
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:32,417
One... It's probably easier
to buy the Golf, really.

100
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,416
'So the Golf is cheaper
to buy and cheaper to run

101
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,097
'and also more practical
than the BMW.'

102
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:45,856
But it's like driving around
in James May's sock drawer.

103
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:51,016
Everything is exactly where you
would expect it to be. Organised.

104
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:55,656
Blue ones, brown ones,
pink ones for special occasions.

105
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:58,456
'Don't think, however,
because it is sensible and practical

106
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:02,496
'and economical, that it's
in any way boring.' Look.

107
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:05,496
The gear lever is
a sort of golf ball shape.

108
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:08,176
You see, you Englishers,
you have the ze Monty Python

109
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,976
and ze Harry and ze Paul

110
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:13,737
but ve have a sense of humour
also with this. Ja?

111
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,696
'There's more as well.

112
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,576
'Because this particular car
is fitted with Volkswagen's

113
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,217
'optional performance pack.

114
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:29,536
'That means better brakes,
more power. A top speed of 155mph.

115
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,856
'And a trick front differential.'

116
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,856
Now we have seen clever
front differentials before

117
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:38,616
but nothing like this.

118
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,656
My foot is hard down now.

119
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,977
Coming round Hammerhead.

120
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:49,097
And there's no torque steer,
there's no understeer...

121
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:55,536
You can feel the whole car being
dragged in,

122
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,737
pulled towards the apex.

123
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,497
I've never felt anything like it.

124
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,697
A baboon could get this around here
as fast as the Stig.

125
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:20,256
'So there we are. These two
cars are not the same at all.

126
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:23,256
'One is brilliant in every way.

127
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,937
'And the other tried to kill me.'

128
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,936
Very interesting.

129
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:37,296
Plainly the car to have there.
Oh, yes. Really fascinating.

130
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:42,176
Just some questions raised.
Let's get this straight.

131
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:44,016
You don't like the BMW.

132
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:47,497
Because you can't drive
in a straight line.

133
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,657
Hark who's talking!

134
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:56,416
How fast did you say you were going?
120mph.

135
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,296
Walking pace, basically.

136
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:02,696
Listen, from the point where
it suddenly snapped sideways for no

137
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:05,656
reason, to the point where it
stopped moving, we measured it.

138
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:07,576
It was over a quarter of a mile.

139
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,536
I could have held it, I reckon.

140
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:11,856
Could you? You just aquaplaned.

141
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:14,616
Yes, but the Golf was on the same
track in the same conditions

142
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,616
and it didn't aquaplane.

143
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,057
Now, the Golf didn't aquaplane
because you weren't driving it.

144
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,496
Yes, but, Hammond,
all things considered,

145
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:28,576
the Golf is a better car.
Is it? It is, honestly.

146
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:30,336
The diff in it is remarkable.

147
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:33,296
Because you know when you go round
a corner in a car,

148
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,816
you go like that, yeah?
And it wants to push out.

149
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,856
Well, in this,
the faster you go, it comes in.

150
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:41,976
It's like Volkswagen has worked out
a way to reverse centrifugal force.

151
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:45,736
Ah, so Volkswagen have broken
science. Yes. With a diff?

152
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,376
Yes.

153
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:51,296
And now, we must find out how fast
these cars go round our track.

154
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:55,296
And that, of course, means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

155
00:10:55,297 --> 00:11:00,977
Some say that his hair is
the exact same shape as a hat.

156
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,417
And that if he worked for CNN...

157
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,456
..he wouldn't get such pitifully
low ratings

158
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:14,417
that his show got cancelled.

159
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:26,216
All we know is he is called
the Stig.

160
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:27,536
And they're off.

161
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:30,296
And for the first time this series,
it is actually dry.

162
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:31,696
First straight.

163
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,736
Will the BMW suddenly
spin off for no reason?

164
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:37,817
No, it has actually made it
to the first corner. Amazing!

165
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:42,496
Both turbocharged engines
loving this crisp dry air

166
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,617
and no fuss so far.

167
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,576
No idea what that was.

168
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,816
Right, through Chicago.

169
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:56,536
Golf's traction control can't be
completely switched off.

170
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:59,496
You can actually see it
nipping at the brakes on the way in.

171
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,697
The BMW, of course,
just being stupid.

172
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:05,736
Hammerhead -
no real dramas there either

173
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:07,136
but the Golf - yes, its magic

174
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:09,377
differential casually twisting
physics.

175
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:18,656
Right, Follow Through and yes, the
BMW is trying to spin, of course.

176
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:21,016
The Golf has a nibble of traction
control and then,

177
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:22,336
faithful as a Labrador.

178
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:24,776
Oh, the Golf brake lights flickering
there.

179
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,856
That is the traction control turning
them on, not Stig, who is still

180
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:32,056
fuming because I said a baboon could
drive as fast in the Golf as him.

181
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,496
Right, just Gambon left.

182
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:35,456
More hooliganism from the Beemer.

183
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:36,777
And across the line!

184
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:42,456
I have the times here.

185
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:46,016
Come on, then. The BMW...

186
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:49,856
The BMW went round in 1.25.1

187
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,856
so it is slower than the old
version,

188
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,216
which did it on a damp track.

189
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,776
So that's useless.

190
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,336
And the Golf GTI did a 1.28.6.

191
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:01,416
Look at that.

192
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:05,256
That's a lot slower. Yes, yes, yes.
But look. Astra, Megane RS, Focus.

193
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:08,696
It is right where hot hatchbacks
should be. This is just stupid.

194
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:12,456
This is much better. And now we must
do the news. Yes, we must.

195
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:15,216
Which is difficult, because that
means walking over there,

196
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:18,016
which is a straight line.
You could spin off and lose it.

197
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,856
Thank you, Hammond.
Don't slip. Careful. Here she comes.

198
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,696
Ladies and gentlemen,
will he make it?

199
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,696
Conditions are very
dry in the studio today.

200
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:28,177
Oh, no, he has only got to step to
go. Shut up. Yes, he has done it.

201
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,856
I thought you were going off.

202
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:34,016
Listen. It is a tricky
straight, that.

203
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:39,416
It was easy because my
shoes were not made by BMW. Really.

204
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,096
Good. Now. Do the news now, you two.

205
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,736
The news, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:46,576
Now, last week you saw Richard
Hammond driving a six-wheeled

207
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,696
Mercedes-Benz but did you know
they made another six-wheeled

208
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:52,776
car long before that one? Like
to see a picture of it? Love to.

209
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:54,576
Here it is.

210
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:56,416
Oh, right.

211
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,856
Did they not mention this, then?
Do you know, they didn't. How odd.

212
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:02,136
It is, isn't it,
because Mercedes like to go on

213
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:05,336
about their heritage and history
and they didn't mention that one.

214
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:08,416
Well, perhaps they didn't mention it
because it has got Hitler in it.

215
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,736
That is not Hitler. It is. It isn't.

216
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:14,936
No, that car was built
long before indicators were invented

217
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,176
so he is just the to do some
hand signals.

218
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,496
What signal is he doing here,
then, James?

219
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:22,537
He's saying, "Take the Third Reich."

220
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:35,616
Now. Have we got any Scottish
people here? Yes! Yes!

221
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:39,096
Would you like to step outside just
for the next few minutes? Please.

222
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:42,216
We've got a bit of a chat.
It's about Scottish independence.

223
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,696
It's just that we've heard
a lot of talk in recent weeks

224
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,776
about what Scotland would lose
if you choose to go on your own

225
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,536
but nobody is talking about what
England would lose.

226
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:52,816
And it is actually quite a lot.

227
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:56,176
Because we would lose North Sea oil,
the sub base at Faslane,

228
00:14:56,177 --> 00:15:00,696
all tramps... Oh, God.

229
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:05,136
And we'd also lose a significant
chunk of our motoring heritage

230
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,456
and I'm not talking
about the Hillmans and Talbots

231
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:09,936
that were made at the Linwood plant
just outside Paisley.

232
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,896
No, I'm talking about stuff like

233
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,696
the mighty Argyll,
Scotland's finest.

234
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,776
Wow!

235
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,616
Look at that MASTERPIECE!

236
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,616
Do you know, when that car came out,
it was the same price

237
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:26,056
as a Ferrari 308... Mm.
..and hardly anybody bought one?

238
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:28,536
Really? It is remarkable
because you look at that...

239
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:30,736
well, plastic body and you know...

240
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,656
you just look at
the way the door fits.

241
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:35,616
That is a quality product.
Isn't it? Isn't it? Oh, yeah.

242
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:38,256
What engine did it have?
Ah, now, it's interesting.

243
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:42,856
Engine-wise, you could have either
an engine from a Lancia,

244
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:46,376
a Peugeot, Renault,
you could have a Buick V6...

245
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:49,616
Basically, it was whatever turned up
in the scrap yard that week.

246
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,376
Basically, yes. Planted in there.

247
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:54,896
Well, actually, you could also have
it with the option of

248
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:59,296
a turbocharged Rover V8 and
guess how many of those they sold?

249
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:03,616
Was it none? Yes, it was none!
Absolutely none at all!

250
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:06,216
And I have to say,
it wasn't just supercars

251
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,976
where Scotland
was ahead of the game.

252
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,416
They were ahead of the curve, also,
with electric cars

253
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,656
because, way back in the day, they
made a little car called the Scamp.

254
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:14,936
I've got a picture of it here.

255
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,296
Wow!

256
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:19,656
Great Scott!

257
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:22,376
That still has the power to take
your breath away, even today.

258
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:27,016
It does. Doesn't it just? It's...
It's a rather tragic story, though.

259
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:29,976
It was made of aluminium and wood
and it was going to be sold

260
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:33,736
through Electricity Board showrooms,
which I remember, actually.

261
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,936
But when they took it to the
government test centre

262
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:39,056
to get a road-worthiness certificate
before they could put it on sale,

263
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:40,936
there was a bit of a problem.

264
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:44,736
In one test,
the government engineer noted -

265
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,336
and I've written
all the problems, here, down -

266
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:50,096
"The speedo broke,
the electric motor stopped working,

267
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,856
"the back door flew open,
the spare wheel fell out,

268
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:56,377
"the steering went wrong
and then the suspension snapped."

269
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:00,056
And that was the end of that. Aw!

270
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,777
And yet it looked so full of promise,
didn't it, there?

271
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:07,856
Now, I drove my Mercedes
down to the track this morning

272
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:10,896
and, genuinely, the most
extraordinary thing happened.

273
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,696
It didn't catch fire.

274
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,096
Really?

275
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:18,536
Now, James, you came down in your
Fiat Panda, did you not? Yes.

276
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,536
Did that catch fire?
Let me just think. No. Did it not?

277
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:25,016
No, it didn't at all. Richard, the
hire car you came down in... Yes?!

278
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,456
..did that burst into flames?
No, it didn't. Did it not?

279
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,936
Why are you in a hire car?

280
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:31,616
Because Porsche have told me

281
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,616
I'm not allowed to drive my brand-new
GT3 and they've taken it off me.

282
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:39,296
Oh, is this because,
as we mentioned briefly last week,

283
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:41,416
Porsche GT3s have been
bursting into flames

284
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,096
and now Porsche have told you
you can't drive it any more?

285
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,256
Yes, it is and you both know
full well that it is!

286
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:48,616
Well, that means you have
no use of those oven gloves,

287
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,136
which I can see down there,
which I bought you last week.

288
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,456
My Porsche driving gloves.

289
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:56,056
Have they taken it away?
Yes, they've taken it off me!

290
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,256
So, you don't need those,
but it's OK, Hammond,

291
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:02,096
because I have got you another
present. Oh, good Have you?

292
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:06,096
No, Hammond, it's a 911 tailored
specifically for you.

293
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,376
Is it

294
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,376
Yes, here it is. Look at that.

295
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:12,616
Oh, you are literally
the most amusing man

296
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:15,496
in the whole world. He is.
Even I'm...

297
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:17,337
Oh, no!

298
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:23,136
Look! It's OK,
I've got on oven gloves.

299
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:26,377
Put it out as fast as possible!
It's all right.

300
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,017
I hate you.

301
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:37,176
Right, now, em...

302
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:40,176
Yes, as we know, a great many
people in the country

303
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:42,696
are now starting to use
one of these to move about.

304
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,976
Now, this is called a bicycle

305
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:49,056
and you can tell just by looking at
it that it is very dangerous

306
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,856
and, as a result,
a lot of people are being hurt

307
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:53,176
in cycle-related injuries.

308
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:54,696
In the olden days, the government

309
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,936
would have addressed this problem
by making a public information film.

310
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,256
They used to make them
about all sorts of things.

311
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:03,576
We had 'Clunk Click Every Trip',
not to go near a railway,

312
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,416
not to play near the water...

313
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,176
Yes, there was 'Don't Run'.

314
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:10,136
They never told us not to run.
They did! They did not.

315
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:13,776
I shall show you!
We've got a clip here, look, watch.

316
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,816
'You never know
what's round the corner.

317
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,297
'So don't run.'

318
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,896
There you go. Yes... That's advice
I have heeded all my life.

319
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,736
You really took that to heart!
You haven't run since, have you?

320
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:28,696
Of course not! There might be
a pane of glass coming!

321
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:31,776
Anyway, we don't really get these
public information films any more

322
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:35,016
because of budget cuts and so on,
so Jeremy and I thought,

323
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:37,376
to help stop cyclists being injured,

324
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,856
it might be a good idea
to bring them back.

325
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:44,856
So you two are going to make a public
information film about cycling?!

326
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:46,176
Yes, we are, actually.

327
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:49,136
We went to see a panel of experts
at London's Westminster Council

328
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,256
and they said
they would be delighted

329
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,296
if we made a public information film

330
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:55,816
which would help cut
the number of injuries

331
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,296
and this is what...

332
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,337
..I came up with. Here we go.

333
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:23,337
'John works hard, which means that
he can afford to drive a car.

334
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:33,136
'That means he gets home
to his family safely every night.'

335
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:35,097
Daddy's home!

336
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,737
Thank you very much.

337
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,656
I think a work of genius, frankly.

338
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:53,336
That is terrible. It isn't!
It is! It isn't!

339
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:57,096
It is. No, it is,
which is why I fired him

340
00:20:57,097 --> 00:21:00,697
and went and had a go at making
a public information film on my own.

341
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,976
'Having come up with
a cracking idea,

342
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,296
'I appointed myself as director,

343
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:14,016
'gathered together a small cast
and crew, and set to work.'

344
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:16,376
The whole point of this is...

345
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:20,096
is to be with you on the swing
and try and look doctor-ish.

346
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,656
That pen isn't very medical,
I'm afraid.

347
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,056
Action.

348
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:27,496
I love it. Golden! Yeah.

349
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:29,656
First positions, let's go again.

350
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:32,936
If you could be opposite each other
on this three-pronged arrangement.

351
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:35,017
Arms out, singing in the rain.

352
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,376
Good... and action!

353
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:46,537
Good swinging. Nice.
I'm liking this.

354
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:52,216
'When my film was finished, Jeremy
and I went to Westminster Council

355
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:55,176

The good news is, we have
two films for you to look at.

360
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:13,816
No, we have one. No, two.

361
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:15,176
There's two.

362
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:17,736
Why don't you show them
yours first of all,

363
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:20,216
which I believe is that one there?

364
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,296
Gentlemen, if you would like to
relax whilst I just...

365
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:25,057
insert this in the machine.

366
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:38,376
Yee-hee-hee! Woo-hoo!

367
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:39,936
Waaah!

children's toys when you grew up.

00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:50,017
Oh, I did a skid!

371

You just haven't got it, have you?
Absolutely crazy.

372
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,216
Well, no,
I can see you are disappointed,

373
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,656
just in the way you're looking.

374
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:07,016
James, they are disappointed
with your work.

375
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,976
May I just play you this one, if I
may. Just let me show you this one

376
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,857
cos I think this will rectify the
problem, which has begun already.

he can afford to drive a car.

'Work harder. Get a car.'

00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:29,776
Terrible. Absolutely terrible.
Sorry, that's...

380
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,936
You just got it wrong, so wrong.
Dreadfully wrong.

381
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:35,976
Where's the cyclist? Mangled
at the end. What was the brief?

382
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:39,136
Well, we are trying to
make cycling safer

383
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:42,296
and we thought the best way to
do that is to stop people cycling.

384
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,616
But the message you should be
getting across

385
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:47,776
is that people need to
be considerate towards each other.

386
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:50,416
I'm not sure they are going
to like our poster idea

387
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,937
that we had as well,
but we came up with that.

388
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,176
We did spell it wrong.

389
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:03,176
I think we are going in entirely
the wrong direction.

390
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:06,536
Entirely the wrong direction. Have
you actually spoken to a cyclist?

391
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:07,856
Well, no.

392
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:11,417
Well, maybe that would be a good
idea, or even try it yourself.

393
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,176
'And so we put on some
cycling clothes

394
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:17,136

Come on, Jeremy! I'm behind you!

397
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:26,577
I'll sound my bell for pedestrians.

00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:31,416
Look at him, he's wearing
normal clothing, the lunatic!

399
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:35,577
You'll be killed! You're mad!
You will never make it!

400
00:24:37,497 --> 00:24:40,696
Whoo!
I nearly hit that bloke in the face.

401
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:44,256
'Our mission was to identify
the dangers that cyclists face

402
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:48,016
'on the city streets
and soon we spotted one.'

403
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:49,976
James, we've got to go right. Right?

404
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:54,296
There's a lot of peril involved
in that. Right... Be careful, James.

405
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:56,736
There is great peril.

406
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:59,576
'So, we came up with a solution.'

407
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:01,256
What if we only went left?

408
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:03,096
That's not a bad idea, actually.

409
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,416
You can still get
where you want to go by going left.

410
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,016
So we go left here, yes?

411
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:08,097
Yeah.

412
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:13,056
There is another little left here
we can do. Excellent.

413
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:17,336
I feel perfectly safe.
I feel completely safe.

414
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:20,776
No right turns,
that's the main thing with cycling.

415
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:24,176
I reckon it improves your chances
of survival by about 85%.

416
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,456
Definitely.

417
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,376
Oh, hang on.
No, I'm not sure that has worked.

418
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:32,337
I've seen Charles Saatchi having
lunch five times already.

419
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,816
'After an hour in the saddle,

420
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:38,696
'I discovered
another problem for cyclists.'

421

Oh, bump, bump!

422
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:45,137
Really bumpy here and
this is deeply uncomfortable now.

423
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:48,257
Oh!

424
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,776
Oof! Ow!

425
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:55,056
I've got to do something
about my bottom, this is really...

426
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:57,377
uncomfortable.

427
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:00,576
'So we stopped at a bicycle shop

428
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:03,376
'where, apparently,
you can buy special creams.'

429
00:26:03,377 --> 00:26:07,256
Are these all to rub onto your bits?
Yes, they are.

430
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,576
Is that normal? Yes,
we even have one for women.

431
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:12,456
Are women's bottoms different to
men's bottoms? I should think so.

432
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:13,536
Are they? Yes.

433
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:15,536
'Having selected the correct cream,

434
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:18,737
'I went to apply it
in the changing room.'

435
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:29,136
'This made everything worse.'

436
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,816
Ooh!

437
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:34,256
Have you ever put toothpaste
on your testicles for a joke?

438
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:36,336
To be honest, yes, I did,
when I was a teenager.

439
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:39,136
Yes, exactly, so did I.
Do you remember the pain? Yes, I do.

440
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:41,457
Well... Is that what it's like?

441
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,776
'James was very sympathetic.'

442
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:47,536
♪ Goodness gracious
great balls of fire! ♪

443
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:52,976
'With the pain getting worse...'
Ooh! Ow! Ow!

444
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:55,536
'..I had to make an emergency stop.'

445
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:59,656
Please may I use your lavatories?
My scrotum is on fire.

446
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:01,976
Have you ever put toothpaste
on your scrotum?

447
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:03,497
Ooh...

448
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:08,496
'With my gentleman's area sorted,
we got back on the road.'

449
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:11,296
Right, so the light just went red,

450
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,656
so that means go
when you're on a bicycle.

451
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:17,376
'And soon we were picking up
valuable information.'

452
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:21,216
Taxi driver. Very polite. Thank
you very much, sir. Another taxi.

453
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,816
Extremely polite.

454
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:25,856
Thank you.

455
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:28,536
Yeah, look at that, you see,
he politely let me go.

456
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:30,177
Thank you.

457
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:34,136
I've been riding now for three hours

458
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:38,136
and not a single car driver
has done anything annoying.

459
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:41,736
You'd imagine that cycling
around Hyde Park Corner,

460
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:44,136
which is what I'm doing now,
would be...

461
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:46,616
as dangerous as juggling chain saws,

462
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:50,576
but if you keep your eyes open
and you are courteous...

463
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,697
it's fine.

464
00:27:54,177 --> 00:27:57,256
Every car has given me a
six-foot berth, taxis, vans.

465
00:27:57,257 --> 00:27:59,696
Yes, all the cars
and vans have been very decent.

466
00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:01,576
I haven't got a complaint.

467
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:06,056
'But... there was one type of road
user who wasn't courteous at all.'

468
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:07,737
Look at this idiot!

469
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:14,816
Whoa! God above!

470
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,816
So that bus just overtook me,

471
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:20,456
so I have to now go on the wrong
side of the road and you get...

472
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:23,416
And now he's just set off! See?

473
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:27,136
And I'm stuck
on the wrong side of the road.

474
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:31,536
These are the problem, I've decided.
The buses.

475
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:33,336
Because all of the drivers think

476
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,417
they are literally
Lord God Almighty.

477
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:43,056
It's bloody murder!
Now they're giving me a wide berth.

478
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:46,176
Your bus is going to kill me!

479
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:48,376
You are going to kill me!
Keep going! Keep going!

480
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:52,496
But he is a homicidal maniac!
And another one!

481
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,896
Aargh!

482
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:56,216
Aargh!

483
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:57,736
No, don't do that.

484
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,497
Why do they put bicycles
in the bus lane?!

485
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,577
Whoa!

486
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:09,416
'And then, just to round
things off...'

487
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:14,136
Whoa! Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

488
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:17,376
What are you doing? Look,
the chain has come off.

489
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:18,697
Sorry.

490
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:23,376
I know! There's nothing much
I can do, is there? Go over here.

491
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:27,016
Why can't they build
a machine where the chain stays on?

492
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,296
You've got that derailleur miles
out of adjustment.

493
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:31,936
I don't know what you're talking
about. What is a de-rail-eum?

494
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,656
It's the thing that moves
the chain across. You've bent it.

495
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:36,176
So, the gearbox on this is broken?

496
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:38,536
We are going to have to sell it and
buy another one.

497
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:43,216
'After James had mended my geranium,
he gave me a stern lecture.'

498
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:46,736
Bicycles... The reason people
have accidents on bicycles

499
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:48,816
is cos of things like
the brakes not working,

500
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:50,256
worn out wheel bearings, bad...

501
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,496
Those out of adjustment, that out of
adjustment, this not tight enough.

502
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:55,416
It's really easy,
bicycle maintenance,

503
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,777
you only need about three spanners
and a screwdriver.

504
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:04,296
'With the fact-finding mission over,

505
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:08,377
'we felt we had become fully paid-up
members of the cycling community.'

506
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,177
Have you got the arts pages?

507
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,376
Mm.

508
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:27,056
It seems to me,
for our public information film,

509
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:33,096
what we should do is make cycling
attractive to bus passengers

510
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,016
because then there would be
no need for buses.

511
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:38,536
And they are the biggest problem
on the road.

512
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,176
Not just for cyclists
but also for cars. Yes.

513
00:30:41,177 --> 00:30:46,576
So if we get rid of buses,
remove the demand for buses...

514
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,656
We get an extra lane.
..everybody wins.

515
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:55,456
'A few days later, we cycled to the
Top Gear office to discuss

516
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:58,177
'some new ideas for our important
public information film.'

517
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:05,096
I think what that does is it
dissuades people from using the bus.

518
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08,696
Yes, but it isn't true.
It is. It isn't.

519
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,056
It is, I went on a bus once
and I got an eye infection.

520
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:14,376
Some people get diphtheria
or rickets or scurvy.

521
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:17,376
They do. It is nonsense, it is
not going to work.

522
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,256
'I then showed Jeremy something
I'd put together.'

523
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:22,496
'Hello, cyclists,

524
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,816
'I am here today to talk to you
about bicycle maintenance.

525
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,816
'Let's start with the most
important part of a bike.

526
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:30,936
'You simply rotate this adjuster

527
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:33,736
'until the brake blocks are almost
in contact with the wheel.

528
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:36,577
'Lock it with the nut and then...'

529
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:42,736
'..the chain and the sprockets
will grind together.

530
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:46,296
'Make sure there is no
play in the steering head bearings.

531
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:48,936
'If there is, if you can feel
a little clunk, clunk, clunk...'

532
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:54,336
How much more is there of this?
Well, quite a lot. How long is this?

533
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:57,856
58 minutes.
What, a 58 minute thing?!

534
00:31:57,857 --> 00:32:01,497
It is more a public information
documentary, if I am honest.

535
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:08,216
'Annoyingly, James's other ideas
were even worse.'

536
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,857
Action!

537
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:18,257
Why is he dressed up as Hitler?
Because cyclists need to be visible.

538
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:21,697
Christ on a bike!

539
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:28,816
James, you can't do that.
Yes, I can.

540
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,696
'As he brought out a cross,

541
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:33,576
'I left him alone
and went off to work on my own.'

542
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,096
One of the problems I discovered
on my fact-finding bike ride

543
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:42,216
around London is that pedestrians
simply don't hear bicycles coming.

544
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:43,576
They step off the kerb,

545
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:46,936
the cyclist has to swerve
into the path of a bus.

546
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:51,976
Blood, artery gush, burst,
court case, murder, disaster.

547
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:54,297
Bicycles, therefore,
need to be louder.

548
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:08,217
What I have done is attached to the
back of this bike a jet engine.

549
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:14,416
And now pedestrians can
definitely hear me coming.

550
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,736
And so can other motorists.

551
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:20,137
And people in subterranean caves
in other countries.

552
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:26,256
Even the profoundly deaf would know
I was on my way,

553
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:28,897
they would feel a disturbance
in the force.

554
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:34,936
Of course,
another advantage is, you don't

555
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:37,416
have to do any of that
annoying pedalling.

556
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:43,576
Again my genius is staggering me,
it really is.

557
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,857
Oh, dear, I am out of fuel.

558
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:50,216
I have run out of fuel.

559
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:51,737
That is what's happened now.

560
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:54,297
Damn.

561
00:33:57,217 --> 00:34:00,576
Think of it, really, as a hybrid.

562
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:01,897
There we go.

563
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:07,496
'For the rest of the day,
we tried all sorts of other ideas.'

564
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:08,537
Here we go.

565
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:13,257
Ooh!

566
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:21,217
What's it supposed to be?
It's a cyclist after an accident.

567
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:24,816
I couldn't use an actual cyclist,
could I?

568
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:29,136
So for example, the double
mini-roundabout, OK?

569
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:33,016
So you come round here, then it is
your right of way going up here.

570
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:34,977
But... Action!

571
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:43,736
'After a great deal of extremely
hard work, we ended up with

572
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:46,696
'a couple of films that we could
take to our panel of experts.'

573
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:49,176
Before we show them to you,
let me say,

574
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:52,496
do you remember the early public
information films from our youth?

575
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:56,136
I do. They always picked on some
very specific detail.

576
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,696
Don't put a rug on a polished
floor or don't fish under

577
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,256
power lines. They were very tight.

578
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:04,896
And so, we have tried to
focus on very specific details

579
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:11,096
of cycling that we experience.
We hope that erm...

580
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:13,977
This one first?
Yes, I think that's... OK.

581
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:22,776
'Cut the green wire. For God's sake,
do not cut the red wire.

582
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:26,217
'It is imperative
to cut the green wire.'

583
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:45,296
Well, I mean... I'm not sure we're
getting anywhere here...

584
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:47,096
What are you trying to
achieve with that?

585
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:49,416
Cyclists jump red lights,
we know this.

586
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,936
Everybody has seen that happen.

587
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:53,656
It is what annoys people
most about bicycles.

588
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:56,336
This is making the roads a happier
place because cyclists

589
00:35:56,337 --> 00:35:59,336
wait like they are supposed to,
car drivers aren't infuriated.

590
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:02,776
And cyclists don't get
knocked off or indeed blown up.

591
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:05,456
You didn't listen to what we said,
did you?

592
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,216
You said we had to make the roads
a more harmonious place.

593
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:10,896
Exploding cyclists doesn't really
get that message across.

594
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:14,576
You're really trying to waste our
time today because that is way off.

595
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:17,736
What, you want them
to jump red lights? No, we don't.

596
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:20,536
I'm talking about that commercial,
it is absolutely wrong.

597
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:24,976
Well, let's try... Yes. Yes, please.

598
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,176
This may be more to your taste then,
I think.

599
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:32,817
'I have a dream.
That all men are created equal.

600
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:35,936
'Dr Martin Luther King was shot

601
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:38,737
'and killed on the balcony
of his motel in Memphis.'

00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:43,216
♪ Imagine there's no heaven... ♪

603
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:47,096

'Jesus died on the cross for our
sins.'

607
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,297
So this is a no, isn't it?

608
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,937
'And with that,
it was back to the studio.'

609
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:31,256
So... There is no way... Come on. No.
So, you two completely cocked it up.

610
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:34,936
I don't know what was wrong
with my jet bike.

611
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:37,696
Well, it was a motor on a bicycle

612
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:41,016
and therefore it was a "motor"
cycle.

613
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:44,656
It wasn't a motorcycle,
it was superb. How fast did it go?

614
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:47,696
At one point I was clocked at 73mph.

615
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:50,696
Yes, that does sound like the top
speed of a motorbike.

616
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:53,096
He is right, you know. Thank you.
He isn't right.

617
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:57,216
And anyway, listen, eventually
we did come up with a film which

618
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:59,937
we think will keep that
panel of experts happy.

619
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:04,896
Because, in essence,
it makes everybody happy

620
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:07,536
and gooey with everybody else.

621
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:08,896
Here we go, let's have a watch.

622
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:14,216
'Cyclists get wet, cold and tired.

623
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,937
'They turn up for work with
revolting armpits.

624
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:22,056
'Their clothes are hideous,

625
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:24,297
'they have to put

626
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:29,616
'However, because three-quarters
of a million people are prepared

627
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:34,056
'to go through this misery every day,
there are fewer traffic jams.

628
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:35,976

00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,856

'for normal people.

00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:50,017
'Cyclists. Give them an inch

632
00:38:55,057 --> 00:39:00,096
No, an inch? They need 6ft.

633
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:02,896
No, Hammond, it is
a figure of speech, you idiot.

634
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:06,736
I couldn't say, you know, give them
1.85m, that is ridiculous.

635
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:09,816
The fact is, we have solved cycling.

636
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:12,736
If people weren't watching
Call The Midwife on the other side

637
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,336
tonight, there would be no more
cycling-related accidents.

638
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:17,056
So, you're saying,

639
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:21,656
watching Call The Midwife is now
socially irresponsible? Yes. It is.

640
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:23,777
And it is morally wrong. Exactly.

641
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:28,696
Anyway, it is time to put a Star
in our Reasonably Priced Car.

642
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,576
And we are going to do
something incredible.

643
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,936
For the next few minutes,

644
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,456
we are going to stop your teenage
daughter from texting.

645
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,176
And that's
because my guest tonight played

646
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,017
Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad.

647
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:46,257
Stopped already!
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Paul!

648
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:52,336
He's here.

649
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:55,976
How are you? What's up, buddy?
How are you? I'm good, I'm good.

650
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,577
Hi.

651
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:04,696
I love them. Yes,
this is a big noise. Have a seat.

652
00:40:04,697 --> 00:40:07,416
All right. Have a seat.

653
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:10,936
It is strange to
have on a guest from a show that was

654
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:13,296
never on British TV... Yeah.

655
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:16,576
..who is now in a film that
isn't even out yet. Yeah.

656
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:19,896
Everyone is screaming and yelling.
I love you all.

657
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:22,536
We love you!

658
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:26,936
Let's do the film, if we may. It is
Need For Speed. Need For Speed.

659
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:30,856
It is the story of Tobey Marshall,
the guy I play.

660
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:34,656
He spends a couple of years in prison
for something that he did not do,

661
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:38,176
so the moment he gets
out of prison it's just...

662
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:41,096
He is trying to right a wrong,
vengeance is on his mind.

663
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:44,256
He has to try and get
from the East Coast to the West Coast

664
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:47,536
in less than 48 hours
in a car, a very fast car.

665
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:50,376
What sort of car? It is
a Shelby Mustang.

666
00:40:50,377 --> 00:40:53,656
Shelby Mustang? Yeah. Well, it can
be quite fast, nice straight line.

667
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:55,936
You should be able to do that.

668
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:59,056
So it sounds like it has got
Top Gear written all over it.

669
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,456
Yeah, he wanted to do a throwback,
our director,

670
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:05,296
to films that really
started this genre.

671
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,976
Like Bullitt and Vanishing Point
and Smokey And The Bandit.

672
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:13,256
Back then they couldn't rely on CG,
they couldn't rely on green screen

673
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:17,256
so everything you see in this
movie actually happened.

674
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:20,696
There is no CGI? No CG whatsoever.
Seriously? Yeah.

675
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:22,096
Let's have a look at a clip

676
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:25,097
and you will see why I am looking
incredulous. Here we go.

677
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:28,817
'They took everything from me.

678
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:40,457
'All those who defied me...

679
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:46,017
'..shall be ashamed and disgraced.

680
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:52,617
'Those who wage war against me...
shall perish.

681
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:57,577
'I will find strength...

682
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:04,137
'..find guidance.
And I... will... triumph.'

683
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:22,496
That was all for real? Yeah, it's...
It gets pretty violent.

684
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:24,976
So it really did do a roll?

685
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:26,376
They actually did those, yes.

686
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,536
I presume these are body shells,
they are not actual... No, no, no.

687
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:32,576
..million dollar cars?

688
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:36,376
We consider those cars
a piece of art.

689
00:42:36,377 --> 00:42:40,056
But the kit cars they built
were about 300,000 a piece

690
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,576
and they just destroyed them.

691
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:43,976
That is unbelievable but forgive me,

692
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,856
I have got to get on to
Breaking Bad.

693
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:47,256
Yes.

694
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,856
Thank you.

695
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:52,696
There's quite a few puzzled faces
going, "What is Breaking Bad?"

696
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:56,136
"What is Breaking Bad?"
This is Jesse Pinkman.

697
00:42:56,137 --> 00:42:57,576
As far as I am concerned,

698
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:00,736
I am now talking to the world's
greatest crystal meth salesman.

699
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,816
Yes.

700
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:03,976
For those who don't know,

701
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:06,376
it was about a chemistry teacher who
meets a delinquent,

702
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:09,856
an ex-pupil. He's got this guy,
he has been diagnosed with cancer

703
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:13,016
and he thinks, "To pay for my
treatment I will start making

704
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:15,416
"crystal meth
cos I am a chemistry teacher."

705
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:17,176
And the series runs from there.

706
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:21,536
We don't really have crystal
meth in this country. That's great.

707
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:25,176
What is crystal meth, do you know
what it is? No, not really.

708
00:43:25,177 --> 00:43:27,616
I have been making
it for the past six years

709
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:30,776
and I have no idea what it is. No,
it is just a terrible, awful drug.

710
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,376
It just grabs a hold of some
people and just doesn't let go.

711
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:37,296
Do you know what I loved about the
show? It is the detailing in it.

712
00:43:37,297 --> 00:43:42,456
And the cars you all drove. Yes,
they are incredible. Who chose those?

713
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:44,496
It was all Vince Gilligan.

714
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,016
He is the creator of the show,

715
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,776
his attention to detail is
just incredible.

716
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:55,056
There is this famous conversation he
had for two hours about the certain

717
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:58,896
colour of red nail polish that was
going to go on Skyler's toenails.

718
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:01,856
He was going to get the cars right
because Walter,

719
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:05,376
who is the chemistry teacher,
has a Pontiac Aztek. Yes.

720
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:08,417
Never been sold here
but it was probably the worst car.

721
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:14,496
It is just such a sad car. Look at
it. Look at that, it is just so sad.

722
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:18,097
It is a sign that your life has gone
terribly, terribly wrong.

723
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:21,456
It was interesting with you

724
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:24,936
because you started out with
a Chevy Monte Carlo, wasn't it? Yes.

725
00:44:24,937 --> 00:44:26,176
When you were a delinquent.

726
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,296
But when you became more
and more successful,

727
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:29,816
switched to the Toyota Tercel.

728
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:31,016
Look at that.

729
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:33,616
I actually wanted that car so bad
when we wrapped.

730
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:39,136
Were you able to keep it? No, they
didn't allow me to take it. Why not?

731
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:40,577
It is worth 32.

732
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:44,896
That is shocking, but it is that
attention to detail which

733
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:48,016
I absolutely adored, I really did.

734
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:51,576
Now, more questions about Breaking
Bad, which fascinates me.

735
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:56,896
About American television. We know
that US networks, they are brutal.

736
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:58,537
One minute...

737
00:45:01,537 --> 00:45:06,017
You've got a chat show... Um...

738
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:11,296
Who are you talking about? Did you
know Piers Morgan? Oh, yeah! Yeah.

739
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:13,336
I had a feeling you were
talking about him.

740
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:16,136
Where I was going, really -
you have got these US networks,

741
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:20,056
presumably Breaking Bad was only
ever going to be one series.

742
00:45:20,057 --> 00:45:23,136
They would have only commissioned
one, to see how it works? Yeah.

743
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:28,896
Every network passed on Breaking Bad
initially. HBO Showtime, everyone.

744
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:32,496
And then AMC decided to give it
a shot. With one series?

745
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:37,336
With one pilot. And then they had to
see how that was, how it turned out.

746
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:42,016
I mean, we were lucky we even stayed
on the air because our ratings

747
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:45,176
weren't that great.
But the critics loved us. So...

748
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,456
No, it was very clever.
Absolutely brilliant.

749
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:51,296
Thank you. Now, your cars in real
life - not a Toyota Tercel?

750
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:53,056
You started out with a Toyota,
I believe?

751
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:58,736
I did, I started out with an '82
Toyota Corolla. Mm-mm Yeah.

752
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:01,656
It was beautiful. Was it
Faded gold.

753
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,736
Any time it rained,

754
00:46:03,737 --> 00:46:06,056
the trunk would fill up with water,
stick shift.

755
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:07,656
But I loved that car. Stick shift

756
00:46:07,657 --> 00:46:12,377
And I bought a Toyota Forerunner.
It's getting worse.

757
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:17,776
And then I bought an old classic
car. OK, which is?

758
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:20,816
A '65 Shelby Cobra.

759
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:22,097
Really? Oh!

760
00:46:24,497 --> 00:46:27,696
We could have... You know,
you see... The Shelby Cobra...

761
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:32,416
Oh, there it is. That is actually...
that is you in it! That is my car.

762
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:36,136
I only take it... It is my weekend
car, I take it along the coast.

763
00:46:36,137 --> 00:46:40,216
But if you are driving in a parking
lot, it sets off the alarms.

764
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,456
I love doing that. It's great.
It's fantastic.

765
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:44,336
They are absolutely fabulous.

766
00:46:44,337 --> 00:46:46,296
My daughter is going to be
mental now,

767
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:49,456
because that is her favourite car
and her favourite actor driving it.

768
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:51,336
I love your daughter. Yeah.

769
00:46:51,337 --> 00:46:53,217
No, you don't. Um...

770
00:46:56,337 --> 00:46:59,816
Right, now.
Obviously you came down here...

771
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,296
This is ballsy, I've got to say,

772
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:06,576
because you have come down here to
do your lap, which is quite brave.

773
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:09,976
Yeah. Let's see how I did.
I mean, I don't know. It was fun.

774
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:12,176
Shall we have a look at the lap?
Oh, God!

775
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:14,737
Yeah.
Here we go.

776
00:47:16,977 --> 00:47:19,736
Wow, that is a brutal start.

777
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,857
All right,
I just don't want to get last.

778
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:27,936
Setting high goals for myself.
Not to get last.

779
00:47:27,937 --> 00:47:30,816
No, it's OK, because for the first
time ever this year,

780
00:47:30,817 --> 00:47:33,377
the weather is good.

781
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:38,456
That thing does grip well. Here
we go. Yeah.

782
00:47:38,457 --> 00:47:41,337
It's OK, it's OK. Yeah.

783
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:46,017
Come on. Tongue out.

784
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:50,976
Oh, that is a very good line
around there. Thank you.

785
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:56,057
Very nice. The dreaded Hammerhead,
I hate this turn.

786
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,896
That is heavy braking you are giving
it there! Yeah. Well, you know.

787
00:48:02,897 --> 00:48:06,017
Oh, that is very,
very neat and tidy.

788
00:48:07,377 --> 00:48:08,857
Come on, you...

789
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:12,376
..bitch!

790
00:48:12,377 --> 00:48:14,816
We knew it!

791
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:18,337
No way were you going to get round
the lap without saying THAT!

792
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:26,296
Ooh, the comfortable line,
missing the apex.

793
00:48:26,297 --> 00:48:28,496
Second-to-last corner,
this catches...

794
00:48:28,497 --> 00:48:31,176
Well, that was absolutely bob on.

795
00:48:31,177 --> 00:48:35,296
Now, Gambon, again kissing
everything perfectly

796
00:48:35,297 --> 00:48:36,737
and you cross the line!

797
00:48:38,817 --> 00:48:43,417
Ah-h-h... Well, now.

798
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:46,336
These are the wet times.

799
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:49,016
You will not be last,
because Jack Whitehall, bless him,

800
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:52,376
he had never driven before.
So you will not be lower than him.

801
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:56,376
OK, good. So, where do you think you
came? I have no idea.

802
00:48:56,377 --> 00:49:01,736
I want to be above James Blunt.
James Blunt was 1.49.4.

803
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:04,856
That is FW,
which stands for flipping wet.

804
00:49:04,857 --> 00:49:06,816
So you are definitely going to the
above him.

805
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:08,016
So come on, be reasonable.

806
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:10,856
I mean, I would like to be
towards the top, but...

807
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:14,096
That is the 1.45 region. Yeah.
I mean, I don't know...

808
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:15,616
Do you know, I was just about to
say,

809
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:17,497
"Well, Jesse Pinkman..."
But I won't.

810
00:49:18,857 --> 00:49:21,016
Aaron Paul. Yes. 1...

811
00:49:21,017 --> 00:49:22,537
forty...

812
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:29,656
- ..4...
- Ooh!

813
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:31,297
Oh! ..7.

814
00:49:32,297 --> 00:49:34,176
That is the best we've ever had!

815
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:36,976
Number one.

816
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:39,576
Come here. Yes! Wow!

817
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:43,416
That's good. Good man. Yes!

818
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:46,736
The fastest man ever to take
the Astra around the track.

819
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:50,297
That's amazing.
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Paul!

820
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:59,056
Now, that is going to take some
beating!

821
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:03,856
This is the £650,000 Porsche 918.

822
00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:05,576
It is insanely fast.

823
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:10,696
It's rammed full of technology
and most importantly, it is a hybrid.

824
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:14,376
In many ways, then, exactly the same
as the McLaren P1 that Jeremy

825
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:17,056
fell in love with a few weeks back.

826
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:20,256
The big question, though...
Is it any good?

827
00:50:20,257 --> 00:50:22,817
No!

828
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:34,136
When Jeremy tested the P1, he took
it to the Spa racetrack in Belgium.

829
00:50:34,137 --> 00:50:37,856
My F1 track may not have that
pedigree,

830
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:42,777
but at this place, at least the fun
doesn't stop when the sun goes down.

831
00:51:15,097 --> 00:51:19,696
The Abu Dhabi circuit is also
famed for having a 1.2km straight,

832
00:51:19,697 --> 00:51:22,096
one of the longest anywhere.

833
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:25,256
Seems like a good place to start.

834
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:27,097
Let's make some noise.

835
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,537
Oh, that is breathtaking!

836
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,097
Oh, ha-ha-ha!

837
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:45,096
9,000rpm.

838
00:51:45,097 --> 00:51:46,697
Boom!

839
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,536
Yee-nar!

840
00:51:51,537 --> 00:51:53,296
Big speed!

841
00:51:53,297 --> 00:51:54,817
280.

842
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:58,537
Braking...

843
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:04,016
Oh, that is... That is
acceleration unlike anything else.

844
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:07,856
I know Jeremy's head was blown off
by the speed of that P1,

845
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:13,576
but I absolutely cannot believe
that it felt any faster than this.

846
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:14,937
It can't have done.

847
00:52:19,257 --> 00:52:23,976
'Like the McLaren, the 918 has a
joint strike force of petrol engine

848
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:26,737
'and electric motors
working together.'

849
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:33,937
It's that electric power that gives
it so much punch off the line.

850
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:40,416
I have 500 foot-pound
of torque at 800rpm. 800!

851
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:43,977
The 458 doesn't
have 500 torques at any rpm.

852
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:47,656
It just wakes up, it's like a
sprinter falling out of bed

853
00:52:47,657 --> 00:52:49,976
and going straight into
a world record

854
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:52,216
while the others
are eating cornflakes

855
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:54,056
and thinking about having a poo.

856
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:57,576
'The petrol engine,
which sounds ungodly through those

857
00:52:57,577 --> 00:53:00,376
'top-mounted exhausts,

858
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:05,257
'is a 612 horsepower 4.6 litre V8.'

859
00:53:10,097 --> 00:53:13,176
On the topic of power
and performance,

860
00:53:13,177 --> 00:53:17,017
the 918 and the P1
can trade punches all day long.

861
00:53:20,977 --> 00:53:26,657
The 918 can't match the P1's top
speed, 218 compared to 211.

862
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:36,056
'But I get to 60 quicker.
2.6 seconds to his sluggish 2.8.'

863
00:53:36,057 --> 00:53:42,097
I've got 875 brake horsepower and the
P1 has 903, but I've got more torque.

864
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,937
And on and on and on it goes.
It's King Kong versus Godzilla.

865
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,696
'There are some areas, though,

866
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:08,096
'where the 918 definitely has
the P1 on the ropes.

867
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:11,056
'It can retrieve energy
generated by braking

868
00:54:11,057 --> 00:54:14,016
'and feed it back into the batteries.

869
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:18,816
'The roof lifts out so you can enjoy
some open-top cruising.

870
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:22,816
'And inside, you get some actual
creature comforts,

871
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:27,136
'like electric seats
and an 11-speaker sound system.

872
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:30,496
'You don't get either of those
on a P1.'

873
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:34,536
I am not one to gloat,
but hello, glove box, yeah?

874
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:38,176
And then this centre console, from
where I can control the top screen.

875
00:54:38,177 --> 00:54:40,856
That does many things up there.

876
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:43,576
And then over 800 functions can be
controlled

877
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:46,296
from the touch-sensitive screen
down here.

878
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:47,616
Maybe I can go online

879
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:51,736
and order Jeremy a set of spanners to
adjust the seat on his P1.

880
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:53,737
Look up "old-fashioned" for me.

881
00:54:57,577 --> 00:55:00,736
'In addition to the
wealth of on-board amusements,

882
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:04,497
'the 918 also has many driving
modes.'

883
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:08,097
Right now,
I am in fully electric mode.

884
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:13,256
And I can whisper
around like this for 18 miles,

885
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:16,696
compared to the P1's seven.

886
00:55:16,697 --> 00:55:19,617
But if I go down here,
I can select hybrid.

887
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:23,536
And that allows it to
alternate between petrol

888
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:26,216
and electric in the most
efficient way.

889
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:31,976
Or we've got sport mode, where
we have petrol power all the time.

890
00:55:31,977 --> 00:55:35,976
But, I'm here on this racetrack,
so let's go one further.

891
00:55:35,977 --> 00:55:37,417
Put it in race mode.

892
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:44,696
'Now the petrol engine is top dog.

893
00:55:44,697 --> 00:55:47,377
'The electric motors
are acting as its wingmen.'

894
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:50,937
It's time to attack some corners.

895
00:55:57,537 --> 00:55:58,617
Hell's bells!

896
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:03,577
That grip!

897
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:13,136
God, this thing corners -
and I mean it - flat!

898
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:14,377
Totally flat.

899
00:56:19,097 --> 00:56:21,936
And there is none of that
bottom-clenching terror Jeremy

900
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:23,497
talked about in the P1.

901
00:56:28,617 --> 00:56:32,056
'Partly, that is because where the P1
is rear drive only,

902
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:37,497
'the 918 has four-wheel-drive
and four-wheel steering.'

903
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:42,216
I think in essence yes,

904
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:46,456
the P1 is more a proper fighter
pilot, seat-of-the-pants staff.

905
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:48,976
This is altogether more civilised.

906
00:56:48,977 --> 00:56:52,337
But that does not mean it's boring,
because it just isn't.

907
00:56:56,177 --> 00:57:01,256
The back end crates away
like a rear-wheel-drive car.

908
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:02,697
Ha-ha-ha!

909
00:57:05,457 --> 00:57:06,977
What a thing!

910
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:19,096
'But even though the 918 is more
grown-up than the P1,

911
00:57:19,097 --> 00:57:22,657
'it can still boast some pretty
exciting achievements.'

912
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:25,936
The fact is,

913
00:57:25,937 --> 00:57:30,496
this car has lapped the Nurburgring
in 6 minutes 57 seconds.

914
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:33,976
That is faster than any other
road-legal production car.

915
00:57:33,977 --> 00:57:35,416
To put it into context,

916
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:40,416
a hard-core Lexus LFA did it
in 7 minutes 14 seconds.

917
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:44,776
The mighty Nissan GTR was almost
half a minute slower.

918
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:48,496
As for the P1, McLaren are saying
it has gone round in under

919
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:52,457
seven minutes, but they're not
saying an actual time.

920
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:57,416
I don't know, maybe they lost
the piece of paper it was written on.

921
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:58,457
Or something.

922
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:19,176
'With daylight coming, I locked up,

923
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:21,736
'left the keys to the circuit
under the mat

924
00:58:21,737 --> 00:58:23,737
'and went in search of breakfast.

925
00:58:26,257 --> 00:58:30,936
'Full of awe for this
incredible machine.'

926
00:58:30,937 --> 00:58:36,257
Here I am with 875bhp,
a 4.6 litre V8 that sounds...

927
00:58:37,377 --> 00:58:38,696
..like that.

928
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:42,976
And yet the CO2 emissions
are lower than a Toyota Prius.

929
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:46,016
And certainly, much lower than a P1.

930
00:58:46,017 --> 00:58:50,736
I don't know, this is just all round
a more impressive achievement.

931
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:52,816
It is more of its time.

932
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:54,296
To put it another way,

933
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:59,696
McLaren have used hybrid technology
to liven up a supercar today.

934
00:58:59,697 --> 00:59:04,817
Porsche have used hybrid technology
to save the supercar for tomorrow.

935
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:08,177
This is an important car.

936
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,616
Oh, yeah.

937
00:59:17,617 --> 00:59:21,936
There it is. I'm amazed it didn't
catch fire. Shut up.

938
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:24,296
Never mind that.
Now, listen, Hammond.

939
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:28,816
In that film, you said there is
none of the bottom-clenching terror

940
00:59:28,817 --> 00:59:32,096
when you drive this that you get
in a McLaren P1. How do you know?

941
00:59:32,097 --> 00:59:34,656
You haven't driven a McLaren P1.

942
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:37,496
I know that because after you had
driven the McLaren P1,

943
00:59:37,497 --> 00:59:40,216
you said it was a day of
bottom-clenching terror.

944
00:59:40,217 --> 00:59:41,856
I did, a bit.

945
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:45,296
But I was driving
in the pouring rain at Spa.

946
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:47,776
You were in Abu Dhabi, bone dry,

947
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:50,696
and with eight mile run-offs
on all the corners.

948
00:59:50,697 --> 00:59:54,136
The fact is, the 918 can handle its
power better.

949
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,736
Its dribble of power.

950
00:59:55,737 --> 00:59:58,136
It has barely got enough to get
out of its own way.

951
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:01,416
And how do you know that? Because you
haven't driven the Porsche.

952
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,216
Because Porsche won't let me.

953
01:00:03,217 --> 01:00:06,536
Yes, because they know, Jennifer,
you can't drive in a straight line.

954
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:09,056
We've seen it. At least
I didn't write a book about it.

955
01:00:09,057 --> 01:00:12,096
And try to milk the moment.
Enough, enough, enough.

956
01:00:12,097 --> 01:00:14,736
Let me interrupt with the solution
to all this.

957
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,056
Because later on in the year,
hopefully, we are

958
01:00:17,057 --> 01:00:19,296
going to make a special
Top Gear programme.

959
01:00:19,297 --> 01:00:23,016
One in which Richard and Jennifer
bring the Porsche 918

960
01:00:23,017 --> 01:00:25,656
and the McLaren P1 down to our track

961
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:28,456
and we will see
which is the fastest.

962
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:30,056
Should be quite good, actually.

963
01:00:30,057 --> 01:00:31,896
Hopefully, we will be able to put
together

964
01:00:31,897 --> 01:00:33,456
June, July sometime, around then.

965
01:00:33,457 --> 01:00:35,496
And it'll basically be
England versus Germany.

966
01:00:35,497 --> 01:00:39,936
But before then, in fact,
starting next weekend,

967
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:44,976
we have our all-new, two-part,
Top Gear Christmas special.

968
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:47,656
Yet, it is a bit late, we're sorry.
A bit late, yes.

969
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:50,096
It's an Easter special. Whatever.

970
01:00:50,097 --> 01:00:54,977
The three of us are told to build
a bridge over the River Kwai.

971
01:00:56,017 --> 01:00:58,896
But first, we have to get there.

972
01:00:58,897 --> 01:01:04,376
And that means driving all the way
across Burma in lorries that we

973
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:08,617
bought from the Internet
unseen for a few hundred quid.

974
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:11,616
And on that BURMA-shell...

975
01:01:11,617 --> 01:01:13,536
There it is... it's time to end.

976
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:16,057
Thank you so much for watching.
Good night.
