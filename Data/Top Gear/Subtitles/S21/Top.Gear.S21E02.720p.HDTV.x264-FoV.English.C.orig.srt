2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,211
Tonight:

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:14,752
Two swans move their heads about...

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,379
I eat a shoe...

5
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:19,572
and James says he's not fat.

6
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,029
I'm not fat.

7
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:29,492
Welcome, everybody.

8
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:30,732
Hello, good evening.

9
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,532
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,212
Now...

11
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:39,972
Thank you. Now, our deep
and profound love on this show

12
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:45,092
for Alfa Romeo is a
triumph of hope over reality.

13
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:48,782
We always pray that their new
models will be brilliant

14
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:51,852
but sort of know they won't be
and then they never are.

15
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:53,542
But what about this?

16
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,772
The new and very pretty 4C.

17
00:00:56,773 --> 00:01:01,003
Well, Richard Hammond has been to
Northern Italy, in the sunshine,

18
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:04,492
to find out all about it.

19
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:06,473
Jammy little bu...

20
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,062
Right, let's get this straight -

21
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:26,465
I'm in a mid-engined,
two-seater Alfa Romeo.

22
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,104
The first proper Alfa sports
car for 20 years.

23
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:39,642
And I'm driving it in Northern Italy,
on a lovely day.

24
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:42,931
In theory,
things don't get much better.

25
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:50,076
But, predictably,
there are one or two problems.

26
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:57,502
First of all,
it's going to cost around £45,000.

27
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:02,852
And that's a fair bit, especially
as you don't get a V8, or even V6.

28
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:07,342
What you do get is a turbo-charged,
reworked version of the 1.7 litre,

29
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:11,013
four-cylinder engine from a
Giulietta hatchback.

30
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,852
And under here...

31
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:17,086
Well, I don't know what's under here
cos the bonnet is bolted shut.

32
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:25,422
It's bolted shut for the same reason
this car has no power steering,

33
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:28,542
and no proper climate control -

34
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:31,263
to save weight.

35
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:33,292
That's why it has the same sort of

36
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:37,143
carbon-fibre chassis as a
Formula 1 car.

37
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:41,024
It's why there's almost no
metal in the body at all.

38
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:48,302
The upshot is,
the 4C weighs just 925kg.

39
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:52,524
That's about half what
a Mercedes SLK weighs.

40
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:01,802
And on a road like this,
that really pays dividends.

41
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:03,492
Oh, come on!

42
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:04,836
Lovely.

43
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:10,582
Because it's light,
it's unbelievably agile.

44
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,360
It changes direction like a kitten
chasing a spider.

45
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,263
And because there's no power
steering, I can feel

46
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:28,871
far more at the steering wheel and
know what the wheels are doing.

47
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:33,913
It grips...

48
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:36,743
fabulously.

49
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,772
It doesn't need a massive engine -

50
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:46,092
it's got 237 brake horsepower.
Do you know what? That is enough.

51
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,481
More than enough.

52
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:54,782
0 to 60 takes four-and-a-half
seconds.

53
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,092
The top speed is 160.

54
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:01,655
And yet, because of the lightness,
it'll do 40 miles to the gallon.

55
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,293
Drop a window, sample the noise.

56
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:12,026
Oh! Lovely little
crackle on the up-shift.

57
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,082
Oh, it's great.

58
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,212
This little Alfa is growing on me
with a speed

59
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:23,702
and ferocity that I've
never before encountered.

60
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:25,910
It's just getting under my skin.

61
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,782
Because it's not like anything
else...

62
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:32,222
Oh, my God!

63
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:33,588
What?

64
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,772
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:43,222
As you well know, Hammond,
we receive thousands of letters

66
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:47,102
every single week from viewers
and they all say the same thing.

67
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,143
"Dear Top so-called Gear,
the Alfa 4C,

68
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:52,273
"is it better than quad bike?"

69
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,302
Well, I can clear than one up
straight away - yes, it is because

70
00:04:55,303 --> 00:05:00,133
quad bikes are slow, ugly, noisy,
stupid and incredibly dangerous.

71
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,542
And I don't mean dangerous like you
might fall off,

72
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:04,062
I mean like they want to kill you.

73
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:07,023
Everybody I know, pretty much,
who's ever tried one, has been

74
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,292
killed by it at some point.

75
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:11,222
Yup. That's as maybe,
but we need to settle this,

76
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,772
so we're going to have a race.
We're going to race? Yeah.

77
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,422
You on that, presumably? Yeah.

78
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:17,452
Me in that? Yeah.

79
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:21,982
Jeremy's proposal was a race
from the top of Lake Como

80
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,652
to a hotel terrace at the bottom.

81
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:27,622
I would take
the 43-mile lakeside route,

82
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:31,002
whilst he would attempt to
go as the crow flies.

83
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,123
Good, you're going
to be killed and last.

84
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:42,460
And so, at exactly 10.37am,
the race began.

85
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,232
Here we go.

86
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:55,422
Let me talk you through my quad.

87
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,732
It's called a Gibbs Quadski,

88
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:02,732
designed and engineered in Britain,
built just outside Detroit

89
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:07,582
and the engine is German -
a 1.3 from a BMW motorcycle.

90
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,950
And you have 40 horsepower.

91
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,113
Doesn't sound like much
but like the Alfa, it's light.

92
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:19,622
Apparently it has the same
power-to-weight ratio

93
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,011
as a helicopter.

94
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:26,312
He's mad. I mean,
he doesn't stand a chance.

95
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:27,702
I know what he's thinking -

96
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:31,582
he's imagining he'll be crashing
off-road and cutting corners.

97
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,252
He won't - he'll be bumbling through
the woods on little tracks,

98
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:38,359
he'll get stuck, fall off,
break a leg - maybe two.

99
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,462
Hammond was wrong.
My legs were fine,

100
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:49,013
but I had got into a bit of a pickle
trying to find a shortcut.

101
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,072
Totally lost.

102
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:52,235
Literally no idea which...

103
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:54,802
No idea.

104
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:56,919
I'm just in weeds...

105
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:01,030
Oh, now which way?

106
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,772
With Jeremy stuck in the undergrowth,

107
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:11,201
I had time to admire one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.

108
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:23,533
Ah! Mountains, pretty village -
all present and correct.

109
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,092
Coming through.

110
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:34,252
See, this scooter rider will not mind
me whizzing past in my Alfa Romeo,

111
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:39,342
because I know he loves Alfa Romeo
just as much, if not more, than I do.

112
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:42,552
We have to love Alfa, it's the law.

113
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,572
Meanwhile...

114
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:49,903
Oh. God. No, wait.

115
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,462
Many nettles.

116
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:54,592
This may have a top speed of 40

117
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:57,342
but I'm not doing that now, really.

118
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,972
Happily, however,

119
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:04,782
Hammond was about to discover one
of the Alfa's drawbacks - its girth.

120
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:08,472
Oh, no! Oh, my God, this is narrow!

121
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,952
Oh! That's...

122
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:14,542
This car is wide.

123
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,090
That's a problem.

124
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:20,732
So what were they thinking
when they've got streets like this?

125
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,315
I mean... Oh!

126
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,390
Still, could be worse.

127
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:35,232
Oh, no! Now look what I've done.

128
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:38,271
I've accidentally
crashed into Lake Como.

129
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:44,757
But it's OK, because
if I push this little button here...

130
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:55,246
the wheels have folded up
and now I'm on a jet ski.

131
00:08:56,743 --> 00:09:01,502
Oh, and it gets better because,
on land, it has 40 horsepower,

132
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:05,519
but here on water it has 140.

133
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:15,502
I know exactly what music
we have to play right now.

134
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:17,422
♪ We are sailing... ♪

135
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,862
No, not that!

136
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:20,001
Cue the Bond!

137
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:35,782
Here we go - 45 miles an hour!

138
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,879
Hammond, wherever you are,
you can't beat this.

139
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:47,518
Narrow. Really narrow.
Really wide car.

140
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:52,402
I'd like to be driving something
narrower now, like a bus.

141
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:57,890
Right, clear of town, press on.

142
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:07,302
So let's just get this straight -

143
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:11,882
I'm wearing a wet white shirt
and I'm in a lake - I'm Mr Darcy!

144
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,317
Come on!

145
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,770
There is Richard Hammond.

146
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:29,502
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

147
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,252
I'll slow down a bit.

148
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:33,462
'Hello? Hello?'

149
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:35,452
Er, hello. Where are you?

150
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,262
'To your left, mate, to your left.'

151
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,023
You can't be to my left.
How can you be to my left?

152
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,942
What?

153
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,302
'Have you ever seen anything
like this?'

154
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:50,052
What are you on?
Is that the same quad?

155
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,692
It certainly is.

156
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,532
And I'm afraid
I must now say goodbye.

157
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,547
'Cheerio. See you soon.'

158
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:02,332
Cheating sod!

159
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:06,662
He can just go
straight across the lake now.

160
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,342
I've got to go all the way
down the bottom here

161
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:11,382
and back up the other side.

162
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm going to lose this and he's going
to do his stupid smug face.

163
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,884
Spurred on by the horror
of his face...

164
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:25,716
I put the hammer down.

165
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,966
Come on, little Alfa.

166
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:40,102
We were neck and neck,

167
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:43,812
but then Jeremy got
distracted by an Italian ferry.

168
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,695
Look at that!

169
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,897
What a machine.

170
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:56,891
I'm sorry I'm hearing the Bond
music again now.

171
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,702
You want a race?

172
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,444
I'll give you a race.

173
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,640
Oh, come on, I can't lose this!

174
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:30,952
By this stage, I'd disentangled
myself from the hydrofoil,

175
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:36,278
but had run into another problem -
Lake Como's weird winds.

176
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,321
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

177
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,689
I think we've got some chop.

178
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,048
WOW!

179
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,542
I've lost ten miles...

180
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,062
Aw!

181
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,542
Ow, my back bottom!

182
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:58,312
Wow! Wow!

183
00:12:58,313 --> 00:12:59,929
They slow you down a bit.

184
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:03,232
Oh, my...

185
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,142
That was a big one.

186
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:09,312
I'm now down to 15 miles an hour,
and I can't realistically go

187
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:13,903
any faster, cos
I can't see where I'm bloody going.

188
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:17,135
The vicious chop had put Hammond
back in the lead.

189
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,266
We have to beat him.

190
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:33,062
Thankfully, on the lake,
I'd found calmer water.

191
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,407
45 miles an hour.

192
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,294
We are back in this race.

193
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:53,622
There he is.
There is Richard Hammond.

194
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:56,192
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

195
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:58,982
Goodbye, Hammond.

196
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:01,281
He is history.

197
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,132
It certainly seemed that way,

198
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,672
because pretty soon
the hotel was in sight.

199
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,756
There it is, there's
the finishing line.

200
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:19,132
So, I was definitely going
to win this.

201
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:24,592
But then I realised
the victory would be a bit hollow.

202
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:28,992
Obviously, I want to beat Hammond,
of course I do.

203
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,913
But I don't want to beat that
Alfa Romeo, because, to me,

204
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,272
Alfas are special.

205
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,832
They're really special.

206
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,672
This is a bit like having a running
race with your four-year-old son -

207
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:47,201
yes, of course you can win, but you
don't really want to.

208
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,803
It's not far now.

209
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,919
Little Alfa, I think
we have to accept the inevitable.

210
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,102
He's not there, is he?

211
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:04,033
In a few minutes,
Hammond would arrive

212
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:09,033
and see my Quadski moored
alongside the hotel's jetty.

213
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,878
Damn and blast, I'm going
to win this.

214
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,903
Nothing I can do.

215
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:16,412
But then...

216
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,622
I spotted a hidey-hole.

217
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:20,557
Yes!

218
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:26,767
Sometimes I stagger even
myself with my genius.

219
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:32,004
Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

220
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:43,411
Right, where is he?

221
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:00,327
This is the terrace.

222
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:03,804
Up here maybe.

223
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:12,439
Do you know what?

224
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:20,718
He no here. I don't know how.
What I've done is win...

225
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:26,923
in that little Alfa.
Hammond! Mate. Well done.

226
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:29,272
You beat me fair and square. I did.

227
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:34,112
In the Alfa. Do you know? I would
have bet £1 million...

228
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:37,651
when I overtook you,
I was going to win.

229
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:47,783
Your question is answered.

230
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:51,982
The Alfa 4C is better
than the quad bike.

231
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:56,322
Yes, but we saw you lose on purpose.
A bit, just a bit.

232
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:58,602
Did you not like the jet ski,
Quadski thing?

233
00:16:58,603 --> 00:16:59,793
Yes, it's brilliant.

234
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:02,622
Do you know, the best
thing about it is its reliability.

235
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,502
It performed faultlessly all day

236
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:09,322
and then it performed
faultlessly all the next day

237
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:12,702
when we had to rerun the race
because an American

238
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,492
knocked the camera with all the film
it into the lake. Really?

239
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,112
I was on this thing for two days,
two days.

240
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:25,721
By the time we finished, my sausage
looked like a beaver's tail.

241
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:33,962
Right, um, is it expensive?
What, my sausage? No, the thing.

242
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:37,192
Oh, the thing, yes,
it's £26,000, but, no, hang on,

243
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:42,832
you do get a lot of health and
safety warning notices for that.

244
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,232
This is my favourite down here.

245
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:50,402
It's warning about what you have
to wear and it says, hang on,

246
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:55,322
"Normal swimwear does not adequately
protect against forceful

247
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:59,362
"water entry into rectum or vagina."

248
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:09,422
He's not making that up.
It says vagina on it.

249
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,712
Excuse me, does anyone mind
if we talk about the car for a bit?

250
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,783
It's a car show and everything.

251
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:19,142
Good, cos I've got some questions
about this. How wide is it?

252
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:22,182
It's wider than a Range Rover. Is it?
Seriously? Very wide.

253
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,952
And let me get this straight,

254
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:28,272
Alfa Romeo is selling a car
where you can't open the bonnet?

255
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,582
Yeah, I know.

256
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,872
Ballsy. Yeah. Ballsy. It is, yes,

257
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:35,272
but that's not the interesting thing
about it.

258
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:36,793
What is the interesting thing?

259
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:39,043
Well, it costs £47,000,
but when you get in it,

260
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:43,903
everything feels just feels a bit
cheap and plasticky.

261
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:47,312
Look at this handbrake, it's just...

262
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:50,822
It's like something that came
out of a cracker.

263
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:53,232
You know, if I got the handbrake in
a Christmas cracker,

264
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,793
I'd be a bit disappointed. You know
what I mean. Yes, I do.

265
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:00,322
It's just that there are a lot
of EU rules coming very soon

266
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:02,762
on fuel efficiency and emissions
and so on,

267
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:05,182
and the only way that cars
can meet them

268
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:07,932
is if they get very, very light.

269
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:11,222
Yeah. And pretty soon, all cars
will have to be made like this,

270
00:19:11,223 --> 00:19:14,582
but do you know what? I don't think
that's necessarily a bad thing.

271
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,272
Yes, you get a shonky handbrake,
but your car is more nimble.

272
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,592
It's faster and it's more economical.

273
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:24,942
And for the ultimate expression
of that art, later in the show,

274
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:32,062
we have a review of this - the new
McLaren P1, which is astonishing.

275
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:37,512
Well, I am very much looking forward
to that, but first it's the news.

276
00:19:37,513 --> 00:19:42,062
Yes. Now Kia is working on something
called "gesture control".

277
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:45,702
It's very interesting,
because of instead of having

278
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:49,462
buttons all over
the dashboard of your car, you just

279
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:53,302
sort of wave your hand around a bit,
and the car will do stuff.

280
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:54,783
Very futuristic.

281
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:58,163
Yeah, but I only make three
gestures when I'm driving a car.

282
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:02,033
What? One of them is...

283
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,312
which means I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean to do that.

284
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:09,090
Then there's... hi, to a friend.
And... Call Jeremy Clarkson.

285
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:14,930
Or navigate to James May's house.

286
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:20,072
Oh, now, now... you know
those motorway gantries

287
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,942
that are supposed to be used
to tell you

288
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:25,512
about stationary traffic ahead
or ice, but they're actually used

289
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:28,222
for telling you stuff
that doesn't matter.

290
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:32,582
We've got a picture of one here -
"Check your fuel level."

291
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,432
It might as well say, "Wash your
hands after going to the lavatory."

292
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,712
"Brush your hair."

293
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,793
Well, anyway, the committee that
decides on what messages flashed up -

294
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:42,762
and it is a committee, we checked -
has been told to stop doing

295
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:46,952
that sort of thing, OK, because the
government says it's distracting.

296
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,192
But it isn't distracting,
it's irritating.

297
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:52,222
Scarlett Johansson in a short skirt
on a windy day on a motorway bridge,

298
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:55,762
that is distracting.
That would be. It's distracting now.

299
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:57,232
It's distracting me right now.

300
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:00,673
I think what would be distracting
would be painting

301
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:03,592
the surface of the motorway so it
looked like the opening sequences

302
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:05,632
of Doctor Who
as you drove along.

303
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,632
That would be really distracting.

304
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,043
I think they should use those signs
to put up a pub quiz questions

305
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:14,663
as you drive past.
That's a really good idea.

306
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:17,402
What, and then you'd have
the answer on the next one along?

307
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:20,082
Yes, journeys would just fly by.
"ooh, I don't know."

308
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,762
And then you get the answer.
That's brilliant. Yes, thank you.

309
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:24,562
Not if my little sister
set the questions.

310
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,402
Why? Because you'd get
the question on one,

311
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:29,302
and then the next one would go,
"Oh, come on, you must know that!"

312
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:32,793
Please can we move on?
I'd like to talk about this.

313
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:35,222
It's the new Corvette Z06. Oh, yes.

314
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:38,352
Supercharged V86.2 litres
625 brake horsepower.

315
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:42,112
It's got a magnetic ride control,
electronic diff, carbon fibre.

316
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:45,502
All the hi-tech stuff
you get on a European sports car...

317
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:48,592
But does it have the European
self-restraint, though, does it?

318
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:50,793
It's a bit more shock 'em all
than stiff upper lip.

319
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:52,482
Yes, but look at it.

320
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:55,582
No, Hammond, you can't drive
a Corvette in England.

321
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,472
It's like talking in a lift -
you can do that in America,

322
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:00,392
you can't do that in Britain.

323
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:03,122
In fact, we should have signs at
Heathrow telling American visitors,

324
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:05,952
"Please drive on the left
and don't talk in lifts."

325
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:09,032
Yes, yes, whatever,
but I think that looks stupendous.

326
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:12,663
Yes, yes, it would
look stupendous in Texas,

327
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,432
but it would look ridiculous
in Tewkesbury. It would.

328
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,192
Hammond, if you bought one of those
and drove it around England,

329
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:21,562
the next thing you would be
hanging up a Confederate flag

330
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:22,722
outside your house.

331
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:25,712
I did paint a Confederate flag
on the roof of my Toyota Corolla

332
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:26,772
when I was 17.

333
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:29,482
Where were you?
Ripon. North Yorkshire.

334
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:32,032
What? It looked brilliant.
Let me just get this straight.

335
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:35,552
You drove around North Yorkshire in
a crappy little Japanese hatchback

336
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:39,512
with a Confederate flag
on the roof?

337
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:43,404
Yes. Yes. A symbol of slavery.

338
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,793
Ladies and gentlemen,
12 Years A Hammond!

339
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:51,472
I didn't realise -
I just thought it looked nice.

340
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,282
The base model of this -
not the Z06,

341
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,122
the normal one - 60 grand? 62, yes.

342
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,442
Well, for about the same sort
of money, you can have this,

343
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,842
which is the new jag.

344
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,202
This is the F-type Coupe.

345
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:04,783
That's around the same sort of
money, and I put it to you that

346
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,382
what we have here is a lovely piece

347
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:10,112
of double Gloucester
on a water biscuit.

348
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:12,482
Your Corvette is 600 kilos of...

349
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:14,673
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
..Monterrey Jack on a taco.

350
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:16,592
Yeah, that's right.
I'd rather have that.

351
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:19,022
You'd rather have the Monterey Jack,
wouldn't you?

352
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,482
Yes. Hang on a minute.
Surely it's 600 kilograms of...

353
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,622
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Monterey Jack
on a taco with a strawberry on top.

354
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:25,671
Strawberry.

355
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,461
At as long as
there's a strawberry on top.

356
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:29,111
Are there any Americans here? Whoo!

357
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,511
You are. Oh, we've wondered
about this for years.

358
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:33,351
Why do you put these on everything?

359
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,980
Because they taste good.
Yes, but not on a shepherd's pie.

360
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:40,341
This is not an exaggeration.
I stayed in a hotel in LA.

361
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:42,752
I had to have some dry cleaning
done, and when it came back

362
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:45,632
in the morning, it was all wrapped up,
and there was a strawberry on it.

363
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,991
What, on your dry-cleaning?
On my dry-cleaning.

364
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,801
Now, this isn't news -
it's a question.

365
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:53,401
Why is the world still
incapable of working out

366
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:55,831
a way of dispensing petrol?
Anyone been to America?

367
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:58,601
Well, you've all been to America,
I suppose, at some point.

368
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,271
You go into a petrol station there

369
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,191
and you have to pay for the fuel
before you fill your tank.

370
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,752
Well, you don't
know how much you want

371
00:24:05,753 --> 00:24:07,161
or how much it's going to take.

372
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:09,081
Yes, but I hate those European
stations

373
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,551
where they have those automatic
credit card ones. Don't work.

374
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,901
Never ever work. The other one
that doesn't work,

375
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:16,191
and especially in France,
are those ones

376
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:18,752
where you're supposed to put
euro notes in a little slot.

377
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:22,405
No. You put it in and it goes,
"Nnnngh! Nnnngh!" Oh.

378
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:26,622
There's a lot of people doing
that, and it goes, "Nnnngh!"

379
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:29,471
I'll give you the worst scenario,
James.

380
00:24:29,472 --> 00:24:31,261
Worst scenario is, "Nnnngh!"

381
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,471
"Yes, there we go," get the pump
out, "Nnnngh!"

382
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:38,831
But the worst country in the world for
filling up with petrol is Britain,

383
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:44,271
because petrol stations here
now are also supermarkets,

384
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:46,401
which means that people pull up
at the pump

385
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,882
and then go and do their shopping.

386
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,961
Well, that is
exactly why I was late this morning,

387
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:52,321
cos I pulled up behind
the car that was at the pump

388
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,981
ready for my turn and I knew
who it was through the window -

389
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:58,271
it was a woman and she was doing
the whole weekly groceries shop -

390
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:00,791
and she came out with the
four massive carrier bags,

391
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,471
and I thought, "That's finally it,"

392
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,541
and then she went to
the cash machine... Oh...

393
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:08,261
sorted out Greece's
national debt with her card.

394
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:10,711
I am a patient man, but even I...
I was thinking,

395
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:13,911
"I want to put your head in a brown
paper bag and bludgeon you to death

396
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,551
"with the blunt end of an axe."

397
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:19,911
That's quite bad. Do you know?
My question is petrol stations is -

398
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:23,471
and we could ask this here -
and it's mostly women,

399
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:27,762
what do you do in the 15 minutes
between getting into the car

400
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:28,911
and driving off?

401
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:32,161
I know what it is, I know
what it is. What? I watched it.

402
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:34,991
She turned round and she put her
handbag on the back seat,

403
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,752
fair enough, but then interfered
with it for some time.

404
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,421
Doing what, though?

405
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:43,521
I suspect women try to make sure
their handbag doesn't fall over,

406
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:47,121
which I don't understand, because women's
handbags are not well organised,

407
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:49,431
so it doesn't matter
if it falls over.

408
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:52,762
I reckon I could put a house brick
in a woman's handbag,

409
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:57,471
and she would not know it was there
ever. Have you got handbag with you?

410
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,632
No. You haven't?
Anyone got handbag? It's in the car.

411
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,892
That's a shame,
because I was going to do this game.

412
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,201
I was going to put my car keys,

413
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,121
and it's a jag this week,
in your handbag and then,

414
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:10,521
if you could find them by the end
of the show, you could have the car.

415
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:12,261
You wouldn't be able to.

416
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:15,481
Two angry old men
rampaging on about petrol stations.

417
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:18,076
Him and his cardigan, him...
just him.

418
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,351
Now, as I'm sure you know,
after 13 years,

419
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:25,551
the British military forces
are pulling out of Afghanistan.

420
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:29,191
What you may not know is that that
operation has been the biggest deployment

421
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:33,231
of British military vehicles
since World War ll.

422
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:36,872
Now, bringing that lot home
is quite a big job,

423
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:40,980
so I packed my tin helmet and
went out there to... get in the way.

424
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:49,681
'If you want to get a sense of just
how big the British involvement

425
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:52,882
'in Afghanistan has become,

426
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:57,127
'you just have to look at the size
of its main base - Camp Bastion.'

427
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:05,991
In 2006,
when British forces arrived here,

428
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:10,892
it was just a scrap of desert
with a few tents in, but now look.

429
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:12,452
It's the size of Reading.

430
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:25,831
'And inside its 25 miles
of blast-proof perimeter wall

431
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:29,281
'alongside the few comforts of home,

432
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:32,934
'you'll find a vast armada
of vehicles.

433
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:40,373
'At its peak, the number was 5,000.'

434
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:44,521
We've got a few of them here.

435
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:46,921
The names will be dimly familiar
from news reports.

436
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:49,882
That is a Ridgeback,
that is a Mastiff,

437
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:53,632
then you have a Foxhound,
the pale-coloured one is a Husky,

438
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:57,241
and that weird-looking thing with the
tracks on over there, that is a Warthog.

439
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,991
Don't expect cute and cuddly
names like Panda or Fiesta -

440
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:05,351
everything here is named
after a dog, except the Warthog,

441
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,571
which is named after a warthog.

442
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:13,271
'To keep the wheels turning, the Army
has built this enormous workshop,

443
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:16,391
'which, at full strength,
carries £60 million worth

444
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:20,625
'of spares and employs
150 mechanics.

445
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:27,281
'Bastion even has its own
purpose-built

446
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:31,936
'driver training ground, approved
by a squad of driving instructors.'

447
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,961
The sheer size of this operation
is truly impressive,

448
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:42,551
but equally fascinating is what
the Afghanistan campaign has done

449
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:44,702
to Britain's military vehicles.

450
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:50,351
'It has brought about the biggest
change in a generation.

451
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:53,711
'When the British first arrived
here, their staple patrol vehicle,

452
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:57,791
'the Snatch Land Rover, offered
woeful protection against IEDs.

453
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:04,164
'In 2009 alone, 79 soldiers
fell victim to such devices.'

454
00:29:10,712 --> 00:29:13,921
'The 29-tonne American-made Mastiff
offered a quick fix,

00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,728
'a small British firm devised
a more 21st-century solution.'

457
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:29,642
This is a Foxhound
and it's very clever,

458
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,721
because it's actually
made out of armour.

459
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:34,642
It's not a normal vehicle to which
armour plate has been added.

460
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:37,055
It's sort of armour monoblock,
if you like.

461
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:43,762
'The Foxhound also has a V-shaped
hull to deflect mine blasts

462
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:47,271
'and thanks to its state-of-the-art
armour, it weighs

463
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:49,431
'just seven and a half tonnes,

464
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:51,924
'which makes it a featherweight
around these parts.'

465
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:58,530
To drive, is pretty much like
an off-road car.

466
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:03,299
It's a positive mountain goat,
this thing.

467
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:07,361
'Now, history will record that
government bureaucrats

468
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:09,961

'but the boffins who developed
the Foxhound certainly didn't.'

471
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:18,121
This machine was designed,
engineered, tested, proved

472
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:22,632
and got on the ground in large
numbers in just over three years.

473
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:26,854
Try doing that with a small
hatchback or something.

474
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:32,854
'Alongside the Foxhound...

475
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,081
'..the military drew on a policy

476
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:40,281
'called Urgent Operational
Requirement or UOR,

477
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:43,051
'which saw them combine
operational demands

478
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:46,579
'and the best vehicle-related suggestions
from soldiers on the ground.'

479
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:53,015
Here's a very simple example
of UOR - this is a Mastiff.

480
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,051
It's got cameras mounted
on the sides.

481
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:59,871
Commander Buzz here can
look at the pictures on his screen.

482
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:02,351
On the early ones,
they were originally mounted.

483
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:05,011
When you went through things
like villages, they got smashed.

484
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,431
So somebody said,
"Why not put them on a hinge?"

485
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,934
So they did.

486
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:16,071
'Soldiers also needed their vehicles
to be more stealthy in the dark.

487
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,642
'So a night-vision system
was developed

488
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,801
'that would allow them
to switch off their headlights.'

489
00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:25,321
I'm now driving the Mastiff
completely blacked out

490
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:29,041
but using the night-vision system
suspended in front of my face.

491
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,481
And this is quite amazing.

492
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:35,715
This is actually my eyes. I can't see a
single thing through the windscreen.

493
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:40,161

00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:51,791
We ought to point out that normally, we wouldn't
even have these red interior lights on.

498
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:54,361
Those are there
so our cameras are working properly.

499
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,361
But actually,
you could drive this...

500
00:31:56,362 --> 00:32:00,131
we could be completely black in here,
couldn't we? Yeah, complete blackout, yeah.

501
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:01,772
Right, so I've missed those...

502
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:03,971
what are those, are they rocks
or are they...?

503
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:06,441
Yeah, they're just in front of you.

504
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:07,971
Straightening up, sir.

505
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:10,512
See that compound ahead of us?
Yeah.

506
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,681
You want to be going
round to the left of that.

507
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,711
I can see that as clear as day.

508
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:18,361
It's a good piece of kit, isn't it?
It's brilliant, isn't it?

509
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:21,561
'Now, on a machine is heavily
armoured is a Mastiff,

510
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:24,921
'the protection against
roadside bombs is good.

511
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:28,301
'But Afghanistan threw up another
issue that needed sorting.'

512
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:33,895
What if the vehicle is blown
over? How do you train for that?

513
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:39,841
Well, what you do is
you build one of these.

514
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:44,522
It's a RODET - Roll Over Drills
Egress Trainer.

515
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,401
Oh!

516
00:32:46,402 --> 00:32:48,245
And I think we're upside down.

517
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:57,361
'All these improvements have had a dramatic
effect on military motoring out here.'

518
00:32:57,362 --> 00:33:01,151
Since the new generation
of PMVs was introduced -

519
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:04,522
that's protective military
vehicles... the Mastiff,

520
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:06,762
the Foxhound, the Husky,

521
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:08,951
the Warthog, all those things -

522
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:14,091
there have been over 1,000 survivors
of IED strikes on vehicles.

523
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:19,131
And a senior British officer
admitted to me the other day that,

524
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,601
in the old days, when we had
the soft-skinned vehicles -

525
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,921
the Snatch Land Rover and so on -

526
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:27,825
that might have been more like
three casualties per vehicle.

527
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:36,491
'With our troops now coming home,

528
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:39,411
'this stuff is too valuable
to leave behind.

529
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:43,051
'So a massive operation is under way
to bring it back to Britain.

530
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:47,001
'At forward bases like this one,
all the vehicles and spares

531
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:50,281
'are being gathered up
for the drive back to Bastion.

532
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:53,512
'Which meant that,
in the middle of the night,

533
00:33:53,513 --> 00:33:56,491
'I found myself in a convoy
of returning vehicles

534
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,841
'in full Ross Kemp mode.'

535
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:02,241
We're in a Mastiff.
We're in a convoy of 31 vehicles.

536
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:06,361
These legs belong to Sue, who's up
the top on the gun, keeping lookout.

537
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:10,151
Hello. Morning. Morning, ma'am. ls
there room for two of us up there?

538
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:15,201
We can give it a go. Right, I'll move
this way a bit. There we go. Ow.

539
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:19,344
I don't think we're going to fit on.
I've pulled something off.

540
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:26,665
I'm not fat.

541
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,281
What's to stop somebody... Cos we
can't really see very much out there.

542
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:35,522
What's to stop somebody out there
just taking a shot at you?

543
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:39,762
Absolutely nothing at the moment.
So they're out there somewhere.

544
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:42,711
They are.
There're not that far away.

545
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:46,921
When was the last time a roadside bomb
went off on this bit, do you know?

546
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:51,473
Very... Very recent.
Very recent? Very recent.

547
00:34:57,523 --> 00:35:00,571
'Daylight found us
still in one piece,

548
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:02,961
'and back within the walls
of Bastion,

549
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,591
'the packing-up process could begin.

550
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:07,881
'Alongside a strip-down service,

551
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:12,241
'each vehicle gets a 24-hour-long
jet wash.

552
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,681
'Biological decontamination.

553
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:18,931
'And, at the very end,
its own passport.'

554
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,881
And look at the size of it.

555
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:26,011
All these pages, all these
signatures, everything signed off.

556
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:29,681
Every single vehicle and piece
of equipment has one of those.

557
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:32,762
And there are over
3,500 of them.

558
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:36,222
So don't complain next time
you have to tax and MOT your car.

559
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:46,616
'For some poor souls,
the new machinery came too late.

560
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:53,433
'But the military has responded
to the brutality of this conflict.'

561
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:04,762
'And the vehicles we're
bringing home from Afghanistan

562
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,539
'are much better than the ones
we went out with.'

563
00:36:33,082 --> 00:36:35,721
And there it is.

564
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:38,131
The big military Foxhound.

565
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:42,731
Or, since the Army loves
an acronym, the big MF.

566
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:47,441
Anyway, it's now time to put
an S in our RPC.

567
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:51,361
Britain has produced many great
Toms over the years -

568
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:54,421
Daley, Jones and, of course,
Mas the Tank Engine.

569
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:58,491
But, tonight,
our Tom is the newest of them all.

570
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:01,601
He's from Thor and Avengers Assemble
and War Horse.

571
00:37:01,602 --> 00:37:04,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Hiddleston.

572
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:12,441
How are you? Very well, thank you.

573
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:15,881
Look! Thank you. Thank you.

574
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:17,623
Have a seat. Thank you.

575
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:25,532
I was half expecting you to ask
the audience to kneel before you.

576
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:27,681
Not here.
I haven't got my horns with me.

577
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:30,611
So let's get on to your car history
if I may. Yes, sure.

578
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:35,174
Your first car, then, what was it?
It was a Peugeot 106. Mmm(!)

579
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:42,652
Yeah. It was quite adventurous.
Mmm(!) 1.1. Wow(!)

580
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:47,851
Really phwoar - when you floored it,
you felt it. It was a 1.1 what?

581
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:50,913
They always had silly names. Zest.
Yeah, there you go.

582
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:56,782
Sounds like a washing powder.
It sounds like lemon juice. It does.

583
00:37:56,783 --> 00:38:01,141
I bought it with my first pay
check for some TV work that I got

584
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:05,171
while I was at university. And I
kept that for ten years. Ten years?!

585
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:07,751
Ten whole years.
All the way through my 20s, yeah.

586
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,971
But I presume that, obviously,

587
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:13,891
now, as result of you being Loki in
the Thor franchise... Indeed, yes.

588
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:17,371
there's no need now to drive
around in cars with zesty names?

589
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:20,971
Well, I'm very fortunate
to drive a Jaguar.

590
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,861
And as you probably know,

591
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:26,321
I'm part of a campaign that they
have recently done. And they are...

592
00:38:26,322 --> 00:38:30,001
Weirdly, Jaguar's been part of my
life for the last couple of years,

593
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:32,571
cos I keep playing characters
in films who drive Jaguars.

594
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:33,951
What, does Loki drive a jag?

595
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:37,561
I think Loki drives a spaceship.

596
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:40,591
Yes, he does. Is it a jag spaceship?
It is a jag, I'm sure.

597
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:42,601
Goes to the petrol station and goes,

598
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:45,851
"Oh, dear, my dear, I seem
to have left my wallet at home.

599
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:48,761
"This is embarrassing."
I'm sure he would approve.

600
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:50,731
Caddish spaceship. Yup.

601
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:53,691
No, this jag commercial, actually,
I don't know if anybody's seen it,

602
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:55,581
but have a look at this.

603
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:58,091
Have you ever noticed,
how, in Hollywood movies,

604
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,931
all the villains are played
by Brits?

605
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,241
Maybe we just sound right.

606
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:03,313
Good evening, sir. Thank you, Mary.

607
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:08,291
We're more focused.

608
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:10,402
More precise.

609
00:39:10,403 --> 00:39:12,402
We're always one step ahead.

610
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:15,623
With a certain style, an
eye for detail.

611
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:19,584
And we're obsessed by power!

612
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:31,361
A stiff upper lip is key.

613
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:33,561
And we all drive Jaguars.

614
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:36,736
Oh, yes. It's good to be bad.

615
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:46,532
I have to say, the line I like most
in that is Mark Strong's,

616
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:49,291
cos he goes,
"And we all drive Jaguars."

617
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:53,422
What it should be is, "We all drive
Jaguars... now." Right!

618
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:58,091
"As a result of this."
Yeah. Or, indeed, a helicopter.

619
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:00,891
Was that really filmed in London?
It was all filmed in London.

620
00:40:00,892 --> 00:40:03,381
It was one of the most
extraordinary evenings of my life.

621
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:07,301
I... We were allowed to go over
central London about 500 feet.

622
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,051
And the door of the helicopter
was open.

623
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:13,761
And Tom Hooper, who directed it,
was sitting behind the camera.

624
00:40:13,762 --> 00:40:17,931
And we were up, banking right,
and I was leaning out the window,

625
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:21,681
and a certain point, he said, "I'm afraid
we have to cut, we have to change..."

626
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:24,662
"OK, good, that's completely fine."
"Cut."

627
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:28,581
Argh! It's really high!
You know what I mean?

628
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:31,402
When the cameras rolling,
I was like, "I've got this -

629
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:34,652
"more focused, more precise." And
as soon as it was cut, I was like...

630
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:37,731
"Oh, God, the window's open!
Someone shut the door!"

631
00:40:37,732 --> 00:40:41,211
It is a good point, though. It's a very
good business, isn't it, that is raised

632
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:44,581
in that commercial about the
number of vets who are baddies.

633
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:46,581
Rickman and then Hopkins and you...

634
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:48,331
Alan Rickman, Anthony Hopkins...

635
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:50,532
I guess it started with
James Mason back in the day.

636
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,331
God, I thought
you were going to see James May!

637
00:40:53,332 --> 00:40:55,961
The world's longest
and most boring film.

638
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:58,481
The undiscovered British villain.

639
00:40:58,482 --> 00:40:59,601
Yes.

640
00:40:59,602 --> 00:41:03,111
But what is it, do you think, that the
Brits bring to a Hollywood movie?

641
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:05,441
I genuinely think
it's because Americans think

642
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:06,898
we're inherently distrustful.

643
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:11,824
They think, "Oh, my God,
your accent! You're so sneaky!"

644
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,771
Or something.
It's illusion, of course.

645
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:19,891
They like seeing us fail, I think
that's what it is. That's it.

646
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:23,961
Cos you have to fail if you're the
baddie. That's probably what it is.

647
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:28,532
Now, your career began, I believe,
at Slough Comprehensive.

648
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,221
It certainly did, yup.
As the front leg of an elephant?

649
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:36,041
I was the front leg of an elephant
carrying Eddie Redmayne.

650
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:39,091
He was grand enough to be the passenger
of the elephant. Really? Yeah.

651
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:42,011
I was the arse of a donkey once.

652
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:44,891
And I ended up here as a result of that.
And then you did the obligatory...

653
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:48,237
The greatest arse
of a donkey... in the world.

654
00:41:51,772 --> 00:41:57,131
That was very good! Sorry,
couldn't help it. No, that was...

655
00:41:57,132 --> 00:42:00,091
Somebody said that you were a good
mimic. Is that something...?

656
00:42:00,092 --> 00:42:03,681
It's something I've done.
I've done it my whole life.

657
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:06,881
I remember, when I was a child, they
used to have a double tape deck,

658
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:10,291
and I would record my own radio
show, with all the different voices.

659
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:14,532
They were basically voices of people
I'd heard of the telly, you know.

660
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:19,611
Phillip Schofield's and... Could
you still do Phillip Schofield?

661
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:22,301
I don't know. I don't even know
if... Actually, don't bother.

662
00:42:22,302 --> 00:42:26,291
I wouldn't know what he sounded like.
Throw me another one. Anthony Hopkins.

663
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:27,941
HE MIMICS: Oh, Tony Hopkins... Yeah.

664
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:29,691
Have you had him on the show?
Top Gear.

665
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:32,652
Yes, I'd love to be on the show. I'd
like to drive fast around a track.

666
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:36,305
Being taught to drive by The Stig, great
man, great man, I'd love to do that.

667
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:42,331
Let's think of some more names.

668
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:44,532
Anyone got any more names
we can fire?

669
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:46,931
Try to make them men,
cos that's probably easier. Yeah.

670
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,121
What? Arnold Schwarzenegger?

671
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:51,601
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
What was that?

672
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,594
Paul O'Grady.
I think I'll go for Schwarzenegger.

673
00:42:56,302 --> 00:42:58,091
I'm trying to think of something
he says.

674
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,675
HE MIMICS: I know now why you cry.

675
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:05,611
That sounded a little bit like
Peter O'Toole. Sorry about that.

676
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:09,291
HE MIMICS O'TOOLE: I know now
you cry.

677
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,131
That is quite a skill. Yeah.
And what are you doing now?

678
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,821
Anything exciting?

679
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:16,931
I'm just finishing
a run of Coriolanus in the West End,

680
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:18,652
which I've enjoyed hugely.

681
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:22,532
And I'm about to go to Toronto
to make a horror film

682
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,931
with Guillermo del Toro...
If you know him,

683
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:28,301
the Mexican director
who directed Pan's Labyrinth.

684
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:31,311
Who did one with Tilda Swinton as
well just recently? That's correct.

685
00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:34,251
There's a film called Only Lovers
Left Alive, which is coming out

686
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:38,652
in the UK, I think, on the 21st of
February, and it's basically a love story.

687
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:42,652
Tilda and I play a couple
who are vampires, so...

688
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:47,011
Oh, it's about a vampire film? It's a vampire
film, but were vegetarians, we don't bite.

689
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:50,171
Vegetarian vampires. Vegetarian
vampires. This I need to see.

690
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:54,171
We're much too classy for all
that 15th-century nonsense.

691
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,171
Now, I'm conscious of the time,
cos I know that you are appearing

692
00:43:57,172 --> 00:44:00,412
on stage this evening... Mm-hm...
..in Coriolanus. In Coriolanus, yes.

693
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:02,331
Which calls for you at the end,
I understand,

694
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:05,051
to be strung upside down,
bleeding profusely.

695
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:07,451
That's how it goes down, yeah.

696
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:09,601
Spoiler! Yeah.

697
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:13,652
It is a 450-year-old text,
so I think it's OK.

698
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:16,331
Did it occur to you when you
were driving around the track,

699
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:19,451
if you had an accident,
you could save the make-up?

700
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:22,741
If I just roll the car,
crash it... You could turn up...

701
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:28,251
And say, "I have my 27 wounds upon
me." 27 wounds, blood gushing...

702
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:32,971
So, did you crash?
I didn't trash, per se.

703
00:44:32,972 --> 00:44:36,561
Because, well, shall we have a look?
Let's have a look. I'm very nervous.

704
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:39,381
It was very wet out there.
Who would like to see the lap?

705
00:44:39,382 --> 00:44:41,131
AUDIENCE: Yes!

706
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:42,761
Let's have a look. Play the tape.

707
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:45,412
Three, two, one...

708
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:47,761
Oh, I've stalled the BLEEP!

709
00:44:47,762 --> 00:44:49,070
No way!

710
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:57,391
Oh, the shame! Yeah, you've got double
first from Cambridge, have you not?

711
00:44:57,392 --> 00:45:01,532
In Classics? I did. I did. But you
can't set off in a Vauxhall Astra?

712
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:05,171
Oh, dear. Anyway, let's see
the finished product, shall we?

713
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:07,709
When you actually set off.
Right. Here we go.

714
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:13,121
Ooh, that's a lot of clutch.

715
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:17,548
Come on. Come on!
BLEEP. Come on!

716
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:21,397
God Almighty, that's wet.

717
00:45:25,212 --> 00:45:27,078
Doing well, though.

718
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:33,491
Go, go, go. Go, go, go, take
the bend hard, take the bend hard.

719
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:35,101
Use the track.

720
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,451
Yeah, use the track. Better.

721
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:40,171
God, you've actually got
that thing sliding.

722
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:44,021
Normally, it's got very good grip.
Yeah, it was very puddly out there.

723
00:45:44,022 --> 00:45:47,491
♪ I'm for ever driving in puddles. ♪

724
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:50,561
Right, could you see
the lines at the Hammerhead?

725
00:45:50,562 --> 00:45:54,021
Yeah, just about, cos it was
very tight. Very difficult. Yeah.

726
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:56,691
Hugh Bonneville was here last week.

727
00:45:56,692 --> 00:45:59,811
He said he couldn't see the lines
cos it was so wet.

728
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:03,715
It's weird in England... Yeah.
..to have two wet days(!)

729
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:06,741
Floor it.

730
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:08,292
You're not doing it flat.

731
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:09,751
Come on!

732
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:12,981
You are! No, you're not.

733
00:46:12,982 --> 00:46:16,261
I was going to say,
that's ballsy on a day like today.

734
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:18,021
Stupid but ballsy.

735
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:23,101
Right. Ooh, the tail coming out.
You are very committed to this.

736
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:27,891
There you go. Second to last corner.
That's very nicely done. Gambon.

737
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:31,381
A bit safe, a bit safe?
No, I disagree.

738
00:46:31,382 --> 00:46:35,148
There we are, across the line.

739
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:43,611
Now, we've only ever had one wet lap,
which was last week - Hugh Bonneville.

740
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:46,121
So where do you think you've come,
bearing that in mind?

741
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:49,261
Oh, I'm a bit worried
I haven't beaten Hugh.

742
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:52,131
It'd be nice to be somewhere around
that, that area.

743
00:46:52,132 --> 00:46:54,282
Right, somewhere around that...

744
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:56,841
There's Ron Howard.
He directed Rush. He did.

745
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:58,841
Ron Howard - that was dry.

746
00:46:58,842 --> 00:47:00,971
He was just basically hopeless.

747
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:03,402
Hugh was 1.50.1.

748
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,731
OK. And you, Tom Hiddleston,

749
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:07,921
1...

750
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:10,402
Which is good. That's good? OK.

751
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:13,479
40...

752
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:16,797
but only just.

753
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,851
9.9.

754
00:47:19,852 --> 00:47:21,731
Oh! There we go.

755
00:47:21,732 --> 00:47:23,655
Well...

756
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,412
All right. Thank you.

757
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,101
In the wet?

758
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:32,651
Very wet.

759
00:47:32,652 --> 00:47:35,831
Thank you! I got a V.
Special very wet.

760
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:38,412
Well, I must let you go,
which is a shame

761
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:40,781
because I'm much enjoying
all of this.

762
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:43,638
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Hiddleston! Thank you.

763
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:51,483
Now...

764
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:59,811
this is the brand-new
£866,000 McLaren P1,

765
00:47:59,812 --> 00:48:03,381
probably the most advanced
and jaw-dropping car

766
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:05,451
the world has ever seen.

767
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:09,091
Hmm. The attention to detail in this
thing boggles the mind.

768
00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:11,981
It is... It's almost science
fiction.

769
00:48:11,982 --> 00:48:15,011
And so, there was
only one place on Earth

770
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:17,422
where I could test it properly.

771
00:48:17,423 --> 00:48:19,505
Belgium.

772
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:35,235
This is Bruges.

773
00:48:38,262 --> 00:48:42,771
It's a quiet, friendly,
cobbled sort of place.

774
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:45,621
And it's just a stone's
throw from Brussels,

775
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,971
home to all the environmental
EU law-makers.

776
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:52,741
All of which makes it an ideal
starting point

777
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:55,723
for my test of the new McLaren.

778
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:05,611
Because behind the front seats
there are 324 laptop-style batteries

779
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:11,153
which power a silent,
polar-bear-friendly electric motor.

780
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:17,111
This means that even the most
frizzy-haired sandal enthusiast

781
00:49:17,112 --> 00:49:20,061
would welcome this
car into their city centre.

782
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:24,061
It's like that other two-seater
electric car, the G-Wiz.

783
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,509
It's Al Gore with
a windscreen wiper.

784
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:35,234
Do not think, however, that it has
the get-up-and-go of Jabba the Hutt.

785
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:39,292
Because the electric motor in this

786
00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:43,491
produces a whopping 176 horsepower.

787
00:49:43,492 --> 00:49:47,771
That's about what you
get from a Volkswagen GTI.

788
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:49,718
So it's pretty nippy.

789
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:58,331
The only problem is,
that after just six miles,

790
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,661
the batteries will be flat.

791
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:03,371
So you'll need to
plug your car into the mains

792
00:50:03,372 --> 00:50:06,931
and sit about eating a chocolate
shoe for two hours

793
00:50:06,932 --> 00:50:09,310
until they're charged up again.

794
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:14,851
Or if this doesn't appeal,

795
00:50:14,852 --> 00:50:17,025
there is an alternative.

796
00:50:18,652 --> 00:50:22,331
Because, you see,
the P1 is fitted as standard

797
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:26,051
with an on board petrol-powered
generator.

798
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:28,191
And it is quite a big one.

799
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:32,831
In fact, it's
a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged

800
00:50:32,832 --> 00:50:36,422
722-horsepower V8.

801
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:38,861
We push this button...

802
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:41,341
There it is, firing up.

803
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,501
And the great thing is,

804
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:45,981
it's not just charging
the batteries.

805
00:50:45,982 --> 00:50:49,491
It's also working alongside
the electric motor

806
00:50:49,492 --> 00:50:51,392
to power the wheels.

807
00:50:53,622 --> 00:50:58,331
So the P1, then, is not like a G-Wiz
at all, in any way.

808
00:50:58,332 --> 00:51:00,641
Thanks to that generator,

809
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:03,781
you can take this
out of a city centre

810
00:51:03,782 --> 00:51:05,876
and onto the open road.

811
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:18,963
And that's another reason I've
come to Belgium.

812
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:23,430
Because there are
so many roads to choose from.

813
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:27,261
Belgium has three times
as many roads

814
00:51:27,262 --> 00:51:30,211
and 50% more cars per square mile

815
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,901
than we do in Britain.

816
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:36,341
And the stats from this
remarkable country

817
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:38,276
just keep on coming.

818
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,271
There are so many
miles of street-lit motorway here

819
00:51:42,272 --> 00:51:46,231
that Belgium is officially
the brightest country on Earth.

820
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:50,821
It's a little-known fact that
Buzz Aldrin's first words

821
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:53,011
when he set foot on the moon were,

822
00:51:53,012 --> 00:51:55,788
"Good God! You can
see Belgium from up here!"

823
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:59,237
I made that up.

824
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:08,839
On the road I chose, there was rain.

825
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:12,723
There was sunshine.

826
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:16,491
There were clear stretches.

827
00:52:16,492 --> 00:52:18,971
And there were traffic jams.

828
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:23,671
And the McLaren was quiet
and comfortable through it all.

829
00:52:26,702 --> 00:52:30,024
But it was not what you'd
call luxurious.

830
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:36,242
It is, frankly, as well equipped
as a pair of monk's underpants.

831
00:52:41,932 --> 00:52:45,621
And that's because,
like the Alfa we saw earlier,

832
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:49,445
this car was designed to
be as fat as Iggy Pop.

833
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:54,446
Inside, there's no glove box
and no carpets.

834
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,861
The glass is just 3.5mm thick,

835
00:52:58,862 --> 00:53:02,581
1.5mm thinner than
the glass in normal cars,

836
00:53:02,582 --> 00:53:05,211
except in the back windows...

837
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:07,811
where there's no glass at all.

838
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:10,981
No lacquer is added to
carbon-fibre trim

839
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:13,542
to save 1.5kg.

840
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:17,389
The whole chassis weighs less
than James May.

841
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:20,861
The trimmings are titanium,

842
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:23,781
and the body is
made from just five panels,

843
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:27,061
which means less glue
and fewer bolts are needed

844
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:30,071
to hold it all together.

845
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:34,061
All of this means that,
despite the bank of batteries

846
00:53:34,062 --> 00:53:36,371
and the fact it has two engines,

847
00:53:36,372 --> 00:53:39,717
this car weighs less than
a Vauxhall Astra.

848
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:44,451
That, of course,
makes it economical.

849
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:46,271
And fast.

850
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:47,876
Really fast.

851
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,881
Mind-blowingly fast.

852
00:54:05,423 --> 00:54:07,437
Oh, my God!

853
00:54:09,342 --> 00:54:12,164
Ohhh!

854
00:54:15,732 --> 00:54:19,091
The speed, in fact,
is the main reason

855
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,261
I brought this car to Belgium.

856
00:54:21,262 --> 00:54:24,755
Because Belgium is home to
this place.

857
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:33,923
Spa - the longest, wildest
racetrack on the F1 calendar.

858
00:54:37,543 --> 00:54:40,956
How can they make something
go this fast?!

859
00:54:43,862 --> 00:54:47,581
OK. OK, let me
just slow it down while I explain

860
00:54:47,582 --> 00:54:49,701
what's going on here.

861
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:52,811
The electric motor
and the big V8 generator

862
00:54:52,812 --> 00:54:54,901
are working together

863
00:54:54,902 --> 00:54:57,221
so that I have at my disposal

864
00:54:57,222 --> 00:55:00,476
903 brake horsepower.

865
00:55:03,582 --> 00:55:06,244
Ohh!

866
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:11,071
Obviously, I've driven
a Bugatti Veyron

867
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:13,011
that has more than that,

868
00:55:13,012 --> 00:55:15,322
but a Bugatti Veyron...

869
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:18,991
Oh!

870
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:21,221
It has four-wheel drive

871
00:55:21,222 --> 00:55:24,141
and it weighs more than most
mountains.

872
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:26,861
This is rear-wheel drive,

873
00:55:26,862 --> 00:55:29,861
and the only significant weight
comes from the air

874
00:55:29,862 --> 00:55:32,001
passing over the body.

875
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:38,021
Flat in a Formula 1 car.

876
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:39,933
Not flat in this.

877
00:55:41,632 --> 00:55:45,034
Oh, they should have called
this the Widow-maker!

878
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:50,731
The throttle is a hyperspace button.

879
00:55:50,732 --> 00:55:52,422
Step on it...

880
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:54,323
and you're gone.

881
00:55:56,632 --> 00:56:00,621
And yet, somehow,
even in this appalling weather,

882
00:56:00,622 --> 00:56:03,172
it got round all of the corners

883
00:56:03,173 --> 00:56:05,091
without crashing once.

884
00:56:05,092 --> 00:56:07,038
So, how?

885
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:18,086
Well, that's partly because it's
made of stuff from the future.

886
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:23,874
And partly because it's clever.

887
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:29,999
It adapts. It moves around to
suit its environment.

888
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:35,581
As the speed climbs,
the rear wing rises

889
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:37,631
to generate more downforce,

890
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:40,461
but as you go past 156mph,

891
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:43,731
it starts to go
back down a little bit,

892
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:46,811
otherwise the weight of the air
passing over it

893
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:50,071
would be so enormous it would
break the suspension.

894
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:53,751
Then you have the exhaust,
which works with the rear diffuser

895
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:56,381
to generate an area of low pressure

896
00:56:56,382 --> 00:56:59,811
into which the back of the car
is sucked.

897
00:56:59,812 --> 00:57:03,531
The wheels are made
from military-grade aluminium.

898
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:07,221
The brake discs from a material
that's only ever been used

899
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:09,451
in the Arianespace programme.

900
00:57:09,452 --> 00:57:12,631
And they're coated with something
called silicon carbide.

901
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:16,091
Apparently it's the hardest
substance known to man.

902
00:57:16,092 --> 00:57:18,581
Apart from dried Weetabix,
obviously.

903
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:20,581
And then, the whole thing

904
00:57:20,582 --> 00:57:25,918
sits on four tyres that were
designed and made by Pirelli.

905
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:31,414
All of this means you really
have the confidence to open it up.

906
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:43,341
This thing goes from 0 to 160mph

907
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:47,151
faster than a Golf
goes from 0 to 60.

908
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:50,422
130, 140, 150,

909
00:57:50,423 --> 00:57:54,021
160, 170, 180, 190...

910
00:57:54,022 --> 00:57:56,605
Bloody hellfire!

911
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:02,821
And as you hurtle round in a puddle
of your own faeces,

912
00:58:02,822 --> 00:58:04,991
girning like an infant,

913
00:58:04,992 --> 00:58:08,826
the car is working on ways of going
even faster.

914
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:15,909
Let me give you an example.

915
00:58:17,992 --> 00:58:20,891
The electric motor is used

916
00:58:20,892 --> 00:58:24,351
to fill in the little gaps
when the petrol engine

917
00:58:24,352 --> 00:58:27,101
isn't working at its best, like,
for example,

918
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:29,941
during gear changes

919
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:33,242
or while the massive
turbos are spooling up.

920
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:38,451
And what I find hysterical
about that is that McLaren

921
00:58:38,452 --> 00:58:40,991
has taken this hybrid technology,

922
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:44,061
which is designed to reduce
the impact

923
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,531
of the internal combustion engine

924
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:50,302
and is using it to increase
the impact.

925
00:58:50,303 --> 00:58:53,591
That's like weaponising a wind farm.

926
00:58:53,592 --> 00:58:58,154
Or buying the Rainbow Warrior
and turning it into an oil tanker.

927
00:59:05,152 --> 00:59:08,731
For years, cars have all been
basically the same

928
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:11,422
but this really isn't.

929
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,781
It's a game-changer.
A genuinely new chapter

930
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:17,683
in the history of motoring.

931
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:22,591
In a town, it's as eco friendly as
a health-food shop.

932
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:26,541
On a motorway, it's comfortable
and produces no more carbon dioxide

933
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,621
than a family saloon.

934
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:32,141
And on a track,
it can rip a hole through time.

935
00:59:32,142 --> 00:59:36,351
And it's all been achieved using
something that's been around

936
00:59:36,352 --> 00:59:40,266
for centuries -
brilliant British engineering.

937
00:59:41,982 --> 00:59:44,901
You could argue
that it doesn't have

938
00:59:44,902 --> 00:59:47,261
the passion or
the flair of a Ferrari,

939
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:49,981
and I'd probably agree with you.

940
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:52,511
But look at it this way.

941
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:56,302
It was passion and flair that built
the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

942
00:59:56,303 --> 00:59:59,351
and it was British engineering

943
00:59:59,352 --> 01:00:03,823
that built the plumb-dead-straight
Westminster Abbey.

944
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:39,971
Hair on end.

945
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:43,432
Great, but weren't we supposed to
test that against the hybrids

946
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:46,591
that Porsche and Ferrari are
developing? The Ferrari isn't ready.

947
01:00:46,592 --> 01:00:49,422
The Porsche is. It wasn't
when I filmed that. But it is now.

948
01:00:49,423 --> 01:00:52,971
I shall be driving it on the show
in a few weeks' time. Yes.

949
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:55,861
And after you've done that,
we're going to put the Stig

950
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:59,231
in both of them and do some time
laps around our track.

951
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:02,391
Now, that should be quite
something, I think.

952
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,031
I don't think it will be. Hey?
Why not?

953
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:07,871
Well, because... Were you not
listening the film? Yeah.

954
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,821
The speed of this is beyond
anything I've ever experienced.

955
01:01:10,822 --> 01:01:13,711
It's animal savagery.
It's beyond belief.

956
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:17,101
Yes, yes, yes, but the Porsche might
be faster. It won't be.

957
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:19,461
But it might be. No, but it won't be.

958
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:21,621
But... it might be.

959
01:01:21,622 --> 01:01:24,141
I guarantee it won't be.
But it might be.

960
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:26,891
Hammond, I'll do you a deal.

961
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:30,741
If the Porsche is faster
round our track than this,

962
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:34,341
I will change my name, by deed poll,

963
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,432
to Jennifer.

964
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:38,341
Really? Yes.

965
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:39,951
Promise? Yes.

966
01:01:39,952 --> 01:01:44,231
And on that potential bombshell,
it is time to end.

967
01:01:44,232 --> 01:01:46,881
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night!

968
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:54,882
