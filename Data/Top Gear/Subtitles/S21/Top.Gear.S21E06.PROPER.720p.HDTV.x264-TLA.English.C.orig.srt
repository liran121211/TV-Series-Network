2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,510
Hello. Hello, everybody,
thank you very much. Thank you.

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,470
A big welcome! Nice.

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,670
A big welcome.
Thank you and welcome.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,710
Welcome to what is
a very special show,

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,350
because it is our Christmas special.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,110
Yeah, and this year
it's a little bit different.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,590
Yeah, because it's actually
the middle of March. It is.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,750
The main reason it's a little bit
different is because our producers

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,070
have told us that
we should try our hands
at long-distance lorry driving.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,510
Literally, my idea of heaven. Yeah.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,110
They told us each to buy a truck
and report with it

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,510
to what the BBC calls the Republic
of the Union of Myanmar.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,360
But everybody else calls it Burma.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,550
The meeting point was
a giant parade ground

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,040
in the middle of
the old capital city, Rangoon.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
And I was the first to arrive.

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,310
I've bought a stereo.

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,030
I have a speaker system here
in the roof,

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,910
the passenger seat has been replaced
with a subwoofer,

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,590
and there are two amps with
a combined power of 2,300 watts.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,390
The best thing is,
included in the price was this comb

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,680
and...an entire lorry.

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,710
It was built in 1959...

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,830
or 1976.
People are a bit hazy on that.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,830
What we do know for sure
is that Isuzu made the mud flaps,

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,470
which is odd, because it says
Mitsubishi on the axles.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,910
Ooh!

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,840
Is that James? It is James.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Don't really call that a lorry.

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,510
Morning. Van, mate. What?

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,070
We had to bring lorries.
That is a lorry.

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,550
It's a van.
Technically it's a crane, actually.
I've bought a crane.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,670
Oh, is that what that is?
Look at that.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,990
A crane, two winches,
hydraulic rams, legs...

36
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,710
'And it had the latest
in high-tech dashboards.'

37
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,670
That's a mess.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,190
Isn't this going to drive
your OCD madness...

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,110
Well, I've put labels
on things corresponding to
what I think they do.

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,870
Hazards... What's that?
I've got one of those.

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,230
I've had to put a question mark
on it. Mine is a sports lorry.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,190
Straight six, rear-wheel drive,
twin exhausts.

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,590
BMW 325i and this, almost identical.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,430
Banging stereo. Really?

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,270
Seriously. You want to hear it?
Not really. I expect it's quite...

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,070
Anyway, I'm sure that won't
become annoying at all.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,470
I need to ask you a question. What?
Why are you wearing a tie?

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,030
Because I'm a modern lorry driver,

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,030
and modern lorry drivers
are crisp and sharp.

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,390
The days are over
when you simply turned up

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,240
with a glove box full of strong
pornography and egg on your vest.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,830
At this point, Hammond arrived

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,710
with a glove box full of strong
pornography and egg on his vest.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,390
What do you think?

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,390
What is it?
A lorry or a Hindu temple?

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,910
This has been extensively modded.
Has it?

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,710
Not just the visual improvements.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,950
They are significant, the lights and
the little studdy things, but note...

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,590
Oh, God.

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,910
All of that frame arrangement,
right, it's a farm truck. Yeah.

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,310
And that's so it can accommodate
those low-density big loads.

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,230
Big loads of what? Crops.
What crop? Here? In Burma?

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,790
Home of the Golden Triangle?
Hay. No. Or turnips. No.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,430
Kale. No, heroin.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,750
That's all they really grow here.
You've bought a heroin lorry.

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,110
Fit a lot of heroine in there,
wouldn't you?

67
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,310
Hammond, this seat, well, let's be
honest, it's a church pew. Yeah.

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,110
It looks like the sort of railway
carriage that Agatha Christie
went about in.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,870
James has bought a van.

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Has he parked it a long way away,
or is it that small?

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,920
'As we were admiring
the paintwork on Jeremy's lorry,
our challenge arrived.'

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,990
I'm quite excited, actually, come to
think of it! We're here with these.

73
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,830
"In 1943, British, Australian
and Dutch prisoners of war

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,470
"were forced by their Japanese
captors to build the Burma Railway

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,230
"across South-East Asia.

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,910
"Their efforts and their suffering
were immortalised in the film

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,510
"Bridge On The River Kwai.
That's what you're going to do.

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,590
"You're going to build a river
bridge which is strong enough

79
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,830
"to support the weight
of your lorries."

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,310
I don't know anything about
bridge-building. Build a bridge?!

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,630
How big a bridge are we going to
have to build... Yeah, how big?

82
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,270
How much does yours weigh? About
1,000 tonnes. Afraid it gets worse.

83
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,550
You know they said long-distance
lorry driving? Yes.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,950
"The only trouble is that you have
to drive to the river in question,

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,390
"which is in Thailand."

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,510
The River Kwai is not in Thailand.
Yes, it is.

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,110
The River Kwai is in Thailand.
Is it? Where's Thailand?
But it's in...

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,470
I promise you, the River Kwai,

89
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,230
I know everyone thinks it's Burma,
it isn't, it's Thailand.

90
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,950
So we're going to go and build
a bridge over the River Kwai.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,030
Like Alec Guinness.
I don't know how to build a bridge.

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,040
'In high spirits,
the journey began.'

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,150
We are off.

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh, yeah.

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,830
We worked out that the most sensible
way of getting to the river

96
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,670
was to head right across Burma

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,880
to its northernmost border crossing
with Thailand.

98
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,910
On this epic 1,200 mile journey,

99
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,990
we would find strange new cities
with no-one in them,

100
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,710
cross mountain ranges
straight out of Jurassic Park,

101
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,310
ford disease-filled rivers
and attend a party which made

102
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,400
the scene at the end of Apocalypse
Now look like a quiet night in.

103
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,870
And we'd have to do it all
in lorries which,

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,630
right at the start,
weren't really working properly.

105
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,990
There are gauges. Nothing works.

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,310
Nothing at all. Not one of them.

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,550
Not fuel gauge, oil,
oil pressure, charge, vacuum,

108
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,240
temperature, nothing works.

109
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,830
Oh, God above!

110
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,510
Ah! That's not it.

111
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,630
There's no synchromesh
on this gearbox,

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,470
so when you go from third to second
or whatever, you have to -

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,030
oh, bloody Nora - double de-clutch.

114
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,110
Like that. Only smoother.

115
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Oh!

116
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, God.

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,560
How fast am I going?
Speedo doesn't work.

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,350
Oh, my giddy aunt!
The ride is shocking.

119
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
OG!

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,080
Possibly a bit of play
in the steering.

121
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,790
Let me talk you through my brakes.
They don't really work.

122
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,590
I've got three centimetres of
pedal travel where nothing happens,

123
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,560
and then a millimetre where it all
happens and the wheels lock up.

124
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,110
There's no handbrake,
and I'm not being stupid.
I've looked everywhere.

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
There isn't a puh-chh! one,
there isn't hand one,
there isn't a switch.

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,390
And on top of
the mechanical problems,

127
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,110
we had to deal with
Rangoon's pedestrians.

128
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop wandering about in the road!

129
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,390
Whoa! A granddad's just walked
by that child, right underneath
your lorry.

130
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Whoa! Somebody else just did it.

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,120
Pedestrians have no concept
of traffic. None at all.

132
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,560
And there was another issue.

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,630
One of the reasons that driving
here is so difficult

134
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,470
is because everybody, as you can
see, has right-hand-drive cars,

135
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,840
but they drive on the right.

136
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,070
And this is because, for 46 years,
Burma was run by

137
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,840
a chap called General Ne Win,
who was a proper lunatic.

138
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,350
He was guided mostly either by
his dreams or by his astrologers.

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,910
One morning, he woke up
and he thought,

140
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,350
"My country is slipping too far
to the left politically,

141
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,790
"so I shall correct this
by forcing everybody

142
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,280
"to drive on the right-hand side
of the road."

143
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,430
This makes life particularly
difficult for bus passengers.

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,350
In a minute, we'll see a bus
pulled up at the side of the road,

145
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,870
at a bus stop, but all the people
will be getting out

146
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,950
into the road, because the bus used
to go on the left, so the doors...

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,160
It's just complete madness!

148
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,270
You may be wondering why today

149
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,840
people don't buy
left-hand-drive cars...

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,200
..and if I'm honest,
I'm wondering that as well.

151
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Our worst problem, however,
was that James was navigating.

152
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,550
James, can I say,
this can't be right.

153
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,320
Sorry! Sorry!

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,920
How does James ever land his
aeroplane where he wants to be?

155
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,960
Right, should be this way.

156
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,840
'It wasn't.'
Will I even fit down there?

157
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,550
Mind that sign on your right,
Hammond. This is ridiculously tight!

158
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,270
'As I sorted out some compensation
for the damaged fruit...'

159
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,030
Thank you. No, no!
Oh, I see, it was not enough.

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,670
'..Hammond was discovering
for the very first time

161
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,670
'the problems of being tall.'

162
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,230
Hold on a second, these wires...
these are too low.

163
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh, God.

164
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,790
I'm thinking if I crane out...
It's only this one, isn't it?

165
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,070
Yeah, lift that, you come
underneath, I'll drop it on you,

166
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,390
then it will just slide
along your rails.

167
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,030
Do it.
How about five crisp English pounds?

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
Keep coming. Keep coming.

169
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,470
Haven't been electrocuted yet.

170
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,360
Haven't been electrocuted yet.
Still haven't been electrocuted.

171
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,910
I don't like it!
Oh, everyone's going to die!

172
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,470
BANG!

173
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,990
You've ripped a hole
in the top of my truck!

174
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,790
James... Why is your...
Your lorry's moving, James!

175
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,710
You've winched yourself into...
Put your handbrake on.

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,390
It hasn't got a handbrake.
What do you mean,
it hasn't got a handbrake?

177
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
It hasn't got a handbrake!

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,000
'We were causing chaos.'

179
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,360
It's broken.

180
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,910
Whoa! What was that?!
James, I've got a headache!

181
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,640
I've never concentrated this hard!

182
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Sorry. I don't think it will
go through there, mate.

183
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,000
Sorry. Sorry.

184
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,320
Still, the good news is
we've done two miles.

185
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,760
'Mercifully, we eventually broke
free from the narrow streets.'

186
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,270
I'm in agony. Left foot,
endless gear changing...

187
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,270
God above.

188
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
Reverse.

189
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,670
Third... Oh, Christ!

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
Hang on a minute.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,590
If I engage the low range
then I can put it in third gear

192
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,760
and basically leave it there
all day.

193
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,510
A-ha! How brilliant is this?

194
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,950
Oh, yeah.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,750
No more gear changing.

196
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
That doesn't feel
very low range to me.

197
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,520
What is it
if it isn't a low-range gearbox?

198
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh, my God!

199
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,960
My truck has split in half.

200
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,230
'After I had explained to Jeremy
that he'd bought a tipper lorry,

201

'I then had to deal with
CW McCall on the CB radio.'

202
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,110
Hey, James. Hello.

203
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,950
I've got it. You've got it?

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,710
Yeah, my handle.

205
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm going to be called
Fighting Peacock.

206
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,190
Can I just abbreviate that to Cock?
What are you going to be?

207
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,830
I thought I'd be James,
because that's my name.

208
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
Fighting Peacock!

That's my first lock-up,
total lock-up.

I've lost second gear.

There it is.

233
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,590

he's mad.

I'm sitting on a church pew,
for God's sake.

My knee... Ah!

239
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,190
Ow! Ow!

240
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,520
My knee! Ow!

00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,960
That is the going down of the sun.

242

It's fabulous. Look at that.

243
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,150
However, when the sun
had finished going down,

244
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
things weren't so fabulous.

245
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,240
That girl on that bike,
she's just invisible.

246
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,270
There's a moped there
with no lights on

247
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,390
and a bicycle there
with no lights on,

248
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,990
and I can't really see them,

249
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,760
because my headlights are, well,
they're glow-worms in jam jars.

250
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Can you see anything, Hammond?

251
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,270
Not a thing.

252
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,560
Literally, just my own stupid
reflection in my windscreen.

253
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,150
Jeez, I'm so frightened of
running over a pedestrian,

254
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,480
I'm not even worried
about my knee any more.

255
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,790
Whoa!

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,270
Well, if I had to dip
the headlights,

257
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,080
it would appear to be
full beam or off.

258
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,510
A lorry with one central headlamp,
so you think it's a motorbike

259
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,320
until the last second, and then, no!
It's a massive truck!

260
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm bloody tired. I've been driving
today for exactly 12 hours.

261
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,800
That would be illegal in Britain.

262
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,000
But we are now very close
to the overnight hotel.

263
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,120
'Two agonising hours later,
we reached it.'

264
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,360
Do you know what? This is like a
trucker's place. Are we staying here?

265
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,160
'The producers said yes,
and that our room was upstairs.'

266
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, it's not so bad!
Is it not so bad? Yeah.

267
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
Oh, God.

268
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,880
Worst night's sleep in history.
It wasn't sleep.

269
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,750
This lot. What were they doing?

270
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,710
That.

271
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,030
Look what I've done.

272
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,070
What have you done?

273
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,000
It's a leg brace so I can change
gear. So it supports my knee.

274
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,750
Let's go. Let's just move on,
erase it...

275
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,350
You know those Ice Road Truckers,
they're always going,

276
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,230
"We got a real tough job..."
They can shut up.

277
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,070
Cos I don't suspect that
the Ice Road Truckers

278
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,230
have to sleep like this chap here.

279
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,360
Look at him.

280
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,120
'Before leaving, I checked the map
to see how far we'd come.'

281
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,160
No? Here? Are you sure?

282
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
Here.

283
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,360
Show me. Hammond.

284
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,040
This is where we began.

285
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,270
We're heading for here,
up here, around here.

286
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,990
So where do you think we are, then,
on this road?

287
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,790
No. We're here.

288
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,510
You know that fork when we left
Rangoon and James went left?

289
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,430
All of yesterday we drove up here.
What was it, 14, 15 hours?

290
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,520
Yeah, but... You're on
the way to Bangladesh.

291
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,310
'James suggested we go
all the way back to Rangoon

292
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,190
'and start again, but I fired him
as navigator and said

293
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,520
'we should take a small road over
the hills to get back on course.

294
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,000
'This would mean driving
deep into the sticks.'

295
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,470
There seems to be a tradition here
for riding on a lorry rather than

296
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,510
necessarily in it. I've just seen
three or four blokes

297
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,230
on the top of the cab of a lorry.

298
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,750
So if he brakes suddenly,

299
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,480
they all get run over, I suppose.

300
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,590
'Still, could be worse.'

301
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,280
Uh!

302
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,510
I'm not a young man and I'm
not a fit man, I'll be honest.

303
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,670
And I am suffering in here.
This ride is really brutal.

304
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,030
The problem is that the sports
lorry was designed

305
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,710
to work for a living,

306
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,510
was designed to have five or six
tonnes of stuff in the back.

307
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,160
Without that weight, it's just
bouncing all over the place.

308
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,630
'Obviously, I didn't want
to admit this to my colleagues,

309
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,360
'so when we stopped for tea I tried
discreetly to rectify the problem.'

310
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,470
He's putting bricks in his truck to
weigh it down to improve the ride.

311
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,920
I can see. He's going to need
a lot of bricks.

312
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,150
'Having come to the same conclusion,

313
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,000
'I decided to borrow
James's complicated crane.'

314
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,320
I can't stand watching this.

315
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Right.

316
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,680
What the hell's happening?
What have you done, you moron?

317
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,480
I think you've actually
caught your own lorry.

318
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,880
Stop! Help! My knee!

319
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,680
Save the day!

320
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,030
Oh, dear. Stop! Put it down!

321
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,710
You'll break the jib off the crane.
And you've knackered my lorry.

322
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,390
I've just saved the day
by tipping my lorry up.

323
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,910
The bricks have fallen out,
the handbrake's not on.

324
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,000
What have you done? It is on.

325
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,160
'At this point, I opted for
a less high-tech solution.

326
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,910
'And after they'd loaded a tonne
of bricks in the back,

327
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,120
'there was a noticeable difference.'

328
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,600
It's not perfect,
but it's a hell of a lot better.

329
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,600
If I put more weight in,
it will be even more comfortable.

330
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,720
'So at the next village, I bought
some of the region's special seeds.'

331
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,640
What's he doing?

332
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,510
He thinks he's bought some heroin.

333
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,070
I have. Has he?

334
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,910
I have bought heroin. It's rice.
It isn't rice. It is rice.

335
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,030
Richard Hammond, trust me on this,
on the streets of London,

336
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,600
this has a value of £12 million.

337
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,590
No, mate, on the shelves of Tesco,
that has a value of about a fiver.

338
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,600
It's not rice!
Are you going to cut it with peas?

339
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,870
'With the heroin loaded,

340
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,950
'I found a heavy old tree stump

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
'and asked James
to crane it on board as well.'

342
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,320
He is so unbelievably happy.

343
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,510
'With the sports lorry fully loaded,
it was transformed.'

344
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,510
Oh, yeah!

345
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,360
First bump, I shan't even feel it,
because the ride is sublime.

346
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,760
The ride of a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

347
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,120
'However, on the hills,
there was a bit of a downside.'

348
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,790
Hello, James and Richard?

349
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
What?

350
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,750
This is my new top speed.

351
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,750
Oh, God, I thought we were
stuck behind a moped.

352
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,790
I couldn't see. Is this it?

353
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,590
Yes.

354
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,800
You're a right dipstick.

355
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes.

356
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,950
'And because the road was so narrow,
we couldn't get past him.'

357
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,440
Uh-oh!

358
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,560
Steep gradient.

359
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,960
Foot hard down.

360
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,270
Dearie me, we're in trouble here.

361
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,240
This is ridiculous!
We're hardly moving.

362
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,390
No, we've had it.
You're going to have to back up.

363
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,790
I need a run-up for this bit. What?
It won't go up this hill.

364
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,390
You're going to have to back up.

365
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,270
No, this hill has gone on
for about a mile through hairpins.

366
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,750
I'm not reversing back down.

367
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,950
James, could you explain
the situation to him?
I can't go forwards.

368
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,670
I can't back up either.

369
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,910
A, Hammond's in the way,
and B, I can't be bothered.

370
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,200
..There's round bends,
this people on bikes. No.

371
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,720
Well, there's only one thing for it,
then. I have to lose weight.

372
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
Oh, no.

373
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,080
No! Jeremy, that's not...

374
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,800
You are a complete child,
a petulant child.

375
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,710
You wanted me
to move out of your way.

376
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,680
I am now able
to move out of your way.

377
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,390
Look at this. Yes!

378
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,960
This lorry
is now scampering up these hills.

379
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,150
Right. Well...

380
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,800
One, two...

381
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,430
'Stopping to mend my tailgate
allowed the others to catch up,

382
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,920
'and when they did,
they weren't in the best of moods.'

383
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,720
I've got a new handle for you on
the CB. It's called Selfish BLEEP.

384
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,550
'And things didn't improve
a few miles later

385
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,520
'when the hill route I'd selected
went a bit wrong.'

386
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,390
Your road is sort of not a road,
is it? Let's be honest.

387
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,750
Clarkson, you are a...

388
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,280
It's not really a road here at all.
We've got a ford.

389
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,640
Here we go, into the water.

390
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,480
Lots of wheel spin, sliding badly.

391
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,320
Oh, yes.

392
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,350
The sports lorry is clear,
it's through.

393
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
It's time for the smug face.

394
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,640
'Mr Slowly went next...in his van.'

395
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,640
That's quite clunky.

396
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,990
It's... There's something stuck
there, I can feel it.

397
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,750
We'll break the front axle off.

398
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,750
'Hammond immediately rushed
to May's aid.'

399
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,280
Ramming.

400
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Stop!

401
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,710
'James then tried
to winch himself off

402
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,280
'using Hammond's truck
as a ground anchor.'

403
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,920
Ted Nugent and George Michael
are helping one another out.

404
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,590
'After this failed,
I tried to tow him clear.'

405
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Three, two, one, now.

406
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,990
'But that didn't work either.'

407
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,950
Stop!

408
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,160
'He then decided to use his crane,
which immediately broke.

409
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,160
'He really was stuck, so we were
forced to take drastic action.'

410
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,400
Hammond and I have had
a bit of a chat and we are...

411
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,910
Well, we're leaving him.

412
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,750
He has bought a van
that has no traction at all,

413
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,910
no ability to work off road

414
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,670
and now no hydraulics
so none of his tools work.

415
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,510
You've got to be ruthless
in these circumstances.

416
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,190
With his crane, he was useful.

417
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,760
Without it,
he's just another mouth to feed.

418
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,510
'I settled in for another stint
with the world's most
cooperative gearbox.'

419
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,750
Oh, bollocks, missed again.

420
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,550
Nothing there.

421
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
Nothing there, there it is.

422
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,800
'I knew, on these twisting roads,
life was even worse for Hammond.'

423
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,590
This is really annoying.

424
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,520
'Still, at least I was moving.'

425
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,070
The situation report.

426
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,950
I've been rescued by a very helpful
local man with his truck.

427
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,630
I still don't know his name.

428
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,190
He's lent me this arc welder

429
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,920
to repair the shaft that drives
the pump that makes the crane work.

430
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,430
'With that done, my fellow
knight of the road towed me

431
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,760
'back to firmer ground.'

432
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,960
And then we're free.

433
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,480
I must remember to say a thousand
chei-zu-boos to this man.

434
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,870
'Miles ahead. in the advance party,
we were really starting to climb.'

435
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,070
Oh-ho-ho!

436
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,200
Wow!

437
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,160
'The views were stunning.

438
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,400
'And at the top of the hill,
we pulled over for a bit of a look.'

439
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,510
You know we always say
that Italy is God's race track,

440
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,360
Canada is his pantry,
Germany is his workshop?

441
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,200
That's his garden.

442
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,840
Absolutely staggering.

443
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,320
'Captain Traction would have enjoyed
this view very much, however...'

444
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,600
Bollocks.

445
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,280
The local bloke with a digger is
giving me a little leg up there.

446
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,070
It's great, isn't it? This must be
Buddhism in action.

447
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,310
I might convert.

448
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
From whatever I already am.

449
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,230
'Very, very far ahead,
Hammond and I finally found the road

450
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,280
'we should have been on
in the first place.'

451
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,000
Put it in top gear.

452
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,950
There it is. Oh, yeah.

453
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
That sounds terrible.

454
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,960
It's like being back in Spain.
Nothing on it.

455
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,990
'Regrouped, we continued onwards.

456
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,400
'Our destination, Burma's brand-new
capital city, Naypyidaw.'

457
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,270
'Here, the producers had once again
lined up a hovel for us to stay in.

458
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,750
'But we were hot, filthy
and worn out.

459
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,760
'So we ignored them and headed
for the best hotel in town.'

460
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,880
A flushing lavatory.

461
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,390
Oh, rest my weary head.

462
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,240
Having first filled it with gin.

463
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,880
Oh, listen to that rain.

464
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,160
It'll be like the shower
or something. 30 seconds.

465
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,910
'Our only problem was that two of us

466
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,350
'weren't exactly dressed
for a place like this.'

467
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,470
Let me do the talking.

468
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,710
Good evening, sir. Evening, sir.

469
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,390
Three rooms, please.

470
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,200
Sorry, no more rooms, sir.

471
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Fully booked.

472
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,640
Sorry, sir.

473
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,910
'The next morning
after another dreadful night,

474
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,630
'we decided enough was enough and
agreed we should modify our lorries

475
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,040
'to make them more suitable
for our travels through Burma.

476
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,990
'So we found a workshop,
hired some local help,

477
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,590
'toiled through the night,

478
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,160
'and the next morning
the job was done.'

479
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,870
Every modification I have made

480
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,670
is inspired by my desire
not to run over any of the locals.

481
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,670
So it has, for example,
Buddha looking down,

482
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,590
a lucky elephant, the lucky owl
which is very important,

483
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,870
it has better mirrors,

484
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,030
better lights and it is wearing
a high visibility jacket.

485
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,030
Yes, as are you. What is
the boiler in the back? That...

486
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,390
Are you brewing beer?
What? No, sadly.

487
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,150
It's the water tank
for the brake cooling system.

488
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,070
What, like racing lorries have?
Exactly like that.

489
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,630
It sprays. I've got a little switch.

490
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,710
It sprays water on the drums,
makes them more efficient downhill.

491
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,830
I didn't think of that.
No. What's the box?

492
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,070
Air conditioning. What's that got to
do with safety? Keeps me alert.

493
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,390
Does it? Yes.
And keeps him alert as well.

494
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Because he'll want to break it. Yes.

495
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,080
'Jeremy then showed us his work.'

496
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:35,270
Why would you not have a convertible
lorry. Cos it's raining. Look at it!

497
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,070
It's... It's quite good actually.
Smashing. It's very good.

498
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,510
Shelby striping.
Sports badging on the side.

499
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,070
Living accommodation on the back.

500
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,070
This is fashioned from lead
and rhodium. Is it?

501
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,160
Yes, for extra weight
to improve my ride. Come back.

502
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,430
Simple, crisp accommodation inside,
Shelby bedding and ebony wood floor.

503
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,520
More weight. Come on!
It looks brilliant.

504
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,990
'As, it must be said,
did Hammond's.'

505
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,350
Hammond, you've got white walls!
Oh, yeah, yeah!

506
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,950
The ugly duckling has become a swan.
Wow! Yeah!

507
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,270
Check out my stacks. Please don't
tell me they're exhausts.

508
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,950
Yeah. Both sides.

509
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,870
What, actually func...? They are.
Yeah, there's a T-junction.

510
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,910
Hang on, you've made it even taller.
I have. It's bigger, isn't it?

511
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,270
It's better. But, come round
the back, this... Honestly.

512
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,910
He did a little skip then.
He's very excited. He did a skip.

513
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,390
I am very, very... What I have here,
this is the bathroom area. Shower.

514
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,110
It's got a shower. Where's the water
come from? Ha-ha! Ha-ha yourself.

515
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,270
There is, up the top, a reservoir.
About so big.

516
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,110
On my viewing gallery. Hammond, it's
a bucket. It's... It's a bucket.

517
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,030
It's a remote reservoir.

518
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,830
And that is, right now,

519
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,510
collecting beautiful crisp, clean,
fresh, invigorating rainwater.

520
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,230
This is the kitchen area with lino
to reflect that. What's that?

521
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,590
Over there is a wardrobe.

522
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,110
There is a hammock with mosquito net
built-in. Drinks globe on the right.

523
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,270
'And Hammond wasn't finished.'

524
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,910
From up here, on a sunny evening,
I can sit here as the sun goes down,

525
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,990
gaze at the stars and enjoy
a drink from my drinks globe.

526
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,230
Do you take visitors? Yeah.

527
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,190
I think he's going to have to
because something
has just occurred to me.

528
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,950
What? You haven't got
any living accommodation.

529
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,670
That's a very good point.
You've forgotten it, you idiot!

530
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
No, I haven't.

531
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,990
Well, you have.
Are you sleeping in the cab?

532
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,390
Because it's not going to be
comparable. Let's... Let's see.

533
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,190
'Before we set off,
I gave the chaps some presents.'

534
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,750
You bought us a teddy bear?
No, that's for me. Is it?

535
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,990
Yeah, that's my bonnet ornament. Are
you feeling lonely? It's your what?

536
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,430
Bonnet ornament for weight. It's
the heaviest teddy bear in Burma.

537
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,200
'I'd got Hammond
a bonnet ornament too.'

538
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,750
Wow, that's beautiful.

539
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,430
I know you don't have a clock
so you'll have it on the bonnet,

540
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,270
you'll be able to tell the time.
Oh, it really is...

541
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,830
It's a high-quality gift.
Oh, fantastic! Thank you.

542
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,230
I've always wanted
a Shuanglin hammer.

543
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,560
It's from my own personal
collection.

544
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,080
'Having christened my bear Rudyard,
and attached him to
the sports lorry, we set off.'

545
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,870
Oh, this feels better already.

546
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Oh, hang on.

547
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,280
Richard Hammond is doing
a remake of The Poseidon Adventure.

548
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,870
'We had many miles to cover

549
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,360
'but first we had to get through
Naypyidaw's morning rush hour.'

550
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,550
This rush hour traffic is
not as bad as I thought.

551
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,200
'The roads were completely empty.
And massive.'

552
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,920
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. Yep, 16 lanes now.

553
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,790
Wait, it's gone bigger.

554
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,590
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten. 20.

555
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
It's 20 lanes now.

556
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,360
'This may look stupid and pointless,
but actually it really isn't.'

557
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,550
The problem with most cities
is that the growth comes

558
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,830
and the city simply
can't accommodate it.

559
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,590
That happened in London, Rome,
Paris, Bangkok, everywhere.

560
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,520
That is not going to happen here.

561
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,790
I think this must be
the first city built

562
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,760
entirely in anticipation
of the future.

563
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,480
'But the future hasn't arrived yet.

564
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,200
'So, for now, the whole place is
almost completely deserted.

565
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,270
'Even here, in the shadow
of the parliament building,

566
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,270
'we were able to have a game of
football in the middle of the road.'

567
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,560
Officer.

568
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,830
It's the Burmese police versus Top
Gear. Oh, no. Rush hour, game over.

569
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,910
Look at it, traffic.

570
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,310
Really though,
it was too wet for football.

571
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:33,150
So, much to Hammond's annoyance, we
organised a city centre drag race.

572
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,190
This doesn't seem fair.

573
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,030
I've got the same 6.4 litre Isuzu
straight-six diesel as Jeremy's

574
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,960
and probably James's,
but the lumber bus is bigger.

575
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,880
We're not going to cover ourselves
in glory here, old girl.

576
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
Disastrous start. There it is!

577
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,080
This is going to hurt,
we're going to have to rev you hard.

578
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,150
Sports truck is gaining. Gaining.

579
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,630
Gaining. Gaining, gaining.

580
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,840
No!

581
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,480
115km an hour.

582
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,240
Come on! Yes!

583
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh, victory is sweet.

584
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,190
Second place.
But I have got a crane.

585
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,880
Must brake, must brake.

586
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,640
Oh, got a football under
the brake pedal. That's bad.

587
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Hammond, have you finished yet?

588
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,680
Still going.

589
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,230
'After Hammond had lumbered across
the line, we headed out of Naypyidaw

590
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,680
'and soon we started to discover
some flaws with our modifications.'

591
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,640
Oh, my... No...no, wait.

592
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm speaking to you now
from underneath
my businessman's umbrella.

593
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,750
It has taken the water
about 15 minutes to fathom it out

594
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,360
but it's in here now
and it's in in great quantities.

595
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,560
Oh, I can hear my exhaust
hitting a tree.

596
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,030
Hammond, you're doing the council
out of a job, mate.

597
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,430
It's like I'm driving through
the aftermath of a hurricane.

598
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,470
Let's rename him Pruning Peacock.

599
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,880
'Soon, though,
James was punished for mocking.'

600
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,550
Captain Workmanship.

601
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,600
It's a radiator hose.
It's not a bit I've touched.

602
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,230
Well, we have a tradition.

603
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,030
Oh, no, how am I going to
do it without them(!)

604
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,390
'Leaving James to deliver
an interesting lecture...'

605
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,910
If you're watching this
from an engineering workshop

606
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,550
or technical college, this is not
the correct tool for the job.

607
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,800
'..we continued on our way.'

608
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,640
I think a lot of the fumes
are coming into the cab
from under my new stack.

609
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,640
Not all of my improvements
have turned out to be improvements.

610
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,830
The simple tradition of
the British dustman,

611
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,830
putting a teddy bear
on the front of a lorry,

612
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,280
is bringing joy
to the children of Burma.

613
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,040
They love Rudyard!

614
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,590
'By mid-afternoon
we were all reunited

615
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,840
'and James took advantage
of my mobile maintenance service.'

616
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,630
This isn't perilous at all(!)

617
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,750
Oh, it's about
three or four inches.

618
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,070
Too far.

619
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,910
'Soon, the road started to climb,
and as night fell,

620
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,520
'I turned on the roof lights
that I'd fitted myself.'

621
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,310
Oh, yes!

622
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,710
MUSIC: "The Great Gig In The Sky"
by Pink Floyd

623
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,760
I'm driving a Pink Floyd gig
right now.

624
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,080
I love this!
The noise, the chaos, the heat...

625
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,630
I think I might have just lost
one of my...

626
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,320
Yeah, I did. I lost a stack.

627
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,350
I've got to carry on.

628
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,720
I'm just going to pretend I didn't.

629
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,270
'Meanwhile, in the darkness,
James was coming over all Buddhist.'

630
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,520
Hang on, I've got a personal
dog escort here.

631
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,190
Shift your ass, dog.

632
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,560
Oh, God, give me strength!

633
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,670
I think that dog
was inhabited by a benign spirit.

634
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,790
Seriously -
if that dog hadn't done that,

635
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,080
I'd have gone onto the bridge
and I'd have hit the bus.

636
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,990
'Sadly, Buddhist dog wasn't around
when five miles later,

637
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,560
'I had another breakdown.'

638
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,990
That's what came off. That's the
old one, which tore itself to shreds

639
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,910
and in the process, pulled the wire
out of the sender

640
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,950
for the temperature gauge,
so I don't have that any more.

641
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,360
This lorry is crap.

642
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,670
'Up ahead, Richard and I
were looking forward

643
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,360
'to a night in our new
on-board accommodation.

644
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,200
'But thanks to the British Empire,
we didn't need it.'

645
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,710
'After a night here,

646
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,270
'4,000 feet up a mountain in a small
village in the middle of Burma,

647
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,230
'at this strangely odd
but comfortable Bournemouth hotel,

648
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,560
'we were feeling refreshed.

649
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,150
'And with Hammond leading,

650
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,640
''we were out of the village
in a mere couple of hours.'

651
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,400
Hang on - whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

652
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

653
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,870
Oh, God...

654
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,270
Go slowly. OK?

655
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,510
Oh, thank you.

656
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,910
Keep going, hang on...

657
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,510
Are we going to spend the whole day
tiptoeing under telephone wires?

658
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,320
No, because you'll break down
eventually.

659
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,750
OK, there's going to be
a motorcyclist coming past you.

660
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,400
Check out his helmet.

661
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,240
That's quite a strong statement.

662
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,190

None. I mean, it's dry,

- you've got to bleed the system,
haven't you? And it's hours.
- Yeah.

717
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,870
Well, look, why don't you just go
and snout around the village

Why me?
You're the youngest and fittest.

719

Well, it's your fault we're in
this situation. But I'm old and hot.

720
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,480

anybody's got to go, it's you, mate.

Fuel. Diesel.
And as much as you can. Yes.

723
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,950
What is Burmese for "diesel"?

724
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,590
How do you mime "diesel"?
Mime a lorry.

725
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,870
Brrr... And then do that.

726
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,880
Right, so I'm a butler with
Parkinson's, and I've got a gun.

Still quite hot, that.

730
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,870
Done the oil. Have you? Are you
reading Bridge On The River Kwai?

731
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,230
Yeah, he's just gone into the hut...
Bad news. What? Bad news. What?

732
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,920
I haven't been able to get
any diesel.

with a clever alternative.'

No, you halfwit.

735
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,270
There's no diesel in this village.

736
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,150
But there is diesel
in the next village.

737
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,470
So we use the horses
to ride to the next village,

738
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,550
get the diesel, bring it back
to the trucks.

739
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,870
We're not in a Western.
I can't ride a horse. What?

740
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,739
Well, I might have been pony
trekking when I was eight, but...

741
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,350
Well, it'll be in
there, won't it?

742
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,280
Well, I wouldn't use that one there.
Holy moly!

743
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,470
Why do they have five legs in Burma?
Maybe so it can milk itself?

744
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,950
Shall we spend all day looking
at a horse's willy, or shall we go?!

745
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,150

752

Ready, steady, go.

753
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,390
Well, I've bought a stalled horse.
It's going backwards.

754
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,990
I've bought a reversing horse.

755
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,630
I think if we get moving,
yours might follow more readily.

756
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,910
James, can you turn right
and go up there? Turn around.

757
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,990
How do you make it turn around?
Anybody know how to start
a Burmese horse?

758
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,310
Go on, follow your mate.
Yes. Very good.

759
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,630

Yep. Not bust. Nothing exciting.

So what is it you have to do,
basically steering...?

806
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,790
Yeah, be all right.
You just have to...

Yeah. Still do that. Right.

Um, not bad. What about yours?
Fine.

00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,310
Where did James sleep in the end,
what's he done?

811
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,670
Oh, he's got some stupid high-tech
mountaineering tent on his crane.

812
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,150
Why is it up there?

813
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,990
Well... You know his snoring?

Yeah...

815
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,800

a bit further away.

Very funny. Yes.
I don't like heights,

they put diesel in my truck.

Assuming it IS diesel.

01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,350
It's covered in ants...
Oh, it's an ants' nest!

832
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,470
That's a mistake. Ow!

833
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

834
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,830
'This, then, looked like
it was going to be

835
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,230
'another day of calamities
and mishaps.

836
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,670
'But actually, here,
in this part of Burma,

837
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,960
'we had to get properly serious.'

838
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,360
Today is a big day for us,
because we are headed for the Shan.

839
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,910
Top Gear's been to a lot of
remote places over the years

840
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,350
but we've never been anywhere
quite like this.

841
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,230
The Shan is to Burma
what Scotland is to Britain,

842
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,550
it's a part of it,
and yet it's separate.

843
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,470
We know there's been
a civil war in there,

844
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,390
we understand there's
a cease-fire at the moment...

845
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,870
Only a handful of Westerners
have ever been there,

846
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,470
and certainly, no TV show
has ever been allowed in.

847
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,880
We are the first...ever.

848
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,430
All of the people who've been
fighting are coming together tonight

849
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,440
to welcome us
here to the Shan State.

850
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,600
Who's got any whisky? Got any Scotch?

851
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,400
BLEEP second gear failed
and now the engine has BLEEP.

852
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,560
Hammond, you idiot! You've reversed
into the sports lorry!

853
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,910
"Work on the bridge starts at 0500"?
What?

854
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,000
Get in! Get in.

855
