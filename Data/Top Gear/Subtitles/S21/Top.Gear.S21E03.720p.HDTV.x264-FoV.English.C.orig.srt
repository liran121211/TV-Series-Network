1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,650
Tonight, I eat a cabbage,

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,650
James throws a bird out of a car

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,650
and Richard forgets
the abbreviation for America.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,700
USB.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,650
Hello, everybody! Good evening.
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,650
Thank you, everybody. Now,

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,650
I want to start by talking
about Denmark because, you see,

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,650
over the years, this tiny little
country has contributed

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,650
so much to the
betterment of mankind.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,650
It's given us interesting furniture,
stylish hi-fi,

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,650
amusing children's toys
and, of course, this.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,650
Danish bacon, Danish butter,
wrapped in bread,

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,650
to create the only known cure

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,650
for vegetarianism.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Denmark, however,
has never made a car...until now.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,650
Because Denmark has
more windmills per head

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,650
than any other country on Earth

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,650
and because Copenhagen
is a cyclist's paradise,

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
you know exactly what
sort of car it's going to be.

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Yeah, well, it isn't.

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,650
I was also expecting Hans Christian
Andersen with windscreen wipers

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
or The Little Mermaid
with door handles, but no.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,700
What we've got instead is this.

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,700
A 1,086 horsepower orange monster!

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,700
It's called the Zenvo ST1
and it is extremely fast.

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,700
It's got a 6.8 litre V8...

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,700
..which is supercharged
AND turbocharged.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,650
And that's like smearing
a habanero chilli with wasabi

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
and then garnishing it
with dynamite.

30
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,700
The net result is
a speedometer that can't keep up.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
It's just a blur.
138, 150, 170-something...

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
My God! No, no idea!

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Apparently, however, flat out,
it will do 233mph.

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,650
You know those Scandinavian
crime dramas,

35
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,700
lots of quietly thoughtful people in
jumpers looking out of the window?

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,650
This is nothing like that.
Nothing at all.

37
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,650
So, it is very definitely
a supercar.

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,650
And that's a problem

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,650
because who's going to say,
"No, I don't want a Ferrari

40
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,650
"or a Lamborghini
or a Pagani or a Bugatti

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,650
"or a Porsche or an Audi R8
or a McLaren or an Aston Martin

42
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,650
"I would rather spend my money
on something totally unproven,

43
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,650
"preferably from a company
I've never heard of?"

44
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
I mean, why would you do that?

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,650
It's not like the engine is
made from the tears of an angel

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,650
by the gods of science
and precision.

47
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,650
What's more,
it has conventional suspension

48
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
and a heavy, steel chassis.

49
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,650
However, because it's
a bit last-week, you can

50
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,700
have some old-fashioned
fun in the corners.

51
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,650
Oh-ho-ho!

52
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,700
'But you can also have an accident.'

53
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,650
Part of the problem is that
if you engage sport or race mode,

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,650
the traction control is disengaged.

55
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,650
Now, this, according to
the - oops - chief engineer,

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
makes it pretty much undrivable

57
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,650
He's right.

58
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
He is right.

59
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,650
There were also some issues
with quality.

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,650
The lights filled with condensation,

61
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,650
the rear brakes didn't seem to be
working properly,

62
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,650
then the clutch went.

63
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
So the car had to go
back to Denmark.

64
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,650
After a couple of weeks,
however, it was mended,

65
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
so the Zenvo came back.

66
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,650
But almost immediately...

67
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,650
a cooling fan went wrong.

68
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,650
Fire, fire, fire! Copy that.

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,700
So the car became even more orange.

70
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,700
And that was the end of that.

71
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,650
That didn't do very well.

72
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,650
How much is this thing?
How much? Mm.

73
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,650
?800,000. 800?!

74
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,650
Yes. Are there any upsides to it?
Er, upsides, yes.

75
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,650
The fire did get rid of
the condensation in the lights.

76
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,650
Apart from the fire?
Apart from the fire...

77
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,650
Yes, it's surprisingly comfortable
and very quiet.

78
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,650
Well, it would be quiet.
It was broken.

79
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,650
Yes, but amazingly, they have
mended it again and it's back again.

80
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,650
And now we can find out how fast
it does a lap of our track,

81
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,650
or rather IF it can do
a lap of our track.

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,650
That, of course, means handing it
over to our tame racing driver

83
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Some say that this week
he is wearing two layers of Nomex.

84
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,650
And that on a recent trip
to Cornwall,

85
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,650
he stopped off for one of his
special big wees in Somerset.

86
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,650
All we know is he's called The Stig!

87
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,650
And he's off!

88
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,650
Cautious start because
it is soaking out there today.

89
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,650
Be beautiful, though, if it catches
fire. Right, first corner.

90
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Will it try to bite him?
Nothing so far.

91
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,650
Oh, no, wait, there is
a bit of a nibble at the end.

92
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,650
Absolutely no idea what
The Stig is listening to.

93
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,700
I do know, however, he is in full
race mode. No traction control

94
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,650
He is being cautious, though.

95
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,650
Right, through the Hammerhead.

96
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,650
Oh, no, it's stepped out again,
but he has managed to hold it.

97
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
God, that is very good driving!

98
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,650
Right, is he going to lift?

99
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,650
Oh, yes, he is going to lift

100
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,650
because that thing is as racy
as the Danish Prime Minister.

101
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,650
Through the tyres.

102
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,650
Only two corners left.

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,650
You can actually see it squirming on
the lake where our track used to be.

104
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,650
Only Gambon left before he can have
a lie down. Is he going to make it?

105
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,650
Is IT going to make it?

106
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,650
Yes, it has!

107
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,650
Now...

108
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,650
I have the time here.

109
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Remember, it is an?800,000
1,000 horsepower car, so here we go.

110
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,650
Ohhh...

111
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,650
No, it's a bit lower. Really?

112
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,650
Ohhh...

113
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,650
Oh-ho!

114
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,650
There you go, it's 1.29.9,

115
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,650
slower than a Ford Focus.

116
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,650
No, no, hang on a minute.
I'm sorry. Hang on a minute.

117
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,650
Let's be fair about it. We need to
look at another time for a wet lap.

118
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,650
There you go. It's slower than
a German saloon car. It is!

119
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,650
You know this is Danish and it s
orange and it's genetically flawed?

120
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,650
I'm surprised they haven't
called The Giraffe...

121
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,650
..and shot it.

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,650
He said that out loud,
didn't he? He did.

123
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,650
He said it out loud.

124
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,650
Never mind,
let's move on with the news

125
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,650
and, well,
my big news this week, certainly

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,650
is I spent last weekend
driving the new Porsche 980.

127
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,650
Oh, you did! It'll be on the show
later in the series. There it is.

128
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,650
Come on, quick, quick, now,
sneak preview. What is it like?

129
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,650
Well, Jennifer...

130
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,650
Funny(!)

131
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,650
Yeah, if you were watching last week,
Jeremy did say on the show,

132
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,650
on TV, that if the Porsche
was faster than the McLaren,

133
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,650
he would change his name to Jennifer.
Yes.

134
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,650
Didn't you, Jennifer? Well, it won't
be. See, I think it might just be.

135
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,650
Honestly, it... It's staggering
Really.

136
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,650
It doesn't accelerate
like most other cars.

137
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,650
You are not conscious of it

138
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,650
gaining speed through the gear
as the revs rise.

139
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,650
It doesn't go, "Ohhh-aaahhh!"

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,650
It just goes straight to, "Aaaaargh!"

141
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,650
But, Hammond... What?

142
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,650
..the McLaren has more power
than the Porsche

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,650
and is lighter than the Porsche
I know.

144
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,650
But listen, Jennifer,
the Porsche has four-wheel-drive

145
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,650
and four-wheel steer
and on our track...

146
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,650
It will lose.

147
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,650
Listen, I'm sure the Luftwaffe
were very proud

148
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,650
and pleased with
the Messerschmitt Me 109.

149
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,650
That was a damn good aeroplane.
Yes, but it wasn't...

150
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,650
It wasn't as good as the Spitfire!

151
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,650
No, you could do negative G
in the Messerschmitt 109.

152
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,650
May, you are as bad as he is!
That is going to be humiliated.

153
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,650
We are going to win. When I say we,
Britain is going to...

154
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,650
I'm all for patriotism,
that's great,

155
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,650
but you've just got to face facts.
The thing is astonishing.

156
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,650
It's about how it manages those three
engines... Shut up about it!

157
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,650
I'm with you about
the British thing,

158
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,650
but I sort of hope
the Porsche wins, JENNIFER.

159
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,650
The news has been
filled with a lot of scenes

160
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,650
of flood victims
all waving their arms around

161
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,650
and going, "Oh, no,
what are we going to do?"

162
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,650
End of the world really.

163
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,650
I mean, it certainly makes me
very sad because the answer,

164
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,650
as we all know, is simple.

165
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,650
You buy a Ford transit van,
cut a big hole in the floor,

166
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,650
take the back doors off, couple
of engines in it, fans, skirts,

167
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,650
put it in the water, it sinks.
That's true.

168
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,650
You get another transit van,
more powerful engines,

169
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,650
totally redesigned. Here we go.

170
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,650
And it works perfectly.
That IS the solution.

171
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,650
We predicted these floods six months
ago and came up with the solution.

172
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,650
But what is really annoying
is that everybody

173
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,650
is blaming the floods on David
Cameron, the Environment Agency

174
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,650
pretty much anything you can name...

175
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,650
Mm-mm, I know exactly
who is to blame

176
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,650
for this problem
everybody is having.

177
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,650
Miranda Hart.

178
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,650
You laugh, but here's the thing

179
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,650
We are sitting here
now on a Sunday evening.

180
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,650
Eight, nine million people
in Britain have chosen to watch

181
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,650
some 1950s midwifery
on the other side,

182
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,650
so they don't know
about the hover-van.

183
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,650
That is the problem.

184
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,650
They have chosen Miranda over us
and our show is

185
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,650
rammed full of helpful hints and
useful consumer advice. Every week!

186
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,650
Now, hey, listen, how long has
the Gallardo been in production

187
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,650
17,000 years? Just over? Just over.

188
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,650
I know there are cave drawings of
it in the Pyrenees. There are.

189
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,650
Well, Lamborghini has announced
they are stopping making it

190
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,650
and are going to replace it with
this. It's called the Huracan.

191
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,650
600 horsepower, 5.2 litre V10,
four-wheel-drive.

192
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,650
None of that is interesting

193
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,650
because if you're interested in
speed and power and handling,

194
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,650
you're going to buy a Ferrari 4 8
or a McLaren 12C, aren't you?

195
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,650
The only reason you want to buy a
Lamborghini is because it looks mad.

196
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,650
And that's very nice, but I don t
think it's bonkers enough.

197
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,650
I know what you mean.
It looks nice, but...

198
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,650
Yeah, it needs to be outrageous
It does.

199
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,650
Nobody should be allowed
to design a Lamborghini

200
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,650
unless they've just consumed
two bottles of absinthe.

201
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,650
Now you're ready!

202
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,650
The essence of it is,

203
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,650
it doesn't really matter
how a Lamborghini drives

204
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,650
because a Lamborghini
is for prowling around the city

205
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,650
Ferraris are for doing
a 2.35 around Silverstone.

206
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,650
Lamborghinis are for doing
Knightsbridge at 2.35am.

207
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,650
Yes, yes.

208
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,650
Now, there's a new type of gas
which is worrying the government.

209
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,650
Is it cyanide? No.
Is it carbon dioxide?

210
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,650
No, it used to be carbon dioxide.
Now the days where...

211
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,650
I can hardly bring myself
to say this.

212
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,650
They are very worried
about a terrifying new combination

213
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,650
of nitrogen and oxygen.
What, you mean air? Yes.

214
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,650
99% of the air that we breathe
is nitrogen and oxygen,

215
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,650
but the government has got
his knickers in a twist about it,

216
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,650
specifically about nitrogen dioxide
and I've done some checking.

217
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,650
Bear with me on this.

218
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,650
It mostly comes from
soil or stoves

219
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,650
or particularly from lorries
in stop-start city driving, OK?

220
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,650
So the government has decided to
address the problem

221
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,650
by limiting cars to 60mph on the M1
just outside Sheffield.

222
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,650
That's their solution.
But that's got nothing to do with it!

223
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,650
Isn't that like saying,
"I've got toothache,

224
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,650
"I think I'll go and have
a hair cut. That will sort it."

225
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,650
"Doctor, I've twisted my ankle.
"You must put on a bomber jacket "

226
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,650
The thing is, they actually say
"Well, it's as European law,

227
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,650
"so we have to lower
the speed limit."

228
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,650
Germans aren't, French aren't,
Italians aren't, only we are.

229
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,650
And I know exactly
what's happened here.

230
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,650
You've got some guy
in the government, you know...

231
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,650
You know the type. Oh, yes, right.

232
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,650
OK, now, he has the power
to lower the speed limit

233
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,650
and stop parents eating sandwiches
in cars if kids are present,

234
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,650
but what he needs to do is take
a leaf out of the Queen's book.

235
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,650
What, marry a Greek? No!

236
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,650
The Queen has
the constitutional power

237
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,650
to declare war on another country,

238
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,650
but she never does.

239
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,650
Even after a big party
where she's a bit...

240
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,650
and all her mates
are egging her on.

241
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,650
"Go on, Liz! Declare war on
someone!" Can she really do that?

242
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,650
Yes, she can do that, but she
doesn't. "Hello is that Mr Hollande?

243
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,650
"This is the Queen. WE ARE AT WAR!"
I'd do that every week!

244
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,650
She could do that. I'd be
constant... I'd do it every...

245
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,650
"Oh, God, what have I done?"

246
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,650
Yeah, I would love to be
a drunk Queen!

247
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,650
I didn't mean...

248
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,650
Shall we move it on? Yes. Yes.

249
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,650
Every week, we receive thousands
of letters from people that say

250
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,650
"Dear Top so-called Gear,
why do you never test the sort of

251
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,650
"affordable cars that normal
people are likely to buy and drive?"

252
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,650
Well, the truth is, we would love
to. But the producers won't let us.

253
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,650
It's frustrating,
because contrary to public opinion,

254
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,650
we really do like small,
sensible little cars.

255
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,650
I mean, he has a Fiat Panda.
I have a Fiat 500.

256
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,650
Yeah, and I have a very small
AMG Mercedes.

257
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,650
Very small indeed.

258
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,650
We like the way that small cars
are easy to park and cheap to run,

259
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,650
but, most of all,
we like the way that a lot of them

260
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,650
are very good fun to drive.

261
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,650
But the producers say they aren t,
they say they're boring.

262
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,650
And to prove their point,
they came up with a challenge.

263
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,650
Yes, they told us to choose three
one-litre, three-cylinder,

264
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,700
little city cars and report
with them to the Crimean peninsula.

265
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,650
So, here it is,
at the bottom end of Ukraine,

266
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
jutting out into the Black Sea.

267
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:26,650
The Crimean peninsula, 10,000 square
miles of history, beetroot

268
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
and girls who leave the West behind.

269
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,650
And this is where we were to meet,
the city of Yalta.

270
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,650
Outside the very building
where Churchill, Stalin

271
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,700
and Roosevelt met to carve up Europe
after Hitler's defeat.

272
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,650
Hammond was the first to arrive

273
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I have brought,
as you can see, a Fiesta.

274
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,650
Which is a very, very good
small car in any case,

275
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,650
but in this instance,
particularly good,

276
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,650
because this one is fitted with
an absolute jewel of an engine.

277
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,650
It's a tiny, one-litre,
three-cylinder EcoBoost,

278
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,650
and when I say tiny,
I mean REALLY tiny.

279
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,650
The block of that engine
would fit on an A4 piece of paper.

280
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
And it's magnificent.
Right, who's that?

281
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Oh, it's the orang-utan. Here we go.

282
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,650
Congratulations. What, why?

283
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,650
Because that is unquestionably
the best one-litre little car

284
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,650
of them all. No doubt about it.
The engine in this... Yeah.

285
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,650
It is phenomenal. 125 horsepower,
from one litre. I know!

286
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,650
And 65 miles to the gallon.
Honestly...

287
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,650
Why are you saying these things
and why, then, are you not in one?

288
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Why are you in that VW? It's the Up!

289
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,650
Well, I brought this because
I like it. Hang on, you've just..

290
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,650
No, I like it. This is brilliant.
But I like this.

291
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,650
Let me put it to you this way.

292
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,650
You can buy better dogs
than my West Highland terrier,

293
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,650
but I LIKE my West Highland terrier.

294
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,650
Yes, it bites the postman
and it lays dog eggs all over

295
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,650
the kitchen and it steals food
but it's brilliant! And it goes..

296
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,650
If this had ears,
it would go like that...

297
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,650
'Sadly, at this point,
my dog impersonation was

298
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,650
'interrupted by the arrival
of Captain Interesting.'

299
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,650
That's the most boring looking car
I've... What is it? I'm nodding off!

300
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,650
Good news! What? It's
a Dacia Sandero. Is it? Yes.

301
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,650
Anyway, we were just
saying before you got here,

302
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,650
this is just an epic little car

303
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,650
It's quite expensive, though,
isn't it? How much is it? 17,50.

304
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,650
?17,500? Yup.
And how much is yours? 7,500.

305
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,650
That's a big price gulf,
Hammond. It is...

306
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,650
I can afford to lose this
and just go and buy another one

307
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,650
and I'm still better off than you.
Look at it! It's... It looks great.

308
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,650
It's anti-fashion, it's a car for
people with more sense than money.

309
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,650
It works, it's cheap. Wow,
how have they done it so cheaply?)

310
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,650
You can't work it out, can you?
There is no obvious...
It's amazing(!)

311
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,650
That steering wheel,
what a quality item(!)

312
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,650
That's exactly the same as yours! It
isn't the same! It's the same SHAPE.

313
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,650
And correct me if I'm wrong,
it was a Renault Clio 30 years ago.

314
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,650
Not 30 years ago.

315
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,650
It's BASED on the underpinnings and
mechanicals of the old Renault Clio.

316
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,650
An old car. Basically, I've brought
an iPod to a gramophone convention.

317
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,650
Utter rubbish! Look at it!

318
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,650
'Our argument was then interrupted
by the arrival of a challenge.

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,650
They still don't believe that
we like small cars. But we do!

320
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,650
I love my Fiesta. Right.

321
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,650
"Between Yalta and Sevastopol,
there is an excellent coast road,

322
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,650
"which you would enjoy very much
in a normal car.

323
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,650
"But you will not be able
to enjoy it

324
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700
"in your miserable little
shopping carts"?!

325
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Hello!

326
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,650
You can't get away from the fact
the Fiesta, in any guise,

327
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,650
is a brilliant little car.

328
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
The chassis is so sorted out!

329
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,650
I've driven the ST version,
the hot one, and it is simply superb.

330
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,650
What's incredible is that they
haven't lost any of that liveliness,

331
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,700
that excitement, that thrill, by
fitting it with a tiny, tiny engine.

332
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
It's like driving a cartoon!

333
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Squealing!

334
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,650
Bit of turbo boost,
bit of traction control wise.

335
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
That means I'm having fun
and I'm on the ragged edge.

336
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Hee-hee!

337
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,650
Unlike the Ford and the Dacia,
the Up! doesn't have a turbocharger.

338
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,700
But even so, it still feels like
a determined spur.

339
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,650
I'm going to get there first!
Yes, I am, get out of my way!

340
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,650
Woo-ha-ha!

341
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
And stick it into the bend...

342
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,650
I mean, if I were in even a Ferrari
on this road, I'd be thinking

343
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,650
"Oh, no, I'm going
to scrape my nose!

344
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,650
"How much power do I need here
and how much braking?" And I don't

345
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,700
have to worry about any of that,
because the Up! has no power at all.

346
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,700
You just put your foot hard down
and leave it there!

347
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,650
Much to the annoyance
of the producers,

348
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,700
we have loved our drive
on the wiggly road.

349
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,700
But we loved what we found
at the other end of it even more.

350
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
A disused Soviet submarine base

351
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,650
Now, ordinarily, we would have
to park in the car park there.

352
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,700
But because our cars are so little,
we won't.

353
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,650
This is remarkable.

354
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,650
James Bond could not have
got in here!

355
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Because of course,
his Aston Martin is too large.

356
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Good God!

357
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Look at that!

358
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,650
In the event of a nuclear war,

359
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,700
they could get 14 submarines
in here, and 3,000 people.

360
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,650
It's under a mountain!

361
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,650
Yeah, it is your actual
under-a-mountain submarine base

362
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
It's full-on Bond.

363
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,650
How much energy and effort
was expended by MI6

364
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,650
and the CIA trying to find out
the details of this place?

365
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,700
And here I am, driving through it!

366
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Sadly, we spent so long
driving around the sub pen...

367
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,650
..that night was falling
by the time we reached

368
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
the busy city of Sevastopol.

369
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,700
And here, the Up!'s lack of oomph
was a bit of an issue.

370
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,650
Oh, I'm being squeezed!

371
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I've lost it.
Being strashed by a Lada 2107!

372
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,650
However, because the VW
is smaller than the Ford

373
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,700
and the Dacia, I didn't have to park
miles and miles from the hotel.

374
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,650
Is that legal? No.
Where does it say "no parking"?

375
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,650
But it doesn't say "no parking"
in a lot of places where it's

376
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,650
obviously not quite right to park.

377
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
To be fair,
it doesn't say "no murdering" either.

378
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,650
The next morning,
we continued our journey through

379
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,700
a region where the hills were once
soaked with British blood.

380
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,650
The Crimean War may have been
unfathomable,

381
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,650
nobody really knew why it started,
but the legacy is enormous.

382
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,650
It gave us important words
like balaclava and cardigan.

383
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,650
It gave us Florence Nightingale

384
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,650
the world's first war photographer,
the world's first war reporter.

385
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,650
The Victoria Cross was first awarded
to soldiers who fought here

386
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,650
And even today,
the medal is made from metal

387
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,700
taken from a Russian gun
that was captured here.

388
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Then, of course, there's
the best-known legacy of them all.

389
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,650
How's it go?

390
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,650
"Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,

391
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
"Theirs but to do and die."

392
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,650
"Into the valley of death rode
the 600." And that is the valley.

393
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,650
That is where the Charge of the
Light Brigade actually happened

394
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,650
It was a misunderstood order.

395
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,650
Yeah, they were supposed to go
up there somewhere.

396
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,650
They were supposed to
snout around in the hills,
looking for the Russians,

397
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,650
misunderstood it, came charging
over here armed with sabres,
against the entire Russian

398
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,650
artillery here, all of it was there,
pointing straight at them.

399
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,650
And they were on horses with sabres.

400
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
How could that possibly end?

401
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Oh, God!

402
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,650
Choose your moments!
Exactly. Exactly.

403
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,650
"Ukraine is the second largest
country in Europe, and now you will

404
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,650
"drive all the way across it,

405
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,650
"from here in the far south to
the Belarus border in the north

406
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,650
"It will be worse than those
long journeys you did

407
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,650
"as a kid in the back of
a family car to the seaside.

408
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,650
"It will be the journey from hell."

409
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,650
How can it be worse than those
journeys? I was a kid then!

410
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,650
I was in the back of
a Mark I Cortina.

411
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,650
I was in the back
of an Austin 1100.

412
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,650
Anglia, with a hole in the floor
How far is it? It doesn't...

413
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,650
How far is it? It's 750 miles.

414
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,650
750 miles? What, in a Volkswagen
Up!? That's easy. Piece of ca..

415
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,650
In these three cars - light cars -

416
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,650
we shall be the modern-day
Charge of the Light Brigade.

417
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Very good.

418
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Still feeling slightly baffled,
we set off.

419
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,650
Well, I think the producers have
gone a bit soft, to be honest.

420
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,650
It's just not in any way difficult,
challenging... It's just...

421
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
It's easy!

422
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
750 miles!

423
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,650
It turned out not to be easy at all.

424
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,650
Yes, in the second
part of that film,

425
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,650
which we'll show you later on,
I was actually killed.

426
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,650
Yeah, he really was.

427
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,650
So, that's something for us
all to look forward to.

428
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,650
Yes, thank you, Hammond.

429
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,650
But in the meantime, we must put
a Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

430
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,650
Now, my guest tonight is the only
British musician who can

431
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,650
drive a tank, fire a mortar
and strip an assault rifle.

432
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,650
Apart from Posh Spice, obviously.

433
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,650
Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!

434
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,650
How you doing, big man?
How are you? I'm well.

435
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,650
Hi there. How are you doing? Hi
Hello. He's here. Have a seat.

436
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,650
All right. Many whistlings!

437
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,650
First of all, congratulations
on your forthcoming marriage.

438
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,650
I'm getting married? BLEEP!

439
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,650
You're getting married to the girl
standing behind you. Fantastic

440
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,650
Just in case you'd forgotten.
No, there she is, look.

441
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,650
What's your name? Aah!

442
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,650
That's the ticket. OK, great.
So, when are you getting married?

443
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,650
September.

444
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,650
I'm just thinking, I know there s
lots of girls here and they'll

445
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,650
want me to ask lots of questions
about it, but I can't think of any.

446
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,650
Shall we talk about the Army?
Let's talk about the Army.

447
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,650
The Army's better. We've got
to do the Army, it's easier.

448
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,650
Now, we know you were in the Army,
of course, that is well documented.

449
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,650
But I think what a lot of people
don't know is that you actually

450
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,650
single-handedly,
when you were in Kosovo,

451
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,650
stopped World War III
from happening.

452
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,650
I'm glad you brought this up. Yeah.
Because it's time the nation knew.

453
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,650
Actually, it was genuinely
the most incredible day of my life.

454
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Other than my forthcoming marriage.

455
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,650
And, er... It was...

456
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,650
You know, having bombed the crap
out of the Serbs,

457
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,650
we signed a peace accord
and we pushed up to Pristina,

458
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,650
the capital, and I was remarkably
put as truly the first officer

459
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,650
to lead 30,000 people up there,

460
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,650
and when we got to the airport
in Pristina, General Wesley Clark

461
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,650
told us to just overrun

462
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,650
and overpower the 200 Russians
who had beaten us to the airport

463
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,650
The American general?

464
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,650
Yeah, and we asked several times -
that one thing means destroy them?

465
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,650
Which seemed a pretty stupid thing
to do. He said destroy...

466
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,650
He said overrun and overpower,
definitely using some political
manoeuvring in his wording.

467
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,650
And after, you know,
five minutes of arguing,

468
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,650
a very special man called
General Mike Jackson,

469
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,650
an incredible character
who I would follow anywhere,

470
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,650
came up on the radio and said,

471
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,650
"This is ridiculous,
I'm not having my soldiers being

472
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,650
"responsible for starting
World War III,

473
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,650
"let's push off somewhere else.

474
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,650
And when the Russians
had run out of food and water,

475
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,650
they came back and asked us for food
and water and we said,
"Sure, if you share the airport "

476
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,650
That was an order from an American
to a British captain to...

477
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,650
And he later then ran
for president in America. I know

478
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,650
Let's move on to music.
We've covered the army.

479
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,650
You saved the world from
World War III, which is good.

480
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,650
Your new album is called
Moon Landing.

481
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,650
Moon Landing, which I only
discovered after the event

482
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,650
that "moon landing" is actually
in the Urban Dictionary

483
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,650
as a term in the gym when two men
are changing and they bend over

484
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,650
and their bottoms touch accidentally.
So, yeah...

485
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,650
There's a single called
Heart To Heart, isn't there? Yes.

486
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,650
Now, forgive me for saying this
my daughter,

487
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,650
she said to me a couple of days ago,
"I was going to tweet James

488
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,650
"to say how much I love that song,"
but she said, "I was so worried

489
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,650
"that his tweet reply would rip me
apart that I haven't dared do it."

490
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,650
I wouldn't abuse her,
if she's nice.

491
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,650
What have you just won on Twitter?

492
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,650
It's something, the best
twitterer... Best Comebacks.

493
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,700
The Best Comebacks, from the chap
over there with windswept hair

494
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,650
I've actually got a few
of your ones here.

495
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,650
Don't they take a long time
to think of?

496
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,650
I would say I'm spontaneous with it,
but I might be lying.

497
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,650
Somebody said here, "Why have you
only got 200,000 followers?"

498
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,650
And you replied,
"Jesus only needed 12."

499
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,650
You've got to admit...
they are properly very funny.

500
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,650
"James Blunt has an annoying face
and a highly irritating voice.

501
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
You went, "Yes, and no mortgage "

502
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,650
Do you mind if I show them
my absolute favourite? Go for it.

503
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,650
The rather sarky,
"Whatever happened to James Blunt?"

504
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
And this was the picture you posted.

505
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,650
What I love about you is the way
that somebody is abusive to you

506
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,650
and you just take it on the chin and
are fine. I sob uncontrollably.

507
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,650
I mean, people take Twitter
far too seriously.

508
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,650
It's just,
there's a real world out there,

509
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,650
and people seem to think
that Twitter is important.

510
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,700
It's just people opinions,
and opinions are like arseholes

511
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,650
Everyone has one. Yeah. Cars.

512
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,650
When you were last here, I think

513
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,650
the only car you'd ever driven
at the time was a Lada.

514
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,650
Yeah, I was really embarrassed about
that, and I've tried to upgrade.

515
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,650
I had a Lada Riva 1.3SL, for "slow".

516
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,650
Because now, obviously,
things have moved on dramatically.

517
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,650
You've got a tuk-tuk.

518
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,650
I have a tuk-tuk from Bangkok,
which is awesome, three-wheeled

519
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,650
vehicle, does 70mph, and I drive it
around home in Ibiza.

520
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,650
It does 70?

521
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,650
70mph, and if you get all your mates
in the back,

522
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,650
you can wheelie as well, at 70mph.

523
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,650
Actually, my best friend is a
chap called Nin, he's Indian,

524
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,650
and he insists on driving to make it
look more authentic.

525
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,650
Yeah.

526
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,650
When you're in London, I gather
you've now got a bicycle. Yeah.

527
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,650
Why do you have a bicycle?
It's much, much faster
and it's good exercise.

528
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,650
You can lose a paunch with a bicycle.

529
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,650
I've got a bicycle, and look what
it's done to me. Literally.

530
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You're not supposed to eat it.

531
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,650
Yeah...

532
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,650
Now, you recently had an altercation
with a paparazzi photographer,

533
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,650
I believe, in the United States

534
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,650
Yeah, paps are quite aggressive
and yes,

535
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,650
I was coming out of a party
and I was with someone who

536
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,650
was in the public eye as well,
and they shout. Paps don't want

537
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,650
an ordinary picture,
they want an aggressive picture

538
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,650
and they're all banging
on the window,

539
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,650
and one of them fell in front of the
car, and what are you supposed to do?

540
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,650
He's fallen down and I wouldn't want
to incriminate myself by saying

541
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,650
that I hadn't spotted him and touched
the throttle and went gently over.

542
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,700
That would be the wrong thing to do.
But... But we did go over him

543
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,650
Did you actually feel the dum-dum?
Yes.

544
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Something strangely
satisfying about it.

545
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,650
And in the meantime, the police
and the ambulance did arrive,

546
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,650
but before they arrived, he got up
and took pictures of more people

547
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,650
They even had some film footage
from another paparazzi of him

548
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,650
rubbing his leg, saying,
"Make it redder, make it redder,

549
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,650
and when the police arrived, he said,
"Poor me, I've been run over.

550
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,650
But it was a very small hire car
and I think it was fine.

551
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,700
It wasn't a large American Cadillac?
No. Get one of those next time.

552
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,650
Anyway, the lap,
how was it out there today?

553
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,650
I think as I was driving down today,
they said today was the first

554
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,650
day of the year the Met Office has
issued a red weather warning -

555
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,650
do not leave home unless you
specifically have to,

556
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,650
and I've been doing laps.

557
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,650
The thing is, as you know,
everybody who comes down here

558
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,650
goes off at the second to last
corner, that's a given, really,

559
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,650
but I heard that James went off
on the Follow Through.

560
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,650
And I followed through
at the time as well!

561
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,650
That's why it's called
the Follow Through,

562
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,650
because that's a 100mph corner,

563
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,650
and you have that building in front
of you, and if things start to

564
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,650
go wrong through there,
it's actually a slightly
buttock-clenching...

565
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,650
Very much. And some of your camera
crew are lucky to be alive. Yeah

566
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,650
Would anybody like to see this
moment when one of our guests

567
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,650
actually went off on
the Follow Through? Yes.

568
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,650
Let's have a look at this.
Here we go.

569
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,650
That is absolutely soaking.

570
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,700
That's properly fast, and you keep
your foot in it until, look at this!

571
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,650
What I love about that is
you did not apply the brakes

572
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,650
until you were an inch
from the edge of the track.

573
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,650
Everyone says you're not allowed
to lift off and so I tried not to.

574
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,650
We're talking big cojones there

575
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,650
It's actually because I couldn't see
through the windscreen.

576
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,650
I didn't know I was coming off.

577
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,650
It started to get bumpy and green -
"This has definitely gone wrong."

578
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,650
Anyway, eventually,
we did get a lap together.
Yeah. Who'd like to see it?

579
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Yeah! Here we go.

580
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,650
See, I think this is
the Blitz spirit.

581
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Come on, then! BLEEP!

582
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,650
It's like a BLEEP lake out here

583
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,650
Yeah, nobody's complaining
about the Environment Agency,

584
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,700
you're going in there, "Why don t
you come and clear it up?"

585
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
That is so wet!

586
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,650
Stayed on the track nicely.

587
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
It's like ice skating.

588
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,650
Not that I ice skate very often

589
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,700
You really should have borrowed
Richard Hammond's booster cushion.

590
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,700
I needed Moses to part the sea.
There's a private jet over there

591
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,650
That could get me home!
Ibiza, right.

592
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,650
Hammerhead, probably couldn't even
see the lines,

593
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
so that's pretty impressive.

594
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,650
Here we go, right, coming up to
the Follow Through again. So slow.

595
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Up to 6,000. And again,
I can't see a BLEEP thing.

596
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,650
This is, I really admire you
for doing this.

597
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,650
A touch of the brakes, and I can't
say I blame you. Through the tyres.

598
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,650
No whingeing, no complaining.
And, yeah, going to make that one.

599
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,650
Not bad at all, actually.
And it's blowing a gale.

600
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Whoa! It's the Jimmy Carr line!
There we are. Across the line.

601
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,650
That is really, properly...
I've never seen it like that.

602
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,650
Yeah, it was fascinating,
because last time

603
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,650
I came down it was wet as well, and
basically, whenever you have me on,

604
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,700
unsurprisingly, it is the wettest,
James Blunt is the wettest lap.

605
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,650
We have had two previous wet laps
in the last couple of weeks.

606
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,650
Hugh Bonneville at 1.50.1,
Tom Hiddleston last week at 1.4.9,

607
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,650
so bearing in mind, he was very wet,
but nothing like...

608
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,650
Not nearly as wet as me. So come on,
where do you think you come?

609
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,650
I really hope I haven't
humiliated myself too much.

610
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,650
No, you haven't humiliated yourself,

611
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,650
because you went out there, which is
brave enough, and you drove around

612
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,650
in it, which is very marvellous
and you looked determined.

613
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,650
Like one of those schools
where everyone's a winner.

614
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,650
So there we are, fastest lap so far,
1.49.9. You did...

615
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,650
1...

616
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,650
49...

617
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,650
4.

618
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,650
I have to say... That is the fastest
wet lap. You are above Ron Howard.

619
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,700
And just under Joss Stone.
I'm always under some... Anyway

620
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Feel the eyes in the back of my head.
Yes. I can see them.

621
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,650
You're between
Joss Stone and Ron Howard.
That's a very odd place to be.

622
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,650
That was quite something.
It really was. Thank you.

623
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,650
Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!

624
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
Thank you.

625
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,650
Now, tonight we are trying to prove
that we really do like small cars,

626
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,650
and our producers are trying
to prove that they're rubbish.

627
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,650
Yes, so, they told us to drive
our three one-litre hatchbacks

628
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,650
all the way across Ukraine,

629
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,700
a trip they said would be
the journey from hell.

630
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,650
Why do they think this is going
to be the journey from hell?

631
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,650
Driving across the Ukraine.

632
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,650
We've only been here 24 hours,
we've been through the Cold War

633
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,650
the Second World War, the Crimean
War. It's going to be tremendous.

634
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
And I'm in my Up!

635
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,650
In the not too distant past,
little cars like ours

636
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,650
were very spartan, but these days,
if you choose your car wisely

637
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,700
you get loads of stuff to play with.

638
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,650
Right, Hammond, have you got your
air conditioning set just so?

639
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,650
I have, yes, I've set it
just half a degree lower

640
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,650
than would be too comfortable.

641
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,650
This heated seat, I think,
just to the first position.

642
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,650
USB.

643
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,650
'USB iPod.'

644
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,650
Bluetoothed my iPod
into the stereo system.

645
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,650
Heated windscreen, let me try that.

646
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
Cruise control. Haven't done that.

647
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
Yep, a mirror on that side.

648
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,650
Eventually, though, even Hammond and
I ran out of things to play with,

649
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,700
so we turned our attention
to the Ukrainian scenery.

650
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,700
A hill or two wouldn't go amiss

651
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,700
Right, I admit it, this is boring.

652
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Do you think
we're halfway there yet?

653
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,650
We needed to find out.

654
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,650
So, as we couldn't understand
the writing on our sat-nav systems,

655
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,650
we pulled over to consult a map

656
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,650
We came from down here, yes?

657
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,650
And we've got to go
all the way there.

658
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,650
We've just gone through a town
called Pravda.

659
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,650
We can't be further back than that.

660
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Maybe it's in...
Can't be there. We've done that

661
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:07,650
Oh, Christ, oh no! It's there. Don't
be daft! It is! We're only here!

662
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,700
We've only done that. We've only
driven over the Isle of Wight.

663
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,700
We've got to come here? How come..
We've only got there?!

664
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,650
And that's good news. Is it? How is
that good news? It's good news.

665
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,650
Really? Yes.

666
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,650
Instead of just sitting and,
"I'm bored,"

667
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,650
why don't we make ourselves more
rounded human beings on the journey?

668
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,650
So while we're in the car
we learn to do some thing?

669
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,650
Exactly! We could sit there going,
"I'm bored, I'm bored,
I wish I wasn't doing this,"

670
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,650
or we can simply say, "No, we shall
use this time constructively.

671
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,650
We will arrive in Belarus
more intelligent

672
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,700
and more rounded than we are now.

673
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,650
Back on the road,
the self-improvement began.

674
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,650
'Hello and welcome to
Teach Yourself Ukrainian. Unit one.

675
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,650
'Hello, what's your name?'

676
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,650
"You will learn to play blues
harp quickly

677
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,650
"and easily by just listening
to the CD." Ooh, I've got a CD!

678
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
"And following the book."

679
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,650
Viewers, you will notice
I'm wearing my magic hat

680
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
and that there is
a playing card in it.

681
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,650
'Karus again invites Stephen
to his home to discuss

682
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,650
'some business questions.'

683
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,650
So that goes in there.

684
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Well...

685
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,700
In the mobile language lab,
things were going well.

686
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Underwear.

687
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,650
And soon I felt confident enough
to get us

688
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
something to eat at a roadside cafe.

689
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,650
What are you saying? I'm trying to
find some food that isn't fish.

690
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,650
Oh, thank you.

691
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,700
You seem to have ordered some wood.

692
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,700
Jeremy then asked for some apples.

693
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Well, we've eaten. Shall we go?

694
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,650
The next morning, after breakfast
had been cleared away..

695
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,650
What?!

696
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,700
..I used my new Ukrainian skills
to check the sat-nav.

697
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,650
Oh, Jesus. To get to Kiev,
13 hours and 49 minutes.

698
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,650
We were in a state of despair, but
then, out of the fog loomed a man.

699
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,700
And behind him, this.

700
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,700
An abandoned nuclear missile base.

701
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,650
This is the silo, is it?
That's a silo. It's ever so big

702
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:28,650
Hammond, this is an SS18, nicknamed
the Satan, targeted Ross-on-Wye.

703
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,650
Was it? That's what that says.
Hang on a minute, though.

704
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,650
It says "alternative target
Chipsky Norton" there.

705
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,650
I think it must be damp!

706
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,650
Many people complain about having
to do a long drive, but on this one,

707
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,650
we really had hit on a brilliant way
of making the time fly by.

708
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,650
Ha ha! Viewers, my hands empty,

709
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,650
nothing at all in them.
Now, can I...

710
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,650
'Unit three. Stephen, do you have
a family?' There's Stephen again.

711
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,650
Everybody's called Stephen here,
that's the one thing I have learned.

712
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Oh, God. My doves have escaped.

713
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,650
My doves have got out. What doves?

714
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,650
What do you mean, got out?
My doves from my magic box.

715
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,650
They're all over the back.
They've crapped everywhere.

716
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,650
Upset by the mess,
OCD May ejected the culprit.

717
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,650
Oh, my God, there's a lorry...
That is an ex-dove.

718
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,650
Yeah, now, you see,
the truck that hit your dove, James,

719
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,650
how good are you at magic?
Seriously, did it not fly away?

720
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,650
You're not going to do
children's parties, are you,

721
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,650
because you're going to have
to change your act if you are.

722
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,650
"So, Sally, is this
the family parrot?

723
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,650
"Just watch what happens

724
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,700
"when I throw it out of
the window of a moving vehicle.

725
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,650
Putting this tragic
incident behind us

726
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:32,700
we ploughed on, and by nightfall had
reached Ukraine's capital, Kiev.

727
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,650
Jeremy checked us into the hotel

728
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,650
Yeah.

729
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,650
Did you just say yes
to stop him talking?

730
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,650
And in the bar, James did another
trick that went wrong.

731
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,650
Ta-da!

732
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,650
I'm afraid not. You can't change
your mind about the card you chose.

733
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,650
That was the card you chose.
You can't tell me what card I chose.

734
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,650
But I know you chose that
because I read your mind.

735
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,650
Magicians are supposed to exercise a
degree of finesse, not just bullying.

736
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
No, it's still not.
It is! That's what you chose!

737
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,650
The following morning,

738
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,700
we were warned there was a mob on
the streets of Kiev, and there was.

739
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,700
Thank you for coming,
thank you so much.

740
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,650
So, to get a bit of peace and quiet,

741
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,700
we were told to report to
the country's only racetrack...

742
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,650
..for what, chillingly,
was called the final challenge.

743
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,650
"Your cars will each be given
exactly 23 litres of fuel,

744
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,650
"which, because
they're so economical,

745
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,650
"should easily be enough for them to
cover the 100 or so miles

746
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,650
"to your destination, a town
near the border with Belarus."

747
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,650
Hang on, 23 litres? To do 100 miles?
That's not really a challenge, is it?

748
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,650
That's easy! "Your challenge is to
run out before you get there." Eh?

749
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,650
"This is something you
will want to do,

750
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,700
"as the town in question
is called...

751
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,700
"..Chernobyl."

752
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,700
Can we actually...
We can't go there, can we?

753
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,650
Chernobyl was the scene of
the world's worst nuclear accident.

754
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,650
When reactor number four
exploded in 1986,

755
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,650
it released a radioactive cloud
so devastating that the entire area

756
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,700
will remain uninhabitable
for 20,000 years.

757
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,650
And unless we could make our cars
do less than 20 miles to the gallon,

758
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,700
this is where we'd end up.

759
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,650
Ford claim mine does 65mpg.

760
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,650
All the way here, this has done 60
miles to the gallon, give or take.

761
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:00,650
Yes. How would you make these cars
do 20 miles to the gallon?

762
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,700
I can't imagine getting it under 30.

763
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,650
After the producers had put
precisely 23 litres of fuel

764
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,700
in each tank, we did some
preparations of our own.

765
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,700
Right.

766
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,650
Clever, this.

767
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,650
What I'm going to do is let
about 30% of the pressure
out of the tyres.

768
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,650
The point is,
it increases rolling resistance

769
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,700
which means I use more fuel.

770
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,650
That is one heavy Up!

771
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,650
What are you doing?

772
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,650
I'm sealing all the gaps so that
radioactive dust can't get in.

773
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,700
What you've done there, Hammond
is made it more aerodynamic.

774
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,700
I have, haven't I? You have. Goodbye.

775
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,650
To get through this much petrol
in less than 100 miles,

776
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,650
we would have to drive like maniacs.

777
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,700
Three, two, one.

778
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Come on! Build up the revs!

779
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,700
Second gear. Right to the limiter.
God, that's wasteful.

780
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,650
James and I decided to go for
a low-gear policy of maximum revs.

781
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,700
Hammond, on the other hand...

782
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,650
If I keep doing this all the way
there, I'll go further.

783
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,650
It will be twice the distance. This
is the answer. Lock to lock. Ooh!

784
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,650
That's where I'm going
to have to be careful,

785
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,700
when there's traffic
coming the other way.

786
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
I've just realised!

787
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,650
I'm driving without the lights on.

788
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,650
I'm driving with
the eco-engine system...

789
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,650
Heated rear window, I want that on.
Heated seats, yes.

790
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,700
That's better.

791
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,650
Probably people think
this is a bit odd,

792
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,700
but if they knew why I was doing it,
they would understand.

793
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,650
I can't believe
they're making us do this,

794
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,650
because it's not like the
radioactivity has gone. It hasn t.

795
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,650
It has a half-life, material that's
left, of 245,000 years.

796
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,650
And James May, obviously,
can explain what a half-life is

797
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,700
In fact, he probably is doing.

798
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,650
A half-life is actually constant.
A piece of uranium

799
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,650
will have a half-life
and when that half-life is passed,

800
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,650
the remaining bit
still has the same half-life.

801
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,650
I think the word was coined
by Marie Curie.

802
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,650
The early 20th century was the time

803
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,700
when radioactivity was identified
and discovered...

804
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,650
After 25 miles of red-line motoring,

805
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,700
the news from the Up!
still wasn't good.

806
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,700
I've managed to average
23 miles to the gallon.

807
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,700
I've got to get that down.
How do I get that down?

808
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,650
Right, the drag is now
dramatically worsened.

809
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Meanwhile...

810
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,700
I am feeling a bit sick now,
if I'm honest.

811
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,700
Oh, is that a police car? Oh, dear.

812
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,650
There's the horrible evidence.

813
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,650
At a quarter distance, 25.5 miles,

814
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,650
I should have lost one of those
four bars that I started with.

815
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,650
But it's not happening.

816
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,700
Come on, petrol! Sod off.

817
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,650
OK, we've been pulled by the police.

818
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,650
They were wondering
why I was zigzagging.

819
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,650
They're talking to
the camera car in front.

820
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,650
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here
at max RPM to try and use some fuel

821
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,700
while I'm stationary.

822
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,650
Whilst Hammond was deafening
the police,

823
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,700
I pulled over to disable
my engine management system.

824
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,650
How about that!

825
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,650
Engine warning light.
Yes. That's what we want.

826
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,650
What the engine has to do now
is assume a sort of
worst-case scenario,

827
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,650
because it doesn't know
anything about itself,

828
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,650
so it will assume it's very cold,
the fuel quality is bad,

829
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,700
so it must be less efficient.

830
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,650
30 miles from Chernobyl,
all our cars were still running

831
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,700
and we were trying every trick in
the book to make them conk out

832
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,700
Look at that for drag now!

833
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,650
Brake. Then accelerate.

834
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,700
Then brake. Accelerate.

835
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,700
Still got three bars! Come on!

836
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:30,700
There it is! 17.8mpg.
My fuel light has come on! Oh, yeah.

837
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,700
I'm doing 21 miles to the gallon.
I'm not doing well enough!

838
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,650
Everything's on empty.
The needle, on empty.

839
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,700
Come on, run out. Run out.

840
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,700
It's one degree out there.
Nipples are sticking out badly.

841
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,700
Ah! I believe this is
Richard Hammond.

842
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,700
This thing should not be moving

843
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:08,650
I'm going! I'm going! I am going!
Don't tell me you've run out. Yes!

844
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,700
Yes! Ha ha! Oh, bliss! It's gone

845
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,650
I don't believe you. It...

846
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,650
I don't believe you. Sit rep.

847
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,650
Richard Hammond is a BLEEP.

848
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,700
Go on. Go and meet your fate.

849
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:42,700
The un-turbo-charged Up! continued
onwards. And then...

850
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,700
Oh, wait a minute. What do we have
here? Some kind of checkpoint

851
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,650
The barrier marked the start of
the 30km exclusion zone,

852
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,650
and now I'd have to go through it.
So would James.

853
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,650
But who would film
what happened afterwards?

854
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,650
- The three main cameramen.
- Yeah.

855
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,650
- They're getting in a taxi
and going back to Kiev. 
- What(?)

856
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,450
The're not going in.
There they go.

857
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,500
So we're filming the most dangerous
thing we've ever done with 2, I don't
want to be rude but, camera assistants(?)

858
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,950
I actually want to thank you.
- Yeah!

859
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,750
Thank you very much, you're very brave
You are now promoted the "official camera man".

860
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,000
I know you wan't to get on in the world,
but this is... this is a bit much

861
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,300
Those of us who were going in
made their preparations.

862
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,000
Right, air on recirc.
Vents, shut.

863
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,600
Geiger counter,
... on.

864
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,600
That really is a geiger counter,
And it really is going tick-tick-tick.

865
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:06,100
The camera man is having to film us from the back
of the land rover as usual but with the door closed.
Normally the tailgate is propped open...

866
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:16,510
There's something like 17 tonnes
of radioactive waste

867
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,470
still in the exposed reactor core.

868
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:24,070
They're building an enormous
sort of arch, really, over

869
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,910
the entire site, which will seal it
off, but that is not finished yet.

870
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:35,020
With 8km to go,
I had started to beg.

871
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,850
Run out. Run out now.

872
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,220
But it didn't.

873
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,070
That needle is definitely moving.

874
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,350
Now it had become imperative
we didn't run out

875
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,620
until we were well past the reactor.

876
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,130
There it is.

877
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,160
That is the remains of reactor
number four.

878
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,160
This is unbelievable.

879
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,230
I wouldn't want to appear to be
gloating at a time like this,

880
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,160
but I do still have
two bars of fuel left.

881
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,860
I didn't.

882
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:37,350
Oh, my God! Don't stop now.

883
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,140
And as a result,
I was in serious trouble.

884
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,840
This is where the people who worked
at the nuclear facility all lived.

885
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,980
Totally abandoned now.
It has been for 28 years.

886
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,060
Look at it. Look at that there.

887
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,520
This has to be one of the world's
most astonishing spectacles.

888
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, my... I've seen this!

889
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,610
This is it.
This is the playground.

890
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,500
Whoa, big spike. It is definitely
now time to get out of here.

891
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,530
Come on, little Up!
Don't run out now.

892
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,620
Oh, that was... It coughed.

893
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:43,500
That was a cough.
It's gone. It's gone.

894
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,800
Why are they applauding that?
Why are you applauding?

895
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,110
So how did you get out?

896
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,040
I waited, thinking you would come
and rescue me, which you...

897
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,330
Well, I didn't, because...
No, you didn't.

898
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:12,290
We do leave a man in the field, or
in this case, the contaminated city.

899
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:17,320
- Yes, so I had to walk.
- Really(?) So, any effects?
- Yes.

900
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,340
I've had to present this entire
show with two penises.

901
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,080
But then, I have been doing that
for 11 years.

902
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,440
Funny.

903
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,170
Anyway, right, the cars,
the important bit.

904
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,680
Yes, and the Fiesta is brilliant.
Yes, I know it is. It saved my life.

905
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,450
Yes, it did.

906
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,460
Yes, bu... but we must remember, the
Dacia, Hammond, is £10,000 cheaper.

907
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,710
Yes, because it's rubbish.

908
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,390
No, but if you buy a small car,
you want it to be cheap.

909
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,300
No, you want it to be good.
Actually, you want it to be both.

910
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,420
Yes, but the Up! is neither.

911
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:55,530
Listen, May, you said the Up!
was brilliant and intelligent.

912
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,150
When did I say that?

913
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,780
You wrote it in a road test
in a magazine about 18 months ago.

914
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,870
I was rather hoping
you wouldn't have read that.

915
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,310
Yes, but I did read it.

916
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,450
So once again, it turns out
that on this show,

917
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,910
I am the voice of reason
and common sense. Really?

918
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,430
Yes, and the Up!
is the small car to buy.

919
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,350
Not that one, though, because
that's been irradiated.

920
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,920
Yes, actually, Hammond,
you are sitting on it,

921
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,560
which means you now have
a radioactive anus.

922
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,570
Ah!

923
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:29,570
And on that bum-shell, it's time to
end. Thank you so much for watching.

924
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,310
See you next week. Good night.
