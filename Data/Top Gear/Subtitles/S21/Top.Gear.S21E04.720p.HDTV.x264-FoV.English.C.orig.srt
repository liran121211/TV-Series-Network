1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,130
Tonight...

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,770
I sit on a rock...

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,530
James gets something in his eye...

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,570
Oh!

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,050
And Richard says, "Mummy!"

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,420
Oh, Mummy!

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,730
Thank you, hello!

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,210
Hello, good evening,
thank you so much.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,620
Thank you, now...

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,130
Now, tonight's show...

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,730
Tonight's show is interesting

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,330
because we have all
sort of reverted to type.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,410
Later on, Hammond is in the desert
driving like an idiot

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,250
in a large and flamboyant
off-roader.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,290
I'm in northern Italy driving
a rather elegant sports car

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,410
and James, well actually, we are
kicking off with James,

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,170
who really is in his comfort zone

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,090
because he is on
a Second World War air base

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,860
talking about a car from the 1950s.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,050
This is The Stig taking
a Caterham to the ragged edge

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,980
on our track back in 2008.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,010
That particular lap is
something of an Internet sensation.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,370
It's been viewed over 100 times

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,650
and one of the reasons
it's so popular is

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,050
because that is the Caterham R500,

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,460
the most powerful and extreme car
they have ever built.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,140
Or, rather, it was.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,980
Because its crown has just been
stolen by this.

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,970
The brand new Caterham 620R.

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,770
Where the old 500 had 263hp,

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,850
this has 310.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,530
And since it weighs just 545kg,

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,090
it has a better power to weight
ratio than a Bugatti Veyron.

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,530
But I have driven a Bugatti Veyron

35
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,050
and I have to say
it was very civilised.

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,250
Let's see how this compares.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,570
Oh!

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,410
Bloody Nora! Oh!

39
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,890
Argh!

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,860
Argh! Argh!

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,460
I can't see!

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,570
Oh! Ow!

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,300
Argh!

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,250
God above, that's not...

45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,850
That's not like acceleration,

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,690
that's like being in a football
and somebody kicks it.

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,460
Ugh!

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,010
'With a helmet and goggles
deputising for the windscreen,

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,060
'I tried once more to get to
grips with the 620R.'

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,010
Obviously, you can tell from the way
I'm screaming at you,

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,300
the racket in here is tremendous.

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,050
It's quite difficult to breathe.

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,740
'That's hardly surprising
since 0-60 takes just 2.8 seconds.

54
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,980
'And it's not like you can get your
breath back in the corners.'

55
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,020
Geez.

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,700
Right, this time, watch this.

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,650
Oh, not again. Sorry.

58
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,820
There'll be a lot of editing
to do on this piece.

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,890
'Stick at it for several months
and you can bring the 620R to heel.'

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Whey, hey-hey!

61
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,580
I've done a whole circuit!

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,090
'And when you get your eye in,
it's not a bad car.'

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,650
It's still a Caterham.

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,980
It's all very crisp. Very nice.

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,210
Fantastic sequential gearbox.

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,140
'It's just that it's too much
hard work.'

67
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,170
The trouble is this is power
piled on power.

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,370
It can barely contain itself.

69
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,450
It's like a teenager left alone
with the Internet.

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,290
The wheels and the suspension
can only just

71
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,690
keep up with what's going on.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,650
Whey-hey!

73
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,090
It's not supposed to be like this.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,940
It's just a little sports car!

75
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,060
'However, I think
I have an answer to the problem.'

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,250
You see, I think if you're going to
build a minimalist car,

77
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,130
you need to take a minimalist
approach to performance

78
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,090
and handling, as well.

79
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,650
It's no good just piling on more
and more power,

80
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,730
that's like trying to improve
a curry

81
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,010
by putting more and more
chillies in it.

82
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,410
What I'm trying to say is, well,

83
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,420
Caterham needs to find a better
Indian restaurant.

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,450
Fortunately it seems
they're ahead of me on this one.

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,090
Alongside their new, most
powerful car ever,

86
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,530
they've also come up with this,

87
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,770
their least powerful car ever.

88
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,770
It's called the 160

89
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,730
and it has just 80hp

90
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,940
from a tiny turbocharged
three-cylinder Suzuki engine.

91
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,010
So the engine is much smaller
but then so is the price.

92
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,370
The 620R is £50,000.

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,180
This is just £17,000.

94
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,210
Admittedly, 0-60 takes
a gentle seven seconds

95
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,700
and the top speed is only 100.

96
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,460
But that's not the point.

97
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,170
Top speed, 0-60,
they're just numbers.

98
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,260
They are meaningless in themselves.

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,130
What matters is whether or not
they add up into a sensation

100
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,060
and this delivers
a tremendous sensation.

101
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,890
The key to the 160's sense of fun
is a set of super skinny tyres.

102
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,330
They are only a tiny bit wider
than a space saver.

103
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,730
So you only have to twitch
your foot a little bit...

104
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,140
..and you can slide
around like Mika Hakkinen.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,340
Oh, lovely! Look at me.

106
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,340
Whoo!

107
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,330
When you have worn your tyres out,

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,090
they're only 40 quid each
to replace.

109
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,970
Even The Stig, who normally
turns his snout up at anything

110
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,420
with less than 500hp,
had an absolute ball.

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,810
It has a windscreen.

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,730
It'll do over 50 miles
to the gallon.

113
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,210
As far as I'm concerned,

114
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,010
it's the best car
Caterham has ever made.

115
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,820
In fact, there's only one thing
wrong with it.

116
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,250
The way it looks.

117
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,690
Next to the latest stripped out
sports cars like the Ariel Atom,

118
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,090
and the BAC Mono, it sits
a bit like a typewriter

119
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,650
in an Internet cafe.

120
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,380
I wonder if they could do
something about that?

121
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,700
As it happens, they're ahead of me
on that one, too.

122
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,410
This is the AeroSeven.

123
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,770
It's been developed with
the help of the Caterham F1 team.

124
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,450
The great thing is, it isn't some
static papier mache one-off

125
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,580
built for a motor show stand.

126
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,420
What do you think of this, then?

127
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,570
Positively down on gastrique
by Caterham standards.

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,530
The next thing you know,
they'll have a fax machine.

129
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,770
The AeroSeven isn't going
into production for a year or so.

130
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,500
Before it does, there's one major
thing they need to fix.

131
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,130
Ow!

132
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,530
Oh!

133
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,170
It hasn't got a windscreen!

134
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,940
Useless!

135
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,170
The best car they've ever made?

136
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,490
According to him, it is.
Well...

137
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,410
The best car they've ever made?

138
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,330
Slowest...

139
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,530
So, James, er...

140
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,770
So you don't like cars
without windscreens?

141
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,370
No, I hate cars without windscreens.
That is the most idiotic idea

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,050
in the whole history of motoring,
isn't it? What is the point?

143
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,770
What advantage is there of building
a car without a windscreen?

144
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,010
You might as well have a snorkel
mask with no glass in it and you get
hit in the eyeball by fish.

145
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,810
It's that idiotic.

146
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,730
James, before you have an aneurysm,
there are one or two points

147
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,050
that Hammond and I
would like to make

148
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,970
about some of the things
you said in that film.

149
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,370
Hammond, do you want to go first?

150
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,690
Yeah, four minutes and 58 seconds
into your film,

151
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,970
whilst referring
to acceleration figures,

152
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,570
you say, "they are just
numbers, they're meaningless."

153
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,850
They are. You would say that!

154
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,210
James, but a car that accelerates
from 0-60 in 2.8 seconds

155
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,650
is better than one that does
it in seven seconds.
No, what I was actually saying...

156
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,970
Also, at three minutes 51,

157
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,930
you say and I'm paraphrasing here,
that giving it more power

158
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,130
is like trying to improve a curry by
adding more chillies. Mmm.

159
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,930
That is how you improve a curry!
No, it isn't. It is.

160
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,130
Remember the chicken
curry from school,

161
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,370
it was screaming for more spice,
it's what it needed is more.

162
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,450
Yes, then James at five minutes
and 29 seconds,

163
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,290
you said you were sliding around
like Mika Hakkinen.

164
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,010
I was. Yes, but you see Mika
Hakkinen is a Formula 1 driver

165
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,890
and they don't slide around.

166
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,530
Yeah, but when Mika Hakkinen
took me out for a drive,
he did slide around!

167
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,370
Yes, but he's not known for
sliding around. No, exactly.

168
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,090
He might collect porcelain frogs
but you don't go around saying,

169
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,850
"I'm collecting porcelain
frogs like Mika Hakkinen right now."

170
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,570
It's not relevant. Exactly!

171
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,410
Have you quite finished?
Well, not really

172
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,290
because there's a
lot to go through but,

173
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,970
sadly, we must now find out how fast
these cars go round our track

174
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,090
and that, of course,
means handing them

175
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,850
over to a man who can
actually drive!

176
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,370
Some say that he once put Helen
Mirren in a dishwasher.

177
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,530
And that at the Winter Olympics
he was disqualified

178
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,930
from the skeleton event for riding
down the hill on an actual skeleton.

179
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,850
All we know is he's called
The Stig!

180
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,690
And they are off.

181
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,290
Oo, it's a bit damp out there,
that may slow them down a bit.

182
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,370
620R building up a command...

183
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,010
Oh, no, there was
the other one coming into shot...

184
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,850
at the last moment.

185
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,930
First corner in, the 620R,
he's handling that well.

186
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,130
No, still...

187
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,450
Yes, we just saw the other one.

188
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,930
And here he is, no music,
obviously, to listen to today.

189
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,970
Just the sound of that

190
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,050
two-litre Ford Duratec engine,

191
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,780
supercharged in the 620R.

192
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,370
They don't use the 2.3 that they use
and the BAC Mono.

193
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,170
Here he is at the back!

194
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,770
Cos it's too tall.

195
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,850
He is actually struggling to
get the power down.

196
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,250
But he is getting it down.

197
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,820
Beautifully.

198
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Right, Follow Through next.

199
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,730
Here he is, definitely lifting off.

200
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,130
This is a magnificent example
of car control

201
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,850
from The Stig,
in one of them at least!

202
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,930
The other one simply not there.

203
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,570
Right, just...

204
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,090
Oh, good God, look at that.

205
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,450
Nearly losing it at the exit
of the Follow Through.

206
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,370
Handling it nicely coming
through into Gambon.

207
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,850
Getting some opposite lock on
before the corner

208
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,620
and across the line!

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,460
We just have to wait now for James's
favourite car to finish.

210
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,650
"The best car Caterham have ever
made"... there it goes.

211
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,100
Any minute now,
it'll be across the line.

212
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620
OK, talk among yourselves.

213
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,090
And there it is!

214
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,850
Wet lap,
so we're not expecting any records,

215
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,970
we certainly haven't got them.

216
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,650
Right the 620R, the car you didn't
much like.

217
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,330
That did it in 1:22.3.

218
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,530
Similar conditions, similar time
to the magnificent Lexus LFA. OK?

219
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,090
Now your favourite car...

220
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,770
Not quite so fast.

221
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,730
There's no other way of saying this,

222
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,090
it was a 1:45.5, so it's there.

223
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,970
It's actually five seconds slower
than Morgan's wooden tricycle.

224
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,210
Good. And that's your
favourite car?

225
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,690
Of those two, yeah.

226
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,890
And now the news

227
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,130
and the news is that later on
in this programme

228
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,850
Jeremy is going to try and prove
to James and me

229
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,850
that cars are better than bikes.

230
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,170
Well, that's because they are.
Well, they're not.

231
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,210
Oh, yes they are.
They're warmer than bikes,

232
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,290
they stand up by themselves.

233
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,250
You don't have to wear
rubber trousers.

234
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,850
They're faster.

235
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,410
Not faster!
They are round corners.

236
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,330
Well, not in a straight line.

237
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,970
Yes, you see, that's what
I'm going to prove later on

238
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,770
that they are faster
in a straight line.

239
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,530
Really? Yes, I am. Really?

240
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,210
Yes, I am, but now we're going to do
the proper news, OK?

241
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,330
Now you know all around the world
there are museums for all

242
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,850
sorts of silly things. There's
a pencil museum in, is it Cumbria?

243
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,570
Yeah, it is. Yeah, a pencil museum.

244
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,930
There's an umbrella museum in Spain

245
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,930
and a museum of the vagina in Japan.

246
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,570
There is a penis museum in Iceland.
Been there.

247
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,810
It's very cold,
all the exhibits are very small.

248
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,010
The reason I bring this up
is because,

249
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,330
in America
there is a Corvette Museum.

250
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,090
There's a photograph of it here.

251
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,970
Now, as we know, the Corvette
enthusiast in America is quite...

252
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,290
Heavy. Yes, they're bigger gentleman.
Big-boned.

253
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,250
Well, one of them visited the museum
this week and this happened.

254
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,650
Must have been a big one!
That was a big hole.

255
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,930
And apparently,
eight cars fell into it.

256
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,450
There's a shot actually
looking down. Look at that.

257
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,850
Oh, God, that's painful to see!

258
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,700
Damage was estimated at 37. Was it?

259
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,690
Was it?
But actually, we shouldn't mock

260
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,410
because you know there was
a sinkhole, which is what this is,

261
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,730
that opened on the M2 this week, did
you see? On the central reservation?

262
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,810
They closed the motorway
for 18 hours.

263
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,410
That, they kept the museum open.
They did!

264
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,940
Well, you can still see the cars.
Yeah, you just...

265
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,090
I think we should applaud
the Americans for that

266
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,610
because that's a good attitude
to health and safety.

267
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,130
It is. Well done, you.

268
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,970
Oh, now, I tell you what,
I've just remembered something else.

269
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,610
Recently, we were talking about, um,

270
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,850
those motorway gantry signs that
flash up idiotic nannying messages.

271
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,650
There was a sign photographed
in America this week, OK,

272
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,930
I think it was in Texas.

273
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,650
There was a light snow flurry
and some wag,

274
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,490
and this is brilliant, posted this.

275
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,930
"Oh my God! Is that snow?
We're all gonna die!"

276
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,290
That's more like it!
It's just fabulous.

277
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,410
But actually, that is what we should
do. Because that is the British way.

278
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,010
Self-deprecating, make fun
of the situation, have a laugh.

279
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,170
Make fun of the rules
and regulations.

280
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,210
I don't know who did this,
but if you're watching

281
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,450
and you ever come to England,
I would like to buy you a beer.

282
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,290
I'll put a strawberry on it for you.

283
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,290
Yes. Now, I've received a letter.
May I just read it to you?

284
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,650
"Dear Mr Clarkson..."
You're going to love this.

285
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,610
"I'm writing to you on behalf of the
world-famous Madame Tussauds."

286
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,970
Oh, they're not going to...
Yes, they are! Oh, you're joking!

287
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,530
Oh, no!

288
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,170
They say I have been highly
requested, highly requested,

289
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,140
to be immortalised in wax.

290
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,300
You sure that doesn't say
immersed in wax?

291
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,530
No, immortalised in wax.

292
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,530
How are they going to
immortalise you in wax?

293
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,210
Where are they going to get
all the wax?

294
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,690
Presumably they'll have to
melt down everything else

295
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,370
in Madame Tussauds, to make one
massive hideous wax dummy...

296
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,610
of a hideous dummy.

297
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,290
It's easy, they just get
a very big candle, they light it,

298
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,370
let it drip down the edges
for a couple of hours,

299
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,410
then just draw a face on it
with felt tip.

300
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,930
That would look a bit like him.

301
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,130
What are they going to do with it
when they've got it?

302
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,210
Imagine children, "We're going to
Madame Tussauds! What is that?"

303
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,050
It's going to be the first waxwork
in history

304
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,610
to be sculpted with a pickaxe.
Yes! And a hammer.

305
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,690
I want to see them sculpting it,
cos imagine,

306
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,450
once they've melted down enough wax,
which is a lot,

307
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,370
the size of the urn, it'll look like
a scene from Lord Of The Rings!

308
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,690
With all these little orcs
walking around the bottom,

309
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,410
getting ready... a big pour,
to create this hideous, hideous,

310
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,690
grotesque, enormous thing!
How are they going to fit it in?

311
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,370
No, don't put it there,
put it in the Natural History Museum.

312
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,770
Better still...

313
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,900
Next to the big brontosaur!

314
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,690
Just a big skeleton.

315
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,130
Just a big skeleton
next to the brontosaur,

316
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,890
a big tyrannosaurus-
what-the-hell-is-that?

317
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,570
And then people can go and watch.

318
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,660
Ladies and gentlemen, the sound
of bitterness and jealousy.

319
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,810
My colleagues, there.
I wish I hadn't brought that up.

320
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,610
As you probably noticed last week,

321
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,490
a Danish supercar called the Zenvo
came down here and caught fire.

322
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,170
A lot of people were very shocked
by that but actually,

323
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,930
it's not unusual for expensive cars
to catch fire

324
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,330
when they're first released.

325
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,290
Ferrari had a problem with the 458.

326
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,810
And then just this week,

327
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,970
we've been hearing about
Porsche GT3 problems.

328
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,050
There's a shot here of one in...
of one in Switzerland.

329
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,490
The internet is awash with rumours
of other examples of this.

330
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,570
Porsche themselves admit
it has happened in Italy as well.

331
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,250
And have now suspended deliveries
of the new GT3 to customers.

332
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,890
Yeah, but what if you'd already
taken delivery of your brand-new...

333
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,050
your brand-new and expensive GT3
that might catch fire at any moment?

334
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,050
Well, we really need to ask
a customer,

335
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,530
don't we, who's just done that?

336
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,490
Hammond! What? You've just had
a GT3 delivered, haven't you?

337
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,530
Yes!

338
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,650
Shut up!
Shut up, stop talking about it.

339
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,690
Thank you, move on. It must be
so depressing. Oh, God. Yes, it is.

340
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,290
To have worked so hard
to buy your dream car

341
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,300
that is then immediately valueless.
Oh, God!

342
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,490
So to try and cheer you up, Hammond,
I've bought you a small present.

343
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,330
Oh, have you? Thank you,
I love your gifts.

344
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,570
We don't often buy each other
presents on this show

345
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,130
but I've done just that today.

346
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,090
Mono... They're actually GT3
branded driving gloves.

347
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,500
Oven gloves.

348
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,300
Thank you.

349
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,010
Funny. Ha-ha-ha-ha(!)

350
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,450
And...

351
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,370
Doesn't just stop there.
Oh, please let it stop.

352
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,250
I think we need to coat your car

353
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,410
in the most fire retardant material
known to man. Pizzas.

354
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,290
Oh, not your pizza theory!
It's one of his stupid theories.

355
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,890
Come on, Hammond, come with me.
Really?

356
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,850
Now, this is your actual GT3.

357
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,130
Yes, it is, actually, yes.

358
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,330
We know this because there's
a fireman standing next to it

359
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,770
with an extinguisher
in case it suddenly combusts. Good!

360
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,010
Now, what I'm planning on doing, OK,

361
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,530
is I'm going to take these pizzas,
pop them on the car.

362
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,530
And then apply a blowtorch.
No! No, you're not, no, you're not!

363
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,810
I've seen you do this and
you're not doing it to my car. No.

364
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,370
But the ladies and gentlemen
want to see if pizza is...

365
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,220
I don't care! Not to my car! No.
Can we attach them to you?

366
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,770
Well, if you must, yes.
Right, well, first of all,

367
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,130
we need to establish...
James, can I borrow you? Yes.

368
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,290
First of all we need to establish
that these are pizzas, OK?

369
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,730
Have a look.

370
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,090
You will see
there's no asbestos in there,

371
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,850
they're real pizzas. Yes? Yeah.

372
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,370
James, perhaps
you'd like to just take a bite?

373
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,090
Yes, let me just pull a piece off.
Is that a pizza?

374
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,570
Tastes like the cardboard box
it came in, so it must be.

375
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,450
There you go.
So those are the pizzas.

376
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,450
If you'd like to attach those to
Hammond, that would be tremendous.

377
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,890
To his face? Um...

378
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,330
His vegetables. OK. Oh, really?

379
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,610
Come on!

380
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,050
Oh, not... That's ambitious, mate.

381
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
That's by my knees!

382
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,330
Now, I'm going to fire up
the blowtorch. There we go.

383
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,810
Oh, God, come on, no!
This is ridiculous!

384
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,690
James, how hot
is the tip of this flame?

385
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,250
Probably the best part of 800
degrees C. Enough to melt aluminium.

386
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,170
Enough to melt aluminium.
This is a real blowtorch.

387
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,850
Look, I can demonstrate it.

388
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,050
Fire on there, you can actually

389
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,610
see it burning the table nicely. Oh!

390
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,570
This is a real, well, two layers of
pizza, and a real Richard Hammond.

391
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,890
Everybody ready?

392
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,890
Yes!

393
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,370
Wouldn't do it to him.

394
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,930
Oh, yes, I would!

395
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,810
Oh, no!

396
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,130
Jeremy, that's quite a long time,
isn't it? Not really.

397
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,650
Stop it!
I can smell burning sausage.

398
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,220
Is that alarming?

399
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,090
Can you see? Pizza.

400
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,130
Pop it on your car. No!

401
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,530
Ladies and gentlemen,
Hammond is still here.

402
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,540
Stupid, stupid.

403
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,130
That is...

404
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,170
I think that is a Top Gear hot tip.

405
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,170
We're going to move on.

406
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,250
Because, you see, in the olden days,
when James was 43,

407
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,650
car makers would sell you
a complete car like they do now.

408
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,330
Or they would sell you
something like this -

409
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,490
an engine, a chassis,
and some suspension.

410
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,810
And then you would take this
to a coach building company

411
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,410
who would then fit a personalised
body, personalised interior,

412
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,410
you could have anything you wanted.

413
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,210
And in the '30s,

414
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,300
this meant there were some truly
amazing creations.

415
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,890
Back then, there were coach building
companies all over the world,

416
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,690
helping the wealthy
to fulfil their wildest dreams.

417
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,090
Anything was possible,
and everything was done.

418
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,290
Coach building meant that
Clark Gable didn't have to have

419
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,010
a car that looked like this.

420
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,340
It meant he could have one
that looked like this.

421
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,090
Today, though,
cars are built differently.

422
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,650
You don't get a chassis
with a body on the top.

423
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,930
Because the body sort of is
the chassis.

424
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,130
The pillars, the roof,
the doorframes,

425
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,250
they're all load-bearing,
so changing anything is a nightmare.

426
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,370
And this has meant that
for many years,

427
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,770
coach building has been a lost art.

428
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,890
Now, though, I'm delighted to say...

429
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,460
it's back.

430
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,180
Welcome, everyone,
to the Alfa Romeo Disco Volante.

431
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,930
One of the most striking,
intelligent,

432
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,780
and unusual cars I've seen
in a very long time.

433
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,370
It started out in life
as an Alfa Romeo 8C.

434
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,530
But was totally re-bodied
and re-upholstered

435
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,060
by an old coach building company
in Milan called Touring.

436
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,700
In the '50s, they styled and built
sports cars for Alfa Romeo.

437
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,980
Later, they designed the
Aston Martin DB5 and DB6.

438
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,250
Along with the Jensen Interceptor,

439
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,290
and the very first Lamborghini -

440
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,180
the 350GT.

441
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,020
That is quite a CV.

442
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,370
In recent years, however,
they've been reduced to making

443
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,810
mildly modified Bentleys
and Maseratis.

444
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,970
It's been like watching
Dame Judi Dench

445
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,220
reduced to appearing in
a regional pantomime.

446
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,130
But now, they've decided to bring

447
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,330
the lost art of proper
coach building back,

448
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,100
with the Disco Volante.

449
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,410
Certain structural and safety
related things can't be changed.

450
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,850
The seatbelt mounting points,
the windscreen,

451
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,690
the suspension mounting points,

452
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,410
they'll be the same on this car
as they are on this one.

453
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,930
It's like plastic surgery.

454
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,170
You can't change the skeleton,
but you can change the flesh.

455
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,010
And that is what they've done.

456
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,380
But has it worked?

457
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,410
The simple answer is, yes.

458
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,580
It doesn't shake, it doesn't rattle.

459
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,370
It doesn't feel like botched
plastic surgery.

460
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,730
You don't think every time
you go over a bump,

461
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,570
"Oh no,
my nose is going to fall off."

462
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,900
Doesn't feel like Michael Jackson.

463
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,250
Do you know what it does feel?
It feels...

464
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,730
solid.

465
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,690
It feels, and this is high praise
for a hand-built car, it feels...

466
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,980
mass-produced.

467
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,970
That said, it does not feel like
the car that spawned it.

468
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,700
It doesn't feel like an 8C.

469
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,890
That's because they've
softened the suspension,

470
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,330
they've turned it from
a stiff, B-road barnstormer

471
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,140
into a comfortable cruising machine,
and I like that.

472
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,810
There are loads of cars
built specifically to attack

473
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,450
a road like this.

474
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,690
So it's quite refreshing to find one

475
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,100
that allows you to savour it.

476
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,900
Savour the views, savour the moment.

477
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,660
So, it doesn't feel like an 8C.

478
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,540
And it certainly doesn't
sound like one either.

479
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,700
Oh, it's the most...

480
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,300
..soulful-sounding car
I think I've ever heard.

481
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,490
It's as though
the entire exhaust system

482
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,820
is actually made out of
Otis Redding.

483
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,330
♪ Left my home in Georgia... ♪

484
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,890
♪ Heading for the Frisco Bay... ♪

485
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,260
It's Otis!

486
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,330
Don't get me wrong, though.

487
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,620
This is not a slow car.

488
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,620
It has a 444 horsepower
4.7 litre Maserati V8.

489
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,690
Couple that to a super-light
carbon fibre and aluminium body,

490
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,050
and you end up with a car
that accelerates

491
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,780
like it's fallen off a cliff.

492
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,140
The top speed is 181.

493
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,850
Thing is, though, driving a car
this exquisite, this elegant,

494
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,170
quickly, feels wrong.

495
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,170
It would be like pogo dancing to
I Heard It Through The Grapevine.

496
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,060
No, no, no, you can't do that!

497
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,340
This, this kind of speed, this is
where it's at its best. Half speed.

498
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,090
I don't even feel inclined
to drive it fast.

499
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,540
I don't want to hang the tail out
on the hairpins.

500
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,530
Just want to put it in auto, put
some tunes on the stereo, like so.

501
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,570
Pop on a pair of sunglasses...

502
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,780
and slow on down.

503
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,930
And pretty soon, you'll want to
stop altogether and get out.

504
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,450
Because looking at this car,

505
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,900
that's really what it's all about.

506
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,010
It's interesting how many elements
from other things are in that shape.

507
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,770
I can see a little bit of Corvette,
a bit of E-Type...

508
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,650
Then there's the, um...I think
it was called the Discovery,

509
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,810
the spaceship in 2001:
A Space Odyssey.

510
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,290
I see that at the front.

511
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,250
And I love the way
they paint it gold

512
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,500
before they paint it red
to make the colour richer.

513
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,770
Then there's the name -
"Disco Volante" -

514
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,090
picked out in the seats.

515
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,450
I know, in Italian, Disco Volante
means "flying saucer"

516
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,650
but to me, it's the name
of Largo's hydrofoil

517
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,380
in the Bond film Thunderball.

518
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,020
I love that car.

519
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,260
I really do.

520
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,810
I think it really is time now

521
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,100
to bring out my special,
"in love" face.

522
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,970
I was jealous of Hammond when
he came out to Italy the other day

523
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,770
to drive the new Alfa 4C,
because, to me,

524
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,250
that thing is special.

525
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,820
It's...it's the Angel Gabriel.

526
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,370
But I'm not jealous any more,
because this...

527
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,300
This is the full baby Jesus.

528
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,530
I'm not going to say
it's the best car in the world -

529
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,490
it certainly isn't
the nicest to drive,

530
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,890
the brakes are spongy,
you can see nothing out of the back.

531
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,210
But as a tool
for making feel special,

532
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,610
really, nothing gets close.

533
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,940
Nothing at all.

534
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,890
A Maserati heart,
an Alfa Romeo badge,

535
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,260
exhausts made out of Otis Redding...

536
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,740
..and a hand-crafted body
to die for.

537
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,050
That is one hell of a combination.

538
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,700
It really is.

539
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,530
No, no, no, no, no. No, don't...

540
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,970
Sorry.

541
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,410
What? Hang on.

542
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,930
You were having a go
at me earlier on

543
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,650
because I preferred
the slow Caterham to the fast one.

544
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,810
Mm-hm. And here you are,
raving about a car

545
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,530
that's happiest at half-speed?
Well, yes.

546
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,730
You're an utter hypocrite.

547
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,450
No, no - you see, the thing is,

548
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,690
I'd prefer to drive to somebody's
house in a Lexus LFA,

549
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,650
cos I like the power
from that screaming V10 engine.

550
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,730
But I'd prefer to arrive in this,

551
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,410
because it's elegant,
it's beautiful, it's handcrafted...

552
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,530
How much is it?

553
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,450
Uh... well, do you know,
they won't tell me,

554
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,690
even when I lightly tortured them.

555
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,090
But I have heard
there's a man in Singapore

556
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,890
paid £1.5 million for his.

557
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,010
Now, there are a lot of import taxes
in Singapore - I mean, huge ones.

558
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,610
Even so, that's about 130...

559
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,610
That's still £600,000 for the car.

560
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,570
Yes, I know. And what's amazing
is that, in Singapore,

561
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,650
you're not allowed to drive
a left-hand drive car on the road.

562
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,450
So he's paid £1.5 million
for a car he can't drive.

563
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,650
He's completely mad.

564
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,450
He isn't - somebody's just paid,
what, £42 million

565
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,170
for a Francis Bacon painting.

566
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,700
You can't drive that, either.

567
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,050
It's not a car.

568
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,930
James, I haven't got time
for your pedantry.

569
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,530
Because we have to now put a Star
in our Reasonably Priced Car.

570
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,450
Now, my guest tonight
is extremely funny,

571
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,170
but he can't drive.

572
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,770
So he is the exact opposite
of Nigel Mansell.

573
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,410
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Whitehall.

574
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,180
How are you? Good, how are you?
Look who's here! Hello.

575
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,940
Hey. Have a seat.

576
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,620
Oh... Ooh...

577
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,450
Do you know, I haven't seen you
since you were in short trousers.

578
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,690
Yes, well, I mean, you know...

579
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,370
You were a big part of my childhood.

580
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,090
And that's not something that
probably everyone in here knows.

581
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,410
Jeremy was a father
at the prep school that I went to

582
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,650
and I have a lot of very vivid...

583
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,170
This is a big moment for me,
being here, with you, cos...

584
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,090
With long trousers.
With long trousers on -

585
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,690
tight, long trousers.

586
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,650
But you were, like,
the first kind of... real, kind of,

587
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,370
silverback, swinging-dicked
alpha male I'd ever set eyes on.

588
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,810
Every other father at the school
that I went to

589
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,650
was, like, a blubbering-faced
posh toff with a Barbour jacket.

590
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,010
Then you came striding across
the sports field,

591
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,610
a vision in denim, like...

592
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,210
It was amazing - we were all like,
"Oh, God, look at him!

593
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,850
"He probably eats his steak rare

594
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,010
"and doesn't bother getting out of
the bath to take a BLEEP."

595
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,050
And here you are.

596
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,010
It was always those book signings -
that's...

597
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,690
You had to go,
all the parents had to go,

598
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,810
if they'd written a book -

599
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,130
and almost everyone at this school
had... Yeah.

600
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,250
You'd be in this room
and there'd be Jeremy Paxman

601
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,890
with a big stack of books
he was trying to sell.

602
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,690
It was you and Paxman...

603
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,730
I remember it like it was yesterday.

604
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,570
There was one room,
it was a science lab,

605
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,340
you were at one end,
Paxman was at the other.

606
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,830
And it was basically a who's got
the biggest dick competition.

607
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,410
He'd have some really acerbic,
intelligent book

608
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,050
he'd written about the Reformation,

609
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,410
then you'd have,
you know... "Full Throttle",

610
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,370
or whatever it was.
It was. It was.

611
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,250
He'd got a queue of people
going, you know,

612
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,050
"Your observations on the
Plantagenets are most interesting."

613
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,820
And I got, "Do you think the Subaru
is better than the Evo?"

614
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,690
Now... we get many guests down here
who say, "Ooh, no, I can't drive."

615
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,410
And they mean,
"I've never done any track driving

616
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,890
"and I'm not very confident
and I'm not very good."

617
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,730
When we say you can't drive,
we mean... you CAN'T drive.

618
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,650
No. No, I can't drive at all.

619
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,370
I... I mean, I've been in a car
once, behind the wheel.

620
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
I've done passenger stuff
loads of times, I'm amazing.

621
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,730
But the driving aspect,
I've done, like, half a lesson?

622
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,490
My dad gave me half a lesson

623
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,810
and it became clear that
it wasn't really a lesson -

624
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,250
he wanted a lift to the butchers.

625
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,650
So we drove down the road
to the left,

626
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,810
he picked up a leg of lamb
and we went home.

627
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,130
So that's the only lesson
I ever had.

628
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,770
But I've never been behind the wheel
of a car on my own ever before.

629
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,290
So I thought it would be good
to come and do it... Here?

630
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,490
Which, of course,

631
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,490
meant that we actually had
to teach you to drive a car.

632
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,330
Yeah. When I say, "we"...The Stig.

633
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,690
Yeah, I mean, he wasn't... he's not
a great instructor.

634
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,570
He's not talkative,
let's put it that way.

635
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,610
Um... well, we've actually got
some footage

636
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,650
of Jack's first ever driving lesson
in an actual...

637
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,690
Was it a manual?

638
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,690
I mean, did it have, like,
a lever coming out there?

639
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,050
It had a pull-y thing
and then three pedals.

640
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,610
Three pedals and a pull-y thing.

641
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,250
This is known as a manual car.
A manual car, yes.

642
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,770
Anybody like to see
Jack's first ever driving lesson?

643
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,290
Yes!

644
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,900
Never, ever done this before.
Here we go, let's have a look.

645
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,180
It should make a "vroom" noise,
shouldn't it?

646
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,620
Do I... am I turning it
the right way?

647
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,370
No? Right, OK, fine.

648
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,370
'Was he completely uncommunicative?'

649
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,660
He didn't even nod.

650
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,930
Yes!

651
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,570
Stig, I might need a little bit more
from you than this.

652
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,530
OK, right, so that's not working.

653
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,330
By process of elimination,

654
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,970
if we come off the clutch
and press this...

655
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,930
Revving. Yeah, that's revving.
Getting ready.

656
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,810
And your handbrake's on.
That sounds good.

657
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,970
No, it doesn't.

658
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,420
OK, this is getting better.

659
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,330
Oh, Jesus...

660
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,850
I mean, well done.

661
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,770
But we had to go from that
to getting you round a lap

662
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,410
in the space of an hour.
I think my priorities were...

663
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,450
He didn't think that I was
taking it seriously,

664
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,930
cos when I first got in the car -
a perfectly valid thing,

665
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,850
it's the thing I always ask
when I get in a car,

666
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,330
is whether he had
an iPhone charger.

667
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,370
Because mine had died and I wanted
to get some photos of the journey

668
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,090
and he wasn't happy about that.

669
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,450
He's so moody!

670
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,470
I asked him if there was a Mrs Stig
and that didn't go down well.

671
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,150
No, it wouldn't.
That's what he needs -

672
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,030
maybe he's not getting
enough of it at home.

673
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,390
I thought of the perfect person
for The Stig as well -

674
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,430
this is a match
made in Heaven -

675
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,870
him and the woman who does
the demonstrations on The Cube.

676
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,350
With the mask.

677
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,270
They would be perfect together!

678
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,510
What would the babies be like?

679
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,190
The babies would be amazing!
You could do it as a challenge -

680
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,840
send them to the Isle of Fernandos!

681
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,150
Talking of The Stig
not getting enough,

682
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,150
how, if you're a 17-year-old youth,

683
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,750
do you get any... at all from girls

684
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,670
if you can't drive them anywhere?

685
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,790
Yeah, it was hard.
Especially when I became a stand-up

686
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,190
and it was like, stand-up,
you're going around on tours,

687
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,630
quite rock'n'roll,
there would be groupies and stuff,

688
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,150
but it's very hard to pull a groupie

689
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,350
when your mother has driven
you to the gig.

690
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,350
Afterwards, you'd be like, "Yeah,
you want to go back to my crib?

691
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,590
"My ride's outside,
it's the Volvo just there.

692
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,320
"You'll have to sit in the back,
cos I ride up front with Mummy.

693
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,240
"Hope you like The Archers!"

694
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,030
So when you're doing your gigs now,

695
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,070
presumably your mum doesn't
take you around.

696
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,030
No - the best thing about
this latest tour,

697
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,390
it's the biggest one I've done,

698
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,990
and I'm going to be in a tour bus,
which is amazing.

699
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,630
Cos the worst thing, I find,

700
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,830
about doing a tour
when you're in a car

701
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,990
is having to use petrol
station toilets,

702
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,910
cos the lock on a petrol station
toilet door

703
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,270
is always broken.

704
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,630
They're always bust, then you have
to do that thing which we all do,

705
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,270
which I call "lavatory yoga"

706
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,110
where you work out how to keep
the door with a broken lock shut.

707
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,350
Yeah.

708
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,950
There's three main schools of it -
you've got the Tom Daley,

709
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,030
where you lean forward
with the arms like that.

710
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,590
Use the fingertips. Yeah.

711
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,390
But I can't unless I'm playing
Candy Crush, so that doesn't work.

712
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,710
Then you've got the Bowing Monk,

713
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,550
where you put your head forward
and just use it as a doorstop.

714
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,230
But someone can, like, knock you out

715
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,630
if they're too insistent
on getting in.

716
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,630
Then your third option,
which is the best one,

717
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,950
which you should always use,
is the Woman In Labour,

718
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,270
where you plant two feet
onto the door.

719
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,030
But I committed to this recently
in a petrol station

720
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,350
just outside of Bolton,
and I'd fully committed,

721
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,550
but you have to be a master
of your surroundings,

722
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,430
I didn't realise the door
in question opened both ways!

723
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,550
This, like, hairy trucker
ripped it off and literally thought

724
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,510
I was kind of presenting myself
to him!

725
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,600
"Hello!"

726
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,710
Now, I want to just go on to...
Are you playing the O2?

727
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,030
I'm playing the O2 on the...
Oh, I've forgotten the date!

728
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,550
Come on.

729
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,310
17th March. 17th March?

730
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,070
The 17th or 18th March.
Like, roughly.

731
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,390
17th, he's coming,
he's got a ticket. The 17th!

732
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,790
Oh, no, he works here.

733
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,150
And there we are, so...

734
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,950
It's not just going to be a tour,
there's plenty of surprises as well.

735
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,150
There will be the greatest ever
Segway entrance to a stand-up tour

736
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,230
the world has ever seen.
Somebody's putting you on a Segway?

737
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,670
I'm on a Segway, yeah.
Well, that's worth going to see.

738
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,510
It's got everything you'd want
from a stand-up comedy tour.

739
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,670
Anyway, the lap.

740
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,150
I ought to explain, you did actually
ditch the manual, didn't you,

741
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,870
for the lap and go to an automatic?

742
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,870
Yeah, I thought that was best cos I
wanted to get all the way around it.

743
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,430
The only trouble with an automatic
is you're not going to...

744
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,270
You'll probably not get very high up
that anyway, so...
Let's not worry too much about that.

745
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,630
Who here would like to see
the result of your driving lesson?

746
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,880
Yeah!
Here we go. Oh, dear.

747
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,590
Flying solo for the first time.

748
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,270
Come on, Jack.
You are a king of speed!

749
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,240
We shall see, you look a bit
frightened. I was very frightened.

750
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,590
You've steered round that one.
It sounds awful.

751
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,510
Oh, good God! And off.

752
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,550
That counts though, doesn't it?
Yes, yes, yes, you're still...

753
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,590
To be honest, a lot of what
The Stig says is BLEEP!

754
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,830
It's really just about... Oh!

755
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,350
I guess we'll never know,
as we do Chicago,

756
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,150
heading down to the Hammerhead.
Where are you going?

757
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,720
That's completely the wrong...
Oh, I feel so sick.

758
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,560
You made yourself sick!
I made myself sick.

759
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,950
And here we go,
round the Hammerhead... Whoops!

760
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,790
That was quite good.
Not really... Ooh!

761
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,830
The big circular thing is
necessary there in front of you.

762
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,350
Is it low on petrol?

763
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,520
Cos it kept beeping.

764
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,510
Right, so, it was beeping at you?

765
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,030
Don't go off there! Tyres.

766
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,230
This one was good.

767
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,670
Oh, braking there!

768
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,990
That's ballsy
because that can upset the rear end

769
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,350
in a front-wheel-drive car

770
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,150
and I may be talking French
as far as you're concerned there.

771
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,750
Only Gambon to go and can you do it?

772
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,510
Oh, wait a minute, yes, nearly,
you can! Across the line!

773
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,440
I got there.

774
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,790
When you bear in mind that you
arrived this morning having

775
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,470
driven a car once to the butchers
and back... Yeah.

776
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,870
And then you had a lesson
and then put that together,

777
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,990
I think that's pretty impressive,
I really do. Oh, thank you.

778
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,390
But how fast do you think
you did it?

779
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,230
Where do you think you came
on the board? Oh, I don't know.

780
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,870
In between Hiddleston
and Bonneville?

781
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,150
You're hoping to get between Tom and
Hugh? Around about the 1.50 mark?

782
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,190
Yeah.

783
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,030
You did it, Jack Whitehall...
You're leaning forward like a pro...

784
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,950
One minute...
One minute, that's good.

785
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,440
..50...

786
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,880
There's no kind way of saying this.

787
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,910
..4.5.

788
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,470
Aw!

789
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,110
It's all right, you know...

790
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,670
Getting in the car for me
was a victory in itself.

791
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,630
Do you want to move it further down?

792
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,110
I feel like I'm sullying that person
by being there.

793
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,950
But that, I mean...

794
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,910
Maybe I could come back
after I've actually learnt to drive

795
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,950
and I would get a competitive time.

796
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,910
I'd like that because this was
woeful. Yeah, I know!

797
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,350
At least I'm on the board
and not at home crying in my pants,

798
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,190
which is where I should be
when it comes to driving.

799
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,470
No, I'd like to have you back
because it's been bloody
good fun having you here.

800
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,630
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Whitehall!

801
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,670
Now... If you want a car that's fast,
you're spoiled for choice.

802
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,870
Same story if you want a car
that's economical or cheap,

803
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,270
or has a big boot, but what if you're
a massive showoff and your main

804
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,990
requirement is for a car that makes
you stand out in your hometown?

805
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,070
Well, that can be a lot trickier

806
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,760
depending upon the town where you
live, as I shall now demonstrate.

807
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,750
Welcome to the United Arab Emirates,
where, as you can see,

808
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,480
it takes quite a lot to stand out
on the car front.

809
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,550
Out here, your common or garden
Ferrari or Lamborghini

810
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,070
can no longer cut the mustard.

811
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,550
So what do you do
if you want to turn heads?

812
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,070
Well, I think I may have the answer.

813
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,430
You see, everyone thinks about
blinging their wheels,

814
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,800
but nobody ever thinks of
adding MORE wheels.

815
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,840
This is the new six-wheeled version
of Mercedes's iconic G-Wagen.

816
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,270
And beside the extra wheels,
it also ticks the rarity box

817
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,470
because it's one of only two
in existence.

818
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,910
More will be built,
though I suspect not many

819
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,840
when you consider the price, which is
a trouser-troubling £370,000.

820
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,030
The six-wheel G-Class was originally
built for the Australian Army,

821
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,910
who demanded standard equipment
like seats and doors.

822
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,630
In this civilian version,
however, you get heated

823
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,550
and ventilated
electric leather chairs,

824
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,310
a leather-trimmed dashboard

825
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,990
and a bamboo-lined cargo bay.

826
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,470
You really do get a lot of car
for your money, as in A LOT OF CAR.

827
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,950
I mean, look at it.

828
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,950
It's nearly a metre longer
than a Range Rover

829
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,790
and it's got 37-inch wheels.

830
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,270
I reckon I could get my head in
the gap between the wheel

831
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,720
and the wheel arch.

832
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,030
Yeah, I can.
Try doing that in a Range Rover.

833
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:53,530
The six-by-six also weighs
three-and-three-quarter tonnes

834
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,130
or the same as three VW Golfs.

835
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,090
So, engine-wise,
it can't afford to mess about.

836
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:07,050
It's actually got a 5.5 litre,
536-horsepower twin-turbo V8

837
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,380
from Mercedes's
in-house nutterists, AMG.

838
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,940
Oh, we're getting a move on!

839
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,540
560 pound-feet of torque.

840
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,180
0-60 in under six seconds.

841
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,500
That's sports car stuff in something
the size of a shopping centre.

842
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,370
Fuel economy? Well, I doubt this
will be the official transport

843
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,020
to the next Greenpeace
annual conference.

844
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,410
All I'll say is they thought it best
to fit two fuel tanks.

845
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,530
You change over
using this switch up here.

846
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,900
And everybody loves
an overhead switch.

847
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,690
If I drove this down Ross-on-Wye
high street,

848
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,940
I would be lord of all I survey.

849
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,890
The undisputed king of Herefordshire.

850
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,050
Never mind Herefordshire, this thing
attracts attention even around here.

851
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,500
Seriously?

852
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,570
Really?

853
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,330
'Yeah, he's serious.

854
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,250
'As it turned out,

855
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,930
'the policeman had never seen
such an unusual car before...'

856
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,050
There's six wheels. I guess
it's the same on the other side.

857
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,530
'..and was on his way again
after he'd had a look.'

858
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,620
Bye!

859
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,060
Lamborghini Aventador police car.
They don't have those in Ross-on-Wye.

860
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,020
Or these...

861
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,620
Ferrari FF.

862
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,570
That's an S... MG.

863
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,340
What a funny day.

864
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:51,570
Now, although the six-by-six is
seriously quick on tarmac and turns

865
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,540
policemen's heads, where it's really
built to shine is as an off-roader.

866
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,810
Let me give you an example.

867
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,810
A Land Rover Defender can wade
through half a metre of water

868
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,530
and that's very good.

869
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,370
This can wade through twice that.

870
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,570
However, this being the desert,
water is quite hard to find,

871
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,100
so if you want to test it,
you do have to improvise.

872
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,660
Morning, sorry.

873
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,850
Sorry. This is, unless I'm very much
mistaken, a metre of water.

874
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,660
And my six-by-six is...
wading through it.

875
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,260
Even dealing with the rubber rings.

876
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,530
Yeah, not having any
difficulties with this at all.

877
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,730
But how does it cope with sand?

878
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,700
Well, the good news is, sand is one
thing we're really not short of.

879
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,500
Welcome to the Empty Quarter.

880
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,450
The largest sand desert in the world.

881
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,940
Covering some 250,000 square miles.

882
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,130
Out here, temperatures hit
50 degrees centigrade

883
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,580
and there are dunes
more than 800ft high.

884
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,010
OK, we have six-wheel drive

885
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,210
with the power split 30-40-30
across the axles... check.

886
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,210
Stronger front springs from the
armoured version of the G-Class...

887
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,730
check.

888
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,210
Locking diffs - oh, we've got those.

889
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,050
The most you'd expect normally
would be three. On here, five!

890
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,010
And you lock them using these buttons
in different ways.

891
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,620
Right, let's go.

892
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,450
These are big, big dunes.

893
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,380
This is more of a sand mountain
I'm on right now.

894
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,170
Oh! Three-and-three-quarter tonnes
of Mercedes

895
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,820
is doing this, it just
doesn't feel right!

896
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,930
This extra axle and these two extra
wheels, it changes the way the

897
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:44,340
six-by-six travels over the ground,
it undulates, it feels supple.

898
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,300
It's like blasting through
the desert dunes...

899
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,900
..riding a sinew.

900
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,770
Come on!

901
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,300
O-o-o-oh!

902
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,260
No! BLEEP!

903
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,060
I got some air. Sorry, everybody.

904
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,450
'Intoxicated by what the Merc
could do,

905
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,250
'I drove deeper and deeper
into the Empty Quarter.'

906
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,980
Right, where's it go now?

907
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,540
Cos... Oh, my God! Oh!

908
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,700
Oh, for crying out loud!

909
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,180
I wouldn't ski down that!

910
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,340
OK.

911
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,810
Whoa-oh-oh-aah!

912
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,620
Over the top, over the top...
Oh! Oh, very unpleasant, not nice!

913
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,740
It's vertical!

914
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,140
I'm in a car,
I'm having a plane crash!

915
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,180
I'm still going down!

916
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,100
Oh, what a stupid place, I hate it!

917
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,850
♪ Ahead, I saw a nice,
flat desert floor

918
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,140
'and decided that was
a much safer place to be.'

919
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,810
It's drifting!

920
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,380
Now it's a rally car,
a gigantic rally car.

921
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,010
And let's not forget,
I'm not having to shout over this,

922
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,050
it's not "Raaargh!" in here.

923
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,500
I'm still cocooned in luxury.

924
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,020
It's an amazing device.

925
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,450
Now, when you take an off-roader
across sand,

926
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,730
the standard practice, as I've done,

927
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:08,010
is to let some air out of the tyres
to give them a bigger footprint.

928
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,450
Now I'm going back on tarmac,
so I need to reinflate them.

929
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,850
All I've got to do is operate these
overhead switches.

930
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,170
I feel like a jet pilot.

931
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,770
Compressor on.

932
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,500
Going up.

933
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:27,130
And they can reinflate ALL of these
tyres in under a minute.

934
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,260
Oh, I love this.

935
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:32,220
If I did this in Ledbury
I'd be mobbed by now.

936
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:40,380
Leaving the Empty Quarter behind,
I headed back towards civilisation.

937
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,330
I'm not going to pretend
this is anything less than

938
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,930
a preposterous machine.

939
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,530
It's a six-metre,

940
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,770
three-and-three-quarter tonne,
£370,000, six-wheeled dinosaur,

941
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,930
but as dinosaurs go,
it is a magnificent one.

942
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,730
Magnificent to behold,
magnificently made,

943
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,410
it's one of the car world's
mad moments.

944
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,580
A day off from Priuses and Leafs.

945
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,890
And even in a country as chock-full
of showy-offy cars as this one,

946
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,060
it's still really rather special.

947
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,530
You can forget your chrome wraps
and whatever,

948
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,930
I don't think you can beat

949
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,810
just having more wheels
than anything else,

950
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,090
and I can say
with absolute confidence

951
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,820
that I have more wheels
than any other... Oh.

952
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,450
No matter, one thing I can say
for sure is that this is

953
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,130
the most extreme Mercedes out here.

954
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,490
I doubt there's anything with
a Mercedes badge in these parts

955
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,300
that can draw as much attention...
as that.

956
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,490
All right,
so I don't have the most wheels,

957
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,650
it's not the most extreme Mercedes
out here,

958
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,930
but the six-by-six does have
size on its side.

959
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,130
Bigger than any Range Rover,
bigger than any Land Cruiser,

960
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,770
bigger than that old Jeep up there
and that's the thing -

961
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,410
a car can be beautiful
but when it's big,

962
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,700
it's got presence and they don't
come much bigger than...

963
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,060
Oh... my... God...

964
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,100
I want this one.

965
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,130
Brilliant.

966
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,450
Embarrassingly, whilst there,

967
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,210
I ran the Merc out of petrol

968
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,530
in the place where they actually
grow the stuff. Really?

969
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,730
It was awful, I felt an idiot.
Never mind that,

970
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,970
can we just look at that
picture of you at the end?

971
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,930
You do look like something
out of The Borrowers,

972
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,330
to be brutally honest. But I have
to say that Jeep is incredible.

973
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,970
Sadly, it was broken the day I was
there, but it does actually move.

974
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,530
And I'd like to see that one day,
but now it is time for me

975
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,530
to demonstrate that cars are better
than motorbikes. Oh, no.

976
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,930
Hang on. Jeremy, we've only got
a few minutes. Yes, yes, listen.

977
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,130
Come over here, because what we have
here is a table laid for two, OK?

978
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:39,170
And I'm going to remove this
tablecloth without knocking

979
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,730
anything over.
Where are you going with this?

980
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,610
Everybody, stand back behind me,

981
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,500
because you need to be...
quick to do this. Well...

982
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,370
Well, yeah. Oh, well done.

983
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,370
That's really cleared that up
for us(!)

984
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,050
Bikes are faster than a table!
Or something.

985
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,730
What's that got to do with anything?

986
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:06,090
It went rather well, better than
I'd expected, if I'm honest!

987
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:11,450
Anyway, the thing is, BMW once did
that trick with a much larger table,

988
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,420
as I shall now demonstrate
with this bit of film.

989
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,170
Well, that is tremendous, it's
amazing. Well done, the motorbike.

990
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,250
Yeah.

991
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,250
But what I'm going to do now is that
exact same thing only with a car.

992
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,250
You are aware, aren't you, that
a Superbike accelerates very fast?

993
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,130
Yes, Hammond, from say 10-150,
but to do that you need

994
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,690
the instant acceleration,
it's 0-10 that matters.

995
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,250
That is a very good point

996
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,050
because it's very difficult
to get a bike off the line.

997
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,210
Right, I'll admit, it usually spins
the wheel or it flips over backwards.

998
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,970
You see,
cars don't flip over backwards,

999
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,210
it's one of the many reasons
why they're better.

1000
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,730
And the car I've selected
is this one. A Datsun?

1001
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,650
A Nissan GT-R.

1002
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,170
No, I approve of your choice of car,
actually, I have to say.

1003
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,210
Yeah, cos May and I were playing
with one of these the other day

1004
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,210
and the way it sets off
is simply unbelievable.

1005
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,090
I mean, it really is,

1006
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,690
there's no car I've ever driven
that goes from 0-10 faster.

1007
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,450
It's got four-wheel drive and
an amazing launch control system.

1008
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,290
So you put your foot hard down
on the accelerator, hard on the

1009
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,090
brake, take your foot off the brake,
computer does everything

1010
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,090
and you set off. OK, and this is
the table, yeah? Yes, it is.

1011
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,530
So let's get this straight.

1012
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,770
You are going to pull this tablecloth
off this, what, 18ft table? Yes.

1013
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,250
Using this Datsun? Listen...
Without breaking anything?

1014
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,850
Without knocking a single thing
over. Really? Yes.

1015
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,090
The words "stand" and "back"
spring to mind.

1016
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,690
Ye of little faith.

1017
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,410
OK, I'm using the same length
of rope that BMW did.

1018
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,410
Same amount of slack that they did,

1019
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,050
we're pulling from the same place
that they did.

1020
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,810
Everything is... What?

1021
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,250
Have you actually measured this out?
A bit.

1022
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,450
You've got to go 18ft to get
the tablecloth off the table,

1023
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,170
plus the length of that bit
off the end... Yes.

1024
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,530
..plus you got to account for
the amount of rope

1025
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,570
and you've got to stop before you
hit the other side of the studio.

1026
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,010
No, I haven't. You have. I haven't,
because I'm not going to drive it.

1027
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,290
He is.

1028
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,970
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Stig has come among us.

1029
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,810
Very rarely in the studio.

1030
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,650
Hold on a minute. Very rarely...

1031
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,850
Hold on a minute. Yes, what?

1032
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,530
So you are saying he is going to
drive across our darkened studio,

1033
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,130
peering through his darkened visor?

1034
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,610
Yes. Is this how this Stig dies?

1035
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,170
Has he done a book?

1036
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,410
No, he hasn't. Right, is he ready?

1037
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,060
Are you ready?

1038
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,770
Everybody here ready?
Yes!

1039
01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:59,810
Oh, God!

1040
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,570
We have no idea
how it's going to work out,

1041
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,250
but I have hope in my heart.

1042
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,260
In three, two, one, go!

1043
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:24,010
Well? That was mostly incredibly
successful. How, in what way?

1044
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,210
He didn't hit the wall,
as we can see.

1045
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,770
But everything else has hit
the floor, it's smashed to bits!

1046
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,930
Yes, but look! There's a whole
cup and saucer, not damaged.

1047
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:37,210
It didn't work. It didn't...
It is most odd actually.

1048
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,500
Can we see a replay of that,
maybe work out what went wrong.

1049
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,770
Oh, there's the problem. What?
He's doing it too slowly.

1050
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,770
No, that's in slow motion, you idiot.

1051
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,650
Well, if he hadn't have done it in
slow motion, it would have worked!

1052
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,290
For crying out loud! But now look!
It's a disaster. It's a bombshell.

1053
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,010
And that means we can end. Yes. Mm.

1054
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,850
Thank you ever so much for watching,
we'll see you next week.

1055
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,930
Take care and good night.
