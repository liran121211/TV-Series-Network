1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,490
Thanks, everybody, thank you.

2
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,890
Hello, good evening.

3
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,730
Thank you so much.

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,210
We're back!

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,820
We have returned.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,490
We've returned with an all-new
series, and it is a cracker.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,010
We have got a review
of the Mk7 Volkswagen Golf,

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,610
we've an extended report
of the 900cc Dacia Sandero,

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,410
James has done that. It's very long.

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,530
We've a piece on bicycles,
we've something on the stresses

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,970
of long-distance lorry driving...

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,420
..and the rest of it
sort of looks like this.

13
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,330
They should have called this the
Widowmaker!

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,210
Come on, little Alfa.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,620
We have to beat him.

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,780
You want a race?
I'll give you a race!

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,140
Oh, God. My doves have escaped.

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,060
Arrrrrgh!

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,020
Just have my heated seat set
to the first position.

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,250
Morning. Sorry.

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,530
The town in question is called...

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,620
Chernobyl.

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,500
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,860
Goooahhh!

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,940
'Newsnight now, on BBC TWO...'

26
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,970
All that is to come.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,690
But first, there has been,
I'm afraid, a bit of a row
in the office.

28
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,090
You see, we think
that the current crop
of hot hatchbacks are very good,

29
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,090
however, we say they're not as good
as the hot hatchbacks

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,250
you could buy in the '80s
or the '90s.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,130
Well, they're not, are they?
No, exactly, but our producers,
who are very young

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,970
and wander around with
the top of their underpants

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,890
showing at the back of their
trousers,

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,610
say that we are talking nonsense.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,890
Yeah, so, to sort it all out,
they told us to go and buy

36
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,970
three old hot hatches,
whilst they would devise

37
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,370
a series of humiliating challenges.

38
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,020
Hmm! Hmm!

39
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,690
The meeting point
was a car park in Droitwich,

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,740
and I was the first to arrive.

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,050
This is a Volkswagen Golf GTI -

42
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,620
the standard-bearer,
the benchmark, the daddy...

43
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,690
And think about it - a modern-day
GTI would cost you Â£27,000.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,530
This was just 800 quid.
I mean, 800 quid! For a Golf GTI!

45
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,010
It's only done 172,000 miles,
and at just 25 years old it's...

46
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,540
Oh, there's James!

47
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,930
Oh, God. That was a handbrake turn,
right there, ladies and gentlemen.

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,970
Yo!

49
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,330
XR2!

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,050
XR2i, 16 valve.

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,290
16 valve? Oh, yes.

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,010
See, I've gone for the coveted Mk2
eight-valve model.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,890
Eight valve? Eight valve.

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,930
What?

55
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,370
Oh, the comedy stickers.

56
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,690
The thing is, James, what you have
to remember is,

57
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,210
you know when you look at a car,

58
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,050
how has it been treated?
Who's owned it?

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,890
I looked at these stickers,

60
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,970
the non-standard alloy wheels,

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,810
and I suspect this has been slammed.

62
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,650
It does look like it's been
slammed. It's been lowered.

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,170
So you add those things together,

64
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,210
and I've deduced it was probably
owned by...a parish priest?

65
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,210
June Whitfield, probably.
It's funny you should say that,

66
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,530
because I employ a similar tactic
when I'm buying a car, so I looked

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,690
at things like - it has very
high-specification after-market

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,170
brake pads. Has it? Which means it
was somebody

69
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,890
interested in safety, not speed.
Yes. And also,

70
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,650
they've done things like left
the jacking point exposed,

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,530
so you spend less time exposed to
danger if you have to change

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,090
your wheel on the hard shoulder.
Exactly.

73
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,330
800 quid. 750 quid.

74
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,780
You see, we've been clever,
we have been wise.

75
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,370
Sadly, our discussion
was curtailed,

76
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,060
because Hammond then arrived.

77
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,890
And he hadn't been wise at all.

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,090
Is that...?

79
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,450
No. No. No.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,650
Nova SRi. No. This is fun, isn't it?
I'm loving my day so far.

81
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,330
Let me talk you through it -
1.4-litre multi-point fuel injection,

82
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,330
82 brake horsepower. Uh-huh.

83
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,210
This is light, and nippy and quick.

84
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,850
This was the clever choice in its
day. Was it? Yeah. It was.

85
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,130
Hammond... I love...
Hammond, Hammond, Hammond, Hammond.

86
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,170
Yeah? This has spent more time on its
roof than it has on its wheels.

87
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,730
All Novas are driven by yobbos
who turn them over.

88
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,810
I must admit... Because it's not
just this door that doesn't match.

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,930
That one was white.

90
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,650
I don't think there's a ditch
in Essex that this hasn't visited.

91
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,210
But it's still working. These are
very desirable. Are they?

92
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,580
How much was it? 700 quid.

93
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,610
Not that anyone ever actually
had to buy a Vauxhall Nova -

94
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,090
it was much easier to steal one.

95
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,450
Nobody's to watch this if you're
a car thief. Don't watch this.

96
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,450
You have the keys. I have the keys.

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm going to remove the hazard
warning light switch, OK?

98
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,020
Yep. I'm now going to pop it
back in again, upside down.

99
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,930
And lo and behold, the ignition
comes on.

100
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,170
Now it's just a question of, um...
Bump-start.

101
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,450
Go!

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,610
And there we are.

103
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,180
And I've got the key!

104
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,130
'As I was finishing my
demonstration,

105
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,970
'I received a message.'

106
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,370
I've got a text.
Oh, it's from the producers. Eh?

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,210
Yeah, it's the first
of the challenges.

108
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,930
What happened to the gold envelope?

109
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,730
He's a teenager.

110
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,450
That would mean using a pen.

111
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,010
Oh, he wouldn't have seen one
of those. No, he wouldn't. Anyway...

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,810
Hang on. I don't know what it says.
Because you need your glasses?

113
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,450
Oh, dear. I'm old!

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,490
It says, "The main reason for buying
a hot hatchback is speed.

115
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,010
"You will therefore do a performance
test at the Shelsley Walsh
Hill Climb

116
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,460
"in your crocks of ship."

117
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,570
Ship?

118
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,090
Ship. I think there's been some
auto-correction. Yes.

119
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,530
Right... Soldier on.

120
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,490
Oh, bloody hell.

121
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,290
Have you got an alarm?

122
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,370
1989? They didn't have alarms,
so everybody put after-market alarms

123
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,210
on them, which don't work. Ever.

124
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,450
Oh, shut up!

125
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,930
I'd like to be laughing
about them and their alarms,

126
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,810
but I've just spotted
something which is...

127
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,010
Well, everything got stolen
in the '80s,

128
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,570
so they'd engrave the reg number on
the glass, and on the tailgate,

129
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,530
I can't help but notice
that this registration number

130
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,170
isn't the same as this
registration number,

131
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,850
which means
it's not the original tailgate.

132
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,490
I thought that was the only original
panel on it.

133
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,370
On the drive to the Hill Climb,

134
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,220
we have the chance to get
acquainted with our cars.

135
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,370
Oh, I love my little Nova.
It's all about simplicity, lightness.

136
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,570
This has nothing on it that
you don't need.

137
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,090
Door mirrors, manual.
Windows, manual.

138
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,450
There isn't even a window winder
on the passenger side,

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,820
because it's dropped off.
How simple and light is that?

140
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,890
Since we're alone, viewers, and
it's traditional for me to be honest

141
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,890
at this point, I will say that
the car feels a little careworn.

142
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,850
The driver's seat smells funny,
the fuel gauge doesn't work

143
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,490
all the time, and neither does
the temperature gauge.

144
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,490
The radio only comes out
of one speaker.

145
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,570
The clutch judders.
The wheels wobble.

146
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,170
There are a lot of knocks
and rattles.

147
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,740
Amazing, really,
because it's only done 23,000 miles.

148
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,050
Let me do a systems check and make
sure all the equipment is working.

149
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,170
Heated rear window, yep.

150
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,730
Ashtray, yep.

151
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,970
Good, that's that done.

152
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,010
Third gear.

153
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,810
That G-force is nearly
tearing my face off!

154
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,090
We were so brave in the '80s.

155
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,610
We were brave and we were strong,
because we had no power steering.

156
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,490
We didn't go to a gym -
we just went for a drive.

157
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,340
That would build up a sweat.

158
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,890
Many power-steering-less
miles later...

159
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,530
God, I stink.

160
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,820
..we arrived at the terrifying
Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb.

161
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,930
Germany has the Nurburgring, America
has Pikes Peak - we have this.

162
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,610
It's more than half a mile long,
and at the bottom of this fearsome

163
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,810
ribbon of tarmac, we were given
more details of our challenge.

164
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,570
"A modern Seat Ibiza Cupre

165
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,850
"will now go up the Hill Climb
course,

166
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,290
"then you must try to beat its
time."

167
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,050
Seat Cupre? Yeah.
That's fast, is it?

168
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,210
Hang on, who's going to be
driving the Seat?

169
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,570
It's not the Stig, is it? No. No,
it's not the Stig.

170
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,300
It's the Stig's teenage cousin.

171
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,610
Look at the size of it!
I know. It's a whale.

172
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,250
Might as well try and drive up there
in that barn.

173
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,050
With the traditional Hill Climb
chock holding the Seat in place,

174
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,090
Teenage Stig was
ready for the off.

175
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,180
Go!

176
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,060
What a dreary spectacle.

177
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,890
Doesn't have that nimble, light,

178
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,340
tight, frenzied feel
of a proper hot hatch.

179
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,340
Ohh...

180
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,300
'The Stig's teenage
cousin did it in 40.50.'

181
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,860
What, to do 0.6 of a mile?
I shall halve it.

182
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,250
As the Golf had the most power,
we agreed it should go first.

183
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,330
Hold on, I'm just going to shut my
window.

184
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,530
There it is.

185
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,460
Three, two, one.

186
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,970
That was all wheel-spin. That's
already quicker, look at that.

187
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,730
Double declutch into second.
A pheasant!

188
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,460
Ooh! That was close.

189
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,010
Yeah!

190
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,860
112 of the finest German horsepower
hurling me up this hill.

191
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,540
60mph as we cross the line.

192
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,900
Uhh-uhh!

193
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,210
Next it was James' turn, in the XR2.

194
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,860
Three, two, one, go!

195
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,330
You bastard!

196
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,580
Nice start(!)

197
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,740
At speed, the XR2's 20-year-old
steering really came into its own.

198
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,810
Oh, God.

199
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,420
He's bought a dog.
He has bought an appalling dog.

200
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,570
Whoa.

201
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,020
This is terrible.

202
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,170
More worryingly, on the way
back down, a marshal handed me back

203
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,300
some of my car.

204
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,580
That is a bolt, obviously.

205
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,660
But for what?

206
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,050
As I pondered on that,

207
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,860
Jeremy prepared
the course for Hammond's Nova.

208
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,650
Hammond. I have never seen a man
suit a car more than that.

209
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,020
Three, two, one!

210
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,610
Ah-ha-ha!

211
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,730
That's some wheel-spin.

212
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,730
There are some people who look like
their dogs. There are one or two

213
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,020
people who look like their cars,
and, yeah... Little... Nova drivers.

214
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,860
Everything, now.
Come on, unleash the lot.

215
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,460
Across the line!

216
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,900
And now, back down!

217
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,460
Oh, yeah.

218
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,850
Predictably, Hammond had binned it.

219
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,290
Oh, my God. No!

220
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,900
How the hell did you get it there?

221
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,020
Well, I was coming down here, and...
Oh, hang on, it's...

222
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,970
You have righted it.
You have righted it.

223
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,010
Look, he's actually beaming
because you stuffed your...

224
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,810
Well, you can tell your mates, can't
you? In the ditch.

225
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,330
And it's a complete roll now.

226
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,130
Cos this was the thing in the '80s -
you put your car in a ditch,

227
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,850
and you did, and you found it funny.

228
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,050
Do you realise if Constable
had lived today, he would have

229
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,450
painted that. It would have been
called the HEY, WAYNE.

230
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,820
Very good.

231
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,570
As the marshals recovered
the Nova, we were given the results.

232
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,700
What was the Stig? 40... 40.5.
Right. I was...

233
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,170
..47.4.

234
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,130
May, perhaps not surprisingly, 50.4.

235
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,570
Right.

236
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,290
Hammond...

237
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,250
46.3.

238
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,730
So you were the fastest, and
I congratulate you. Thank you.

239
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,850
But the point is, we were all slower
than the Stig, and yet we weren't.

240
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,770
Mm-hm. Hang on.
How do you make that out?

241
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,090
Time moved more slowly in the '80s.

242
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,370
Because when you're 30,
a year is a 30th of your life.

243
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,420
When you're 50,
it's a 50th of your life.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,020
'By the time Hammond had got this
one worked out...

245
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,380
'..darkness had fallen.'

246
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,090
So what have we learned?
Well, obviously we've learned

247
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,050
that our cars are much cheaper
than their modern-day equivalent,

248
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,050
and in real terms faster.

249
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,060
But I think we'd all agree that they
are looking a little bit...tired.

250
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,050
So we decided to spruce them up
at the top-secret

251
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,090
Top Gear Antique Restoration Centre,

252
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,490
on the A451,
just outside Kidderminster.

253
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,610
Here, cars are wrapped in a special
self-adhesive material

254
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,700
to give them
a brand-new factory-fresh look.

255
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,570
If you pay somebody else
to respray your car...

256
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,850
Â£5,000, Â£10,000. Easily.

257
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,650
This is less than 1,000.

258
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,660
You know, pull the right bit
off there, job done.

259
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,820
With the Renault done,
we decided to do our cars ourselves.

260
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,810
OK, well... We'll see how we get on
with that later on.

261
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,090
But now, it's time to do the news.

262
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,410
Now, BMW has made
a three-cylinder hybrid.

263
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,730
Would you like to see a photograph?
Well, no, not really, no.

264
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,930
Well, that's a rotten bit of luck
cos here it is.

265
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,930
Wow, is that it? Yeah,
three-cylinder hybrid, right there.

266
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,170
It looks quite good.

267
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,410
Is it vaguely reminiscent of the old
M1? Remember the supercar they did?

268
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,970
What it is, I'll tell you exactly
what it is, that is the future.

269
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,210
It really genuinely is.

270
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,890
It's lightweight construction,
petrol engine,

271
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,090
working in tandem
with an electric motor.

272
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,410
I know that sounds dreary,
but think about it,

273
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,050
it's the exact same recipe
you get in a McLaren P1,

274
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,250
and that is not dreary at all.

275
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,410
No, and more to the point,
you've driven it,
it's on the show next week. Yes.

276
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,610
Well, Come on, give us a hint,
what's it like?

277
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,290
It is genuinely unbelievable.
The speed simply is mind-blowing.

278
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,490
How fast? Beyond...

279
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,970
You can't keep up with just
how fast it goes, that P1,

280
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,930
and because of the P1,

281
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,290
it means normal people
can now drive a hybrid.

282
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,930
You don't have to wear
nuclear-free peace sandals,

283
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,970
you can be like normal people here
and have a hybrid.

284
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,530
That's why I think that is
going to be brilliant.

285
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,530
The thing is, it will go like a 911,
cost about the same,

286
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,730
but you don't have to be a moron
to drive one.

287
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,250
Child! You child! Like James
and Richard both have 911s.

288
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,050
Really?
We're back at work, aren't we?

289
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,850
We are back in the playground, yeah.

290
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,250
I'd like to talk about
things I'm sorry I missed

291
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,730
while we've been off air.

292
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,650
Plans are being drawn up, right,
to fine the owner of a car,

293
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,170
if a passenger throws litter
out of the window.

294
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,770
Fine him? The owner...

295
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,010
Oh, throw him to the dogs.
Well, no...

296
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,530
Use the Kim Jong-un technique
on people who litter.

297
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,370
No, I know what you mean, cos
littering is the most moronic crime.

298
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,690
It's pitiful, however, thanks to
this there is now an excuse for it.

299
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,050
An excuse for littering? Yeah. What?

300
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,130
Think about it, James, mate... Yes?

301
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,250
..can I have a lift home tonight
in your car?

302
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,810
Just me and, like, my favourite
bin bag full of empty crisp packets.

303
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,450
I was once riding my motorcycle
past a line of stationary cars

304
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,250
and I was hit in the face
by half a ready meal that had been
thrown out of a window...

305
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,730
I mean, still hot. That was me!

306
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,290
Was it?
Yeah, and it wasn't a ready meal!

307
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,610
No.

308
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,780
It was an adult nappy!

309
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,650
Anyway, we've had the Formula One
testing all last week,

310
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,970
as I'm sure you know.

311
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,730
Important this year, the testing,
cos there's so many new rules.

312
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,530
The cars have to have 1.6 litre
engines, narrower wings

313
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,130
and sex aids on the front.

314
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,410
Don't be stupid,
they don't have to... They do!

315
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,130
Hello?
Have a look at this at Caterham.

316
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,890
That's a sex aid on the front!
Oh, no! What are they...?

317
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,650
We've got a close-up
on the Toro Rosso.

318
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,420
Oh, God! You wouldn't want to be
rear-ended by that, would you?

319
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,770
Cos if you think of it,
you get in the car,

320
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,730
strap yourself in and there it is.

321
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,570
It is a strap-on, basically.

322
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,290
Formula "strap" One!
Formula "strap" One!

323
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,530
Formula "strap" One is what it is!

324
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,370
Right, here's a scenario. You're
racing towards the finish line,

325
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,490
neck and neck,
you want to cross the line first.

326
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,570
It's good if you could extend
the front a bit... Yeah.

327
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,090
..and maybe if you were,
I don't know, let's say,

328
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,410
having trouble extending
the bit at the front,

329
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,250
they could have a little blue
triangular button on the steering
wheel that you could press.

330
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,530
V Power! Yes!

331
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,130
There it is! For about
an hour and a half...it's longer!

332
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,450
I'm just saying.

333
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,770
You don't get coverage like that
in Autosport magazine. Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,290
Now, are you always late
for your game of golf?

335
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,450
Are you sick of being the last to
the lodge? Well, it's good news!

336
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,250
Is it another Dacia?

337
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,210
It's not a Dacia...

338
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,650
There is a new 450-brake horsepower
Lexus called the RCF.

339
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,380
Here it is, what do you think?

340
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,090
I hate to have to say this, James,
but I actually quite like it.

341
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,610
I'm glad, cos I quite like it
as well.

342
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,010
Oh, God, I'm going to catch golf
from you two! Ugh!

343
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm going to turn up next week
like that. Hang on a minute, though.

344
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,570
This is the second Lexus you've
liked. It is, you're a Lexus fan.

345
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,890
There you go.

346
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,010
And then, I'm going to join
the police as a constable

347
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,970
and become a chief inspector
within a week

348
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,210
with me trouser leg rolled up
and one of those.

349
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,140
Oh, it was the Masons!
I thought that was a sexual thing!

350
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,410
Ooh, I tell you what I was driving
the other day,

351
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,810
the new Mercedes S-Class
which is available

352
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,530
with a thermal imaging camera, OK,

353
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,250
which sends a feed from the front
of the car onto the dashboard,

354
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,130
so you can see
what's ahead at night,

355
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,690
beyond the range of your headlights.
We've got some footage of it here.

356
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,210
So as you're driving along,

357
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,050
the camera can see animals,
there you go,

358
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,130
and it picks them out in red,
or people.

359
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,210
As it's going along there is
an animal, you see?

360
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,490
That's clever. A bit of a gimmick,
though, isn't it?
You wouldn't rely on it.

361
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,010
You say that, James, but I was
coming back to my flat in London

362
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,170
the other night, it was quite late,
in the S-Class with that turned on.

363
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,930
As I was going up, it picked out
a red box in some bushes,

364
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,690
just outside my front door.

365
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,570
I drove up, I thought,

366
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,850
"What on earth is that
at this time of the morning?"

367
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,810
Drove up, when the headlines got
there, paparazzi photographer.

368
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,570
So it can find paps hiding in the
dark? Yeah, but there's a problem.

369
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,610
Because when I tried
to run him down...

370
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,650
As you get near, it automatically
applies the brakes.

371
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,770
What's the point of targeting
somebody, if you can't hit them?

372
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,930
They haven't thought that through.

373
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,650
Back to the drawing board with that,
please, Mercedes.

374
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,010
Now, obviously the biggest news
while we were off air

375
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,810
was the tragic accident
that Michael Schumacher had.

376
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,850
I don't know if any of his family
are watching, but I'm sure everybody

377
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,370
here would join with us to wish him
a full and speedy recovery.

378
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,740
Absolutely.

379
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,940
Come on, old fella, pull through.
Yeah.

380
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,490
Now...

381
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,490
Tonight we are attempting to prove
to our teenage producers that the

382
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,050
hot hatches of our youth were better
than the hot hatches of today.

383
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,770
Yes, and when we left the action
we were at the Top Gear Restoration

384
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,860
Technical Centre, where we
decided to wrap our cars ourselves.

385
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,700
Because Hammond's car was
the smallest, he finished first.

386
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,530
The results of my labours.
Urban camo.

387
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,290
Or it might be Arctic urban camo.

388
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,050
Yeah, there's a rough edge here and
there, but for a first attempt

389
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,290
I think it's pretty crisp...

390
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,060
Behold the genius! What?

391
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,530
Hello. Mate, it's...

392
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,050
I haven't seen it in the light, it's
terrible! How brilliant is this?

393
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,090
What you're looking at here is
velvet. Why didn't you DRIVE it out?

394
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:27,170
Because I suspect James May,
as a cruel joke, has hidden my keys.

395
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,730
Actually, no. I suspect you've
effectively hidden your keys

396
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,010
because I suspect that's them there,
look.

397
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,530
You left them on the roof.

398
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,530
And while I'm here,
isn't there a sunroof on this car?

399
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,490
Yes, here. Well, you can't open it,
or this door.

400
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,890
Or in fact, this door.
Burglar-proof.

401
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,020
As Jeremy retrieved his keys,
James appeared.

402
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,300
He hasn't got the idea of wrapping,
has he? No.

403
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,610
Come on! It's a bit annual, mate.

404
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,850
That's exactly it. It's seasonal.
It is unequivocal, is what it is.

405
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,570
If you park that by the side
of the road,

406
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,770
and say to anyone,
"What's happened to that car?"

407
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,010
and they will say it,
"Oh, it's been wrapped."

408
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,770
Hang on, a text.

409
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,730
"Dear grandad..." Ooh!
Really? Thank you.

410
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,850
"Because 1980s hot hatchbacks
were so easy to steal,

411
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,770
"they were mostly used for doing
handbrake turns on housing estates

412
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,650
"and ram raiding Woolworths.

413
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,890
"So, to see which one of your
ridiculous cars..." Superb cars.

414
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,620
"..is best, you will have a game
of Supermarket Sweep."

415
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,290
The rules were simple.

416
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,530
The producers had laid out a course
around the aisles of a supermarket

417
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,700
and we had to see which of our cars
could get around it the fastest.

418
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,570
Right, James, you are going first.

419
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,970
Just so you know, there is a second
added to your time for every

420
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,330
Â£1 of damage that you do out there.

421
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,450
Right. OK? OK.

422
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,170
This is going to be like
living in the 1980s.

423
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,660
Three, two, one, go!

424
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,490
Obviously,
I am the intelligent one here

425
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,900
and the point of this is to not hit
anything, not to go around quickly.

426
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,660
He's neat. Isn't he?

427
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,290
A second is more easily saved
by not breaking something

428
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,770
than by driving into things.

429
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,380
Through the chicane...

430
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,580
Missing that, missing that,
missing everything.

431
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,860
Oh, his wheel got jammed up with...
spam! Spam!

432
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,060
Briskly around there...

433
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,980
And through to the finish.

434
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,700
How did I do? One minute and two,
but you did hit things, James.

435
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,250
After the value of the smashed
custard creams

436
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,410
and the splattered Spam
had been totted up,

437
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,810
I took my place on the start line.

438
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,380
Good.

439
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,180
Yes! Three, two, one, go!

440
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,420
That's a vigorous start.

441
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,300
Here we go!

442
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,420
And into the turn.

443
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,610
It's a bad crash! Oh, no!

444
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,210
That's a couple of seconds off
there. Yeah, I'd say so.

445
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,890
Things have gone literally...

446
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,580
I've hit the luxury toiletries!

447
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,410
And some bread.

448
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,540
Yes, I've just hit some... Oh.

449
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,660
Oh, no! I've got Rich Tea biscuits,
literally everywhere.

450
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,930
Oh, God above.

451
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,330
Well, it is a quick time now,
but it possibly won't be

452
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,860
once we've added on...
the destruction!

453
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,460
I've gone again.

454
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,780
In the plums!

455
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,740
He's on the finishing straight.

456
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,340
And...across the line!

457
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,210
It took a very long time
to work out Jeremy's score.

458
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,780
But eventually, it was my go.

459
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,130
Let's do this.

460
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,730
What do you think he's going to do?
Your style, or my style?

461
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,690
Well, if he's got any sense
he'll do mine,

462
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,170
but he hasn't got any sense
cos he's Hammond, so...

463
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,140
Go! Come on, little Nova,
here we go.

464
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,100
Oh, dear. Oh, that's...

465
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,660
Gee, that was enormous!

466
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,980
What manner of thing did he do?

467
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,740
Run away!

468
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,020
Here he comes.

469
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,900
And across the line!

470
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,500
Well, that's predictable. Oh, 1:04.

471
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,090
That completed
the supermarket challenge.

472
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,410
All we had to do now was help
Hammond right his car.

473
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,220
..Three... Maybe another one?

474
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,540
Come on!

475
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,050
The next morning, as we set off
to Wales for our next challenge,

476
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,660
all was not well in our convoy.

477
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,890
A packet of Coco Pops had severed
the fuel line in Hammond's Nova.

478
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,570
And one of the many crashes
had damaged Jeremy's Golf.

479
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,490
Oh, God, no, this steering...

480
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,220
There's something catastrophically
wrong. Look at it!

481
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,260
I can't... Oh!
Um, gentlemen, I may have to stop.

482
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,010
A couple of miles further on,

483
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,060
I found an empty airfield
where I could do some repairs.

484
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,850
Yes, the handling characteristics
were affected by a small accident

485
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,130
last night with some beef stew.

486
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,770
Oh, dear. I hit the bottom
of the wheel and it's gone in.
But you can solve it.

487
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,810
Yes, I've seen that done.
Most F1 teams do something similar(!)

488
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,690
Is your car working yet, Hammond?

489
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,770
I've got to put a new fuel pipe on,
it'll take me a second.

490
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,610
I've got one more jubilee clip to do
and it'll be done.

491
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,730
What? Text, which could mean
it is from the producers.

492
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,730
Ah, the results of Supermarket
Sweep are in. Oh, brilliant.

493
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,450
James - one minute and five seconds.
Three quid's worth of damage?

494
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,410
Three seconds added, three quid's
worth of damaged produce.

495
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,610
Richard. Yes?

496
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,610
Two minutes and 12 seconds.
That's 60-something quid's worth.

497
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,690
You got a minute and eight seconds,
yeah, you got Â£68 worth of damage.

498
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,810
Jeremy Clarkson. Yes?

499
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,690
28 minutes and six seconds.

500
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,220
Don't be stupid! Oh, you didn't
quite make the half hour!

501
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,410
It's rubbish, anyway, because in the
'80s I did not ram raid shops.

502
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,970
I had much better things to do
with my cars. What?

503
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,530
I can't tell you now. Why not?
The producers.

504
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,970
What? What I'm going to do, Hammond,
you can't do in front of

505
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,250
BBC health and safety people.

506
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,250
Eventually the producers went to get
something to eat

507
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,410
and with the cars mended,
I began my demonstration.

508
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,490
Right, this is called
Lap Of Your Own Car.

509
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,330
I'm going to climb out of
the window, over the roof,

510
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,090
through the passenger window

511
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,170
and back behind the wheel
before the car stops.

512
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,450
But you're the driver. Yes.

513
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,330
Right! Are we ready? I'm going to
pop it into neutral. Here we go.

514
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,170
Oh, my God. I think this is what
George Michael was trying to do.

515
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,370
Small steering input. I've got it.
Oh, my God. It doesn't really steer.

516
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,330
I'm out! He is out of the car.

517
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,930
I'm actually on the roof
of a moving vehicle.

518
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,330
I am doing a lap now.
Here he comes, ladies and gentlemen.

519
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,450
Here he is, coming in.

520
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,610
Tell you what, velvet's good,
you get better traction.

521
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Genuinely staggered. It worked! Yes!

522
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,940
This success sent us on
a journey down memory lane.

523
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,890
Yeah! Two silver trays underneath
the rear wheels, handbrake on,

524
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,460
the best game in the world.

525
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,530
Musical chairs, let it begin.

526
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,220
Right, you're now steering.

527
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,850
I'm in the driver's seat! Your hair!

528
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,850
Get off!

529
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,170
Your bottom is touching my sausage!

530
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,210
May, go back. Go, go, go!

531
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,690
The '80s were brilliant.

532
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,410
They were better.
Just much better. Music was better.

533
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,930
Everything was better. Oh, yeah.

534
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,610
We then rounded off our Don't Try
This At Home nostalgia trip

535
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,530
with a traditional drag race.

536
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,340
Three, two, one, go!

537
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,810
The mighty Golf GTi.
Come on, Nova. Come on, come on!

538
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,180
No, he's getting away!

539
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,460
What's... Oh!

540
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,090
A total victory.

541
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,090
What's happened to Hammond?

542
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,970
What had happened to Hammond
was not good.

543
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,410
Still there. Perhaps it's not
used to being the right way up.

544
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,170
It's fine. It's fine.

545
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,860
Oh, that's good as well. Fine.

546
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,690
You've knackered that.
You've totalled your Nova.

547
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,410
It's fine.

548
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,890
Hammond... No, what?! Hammond...

549
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,090
Would you like to tell
the ladies and gentlemen

550
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,890
what happened to your Nova?

551
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,290
It just blew up. Did it? Boom!

552
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,050
Or did you change into first
rather than third?

553
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,730
Well, I did do that a bit. Exactly.

554
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,450
Never mind that, because
the producers are very cross with us

555
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,650
about our little trip
down memory lane.

556
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,450
They say that it might make
young people copy us.

557
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,050
I don't see why,
it's not like they've ever copied
anything else we do, is it?

558
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,130
No, you never hear kids
in the barber's say,
"Can I have hair like James May's?"

559
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,170
It was a montage of stuff

560
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,130
that was acceptable in the '80s
that isn't acceptable now.

561
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,770
Like wearing white socks. Exactly.

562
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,570
Or saying to a female co-worker,
"You look nice today."

563
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,690
Exactly. You can't do that any more.

564
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,730
Anyway, we must move on,
because I want to talk about

565
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,370
one of the most evocative words
in motoring.

566
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,690
Bonneville. Team it with "Triumph",
it's a legendary motorcycle.

567
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,850
Team it with "salt flats", it's
a shrine to the pursuit of speed.

568
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,250
Team it with "Hugh" and it's...
neither of those things.

569
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,290
But it is tonight's
Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.

570
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,970
From Downton Abbey, his favourite
TV show, Hugh Bonneville!

571
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,290
Hello! How are you?

572
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,690
He's here!

573
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,540
He's here. Have a seat. Thank you.

574
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,250
Richard Hammond is beside himself
with excitement.

575
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,250
Downton, he's obsessed.

576
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,130
I want to begin, if I may, talking
about your early life, early cars.

577
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,130
Despite your legendary name,
it doesn't seem like

578
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,490
you come from a family of
speed freaks.

579
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,290
No, the Bonneville salt flats
don't feature in my pedigree.

580
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,370
We were a family of Volvos,
when I was growing up.

581
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,290
Starting with a 121, a roundy shape,
number plate NUV665E.

582
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,650
For some reason,
I can remember that number plate,

583
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,250
but I can't remember my own now.

584
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,330
That's a weird thing. I was talking
to James about this the other day.

585
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,490
We can remember the number plates
of our fathers' cars.

586
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,850
JWY370J, DW510H
on the Cortina 1600E.

587
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,330
FYR495J on the Volvo 124.

588
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:56,130
So you can remember all your dad's
Volvos? Yeah, it's tragic, really.

589
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,050
They were 1 Series Volvos,
so very early ones.

590
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,210
The weird thing about
the first one, the NUV665E,

591
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,410
was that my dad
regretted selling it,

592
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,570
and he was at a zebra crossing
near where we lived in Blackheath

593
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,650
and suddenly he spotted it
about five years later

594
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,250
and flagged down the driver and said,

595
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,090
"If ever you want to sell it, it was
the biggest mistake of my life."

596
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,650
Later, the bloke got in touch

597
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,130
and it was in the family
for the next ten years.

598
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,290
On the subject of family,
why did you try to bury your sister

599
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,730
when she was still
perfectly healthy?

600
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,930
I can't believe you've asked me that
question. That's quite embarrassing.

601
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,170
Well, she'd been quite annoying.

602
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,130
I was about eight and she was 16,
I think.

603
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,770
I complained to Mum,

604
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,530
and she was cooking supper and said,
"Yes, that must be annoying."

605
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,170
I said, "I'm going to kill her,
but first I'm going to dig a grave."

606
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,370
And she said, "Yes, dear,
dinner will be in half an hour."

607
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,250
I got a shovel
and I started digging,

608
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,810
I measured it out,
six foot long and that wide...

609
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,930
I got about three inches

610
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,010
and the weird thing was,
Magpie were filming in our street.

611
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,010
They were doing a programme
about rag-and-bone men.

612
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,010
My mum ran out to say,
"We've got an old tin bath,"

613
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,370
so they said, "Can we film coming
round the back of the house?"

614
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,860
to where the tin bath was, and
the cameraman fell in the grave!

615
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,730
I hasten to add, I love my sister.

616
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,970
Yeah! Tried to kill her.

617
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,770
I once tried to kill my sister
when she put a drawing pin

618
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,290
through my space hopper.

619
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,220
Ooh!
Bitch!

620
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,100
You heard that, Joanna. Lord
Grantham just called you a bitch.

621
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,650
Did you have a flirtation
with Triumphs as a family?

622
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,610
I always coveted my aunt's
Triumph Stag,

623
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,410
which was a beautiful car,
and the selfish cow sold it

624
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,090
rather than give it to me
for free.

625
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,930
A Stag. You'd suit a Stag. A Stag.

626
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,650
You don't actually drive
a two-seater sports car

627
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,050
from what I understand?

628
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,410
No, I don't. I currently have
an XC90, a Volvo XC90. A fine car.

629
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,370
I bought it off a friend ten years
ago and it has served us very well.

630
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,810
But going to go to an Audi Q5.

631
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,690
Is that really Snoozeville?

632
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,250
That's like forsaking all food

633
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,010
and saying, "I'm going to live
for the rest of my life

634
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,970
"on nothing but wallpaper paste."

635
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,010
It's an appalling... Jeremy! What?

636
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,010
Stop talking to him about cars.

637
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:34,010
Hammond... Never, you're always
having a cup of tea.

638
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,090
What? Stop talking to him
about cars. Why?

639
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,090
Because he's from Downton Abbey.

640
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,500
He's Lord Grantham, over there.
I know! He's looking at me!

641
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,570
Ask him my question. What question?
Who's Lady Mary going to marry?

642
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,450
Which one? Who is Lady Mary
going to marry?

643
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,290
I have no idea. I'm sorry,
Richard, I don't know.

644
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,570
Of course he knows!
He's Lord Grantham!

645
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,850
Hammond, he's not here
to talk about Downton,

646
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,690
you're here to talk about
your new film.

647
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,860
Exactly. Go away! Back in your box!
Go away!

648
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,330
Anyway, the new film,
The Monuments Men, what is it about?

649
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,970
It is based on the true story of
these rather unsung heroes

650
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,770
of the Second World War, who were
art historians and museum curators

651
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,410
who were sent in after D-day,
largely, to try and locate the art

652
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,490
and treasures that the Nazis
were spiriting away,

653
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,170
and also to persuade the Allies not
to blow up that particular church

654
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,690
because there are Germans in it,

655
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,770
because it does contain
part of our culture.

656
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,450
Really? And that's a true story?
It's based on a true story.

657
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,050
We've got a clip. Ooh!
I've not seen anything of it.

658
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,930
Well, you can have a look at
yourself on telly. Look, here we go.

659
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,410
And finally, we have your sculptor,
Sergeant Walter Garfield.

660
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,970
He's a good egg.
I worked with him on the World War I
memorial in St Louis.

661
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,290
A-ha! St Louis...

662
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,570
How are you, old boy?
Hey, Walter, how they treating you?

663
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,290
Taking it pretty easy on us.

664
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,690
I think that they feel sorry
for us old guys.

665
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,970
I don't much fancy
an obstacle course. It's not so bad.

666
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,930
By the end, you're just crawling
on your belly

667
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,930
while teenagers
shoot blanks over your head.

668
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,210
Well, yes and no. How's that?

669
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,700
Yes, they are teenagers. And no?
They're not blanks.

670
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,810
Looks like my sort of film.
That is my sort of film.

671
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,290
Now, George Clooney.
He directed it as well, didn't he?

672
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,730
George directed it, he stars in it,
he produced it and he co-wrote it.

673
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,450
I've been wondering, looking at
what you're doing at the moment,

674
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,450
is how on earth
you are fitting it in,

675
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,330
because you're also working on W1A.

676
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,650
Yes, W1A is a spin-off of
a show I did called Twenty Twelve.

677
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,010
Which was fabulous. Thank you
very much. I properly loved that.

678
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,530
It was a mockumentary about
trying to organise the Olympics.

679
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,770
Obviously, my character made such a
success of organising the Olympics,

680
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,690
I'm the go-to man
to sort out corporate issues.

681
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,490
So what better place than
to go into the BBC?

682
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,250
When I heard that
this was happening,

683
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,690
and I can see all the location signs
around the BBC buildings

684
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,850
where you are filming it,
I was thinking,

685
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,170
how do you make fiction
about BBC management

686
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,660
funnier than what actually happens?

687
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,810
Broadcasting House, the new big
building on Regent Street,

688
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,370
Portland Place,
you're not allowed in there

689
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,370
even if you're BBC staff unless
you've been on a half-hour

690
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,970
health and safety course on
how to operate the building.

691
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,410
I started the course.

692
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,130
A lady with an eight-page document
arrived to talk me through it.

693
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,290
Page one was a picture of
a fire alarm, red fire alarm box.

694
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,090
It said, "This is a fire alarm."

695
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,090
Page two, a graphic of a green sign
with a man running like this

696
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,890
with the word "exit".
"That's an emergency exit."

697
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,930
At that point, I was taken off
to do some filming.

698
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,290
I still haven't...
You haven't completed the course?

699
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,410
I still haven't. I still have to be
escorted around Broadcasting House

700
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,810
in case I'm confused
by a light fitting!

701
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,330
Or something of that nature.
It is stupid.

702
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,850
I'm longing to see something
that satirises it,

703
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,050
but again, how are you doing it?
You must be the world's busiest man.

704
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,970
Presumably you drove very quickly
around the lap,

705
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,690
so you could get home more quickly?

706
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,930
No, I'm not a speed merchant.

707
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,370
At the beginning,
when The Stig took me around,

708
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,970
I was really terrified,
being in the passenger seat,

709
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,210
and I thought,
"I'll never be able to do this."

710
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,890
By the end,
as your guys will tell you,

711
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,250
I refused to get out, I wanted
to go again and again.

712
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,170
Who here would like to see the lap?

713
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,090
Yes!

714
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,020
Play the tape, let's have a look.

715
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,330
The car, fresh after its long rest.

716
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,660
Come on, son!

717
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,250
Look at the lines, streaming down.

718
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,330
That is wet, really is pouring down,
and that's odd for England(!)

719
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,930
If you're watching abroad,
it's never normally like that here.

720
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,970
Where's the white line? Oh, there.

721
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,730
You may laugh, but it is
quite tricky to see the line

722
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,090
when the track is soaking wet.

723
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,580
It's really steamy.

724
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,780
Hmm?

725
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,810
You need to get that sort of thing
sorted out before you set off.

726
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,050
Even though the lines are invisible
from behind the wheel,

727
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,970
you've done a pretty good job.
That's not bad.

728
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,420
Woohoo! Perfectly judged.

729
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,300
Must remember to get some milk.

730
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,330
Worse than Kimi Raikkonen
for not paying attention,

731
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,500
but no worries through there at all.

732
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,410
Tyres, speedy, moving them
about nicely.

733
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,290
Oh, that is quick!

734
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,530
On the wrong side of the road there,
but never mind.

735
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,730
It's nicely done,
and you haven't gone off
on the second to last corner.

736
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,170
Gambon, a bit of understeer.
That car grips well.

737
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,890
And there we are. Across the line!

738
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,100
Now, ha-ha!

739
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,010
Just realised that's the first ever
wet lap we've had in that car.

740
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,730
Nobody else has driven around
in the rain.

741
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,490
Bearing that in mind,
where do you think you've come?

742
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:24,330
Well, I suspect...between
Ron Howard and Steven Tyler,

743
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,850
bearing in mind it's wet.

744
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,370
Somewhere between 1.50 and 1.51
is what you think you've done.

745
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,940
Well, you did it in...

746
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,050
1.50.1.

747
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,610
Which means you're the first guest
ever to guess correctly...

748
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,340
Wait, wait, wait!

749
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,010
You just put Steven Tyler...
I'll cross it out, wrong.

750
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,420
A very professional show.
There, look, correct!

751
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,850
To be brutally honest with you,
The Stig did say

752
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,370
that you have a natural talent

753
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,290
and if it had been dry you would
have been very close to the top.

754
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,530
Well, that's an accolade then. It is.

755
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,290
I'll go away happy, thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much, Hugh Bonneville!

756
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,610
Thank you.

757
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,450
Right, tonight the boys and girls
who produce Top Gear

758
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,610
are on a mission to prove that
the hot hatchbacks of our era

759
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,450
were rubbish. Yeah.
Things are not going well for me,

760
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,770
cos I've slightly damaged
the engine... Ruined.

761
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,090
Slightly damaged. Whatever... Damaged
the engine in my Nova and it's

762
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,890
on the back of a tow truck.
But despite this we had been told

763
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,650
to report to somewhere
we couldn't pronounce...

764
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,060
in Wales.

765
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,740
Having crossed the Severn Estuary
we soon arrived at the location.

766
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,650
Trefniadaeth Seilwaith Amddiffyn

767
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,410
Man Hyfforddi Caerwent.

768
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,890
And here on this huge, abandoned
army base crisscrossed

769
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,930
with more than 30 miles
of deserted roads,

770
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,370
we received the details
of our challenge.

771
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,050
Oh, hello. Why is it an envelope
and not a text this time?

772
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,810
That's a good point.
We're in Wales - no signal.

773
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,650
Ahh! Yeah!
We're back to the old ways.

774
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,210
Come on then, what is it?

775
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,930
"Because the drivers of '80s
hatchbacks were irresponsible

776
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,450
"and stupid they were often chased
by the 50."

777
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,610
Er, James, it means the 5-0,
as in Hawaii 5-0, it's the police.

778
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,570
Yeah, whatever.
Well, anyway. The 50!

779
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,050
Anyway...
"You will now go head-to-head with

780
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,210
"the Top Gear Police Department.
Each of you will take it in turns

781
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,050
"to drive your own car
while the other two will use

782
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,770
"a selection of police vehicles
to try and stop you."

783
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,130
That sounds quite good.
It does sound good.

784
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,410
Tell you what, Hammond,
you go first.

785
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,050
Erm, good, yes.

786
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,820
I might need a minute.

787
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,650
While Hammond mended his car,

788
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,130
James and I broke out
the TGPD pursuit vehicles

789
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,540
and slipped into
our police uniforms.

790
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,890
OK, Hammond, are you ready?

791
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,690
Yes, I am. This is going to be good.
In 3, 2, 1...

792
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,530
start the clock.

793
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,090
We are off.

794
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,290
Yep, it's just warming up.

795
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,930
Here we go...

796
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,130
Ha-ha!

797
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,610
Excuse me, sir, my moustache
would like a word with you,

798
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,610
if you'd like to step out of the
vehicle. You're nicked, sunshine.

799
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,890
What did I do? How long?
Eight seconds.

800
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,530
Do you know, another fault...

801
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,970
Did it? Very similar. Did it?

802
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,610
It manifested itself similarly to
the last one that one I repaired.

803
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,690
Tell that to the judge...
Yes...sunshine. Right.

804
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,570
Jeremy then put on the yobbo outfit

805
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,490
and lined up his velvet Golf
on the start line.

806
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,850
3, 2, 1...begin...

807
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,420
And there we are, eight seconds.
I've already beaten Hammond.

808
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,940
He's getting away, constable!

809
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,860
Yes. Live with this...!

810
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,810
You see, what we're learning
straight away is that

811
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:41,340
a modern police Astra is no match
for a 1980s hot hatchback.

812
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,610
And it wasn't just the Astras
that were causing problems.

813
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,090
Recent figures say that in London

814
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,050
12 police cars
are crashed every day.

815
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,730
And the reason is, it's because
they are driving in high-energy

816
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,140
difficult situations while under
the influence of the moustache.

817
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,050
Got a moustache, got a moustache,
got a moustache.

818
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,060
Oh, he's lost it!

819
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,860
Totally distracted
by his face decoration.

820
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,930
MUSIC: "Miami Vice Theme"
by Jan Hammer

821
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,410
With the Astras
unable to close the gap...

822
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,900
Come on!

823
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,660
..the chase went on...

824
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,770
..and on...

825
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,460
and on...

826
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,010
The next morning, the weather
had become extremely Welsh.

827
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,340
But still, the Golf was uncaught.

828
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,330
This isn't working, sir.

829
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,770
No, I agree, I think
we're going to have to break out

830
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,460
the Top Gear Police Department
magnetron of justice.

831
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,660
If anything could stop
the miscreant, it was this.

832
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,900
A giant crane with a seven-kilowatt
magnet suspended from its arm.

833
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,420
A machine that could render
any vehicle immobile in moments.

834
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,660
Right, let's go get him.

835
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,220
Soon, the trap was set.

836
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,330
Mmm, what's this...?

837
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,690
Arming magnet.

838
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,020
Here he comes...

839
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,930
Blithering idiots. Do they not
realise you can't use a magnet

840
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,660
to pick up velvet?

841
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,490
There was only one thing for it -

842
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,460
unleash the TGPD
remote-controlled car of death.

843
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,460
Target vehicle identified
and located.

844
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,940
Where the hell are they?

845
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,570
How can this be a police chase when
they aren't chasing me any more?

846
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,290
Target acquired...

847
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,050
Sir, you might want to
put your fingers in your ears.

848
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,210
I don't know where those two are
or what they're plotting

849
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,490
but it won't work.

850
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,810
This car is simply...

851
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,900
invincib...

852
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,610
Bigger than I was expecting,
constable.

853
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,180
Yes, sir, it was, sir.

854
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:17,530
So, it turns out that velvet
is impervious to magnets,

855
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,260
but it IS pervious to dynamite.

856
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,450
Nevertheless, I felt confident
that James would not be able

857
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,650
to beat my evasion time
of 14 hours and 22 minutes.

858
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,210
In...3, 2, 1...

859
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,820
start the clock.

860
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,490
However, as he set off it
became clear he'd come up

861
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,140
with an unusual plan...

862
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,380
What is he doing?

863
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,890
Now, the thing is, viewers, whenever
you watch Police Camera Action

864
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,690
or see a real police chase, the
person trying to get away is always

865
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,290
going ludicrously fast,
but, actually, what's the point?

866
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,170
You'd just panic
and have an accident

867
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,010
and that's the end of that,

868
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,330
but if you just do normal speed,

869
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,500
they still can't get you
out of the car, can they?

870
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,610
Keen to prove him wrong,

871
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,010
I initiated the TGPD
anti-terrorism move.

872
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,620
Here we go.

873
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,140
Pushing, pushing.

874
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,140
Got him.

875
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,900
He's just driven off!

876
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,210
'As the hours crawled by,
we tried many things.'

877
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,180
Stop him, Constable!

878
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,250
How's that going to help?

879
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,770
I've fallen off the bonnet!

880
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,490
What are you going to do
if the doors are locked?

881
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,380
You can't pull a man
out of a car.

882
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,060
This is an arrest.

883
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,330
'Happily, though, after many hours of
tedious pursuit...'

884
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,690
Weaving, weaving...

885
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:11,450
'..James finally made a mistake.'
Oh, crikey, this is a dead end.

886
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,530
Yes, his sense of direction
has let him down. A-ha!

887
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,410
In we go, yes.

888
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,650
Bollocks!

889
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,060
We've got him! We finally have him.

890
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,860
We don't have him,
he's closed my door.

891
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,410
He's done it again.

892
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:35,690
And now look.
I've damaged a police car.

893
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:40,410
'This meant I was now delayed
with police paperwork.'

894
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,610
"I were in pursuit of a pleb...

895
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,250
"IC1, male.

896
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:55,820
"He did crash into me at speed."

897
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,260
I'm going to get that bastard!

898
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,610
While Jeremy had been
finessing his statement, I decided

899
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:16,250
it was time to skewer May
with the TGPD prongs of doom.

900
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,770
It's a heavy, high-mobility
engineer excavator,

901
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,420
built by JCB for the military.

902
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,850
It weighs 13.5 tonnes, but it's got
a 6.7 litre straight-six turbo-diesel

903
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,180
and it can do 63mph.

904
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,650
James May, you've had it!

905
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,660
Wherever you are.

906
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:54,540
'James had vanished. But we had
just the thing to find him again.'

907
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:03,060
The time has come, I think,
to deploy the Top Gear Police
Department drone of intrusiveness.

908
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,991
'With its military-spec
nose-mounted reconnaissance

909
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:12,770
camera, it would track
down May in a heartbeat.'

910
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,380
Here we go.

911
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,180
The drone of intrusiveness
has crashed.

912
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,780
'Eventually I got the drone airborne
and begun the hunt for OJ May.'

913
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,770
Wait a minute.

914
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,580
You sneaky little...

915
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,530
James was hiding
in an abandoned garage bay,

916
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,250
but if he thought he was safe there,

917
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,620
he had another think coming.

918
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,970
Welcome, everyone,
to the Top Gear Police Department

919
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,300
eaty thing of devastation.

920
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,690
This was designed primarily
for mine clearance, but in the TGPD,

921
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:13,540
we use it in
a rather different way.

922
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,850
There is Constable Hammond.

923
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,340
The enemy, behind that wall,
no idea what is coming.

924
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,970
Engaging flails!

925
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,860
Flails engaged!

926
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,340
I'm not sure he should be
operating that thing.

927
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,580
Yes, look at that!

928
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,730
He's not where...

929
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,380
What he isn't, sir, is there.

930
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,970
Situation update:
in three minutes' time,

931
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,820
I will have beaten Jeremy's record
on the run at a reasonable speed.

932
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,100
But the TGPD toy box
wasn't empty yet.

933
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,340
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

934
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,210
Hello, it looks like
Constable Hammond

935
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,850
has got the hang of tank driving.

936
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,980
The first thing you need to know is,
I have an erection!

937
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,970
Coming at you, James May!

938
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,450
Oh, no, the Top Gear Police
Department tank of righteousness
is right on my tail.

939
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,450
What am I going to do?

940
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,660
I know.

941
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,770
Easy.

942
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,340
Right!

943
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,140
Oh, hang on a minute.

944
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,690
He's stopped, he's given up!

945
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,980
And on that bombshell...
back to the studio.

946
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,850
It's interesting, an important
question was raised in that film.

947
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,090
Because if you have a moustache,
how do you concentrate

948
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,610
on doing anything other than
having a moustache?

949
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:14,290
I know, I felt like I was the
life-support machine for a moustache.

950
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,090
If you're a bomb disposal man,
and you have to defuse a bomb,

951
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,690
you are thinking,
"I have a moustache."

952
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,970
How did Nigel Mansell win a Formula
One world championship? I know!

953
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,970
You don't have a moustache, sir,

954
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,770
but let me show you
what it's like to have one.

955
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:35,370
It's like that. What do you do
for a living? Transport manager.

956
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,250
You couldn't be a transport manager
if I was doing that to you.

957
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,250
Anyway, we must get on
because I have received a text -

958
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,730
the results of
the car evasion challenge.

959
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,930
Jeremy Clarkson, 14 hours
22 minutes. Richard Hammock...

960
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,690
Autocorrect again?

961
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,330
Yes. Eight seconds. Thank you.

962
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,090
James May, 14 hours, 21 minutes.

963
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,570
Oh, blast! There you are.

964
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,370
Hang on, so the Fiesta
won the supermarket sweep,

965
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,450
the Golf won the police chase

966
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,570
and the Nova won the hill climb.

967
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,290
That means that each of the cars
is a winner. Precisely.

968
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,210
Which means that the older
hot hatchback

969
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,370
is better than the modern one.

970
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,130
Which means we were right, and on
that bombshell, it's time to end.

971
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,930
Thank you very much for watching.
Good night!
