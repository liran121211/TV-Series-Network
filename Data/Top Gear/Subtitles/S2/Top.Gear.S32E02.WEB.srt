1
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,399
Hello, welcome to Top Gear,

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,999
where tonight, things are
a bit out of the ordinary,

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,719
because I can't help but notice
little Chrissy Harris

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,959
has a certain spring in his step.
Look at him.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,919
He does. I'd say he's even
looking a little bit...jaunty.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,719
He is! He's perky.
He's cock-a-hoop.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,079
What's the news, Christopher?

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,399
Two-for-one at Harrods?
No, even better than that.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,799
Go on. Let us into the secret.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,919
Tonight's the show when I get
to put Fred in a tiny plastic car

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,239
and push him off the side
of a mountain.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,679
Oh. Glad we can make you
happy, finally.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,319
Anyway, that's all coming up later.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,559
But we kick off tonight by
talking about TV cop shows.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,799
Love a police procedural, Pad.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,479
We do. Specifically, we're talking
about that noble tradition

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,199
of TV cop cars.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,599
Because there was once a time,
back in the day,

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
when Luther was in short pants

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,399
and everyone thought H in
Line Of Duty was in Steps,

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,839
when telly police cars were
legends in their own right.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,160
Cop a look at this.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
We got company, all right.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,199
Slip on the leather jacket and
the aviator shades.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,920
It's time to rewind to
the TV cop show golden age.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,559
A time when screen coppers
played by their own rules...

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,759
Get your trousers on -
you're nicked.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,359
..and drove proper cars.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,199
Cars that were as famous

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
as the actors behind the wheel.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,359
But to really show how special
they were,

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,279
we've been given the chance to
have a little nosey round

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,319
some of the all-time greats.

35
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,400
Ah, now...we're starting off
with an absolute peach.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,999
As we call it in Bolton,
Mammie Vice.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,839
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,839
Crockett and Tubbs. Yes!

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,439
Ferrari Testarossa.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,959
Let's get it out of the way now -
you're going to call me Tubbs.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,959
No, no, no, no.
Don't be like that, Chris.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,719
Hey, but I'll tell you what,
we've missed a trick, though.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,839
Edit this in - Tubbs. Tubbs.

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,359
THEY LAUGH

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,279
Can I give you a fun fact on this?
Go on.

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,039
The first two series used a Daytona
on a Corvette chassis.

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,799
And Enzo Ferrari didn't like that.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
He sent them two Testarossas.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,440
That's a really, really lovely car.

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,919
This sounds ridiculous,
but in what world do you walk past

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,800
a Testarossa, see a Capri, and go,
"I'd rather have that"?

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,879
Bodie and Doyle,
they were heroes, weren't they?

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,479
When you played Professionals
at school, who were you?

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,719
Bodie. I were Bodie. Yeah.

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,119
Didn't want to be Doyle,
with the whole curly hair

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,039
and all that deep thinking.

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,159
You want to be Bodie,
booting down the doors.

58
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,879
You're going to hate me here.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,159
I know the names,
and I've heard of it...

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,079
Hang on a minute. No!

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,679
You've never seen The Professionals?

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,639
I know what it is!
I've heard of it.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,959
You call yourself British?!

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,439
Are you aware of the fact
we have a Queen in this country?

65
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,279
Well, yeah, she gave me an MBE.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,799
Oh, I love that. Oh, I like that!
Thanks for popping in, Chris.

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,279
Next car. Thank you.

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,319
Look, the small-screen heroes
just go on and on.

69
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,159
These cars were actually
characters in their shows.

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,399
Exactly. They were as important
as the cops themselves.

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,759
Take Simon Templar's super-sleek,
but brilliantly understated

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,960
Volvo P1800 in The Saint.

73
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,439
This is the most beautiful Volvo
I think I've ever seen. Gorgeous.

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,039
Or...the low-key but very punchy

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth
in Spender.

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,999
I've got to say, I could see
Jimmy Nail driving this now.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,559
And how about DCI Gene Hunt's
Audi Quattro -

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,839
that brilliant '80s throwback
in Ashes To Ashes?

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,479
Totally iconic car.

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,639
Independent of the programme -
an amazing vehicle.

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,519
And, of course, there was
Dempsey And Makepeace -

82
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,639
starring the Mercedes 500 SL,

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,440
beautifully cast against
Ford's Escort XR3i Cabriolet.

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,359
This was a brilliant piece
of product placement.

85
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,519
People went out and
bought them in their droves.

86
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,319
And again, it was a personality
on the show.

87
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,079
For me, though, the absolute best
of the classic cop-car crop

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,320
could only be this little beauty.

89
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,279
HE LAUGHS

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,240
Starsky & Hutch's iconic
Ford Gran Torino!

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,519
What a show Starsky & Hutch was.

92
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
I absolutely loved it.

93
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,239
A couple of undercover cops
driving around

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,079
the mean streets of Bay City,

95
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,320
in, let's be honest,
the least undercover cop car ever.

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,719
First shown in 1975,
Starsky & Hutch was a global hit.

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,359
And the California detectives'
antics behind the wheel

98
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,560
made the Gran Torino one of
the most famous cars in TV history.

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,199
But the truth is,
underneath the stripes,

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,839
the big old Ford didn't have
a whole lot to shout about.

101
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,399
The Gran Torinos from
that era of American cars,

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,559
where they had absolutely
massive engines...

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,599
..but not much performance.

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,199
So, the show's mechanics had
a tinker about with the gear ratio

105
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,039
and made the car quicker
off the line -

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,519
but it wouldn't go above 50mph.

107
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,199
And if it went above 50mph,

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
the engine'd blow up.

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,119
Not very good for catching bad guys.

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,639
Hey, this is one quick car!

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,439
Yeah, it's fast.
No, not fast - quick.

112
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,920
There's a difference.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,559
And it's not exactly
what you'd call agile.

114
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,199
TYRES SCREECH
Whoa!

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,999
It corners like a house
on a skateboard!

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,679
And the braking, well...
it's pretty much nonexistent.

117
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,199
In we go.
TYRES SCREECH

118
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,479
Ohh!

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,240
It's so wallowy!

120
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,999
There we go.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,480
How very...McGuinness.

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,560
How cool is that!

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,159
My ultimate, on the other hand,

124
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,880
is far more...cultured.

125
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,959
This might sound ridiculous,

126
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,039
but in a world where I've been
so lucky and privileged to drive

127
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,279
so many expensive, glamorous cars,

128
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,799
that an old Mark 2 Jag
should be so...erm...

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,799
..emotional.

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,760
But this is Inspector Morse's car -
the actual one.

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,440
And that's my favourite
TV programme of all time.

132
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,119
Inspector Morse arrived in 1987,

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
and soon became a household name -

134
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,719
the story of a grumpy,
erudite Oxfordshire detective

135
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,480
always at the wheel of
an old 1960s Jag.

136
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,879
An old Jag that, once upon a time,

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,440
had a reputation for grace
and sophistication.

138
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,639
But by the 1980s,
when Morse arrived, well,

139
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,799
it had a different image, let's say.

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,320
It was a bit more bank robber
than stately home.

141
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,199
But it all fitted
with Morse's character -

142
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,359
the curmudgeon intellect
who loved real ale,

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,839
loved intellectual discussion,
loved crosswords,

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,479
disliked...pleasantries.

145
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Come on! Come on. Weekend drivers!

146
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,359
And if a great police car in
a TV show says something about

147
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,399
the driver or that character
that almost no lines could,

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,640
then I think this is
the cleverest of the lot.

149
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,719
And the best part -

150
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,239
this genius piece of casting
didn't come from some big-money

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
product-placement deal with Jaguar.

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,359
The producers found the Mark 2
in a scrapyard, complete with

153
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,680
its after-market vinyl roof.

154
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,479
I'll tell you what,
it drives beautifully.

155
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,999
Such a gorgeous shape.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,919
And inside, this big, thin-rimmed
steering wheel - Bakelite -

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,599
moving around in my hands,
I can really feel what's going on.

158
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,759
The gearbox - accurate.

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
It's a little peachy gearbox.

160
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,639
This is the baby 2.4-litre,
120 horsepower.

161
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,679
It does 100mph flat out,

162
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,239
0-60, over 14 seconds.

163
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,520
But who cares when you're
driving Morse's car?

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,799
Not me.

165
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,719
Because now the support acts
are out of the way,

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,600
it's time to introduce
a proper star.

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Magnum PI's Ferrari 308 GTS.

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,679
Oh, pass me a flowery shirt,

169
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,879
stick an hamster on me top lip,

170
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,760
and I'm ready to solve
some crime in Hawaii!

171
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,279
Now, all right, Magnum wasn't
technically a cop -

172
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,239
he was a private investigator.

173
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,320
But come on - when catching bad guys
looks this good, who cares?

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,519
Imagine you've got the
run of Hawaii,

175
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,839
you've got a revvy V8 behind you,

176
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,759
a manual gearbox, rear-wheel drive.

177
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,279
ENGINE ROARS

178
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,720
Oh, it looks great -
but it sounds great, too.

179
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,120
Ohh!

180
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,279
It's mad to think it now,

181
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,679
but Magnum wasn't originally
meant to drive the 308.

182
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,880
He was meant to drive
a Porsche 928.

183
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,039
To make the most of
the Hawaiian weather, though,

184
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,799
the producers wanted an
open-top version.

185
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,039
And when Porsche refused
to build 'em one,

186
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,080
the 308 was the obvious choice.

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,959
But Tom Selleck, he's a big lad.

188
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,319
Same height as me -
couldn't fit in it.

189
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,879
Ferrari said, "We're not bothered.

190
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,879
"We'll chop and weld it.
We'll make it bigger.

191
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,319
"We'll get him in it."

192
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,040
So, Magnum was upgraded to
an Italian Stallion.

193
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,639
It is a squeeze in here, though.

194
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,799
I've got the seat all the way
back. I'm nearly lying down.

195
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,479
I can barely get into fourth gear
because me leg's in t'way.

196
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,359
I'm in me stockinged feet.

197
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,759
I had me size-12s on,

198
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,359
but I was pressing all the pedals
at the same time.

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,480
There's about that much
room between 'em.

200
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,519
But I've got to say,
it doesn't matter.

201
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,839
ENGINE ROARS

202
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,879
He was living the dream, Magnum.
He was living it.

203
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,280
Listen to that!

204
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,359
Who's this flash Harry?

205
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,800
Is that Magnum PI, I spy?

206
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm hunting him down!

207
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,119
SIREN WAILS

208
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, no, I'm getting chased!

209
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,720
Let's get that Ferrari!

210
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,799
He really does think he's Starsky.

211
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,919
I've got to admit, though,
I'm getting into the Magnum vibes.

212
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm thinking of growing a tash.

213
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,799
Oh, he span out! You span out!

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,480
BOTH LAUGH

215
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
All right, Morse, here I come.

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,359
Oh, God.

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,520
You can't get away from
Starsky and Hutch, Morse!

218
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,239
There am I,
imagining Oxfordshire, dons,

219
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,960
clever-thinking crosswords...

220
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,079
McGuinness comes at me
in that thing. What a clown.

221
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,800
HE LAUGHS

222
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Oh, it's so much fun!

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,799
Do you know what's great
about this, lads?

224
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,079
You'd never get these
three cars together.

225
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,799
We've got the best of the
'60s, '70s and '80s right here.

226
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,999
Proper iconic cop cars.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,079
These are pure class.
Look at them - pure class.

228
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,519
Yeah, but if you look
at cop cars now, Paddy,

229
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,999
they don't have the character
like these, do they?

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,239
No. No, they don't.

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
If I see a bent copper,
I only know one way -

232
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
and that's full throttle.

233
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,919
This is what cop shows
look like these days.

234
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,279
It's all gritty realism and accurate
representations of modern policing.

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,719
Yeah, they're great dramas.

236
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,799
I've got some painkillers
in the car. I'll just...

237
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,239
No, don't move. I'll get them.

238
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,239
But when one of your leads
is swanning around in a nice,

239
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,199
comfy Volvo because of his bad back,

240
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,759
we can't help but see a bit of
a missed opportunity.

241
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to introduce

242
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,840
our nominees for a new era
of TV cop-car stars.

243
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,719
HE LAUGHS

244
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,919
ENGINE ROARS

245
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,639
That's my theme tune right here!

246
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Listen to it!

247
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,279
The Dodge Charger SRT
Hellcat Widebody.

248
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,159
Thanks to a supercharged
6.2-litre V8,

249
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,640
this is a 500-brake horsepower
four-door.

250
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,799
So, plenty of room in the back
for a couple of punks,

251
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,600
in a car that'll hit 60mph
in 3.5 seconds.

252
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,640
And it won't give up the chase
until it hits 196mph.

253
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,919
And I love the way it looks.

254
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,559
It's so mean. It's intimidating.

255
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,719
This is a car driven by a cop
you know that can't be messed with -

256
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
in between his trips to
the petrol station.

257
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,879
And when I said this big old
slice of American muscle

258
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,239
has 500 horsepower, it does -

259
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,679
when you use the regular black key.

260
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,319
But when you buy
a Charger Hellcat,

261
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,879
you also get given a red key.

262
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,519
And the red key gives you
700 horsepower.

263
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,399
You've heard of
"Good Cop, Bad Cop"?

264
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,799
This is Psychotic Cop.

265
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,439
ENGINE ROARS
Whooooa!

266
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,399
Still so very...McGuinness.

267
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,400
What the modern TV cop really needs
is a precision instrument.

268
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,079
Introducing the very yellow
Audi RS3.

269
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,360
HE LAUGHS

270
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,799
If telly cop shows have taught us
anything over the years,

271
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,359
it's that to catch the bad guys,

272
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,800
you've got to think like a bad guy.

273
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,919
And bad guys making a getaway
don't just need to be quick -

274
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,800
they need to be nimble, agile.

275
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,999
So, I've thought like a bad guy,

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,319
and I've chosen the ultimate
modern hot hatch.

277
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,159
It's compact. It's grippy.

278
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,800
It's seriously quick.

279
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,879
And I'm thinking heritage here,

280
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,039
because this is basically
the modern version of

281
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,319
the Life On Mars Audi Quattro.

282
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,279
Like the old Quattro,
it's got a five-cylinder

283
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,879
turbo-charged engine up front,

284
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,879
this time with 400 horsepower,

285
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,080
and it's got Audi's legendary
Quattro four-wheel-drive system.

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,359
If you're chasing mobsters
around mean city streets,

287
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,960
this is what you need.

288
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
It's quick!

289
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,320
Quick on a road, maybe.

290
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,640
But I reckon the modern telly cop
should be quick everywhere.

291
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,960
Whoa! Get in!

292
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,719
The Ford F-150 Raptor.

293
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,480
The truck that'll stop at nothing
to dish out justice.

294
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,279
Yeah, this is the world's
best-selling pick-up

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
made tougher and faster.

296
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,959
The V6 engine is based on
the one in Ford's GT supercar,

297
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,600
and makes 450 horsepower.

298
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,999
It might weigh
as much as a bungalow,

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,319
but this thing shifts.

300
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,839
Off-road, on-road,
cities, mountains -

301
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,360
you're just not getting away.

302
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,680
HE LAUGHS

303
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,639
You've just got to remind yourself
how big this thing is.

304
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,559
It gets going in a straight line,

305
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,720
and then, the corners...
a little bit trickier.

306
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,120
In fact, the Raptor is way
too big for UK roads.

307
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,159
But TV cops, they don't worry
about parking at Asda.

308
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,359
they just want to make
a big entrance.

309
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,040
And nothing makes as big an
entrance as a Raptor.

310
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,799
FRED ON RADIO: Hello, hello, hello.

311
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,639
What's going on here, then, boys?

312
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,319
HE LAUGHS

313
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,519
Lovely stickerage, Fred.

314
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,999
Bold choice of car, though.
FRED LAUGHS

315
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,959
Why have you written "Ranger"
on a Raptor?

316
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,399
It's a Ford Raptor,
not a Ford Ranger.

317
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
Because the Ranger's driving, Chris.

318
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,479
You've heard Chuck Norris...
Texas Ranger?

319
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,999
Flintoff, Preston Ranger!

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,440
HE LAUGHS
Oh, God.

321
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,559
I've gone full-on '80s action cop.

322
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,319
LAUGHTER

323
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,839
Honestly, it is an absolute
monster, this thing. I love it.

324
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,279
I see Chris has gone for
a mid-sized family hatchback.

325
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,919
What's that about?

326
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,879
It's an Audi RS3,
and if I need to catch baddies,

327
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,479
which is the name of the game,
this thing's a weapon.

328
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,559
It's the obvious choice.

329
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,119
Well, to see who'd actually
chosen best,

330
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,600
we'd been told to head to
a nearby deserted power station.

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,359
Look at this, lads.

332
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,639
I'm smelling bad guys.

333
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,999
Just the kind of playground
you'd pick for a bit

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,320
of TV crime-fighting fun.

335
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,159
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.
THEY CHUCKLE

336
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,200
Yes.

337
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,079
Ohh! Yes.

338
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,759
Now we're talking, boys!

339
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,399
All right? Yes.

340
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,679
Wh-wh-wh-what? What?

341
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,999
Looking at your trousers,
is your cop based on

342
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,319
an ex-geography teacher?

343
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,239
I'm not going to lie. Yeah?

344
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,959
I was hoping the trousers
would be a bit more fitted.

345
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,999
OK? Preston Ranger.

346
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,759
What are you doing?

347
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,639
You two are like a couple of
children that have had a go

348
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,239
in a fancy dress shop.

349
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,119
Well, let me introduce you to
Officer...Dirty Cobra.

350
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,199
Hang on. Dirty Cobra?

351
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,599
That's right. Why?

352
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,759
Well, I took a bit of Dirty Harry
and a bit of Cobra,

353
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,199
mixed 'em together.
What've you got in your mouth?

354
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,319
Dirty Cobra?! Toothpick.
Because what that's good for -

355
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,319
in like in any classic film,
you see a baddy, you go...

356
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,559
HE SPITS

357
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,199
..and then, you're in.
I've got plenty of spares.

358
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,959
That reminds me. Hang on.
Hang on. Talking about...

359
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,479
While he's gone, Pad,
why are you wearing shades?

360
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,439
All good cops wear shades, Chris.

361
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,279
Brought me own toothpick.

362
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,239
CHRIS LAUGHS
I don't need a gun.

363
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,359
Woodworm. They went out
of business, didn't they?

364
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,200
Yeah, when I retired.
HE LAUGHS

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,479
So, my backstory is...

366
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,039
..ex-cricketer,
retired through injury.

367
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,959
It was sad. I lost me way for
a while. I hit the drink.

368
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,759
You didn't.
My life was going nowhere!

369
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,359
So, I decided...
I'm going to give a bit back.

370
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,279
I'm going to go back to Preston.

371
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,039
I'm going to clean them streets up.

372
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,959
I don't need a gun. I've got this.
Is that why you've had your thing

373
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,719
signed up like Environmental Health?

374
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,639
Yeah, cleaning it up.
All right, I like that.

375
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,959
I do t'bins, as well.

376
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,079
What's the backstory here?
Single man?

377
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,159
LAUGHTER

378
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,399
What is it? Right...

379
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,559
Where does that jumper start
and stop, and your chin finish?

380
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,559
Right, stop there.

381
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,159
The character's name -
you're going to love this -

382
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,839
is Dave Tall. What?

383
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,439
It's a visual gag,
cos I'm not actually tall.

384
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,319
So, the whole time I say,
"I'm Dave Tall."

385
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,359
And everyone goes,
"He's actually short."

386
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,359
I'm actually a failed racing driver.

387
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,199
Yes, you are.
LAUGHTER

388
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
He's playing himself.
He's Chris Harris.

389
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,959
You're Chris Harris in a polo neck.

390
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,439
The big change of wardrobe for me
is I've bought a new jumper -

391
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,919
opportunity for the winter.

392
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,359
And when things get tasty...
Oh, he's got summat here.

393
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,439
What's he got? This is the secret.
Here we go. This'll be good.

394
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,399
..Dave Tall puts on
his driving gloves.

395
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,919
Is that it? This signals the fact
that I'm in pursuit in the show.

396
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,319
So, you'll see the red gloves
on the steering wheel,

397
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,119
and all the kids will go,
"Tall's about to get tasty."

398
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,519
What he's done, this morning
he's got up and he's thought,

399
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,639
"What have I got in me
drawer at home?"

400
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,159
And he's...that's it. That is it.

401
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,039
Look at the gloves. Look at him.

402
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,079
Well, anyhow, listen, we've all
got our cop characters now.

403
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,119
Now, every classic cop film
has a signature move,

404
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,079
something when they rock up in
the car and they get out,

405
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,479
and it freeze-frames on them.
Yeah, yeah. Right?

406
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,879
I want to see all your
signature moves.

407
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,959
Now, get yourselves set.
I'm going to...start you off,

408
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,439
show you what the crack is.

409
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,119
I reckon yours could be trying to
drive that in a straight line.

410
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,719
Here we go.

411
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,799
Hey...
HE SPITS

412
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
All right. Go, Cobra.

413
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,120
Cobra?

414
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,279

415
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm sorry...
Dirty Cobra, where are yer?

416
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,399
DC's just on a stakeout.

417
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,079
A stakeout? DC!

418
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,759
There's a criminal in
my car park, DC.

419
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,080

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,400

Why's he walking around t'car?

Seriously?
Hey, what do you reckon, boys?

430
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,599
Why do you want him
to have insurance?

431
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,199
Why? Have a look at him, son.

432
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,919
He's been apprehended -
by the unconscious police.

433
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,639
Look at the punk on the floor.
You can take that out now.

493
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,279
Now, at this point,

494
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,119
it was decided it was time
to take a more focused approach

495
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,039
to finding out who had chosen
the best new TV cop car.

496
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,600
And that meant it was chase time.

497
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,799
With the power station turned
into a temporary racetrack,

498
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,119
each taking turns as the cop,

499
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,879
we'd now hunt down a suitably
nefarious Chrysler 300C,

500
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,320
driven by a couple of...
conveniently available robbers.

501
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,159
And, to make sure this serious
testing didn't result in

502
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,639
an even more serious accident,

503
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,039
each car had been fitted
with proximity sensors.

504
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,359
Get within ten metres of
the getaway car for ten seconds,

505
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,639
and the chase...would be over.

506
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,560
Quickest to catch the crims wins.

507
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,359
Right, straight for that bag,
straight in - leave your door open.

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
Get in, you tool!

514
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
Come on, go, go, go, go!

515
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,079
Oh, here he comes!
Here's the Ranger!

516
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,599
Tell you what, he's going quick.

517
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,159
Stop right there!
The Ranger's coming!

518
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,599
HORN TOOTS

519
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,920
Oh, my God, he's got his
lights on, as well.

520
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
HORN TOOTS

521
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,120
Oh, he's just smashed
the whole lot out of the way!

522
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,079
That thing looks properly worrying
in your rear-view mirror,

523
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,119
I tell you, Pad.

524
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,080
Come on, don't dig in now, Raptor.
I've got 'em in me sights!

525
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,279
He's closed a massive gap on us.
Here we go, whoa!

526
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,040
Whoa...whoa!

527
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,960
Here we go, I'm catching 'em,
I'm catching 'em.

528
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,559
Oh, he's all over us like a rat.
He's over us like a rat!

529
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,759
Look at the size of
the bloody thing!

530
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,799
Say you what -
off-road capabilities,

531
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,840
I'm going to use 'em.

532
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,959
This is where Dirty Cobra
gets it back here.

533
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,600
Oh, you know, he's disappeared.

534
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
Where is he? Where's he gone?

535
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,839
There he is, there he is!
We've got yer!

536
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,280
Oh, he's there!

537
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,799
Coming for yer.

538
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,079
He's onto us, he's onto us.

539
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,359
SENSOR BEEPS
Keep beeping, keep beeping.

540
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,999
He's going to get us! Shut up!
Go straight down there!

541
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,160
Come on, pull over, man.
You're done. You're done!

542
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,000
LAUGHTER

543
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,439
He's on us! The Ranger's on us!

544
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,559
Come on!

545
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,079
He's gone. He's gone, he's gone!

546
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,439
Nobody gets away from
the Ranger!

547
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
No, we haven't. No, we haven't!

548
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,239
Do you know why I'm stopping yer?

549
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,959
THEY LAUGH
We've got a good idea, Ranger.

550
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,119
Your back right tyre's down.

551
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,599
I'm not going to write you
a ticket this time. Thank you.

552
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,399
But get yourself home, drive
carefully, and get it sorted.

553
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,760
Howzat?

554
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,199
That was an impressively ruthless
four-minute, 50-second chase.

555
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,119
Next on duty, the Dirty Cobra -

556
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,800
ready to unleash his
Charger Hellcat.

557
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,680
Go! Go, go, go, go, go.

558
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,679
All right.

559
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,800
Oh!

560
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,519
HE LAUGHS
Here we go!

561
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,160
Let's get these punks!

562
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,199
Oh, here he comes.
He's right behind yer. Is he?

563
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,760
The Cobra's here, boys!

564
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,679
That's a bit slippy.

565
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,479
Come on! What...we're not...

566
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,559
Why have you not got your
gloves on neither?

567
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,519
Cos I'm not the policeman
at the moment!

568
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,639
Yeah, but you're faster in your
gloves. That's the trademark.

569
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,119
Whoa! The Hellcat's all
over the shop!

570
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,719
We're getting away from him.
We're going to get away with this!

571
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,800
We're going to get away with it!
Mexico, here we come!

572
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,719
The Charger is so powerful,

573
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I can't get it in a straight
bloody line!

574
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,959
OK, so it turns out,

575
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,479
while the Charger does have
all the crime-fighting grunt

576
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,319
you'll ever need...

577
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,679
This don't look good.

578
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,959
..on anything other than
a bone-dry tarmac road,

579
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,439
it is a massive handful.

580
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,080
Ho-ho! Too much goddamn
power for this car!

581
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,279
He can't get close to us.

582
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,679
On the plus side, that does at least
mean all you Dirty Cobra fans

583
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,199
will be treated to some very
lengthy car chases.

584
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,279
Ah, come on.

585
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,999
Keep it going, keep it going.

586
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,319
But when it comes to ending them...

587
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,399
I thought this was meant
to be stressful,

588
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,159
trying to get away from the police.

589
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,159
..you do have to get a bit creative.

590
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,799
Dirty Cobra's going
to go right down here.

591
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,999
Playing by me own rules now.
Come on, the Cobra!

592
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,759
Whoa, oh, he's in range.
Where is he?

593
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,879
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no!

594
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,679
There he is. There he is!

595
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,999
THEY LAUGH

596
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,799
So, with Fred making off
with the loot,

597
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,839
after a chase that took a full
11 minutes and 36 seconds,

598
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,199
let's just say the Dirty Cobra
would be turning in his badge.

599
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,319
I was the passenger! He was driving.
I was the passenger!

600
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,999
You're going to prison, son.

601
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,479
I hope you've got insurance
for that.

602
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,119
And, with the Preston Ranger
still the cop to beat,

603
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,119
finally it was time for
a certain failed racing driver

604
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,999
to slip on the gloves.

605
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,119
HORN TOOTS
Come on! Got it!

606
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,839
Come on, Dave, now's your chance.

607
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm after them.

608
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,160
I've heard Dave Small's in town.

609
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Good God, this thing is
fast round here.

610
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,639
Ohh! It's a bit shaky on t'brakes.

611
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,960
Where'd you get
this getaway car from?

612
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,519
This is so grippy and so fast.

613
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
This is why I chose the hot hatch!

614
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
Oh! Oh, God!

615
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,800
Whoa, sideways!

616
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,919
I'm not going to prison, Fred.
I'm not going to prison!

617
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,519
It frightens me.
Imagine me and you in prison!

618
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,920
Oh! They'd have a field day!

619
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,839
Oh, we're on him. We're on him.

620
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,640
He's behind us. Gun it!

621
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,799
He'll start taking some risks now.

622
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,360
Crims have to take risks at
some point, don't they?

623
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,000
I've seen a wall! There's a wall!

624
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,960
Right, right, right!

625
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,319
He's all over the place.

626
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,999
No. These are chicanes, Fred!

627
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,839
I have to take it. I'm not bothered.
I'm not bothered!

628
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,679
He's got us!
He's got us, Fred! Fred!

629
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,240
HE LAUGHS

630
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,479
Oh! Oh, my God.

631
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,119
Oh, here he is.

632
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,799
Officer Dave Tall!
You're nicked, both of you!

633
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,719
Yeah, I'm in a lot of trouble.

634
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,639
I bet that was a wild ride,
wasn't it?

635
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,280
Gotta be honest -
prison seems a better option.

636
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,439
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

637
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,399
Hey!

638
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
OK.

639
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,199
So, I know the question
everyone's asking.

640
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,719
What the hell was that?

641
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,359
No, no, they want to know who won.

642
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,679
Did Dave Tall apprehend
the perps faster

643
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,159
than the Preston Ranger?

644
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,679
And I have the results here.

645
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,959
OK. So, the Preston Ranger in
the Raptor caught the bad guys

646
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,359
in four minutes, 50 seconds.

647
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,919
All right, innit?
Good work, Preston Ranger.

648
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,919
Thank you. Dave Tall...
HE WHISTLES

649
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,319
..in the family hatchback
caught the bad guys

650
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,799
in three minutes, five seconds!

651
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,559
Victory to the Tall!
CHEERING

652
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,079
Nah, nah, nah. Yes! No.

653
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,919
Yes!

654
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,399
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm not having that. Not having it.

655
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,599
You can't not have that.
It's maths.

656
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,799
We're saying, then,
the ultimate TV cop car isn't

657
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,639
the massive, noisy muscle car,

658
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,439
isn't the massive,
noisy pick-up truck,

659
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,839
but a small German hatchback?

660
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,159
Great things come in small packages.
Really? Really?

661
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,399
I think what we're saying
is the best cop cars

662
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,879
are the worst telly cop cars.

663
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,959
And the worst cop cars are
the best telly cop cars.

664
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,679
Glad we cleared that up. Thank you.

665
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,079
And now, we must move on
to a tribute.

666
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,199
Last year, Britain lost
one of its greatest inventors,

667
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,719
Sir Clive Sinclair, the genius
brain behind the ZX Spectrum.

668
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,079
Ask your parents, kids.

669
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,719
He's the man who brought
home computing and video games

670
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,199
to the masses.

671
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,279
And also, the brain behind this -
the Sinclair C5 of 1985,

672
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,919
which, it's fair to say,

673
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,519
history hasn't judged too kindly.

674
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,439
But we've been thinking -
maybe this battery-powered pod

675
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,159
wasn't actually a bad idea.

676
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,679
Maybe it was just too far
ahead of its time.

677
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,399
Exactly. Maybe in
this modern electric world,

678
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,359
the C5 makes perfect sense.

679
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,520
So, we sent Chris and Fred
to test the theory.

680
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,239
The Sinclair C5 was, on paper,

681
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,400
a genuinely revolutionary
piece of design.

682
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,959
A small, light, affordable,
zero-emission vehicle

683
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
intended for urban commuting.

684
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,919
OK, it might have looked
a little unusual.

685
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,959
But fundamentally, Sir Clive's
vision was for the same

686
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,440
green and responsible future
that we're all clamouring for today.

687
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,399
Oh, bus, bus, bus, Chris. Bus!

688
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,999
That's not nice.

689
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,959
Oh, oh!
BOTH LAUGH

690
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,799
'Ey up, we're holding traffic up.
Move up. I'm going flat out.

691
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,799
Get off, get off! Get over there.

692
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,959
How much power have these got?

693
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,599
About one third of a horsepower.

694
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,919
What, a hoof and a bit? Yeah.

695
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,399
15mph if you're lucky.

696
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,760
HORN TOOTS
I don't like it.

697
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,799
The problem was,
back in the mid-'80s,

698
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,680
the technology simply didn't exist
to do the C5 justice.

699
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,999
Built in the old
Hoover factory in Wales,

700
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,679
its motor was lifted from the
cooling fan of a lorry,

701
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,880
and its all-electric range
was about eight miles.

702
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,999
So, it was hopelessly slow
when it worked...

703
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,319
Run out of battery.

704
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,959
..and then, dangerously slow
when it didn't.

705
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,799
BICYCLE BELL DINGS
Oh.

706
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,640
CHRIS LAUGHS

707
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,279
Clearly, the time has come
to turn Sir Clive's vision...

708
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,639
Mine's died now.

709
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,439
..into the lean, mean, green
machine he'd always dreamt of.

710
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
I've got an idea, Chris.
I've got an idea.

711
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,679
And to show Harris just what
that dream looks like,

712
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,439
I told him to meet me
a few weeks later...

713
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
..in Norway.

714
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Wow. OK.

715
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,160
Hi, Andrew. Chris.

716
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,479
Are you ready to have
your mind blown?

717
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,839
I...what are you playing at?

718
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,079
I'm excited to show you this.
Look at this.

719
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,600
Are you ready?

720
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,639
Look at this.

721
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,120
HE LAUGHS

722
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,399
Oh, yes. Harnessing
the green potential of gravity,

723
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,439
and embracing speed,

724
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,799
this is the Sinclair Ski-5.

725
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,519
The Ski-5? Yeah.
Yeah, but what is it?

726
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,399
I know what you're thinking.
Stop it.

727
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,319
You're thinking I've just got
a bobsled, and I've put the shell

728
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,679
of a Sinclair C5 on top. Yes.

729
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,919
Oh, no, Christopher.
We've done this properly.

730
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,719
Obviously got rid of the wheels,
put some running rails

731
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,959
on the bottom, changed the steering.

732
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,719
Remember that bar where you turned?

733
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,479
I've gone for the pulleys,
bobsled-style.

734
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,079
Wouldn't it be easier just to run
headlong at a brick wall?

735
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,279
No, Chris.
Cos you wouldn't have to travel.

736
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,119
You'd just get the job done cleaner.

737
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,279
You know what I'm going to
try and do? What?

738
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,919
It's what Sir Clive would've
wanted when he designed it.

739
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,639
What? I want to break the
national speed limit of 60mph.

740
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,279
Why would you want to do that?

741
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,680
In honour of Sir Clive.

742
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,719
To help me with my mission,

743
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,719
I'd be running on Norway's
national bobsleigh track

744
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,799
in Lillehammer, with the help
a team of sledding experts,

745
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,520
led by Olympic coach
Graham Richardson.

746
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,839
What's the chance of it making it
to the bottom in one piece?

747
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,999
Ah, here he is. Here he is.

748
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,599
There's no guarantees.

749
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,759
Erm, there's very, very precise
lines that you have to drive to

750
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,559
not crash off the end of the corner.

751
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,919
Cos I've seen it on t'telly.
I saw the Olympics.

752
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,680
Those two lads ended up on the reds.

753
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,959
That word you used there beginning
with C - that's important

754
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,119
in the context of Fred.

755
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,759
Chris, adults speaking.

756
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,479
And the chances of getting to 60?

757
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,959
Erm...

758
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,239
I don't know. I'm not sure
about the aero on it.

759
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,079
It's open sides, a little bit slow,

760
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,039
but it very much depends
how Fred drives it.

761
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,080
Ah.

762
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,999
Before letting me loose
in the Ski-5,

763
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,959
Graham needed me to learn
the course, which,

764
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,519
on a 16-corner track
that's nearly a mile long,

765
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,840
wasn't exactly straightforward.

766
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,359
So, as you go into the corner,
it'll come up.

767
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,239
You look for the straight.
You turn it off, and over.

768
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,719
It's just like driving a car.

769
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,159
I thought I was turning up
to sit down and go quick.

770
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,599
This on the left, incidentally,
is the junior start,

771
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,919
where we're going to be
starting from with you today.

772
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,599
So, when you get to the second
pressure, the sled is high,

773
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,279
and with the nose in a good position
to actually steer through that

774
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,759
and come off the corner.

775
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,799
Graham was talking me
through it, but...

776
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,999
..he's talking a different
language to what I knew.

777
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,839
He was talking about pressures and
getting onto corners too early,

778
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,999
and pointing out little things

779
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,919
you can look at when
you're in a corner.

780
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,479
The problem with that is,
there's 16 of them.

781
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,799
And they come up pretty fast.

782
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,079
Especially as, all too soon,

783
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,160
I was given my very own training
sleigh to take for a run.

784
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,319
And we're going...
Oh, we're building up speed already!

785
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,039
When you come out into
the 4-5 transition,

786
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,359
it's a nice, long straight.

787
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,439
And what you should do here
is just practise.

788
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,399
Just go...when I pull left,
the sled goes left.

789
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,119
When I pull right,
the sled goes right.

790
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,839
Is it fast at the minute,
or is it...? Yeah. Yeah?

791
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,519
Oh, yeah, this'll be cooking.

792
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,119
Ohhh!

793
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,359
"Don't forget to steer."

794
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,760
Today's coaching tip. Yeah, steer.

795
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,079
Top runners are going to be
about here.

796
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,479
And, as you let it run,
it stays parallel.

797
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,079
When everything else is descending,

798
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,640
we're staying parallel and
joining the high line.

799
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,319
Remember, a nice, strong steer
on the beginning of 13.

800
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,800
All right, we'll do another.

801
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,040
Had a couple of bumps, like...
but didn't land on me head, did I?

802
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,200
TANNOY: We have a crash.
We have a crash.

803
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,159
It didn't go particularly well,
Chris. You do surprise me!

804
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,440
Here we go, look at this.
So, here we go.

805
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,919
Oh! See?
What the hell are you doing?

806
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,799
I'm sideways.

807
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,719
So, I came in... Yeah.

808
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,119
And then, as I was going,
I went over.

809
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,639
And me helmet was scraping
on the wall, and then,

810
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,119
pushed meself back up and got
back on me...on me things.

811
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,840
So, you righted yourself using
your own head? Kind of, yeah.

812
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,279
Truth is, the high sides of the
training sleigh are designed to keep

813
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,959
the driver properly protected -

814
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,959
protection I'd now have
to leave behind,

815
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,879
lining up to give the Ski-5
its maiden voyage.

816
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,919
OK, so, remember - into the corners.

817
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,719
Yeah. Turn to parallel.

818
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,759
Let it run nice and free.
Look for the exit.

819
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,599
Remember to look as long as you can.
Steer it down the straight.

820
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,039
OK. Lovely stuff.
ON RADIO: Andrew, can you hear me?

821
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,999
ON RADIO: Loud and clear, Chris.

822
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,159
Just be careful, all right,
because this looks terrifying.

823
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,959
That's great words from you,
Chris.

824
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,159
That's a real good gee-up
for me, that. Thank you.

825
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,719
Be mindful of the fact there's
a lot of trip hazards down here,

826
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,959
so I'm taking one for
the team, as well.

827
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,359
Chris, I'll see you in about
a minute's time. Cheers, mate.

828
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,799
Thanks, Graham.

829
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,719
In his head, he looks like
he's created the ultimate homage

830
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,679
to the C5 - but from here, he looks
like a really large toddler

831
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,479
being pushed in a pram.

832
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,319
TANNOY: Clear the track for a C5...

833
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,479
There you go, it's official now.

834
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,039
TANNOY: The track is clear.

835
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,799
There's no backing down now,
Fred. Here we go.

836
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,439
Here we go,
the Sinclair C5 is going.

837
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,279
He's through the beam -
and he's away.

838
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,799
And we're off!

839
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,240
Come on, Andrew! Coming round.

840
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,879
Down the first, it's a bit...
It's twitching at the back.

841
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,319
Oh, my - he had a massive
wobble there!

842
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,440
Coming round.
Look at where you're going.

843
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,639
And we're off.
Oh, it's a twitcher.

844
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,599
Now he's against the wall
twice there.

845
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,199
Going down the straight now.
Here we go, into 12.

846
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,639
Now he's picking up speed.
Now he's really travelling.

847
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,519
Here we go. And into 13.

848
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,199
Just saw him over there.

849
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,119
Oh, 15!

850
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,679
Coming round.

851
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,999
Steering up into 16,
and we're nearly finished!

852
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,760
And we're down.

853
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,479
Never in doubt, Andrew.
It's, erm...

854
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,639
It's a little bit twitchy.
How does she handle?

855
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,239
Through the corners, was all right.

856
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,039
Straight, it's all over the place.

857
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,719
Is it lacking stability?
A little bit.

858
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,879
How fast do you reckon you went?

859
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,559
I didn't feel I was flying
that time. I reckon...50, max.

860
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,959
OK, can we get a speed?

861
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,479
54.6.

862
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,399
54.6mph.

863
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,159
54? Yeah. Point six.

864
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,399
That's all right, that is.
So, how can we get more speed?

865
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,399
That was only the junior. What?

866
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,879
Send me from the top.
That wasn't the top?

867
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,559
No, that was only t'junior one.

868
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,199
I've got four more corners to go
through. Get to the top,

869
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,359
I reckon 60mph - all day long.

870
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,559
You're confident, are you? Yeah.

871
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,039
Plus, Graham had
a few ideas of his own.

872
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,999
So, what we've done is we've
moved up to the top of the track,

873
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,439
so we've got an extra 200 metres of
track, and maybe 30 metres of drop.

874
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,839
That should do it, shouldn't it?

875
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,919
That'll give us a bit more speed,
but I don't think it'll be enough.

876
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,919
What? We need a bit more weight.

877
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,479
Fred's not heavy enough.

878
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,239
We need to put 50 kilos in.

879
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,879
50 kilos? 50 kilos will get some
more speed out of it, so look sharp.

880
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,879
So, as well as being promoted
from the children's start line,

881
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,439
to increase the amount of energy,
and therefore speed, that Fred

882
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,799
would be carrying down the run,

883
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,120
we'd also now added
a healthy lump of ballast.

884
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,919
Sitting at the top,
it's a different course.

885
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,120
That first drop - wow.

886
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,399
I can just see probably
20 yards of track,

887
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,000
and then, a roof.
I don't even see the track.

888
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,839
Pushing him down now.

889
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,479
Oh, here we go. Look at this.

890
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,519
And he's away.

891
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,679
Bloomin' heck, it just disappears.
And we're off.

892
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,359
I'm on me own here.

893
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,839
And we're going.

894
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,359
We're building up speed already!

895
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,399
He looks exposed. His head's above.

896
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,599
It's like watching an old
Formula 1 car, you know,

897
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,479
when the canopy's so low and
their torso's above.

898
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,239
Here we go, it's...
it's all over the place, this.

899
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,719
Whacked a wall there.

900
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,519
Here we go, coming round.

901
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,559
Keep it straight.

902
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,079
Flashed through there.
God, that looked fast.

903
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,719
Up we go. Five. Into six.

904
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,679
Neat and tidy, Andrew,
neat and tidy.

905
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,559
Watch for the exit.
Watch for the exit to seven.

906
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,239
Bit sideways.

907
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,559
Oh, no, massive,
massive wobble there!

908
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,879
Whoa! Whoa, it's a bumpy ride!

909
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,479
That's a code brown.

910
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,839
No, he's got it back together,
he's got it back.

911
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,999
This is the one now, 12 into 13.

912
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,280
Looking for the exit now.

913
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,639
And we're coming round 11.

914
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,119
He's really flying!

915
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,519
This is a big straight into 14.

916
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,079
Get it set on the wall down. 15!

917
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,319
This is where I come off.

918
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,639
Come on, Clive! You'd better be
enjoying this if you're watching!

919
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,239
Let's see what the speed is!

920
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,520
Wow!

921
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,679
Whoo! Oh!

922
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,959
That looked like a wild ride.

923
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,599
That was a little bit different
to the first one! Jeez!

924
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,719
I was steering, but it was just...

925
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,079
How many times did you hit a wall?
I hit a few walls!

926
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,359
But then, you've just got to try
and drive it, and get it back in.

927
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,919
OK. Do you want to know the speed?

928
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,879
Go on.

929
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,399
50... Oh!

930
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,519
..nine... No, you're winding me up.

931
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,039
..point two. Shut up.

932
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,679
59.2! Right, how do we get
another 0.8mph? Come on.

933
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,759
There is one way. How?

934
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,559
We go from the top... Yeah.

935
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,839
..we've got the weight in... Yeah.

936
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,559
..we stick some spikes
on your feet, and you push me.

937
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,959
Let's go full Olympic.

938
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,199
Get on the back, push me down.
Let's go for it.

939
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,039
Are you sure? Not really.
CHRIS LAUGHS

940
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,840
But it's what Clive would've wanted.

941
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,280
Two...three...

942
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,639
Six... Are you going into
a trance-like state?

943
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,559
Just visualising the course.

944
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,319
Really? There's a couple of corners
I'm a bit messy out of.

945
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,399
If I'm going faster,
I really don't want to be.

946
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,639
Yeah, the video confirms that.
When you say a couple...

947
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,319
All right, Chris, that'll do.
You are spoiling me flow now.

948
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,639
Sorry. Do the counting thing again.
That was impressive.

949
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,479
Thank you. Cos you got to 15.

950
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,759
HE LAUGHS
Right.

951
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,679
OK? Come on. Yeah, come on, Chris.
Let's get going.

952
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,919
You and me. We're in.

953
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,879
For Sir Clive. We're doing this
for Sir Clive. 60mph.

954
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,879
Push me straight.
Don't be messing about.

955
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,479
I'm not messing about.
Three, two, one.

956
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,799
Let's get out of here, Chris.

957
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,519
Oh, you're faster than I thought.

958
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,640
Give us a push, Chris.
Nicely done. Thank you, Chris!

959
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,359
That's a bit different.
He's started me off a bit quicker.

960
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,040
HE LAUGHS

961
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,079
Gathering it as we go.

962
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,080
Turn one, to the left.

963
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,559
Please, a double pressure.
For Sir Clive!

964
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,320
Get off it. Yes, nice.

965
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,679
Here we go. Into five.

966
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,359
Little right...left-hander.

967
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,119
Into six. It's a swoop right.

968
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,719
We're going round for Clive!

969
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,119
Come on, Fred.

970
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,079
We go down the labyrinth.

971
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,439
I'm going sideways, I'm banging
around, but it doesn't matter,

972
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,999
cos this is for Clive!

973
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,960
Come on, Freddie!

974
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,559
Come on, Andrew.

975
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,919
For Sinclairs everywhere!

976
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,559
Spectrum 48Ks! Sinclair C5s!

977
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,439
Get off. Coming round,
here he comes!

978
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,559
In the Olympics
for Great Britain in a C5!

979
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,359
Please be over 60mph!

980
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,400
I'm coming round to the end!
What have we got?

981
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,480
What is it?

982
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,999
Brake, brake, brake,
brake, brake, brake!

983
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,719
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

984
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,000
Whoa!

985
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,519
What's the speed?

986
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,039
Right, we need a speed.

987
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,120
Thank you. Where is he?

988
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,159
Oh, look at this, look at this.
Look at the state of this.

989
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,919
Taken me a bit longer, Andrew!

990
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,919
Really? Well, what was it? Right.

991
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,839
Oh, no. How was it?

992
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,079
I'm...I'm hoping, Chris,

993
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,079
cos half of me would love
to do it again...

994
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,039
..but half of me never wants to go
near these things again in me life.

995
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,999
OK. So, I want to be above 60.
For Sir Clive. What have we got?

996
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,719
Here we go. Track control.

997
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,920
Can we have Andrew's maximum
speed on that run, please?

998
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,239
RADIO: 61...
THEY YELL

999
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,159
CHEERING

1000
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,279
61! Get in there, Sir Clive!

1001
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,279
HE LAUGHS
Hey, thank you. Come on!

1002
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,680
Come on! That's amazing.

1003
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,679
61. Get in! Thank you, Sir Clive.

1004
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,519
Well done. Brilliant.
61. Great effort.

1005
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,200
APPLAUSE
61. Done it.

1006
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1007
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,999
Oh, look at him,
he's like, tch-tch-tch!

1008
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,359
I've got to say, Fred,
respect to you.

1009
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,919
Taking on the bobsleigh run in
this bit of plastic that was built

1010
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,119
in a Hoover factory in Wales.

1011
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,599
What can I say? I give me all
to this show. Take note, boys!

1012
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,359
Was it as bad as it looked?

1013
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,039
It give me a little bit of
a workout, I'm not going to lie!

1014
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,679
But it also got me thinking.

1015
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,039
What is it, Winter Olympics,
four years' time?

1016
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,679
Us three on the podium?

1017
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,759
God Save The Queen? Hey?

1018
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,039
Cool Runnings - not!

1019
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,879
So, Fred, you've bungee-jumped
a Rover Metro off a dam. Yeah.

1020
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,679
You've driven a Sinclair C5
down a bobsleigh.

1021
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,759
What's next? Nissan Sunny
into an active volcano?

1022
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,119
Jammed in the boot of an Austin
and fired into space.

1023
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,159
Oh, that'll be good.

1024
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,799
I was thinking a cup of tea
and a re-evaluate.

1025
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,319
Maybe Strictly. Oh!

1026
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,039
No, no, no, no. Oh!
CHEERING

1027
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yes! Hey!

1028
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,639
HE HUMS STRICTLY THEME
Stop it. Stop it!

1029
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,679
On second thoughts,
get me a Nissan Sunny

1030
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,399
and point me in the direction of
the nearest volcano.

1031
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,399
No chance this lad's doing
the cha-cha-cha!

1032
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,239
That's all for tonight.

1033
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,879
We'll be back next week,

1034
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,279
when Chris Harris drives
a car from Norfolk,

1035
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,999
and the three of us hitch up
the big rigs and join

1036
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,319
the noble army of HGV drivers.

1037
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,639
See you, then. Thanks so much
for watching. Goodnight!

1038
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,000
CHEERING
