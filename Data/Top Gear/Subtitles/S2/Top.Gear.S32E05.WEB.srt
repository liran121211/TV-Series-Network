00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,519
FREDDIE: Whoo!

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,159
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear,

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,959
where we've got some very sad news,

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,799
because it's the last show
of the series.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,719
AUDIENCE: Aw!
Ohh!

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,999
But also, we've got some good news,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,399
because we're going out
with a big birthday bash. Yes!

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,039
AUDIENCE: Yay!

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,879
Yes, as the BBC is very keen
to keep reminding us,

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,839
this is the centenary year -

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,079
100 years of informing,
educating and entertaining.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,799
Well, some more than others.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,639
But here's a question -
what would Top Gear have looked like

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,639
back in those early days
of the Beeb?

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,919
Well, we've had a trawl through
the archives to find out.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,200
PROJECTOR WHIRS

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,759
POSH ACCENT: Hello and welcome
to The Top Gear,

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,120
a programme dedicated
to the mechanical road carriage.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,599
Today, one will be running
one's monocle over this fine filly,

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,679
the Invicta.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,120
Tally-ho!

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,199
This is the Invicta Type A,

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,919
and while it's priced
at a princely £1,500,

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,000
that does afford you the very latest
in modern conveniences...

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,480
...including a seat,
a steering wheel and brakes!

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,359
NORMAL VOICE: Ah, this is the life!

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,519
And I can probably lose
the Jeeves and Wooster accent now.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,679
So most of you have probably
never heard of the Invicta,

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,119
but, back in the '20s and '30s,
this car was on the same par

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,359
as something like
a Rolls-Royce or a Bentley -

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,719
real premium badge stuff.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,879
And even now,
it's worth £200,000, this car,

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,560
and maybe a little bit more.

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,559
Now, you may wonder why
I'm dashing around the countryside.

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,319
Well, I've got a plan.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,599
Sadly, it involves those two clowns.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,360
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,079
Oh, my word. Look at this lad!

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,000
Gentlemen!

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
Firstly...

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,959
..did you not get the memo?

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,239
What's the memo, Pad?
"Come as Jacob Rees-Mogg"?

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,679
Have you seen Downton Abbey?
Not many puffer coats.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,079
No, I'd be downstairs and all,
wouldn't you? Absolutely.

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,399
Dressed like that, though,
you might be round the table.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,119
I've got to say, lads, I quite like
it. I think you look very dashing.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,719
Well, I've got to tell you,
these buttons are working very hard.

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,439
Very hard!
Why are you wearing white socks?

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,359
Yeah... Oh, you're not? You're not!

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
Oh, no!

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,439
Now, obviously, we're here.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,399
Lovely surroundings.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,919
It's 100 years of the BBC,

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,399
and I've got something
very special lined up for us.

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,480
Jump in, my good men. We're going
to do a bit of trialling.

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,479
Yes, we'd be having a crack

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
at one of the oldest motorsports
in Britain.

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,959
I'm glad the weather's nice.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,200
ENGINE REVS
Whoa! Hey-hey!

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,799
Trialling was originally devised

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,599
as a way for carmakers
to prove the ability

63
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,560
and reliability
of their latest models.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,959
And today, in sleepy, sunny corners
of the Great British countryside,

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,959
you can still find devoted bands
of merry motorists

66
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,080
battling their vintage cars
to the top of steep, muddy hills.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,759
This is a competition where
it's not about how fast you go,

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
it's about how far you get.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,319
And with five stages to attack
before the day was out,

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
our first job was to get...

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,839
..to the start.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
I must admit, I'd have liked
a seat belt in the back.

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,519
So, go on, Pad, talk us through it,
changing gear - what do you do?

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,879
Well, going up, it's...

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,719
You've got to put your foot
on the clutch,

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,399
give it a nanosecond in neutral,
then change into your gear,

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,119
but then coming back down -
that's where it gets really tricky.

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,879
You've got to do double clutch
and rev it and all that,

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,679
but I don't know how
it's going to go on at the trials

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,599
because it's driving all right
on the roads,

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,039
but I just can't see it
going up a steep gradient.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,479
It doesn't feel like it should
be doing that, does it? No.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm still not sure
what these trials are.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,759
Just as well, then,
that we were about to find out...

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,679
Morning! Morning!

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,079
..because Lord McGuinness
had managed to coax the Invicta

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
to our first hill...

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,799
..where, as the other challengers

89
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,399
were already making look
alarmingly easy,

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,039
the aim was to get past
as many markers as possible

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,400
on the way to the top.

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,239
Each hill has 25 points available

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,599
to those that can coax and rev
and bounce their way to reach them.

94
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,679
And with the teams with the
most points by the end of the day

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,079
taking home the silverware,
as we lined up for our first go...

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,279
WHISTLE BLOWS
Whoa. We're off.

97
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,400
..it didn't feel like
we'd be troubling the podium.

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,759
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get out there, get out there.

99
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,319
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Shut up. Shut up.

100
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,119
Go, go! Go, go!

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,679
Whoa, whoa! No... No more...

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,399
I've seen it.
No more, no more revs.

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I've seen it, I've seen it.
No more revs!

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,840
Gone past 15, lads.
We don't have to go fast.

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,639
Watch the tree, Chris.

106
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,119
We're good, we're good. Yeah?

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,359
A bit of right hand down now.
That's good.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,559
Mind that tree!

109
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,479
That's good. We're good.
Great work, Pad.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
Right, get bumping.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,559
Yes! Go, Pad.

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,159
Ohh! Bounce, Fred.

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm bouncing.

114
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,359
It's going beautifully.
Round there. No more revs.

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,679
Well done. Well done. Well done.

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,439
THEY CHEER

117
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,879
Stop! Stop! Frickin' stop.

118
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,159
BRAKES SQUEAL

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,719
ALL: Whoa!

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,679
Lovely bit of driving.
Who parked that there?

121
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,439
Jeepers creepers. That was close.
Got past it, though, didn't I?

122
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,600
Hey-hey!

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,519
Fair play to Paddy.
On our first-ever trials run,

124
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,880
we'd just bagged ourselves
a full 25 points.

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,519
That was great work, McGuinness.
What was it like driving?

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,759
Oh, tricky. It works, though,
the bouncing, doesn't it?

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,080
Does it? I didn't know if...
Yeah, you feel it.

128
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,399
Time to take the victorious Invicta

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,240
back down to the road
and onto the next hill.

130
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,599
We might be in this, you know.

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,199
When have we ever started this well
at anything?

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,320
LAUGHING: Never! Never.

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,999
And now that the pre-match nerves
had settled,

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,599
we could start to see
what this trials game

135
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,919
is actually all about.

136
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,159
You all right, boys?

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Hello! All right?

138
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,959
I like the format. So you basically
just wobble about on some lanes...

139
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,359
Lovely. ..you get to
show off your new suit,

140
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,839
then we go up through
some forest-y bits.

141
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,159
Thank you. Thanks very much.
Hello, there. Hello.

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
And everyone's very friendly.

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,560
Thank you. Thank you.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,360
Thank you.

145
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,759
Yes, arriving at a nearby farm
for the start of the next climb,

146
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,399
it was quickly becoming clear

147
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,839
that trials is as much a highlight
of the social calendar

148
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,879
as it is a motorsport.

149
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,439
No robotic racing drivers
and poker-faced pit crews here,

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,040
just lots of jolly people
having a jolly old time.

151
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,960
This is a lovely thing to do.

152
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,639
See this thing? Yeah.
Two-stroke, single chain.

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,519
Where's it from?

154
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,560
Is it?

155
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,279
That's it?!
PADDY LAUGHS

156
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,520
Will it go anywhere?

157
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,560
What is it?

158
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,719
It's a Trojan, yeah.

159
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,599
WHISTLE BLOWS
There you go. Good luck.

160
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
Good luck!

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,279
Look at this boy here. WG Grace.

162
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
Ooh, no messing.

163
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,599
Ooh, he's not messed about.
He's on it there.

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,439
Did you see the concentration
on his face?

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,439
He's had the back end out
and all sorts then.

166
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,079
Better than F1. Oh, wonderful.

167
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,999
Can't get this close
to bloody Verstappen, can you? No.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
I could touch his beard.

169
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,920
It's like Fast & Furious
meets Brideshead Revisited. Yes.

170
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,519
Meets Shameless.

171
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
THEY LAUGH

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,199
For all the fun and games, though,

173
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,159
it turned out our second hill
wouldn't be a stroll in the orchard,

174
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,319
because we'd be facing
our first re-start...

175
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,639
Here we go.
Let's see what happens here.

176
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,359
..coming to a complete stop

177
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,639
before setting off to tackle
the steepest part of the course.

178
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,360
I bet it's tough to get up there.

179
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,479
Oh, Fred, look. Fred, take notice.

180
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
Oh, easy. No messing.

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,760
Wow. No messing.

182
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,999
Now, you get one go at this,

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,480
and any rolling backwards
puts you straight out of the climb.

184
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,239
So, once Fred had distilled
what we'd seen of the pros

185
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,159
into a cunning strategy...

186
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,959
Put your foot down, I'll bounce.
PADDY LAUGHS

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,359
..heading for the start line
in the Invicta,

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,519
McGuinness had decided it was time
that Flintoff and I joined him

189
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,319
in dressing like them, too.

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,920
Oh, now we're talking!

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,319
Idiot!
FREDDIE LAUGHS

192
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,599
Ooh, I tell you what, boys,
now we look like a team!

193
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,119
WHISTLE BLOWS

194
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,199
But while we now had all the gear...

195
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,319
Gas, gad, gas, gas. Go, Pad.

196
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,119
..as we made our way up
to the dreaded re-start,

197
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,319
it soon became clear we still had...

198
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,919
No, no, you're going the wrong way.

199
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,799
You're going the wrong way,
you helmet.

200
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,199
..no idea.

201
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't worry about it, lads.

202
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,399
Right, bounce...

203
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,840
..for your lives, lads!

204
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,040
Bounce it, lads!

205
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,560
Go on!

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,520
No! No chance.

207
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,479
Embarrassing, that.
I think there's a bit of valve

208
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,360
coming out the engine
exhaust pipe there, Pad. Ah, well.

209
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,879
Think we got ahead of ourselves
on the last one, didn't we? We have.

210
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,479
But that looked nothing, did it?
You didn't respect the course.

211
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,319
But you didn't bounce, Fred,
at the first...

212
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,479
Bounced till I done my knees in!
No, you did it after!

213
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,319
Why is it our fault?
Why is it our fault? We're a team.

214
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,919
You'll have to change
the suspension,

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,679
I was bouncing that much.
We're a team, lads, we're a team.

216
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,159
We were a team -

217
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,279
a team in need of a new driver.

218
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,719
Got it all to do in the next round.

219
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,359
We might have to readjust
our assessment of Paddy's driving

220
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,400
after that one.
Feel free, lads. Feel free.

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,519
And so, with just 11 points
from the last hill,

222
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,239
heading for the next one,

223
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,919
it was our resident racing driver's
time to shine.

224
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,039
ENGINE ROARS
Oh, am I in gear?

225
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
Oh, no, he's not even in...

226
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,079
HORN BEEPS
We're being beeped out, Chris.

227
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,079
We're being beeped out, son!

228
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,360
You've got Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang honking you!

229
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,839
Ohh!

230
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,879
BOTH: Ohh! Wey-ey!

231
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,519
It's like a roller-coaster.

232
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
THEY CHEER

233
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,599
So, we're two hills down,

234
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,919
25 on the first,

235
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,839
11 on the second.

236
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,639
We need a big one here.
We need...

237
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,759
We need some high numbers
on this next one, Chris.

238
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,079
Get us back in the game, pal.

239
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,159
We've got the pro in now, though,
haven't we? Be right as rain now.

240
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,680
GEARS CRUNCH
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, whoa!

241
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,999
How are you finding the old Invicta,
Christopher?

242
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,719
Absolutely joyous.

243
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,599
Are you? I've got a bit to learn.

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,439
I thought Paddy was driving very
well... Changed his tune, hasn't he?

245
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,239
No. But I think the old girl
wasn't suited to wet grass.

246
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,159
Yeah. Definitely.

247
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,759
I think if we can get more roads
like the first one,

248
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,479
it'll go up 'em,
it'll go up 'em, definitely.

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,879
In the right hands.

250
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,640
FREDDIE CHUCKLES

251
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,200
We'd soon see, because we'd
reached the foot of hill three.

252
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,159
Go on, Chrissy. Hello!

253
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,399
Easy, Chris. Whoa!

254
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,199
Lovely. Keep it going.
Nice and steady as she goes.

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,519
And as Baron Harris set to work,

256
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,960
the Invicta was looking
much more at home.

257
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,239
Whoa! Whoa!

258
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,479
Hey, we're back in the race here.

259
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,959
THEY GASP AND GROAN

260
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,199
I tell you what, she does well
on the dry, doesn't she?

261
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,359
Oh, all the excuses!

262
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
Ohh! Whoa!

263
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,599
Oh, my God.

264
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,879
I don't like that tree stump,
though, Pad.

265
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,639
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

266
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,279
LOUD THUD
Bloomin' heck.

267
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,600
Come on, let's get to 25.

268
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,519
Let's finish this one.

269
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.

270
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,639
23. 23, Chris. Two more.

271
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,399
I can live with this.

272
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,560
THEY CHEER

273
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,879
Yes, madam.

274
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,679
FREDDIE LAUGHS

275
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,879
A maximum-points run from Harris
had put us back on track

276
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,520
and earned him another stint
behind the wheel.

277
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,479
Chrissy, back in the game.
25 more points.

278
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,879
Yes!

279
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,079
Back in there.
I tell you what... Back in there.

280
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,800
..I'm loving these old cars.

281
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,839
And swaggering up
to the penultimate hill

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,079
with confidence riding high,

283
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,039
it was time to show what
a pro trials team really looks like.

284
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,479
WHISTLE BLOWS

285
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,879
Come on, Chris, we need
a big 'un here. Go on, Chris.

286
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,319
Oh, he's at it here. Ohh!

287
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,839
Whoa, he's going quick.
Is this a time trial?

288
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,759
Your door's opened, Chris.
Shut the door, Pad.

289
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,479
Shut the door!

290
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,639
Ohh.

291
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,199
Yes, Harris had found
his full pouty concentration face,

292
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,799
and the Invicta was starting
to look invincible.

293
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,839
THEY CHEER

294
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,359
This is going to fly up to 25,
this, Chris.

295
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,039
Or at least it did...

296
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Ooh, ooh, this is steep!

297
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,320
..until we ran into our old friend,
the re-start.

298
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,599
Go on, Chris.
Come on, you got it.

299
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,119
ENGINE REVS

300
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,199
Come on, Pad, jump.

301
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,079
Get up! Get up!

302
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,639
Yes! We've done it!
We've done it, Pad!

303
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,599
Come on, lads.
We've done it, Chris.

304
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,119
Go on!

305
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,679
Go on, Chris!

306
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,759
I can't flipping bounce any more.

307
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,560
Go, Chris. Oh, dear.

308
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,039
The standing start
had bested us again.

309
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,239
And with a paltry seven points
for our efforts,

310
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,639
heading off to
the last run of the day,

311
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,679
it only seemed fair
to hand Viscount Flintoff

312
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
his first go behind the wheel.

313
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,519
GEARS CLUNK AND GRIND
Oh. Oh! Oh, he's missed a gear.

314

CHRIS LAUGHS

315
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,359
GEAR CRUNCHES
Oh, no! Oh, no!

316
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,559
No...

317
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,359
I'm panicking. I'm on a B road.

318
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,879
THEY LAUGH

319
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,799
Go on, you can get third now.

320
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
No, I don't want to.
What's your strategy for the hill?

321
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,960
Stay in first.

322
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,479
And after a Flintoff
double-declutching masterclass...

323
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,839
GEARS CRUNCH

324
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,599
What are you doing?! No, no!

325
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,639
Double-clutch it. I am!

326
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,679
..we eventually ground our way

327
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,680
up to the final stage of
our trials roller-coaster...

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
..in no way prepared
to reach the finish.

329
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,919
Here we go, son.
Right, no messing about.

330
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,759
Man and machine in perfect harmony!

331
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,279
Go on, son.

332
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,119
WHISTLE BLOWS

Here we go, lads.

335
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,479
Be very careful.
Do you want to do some bouncing?

336
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,039
Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, Fred.

337
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,239
Gas, gas, gas! Easy.

338
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,920
That's it. We're up, we're up.

339
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,479
Keep going. Right-hander, Fred!
Right-hander!

340
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
Ooh, ooh, I don't like this.

341
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,560
THEY ALL SHOUT

342
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,439
Bounce, bounce! No more revs!

343
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,799
Ohh!

344
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Yes, that was amazing!
Yes, come on, 19.

345
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,319
Come on, Fred. Keep going, Fred.

346
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,399
Bounce, bounce, bounce!

347
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,640
Bounce.

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,039
Bounce!

349
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm bouncing.
I can't bounce any more.

350
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,559
Keep going, keep going!
We're up to 25, Fred!

351
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,599
THEY ALL SHOUT

352
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,999
What a result!
What's all the fuss about?

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,799
Keep going!
What's all the fuss about?

354
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,719
PADDY CHEERS

355
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,439
Thank you. Ohh...

356
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,039
Why have I not done it all day?
Ohh! That was fantastic.

357
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,119
Oh, you abs... I tell you what,
you better get running!

358
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,600
When this car stops,
I'm going to knock you out.

359
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,879
A top-marks finish for Flintoff...

360
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,079
Ow!

361
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,360
..and our first taste of trials
had finished on a high.

362
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,039
Had we won?

363
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,239
Course we hadn't.

364
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,759
Worth another go, though?

365
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,240
You betcha.

366
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,680
PROJECTOR WHIRS AND STOPS

367
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,999
We like old cars, don't we?

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,599
I've got to say,
all things considered,

370
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,039
I think that went pretty well.

371
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,039
It was a nice day out
in the country. Yeah.

372
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,839
And I love that,
all over the UK, every weekend,

373
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,479
people are doing daft things in
cars. I don't just mean trialling.

374
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,479
Banger racing,
sidecars, hill-climbing.

375
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,919
It makes me proud to be British.
It certainly does.

376
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,199
Proper eccentric motorsport.

377
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,559
And if you're part of -

378
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,879
and I mean this
with the greatest of respect -

379
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,359
an even weirder race series
than that one,

380
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,519
let us know,
and we'll be right there.

381
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,799
And now we must move on,

382
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,479
because every now and again
we get a polite email saying,

383
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,159
"Forget about all those supercars.

384
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,079
"How about reviewing a car that
normal people might actually buy?"

385
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,759
We do get a lot of those,
and they're not always polite.

386
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,239
But they've got a point.

387
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,999
Well, it's about time
we tackled some affordable stuff,

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,879
so we sent Chris off
to do a proper, sensible,

389
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,479
real-world car review, in
the world's most sensible country,

390
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,880
Norway.

391
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,679
CHRIS: Yes, with snow on the ground
for six months of the year,

392
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,719
and a reputation for handing out

393
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,479
the strictest driving fines
in Europe,

394
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,479
Norway is a country
that demands a sensible,

395
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,840
no-nonsense approach to motoring.

396
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,559
And that makes it the ideal spot

397
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,760
to bring you a sensible,
no-nonsense compact crossover.

398
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,279
This is the new Ford Puma.

399
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,639
It starts at around 23 grand
and, right now,

400
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,600
it's one of the most popular cars
on sale in the UK.

401
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,720
And straight away,
it's easy to see why.

402
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,879
For starters, it looks quite good.

403
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,839
It's a bit froggy up front,
with the eyes

404
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,519
but, other than that, I like it.

405
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,839
And inside here,
you don't feel deprived.

406
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,559
I've got all the functions
of a very expensive car.

407
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,439
I've even got
a heated steering wheel,

408
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,959
which, given we're in Norway,
is a lovely thing.

409
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,879
And because it's a Ford,
it goes down the road beautifully.

410
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,879
I can't complain.

411
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,759
Not least because,
for an extra £6,000,

412
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,160
you can have your Puma
with a slightly bigger bite.

413
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,799
This is the ST model
with the 200-horsepower,

414
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,399
1.5-litre turbo-charged
petrol engine.

415
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,639
0 to 60 - six-and-a-half seconds.

416
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,079
137mph flat out.

417
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,999
And, best of all,
in these fuel-troubled times,

418
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,160
it'll do over 40 miles
to the gallon.

419
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,919
The Puma ST isn't just fast
and frugal, though.

420
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,559
You'll also be pleased to hear

421
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,880
that it has everyday usability
built in, too.

422
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,879
There's more boot space here
than you get in a Ford Focus -

423
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,959
456 litres.

424
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,359
You wanted real-world reviews,
I'm giving you a real-world review.

425
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,439
And down here is something
Ford calls the MegaBox.

426
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,839
It's a waterproof hose-out tub
for anything

427
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,719
that you might need to store
in a waterproof hose-out tub.

428
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,359
It's even got a drainage plug

429
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,079
just in case anything
you put in there suffers any...

430
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,360
..seepage.

431
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,240
So there you go -
it really is the complete package.

432
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,279
Well done, Ford, for making
the Puma affordable to run,

433
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,520
and if you get the ST version,
pretty decent to drive, too.

434
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,319
But if you're thinking the ST
still doesn't quite have the zip

435
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,999
you're looking for
from your next compact crossover,

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,200
there is also a slightly faster one.
ENGINE ROAR ECHOES

437
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,200
Yes, it's a rally car!

438
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,279
The Ford Puma Rally1.

439
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,919
Wah-hoo!

440
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,039
I've never driven anything like it.

441
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,639
It is a monster!

442
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,360
ENGINE ROARS

443
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,599
This Puma has been built to compete

444
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,040
in the World Rally Championship's
new era of hybrid racing.

445
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,839
And that means that M-Sport,

446
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,680
the legendary British rally
engineers that built it...

447
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,400
..have boosted its four-cylinder
turbo petrol engine...

448
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,520
..with a battery-powered
electric motor.

449
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,599
All working together,

450
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,360
this Puma produces
over 500 horsepower.

451
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,800
Whoa-ho!

452
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,360
The performance is outrageous.

453
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,959
This thing will do 0 to 60

454
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,320
in about three seconds
on pretty much any surface.

455
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,239
I can't begin to describe
the way it stops, as well.

456
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,239
I've got regenerative braking,

457
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,319
so the harder I brake,
the more I charge the hybrid system.

458
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,160
It makes for a wild ride,
it really does.

459
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,479
There she goes.

460
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,439
Now let's feel the hybrid.
Push the pedal down.

461
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,480
Oh, my Lord!

462
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
How does it do that on ice?!

463
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,039
Part of the reason, of course,
is that, unlike the Puma ST,

464
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,759
the Rally1 comes equipped
with four-wheel drive.

465
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,799
Plus, there's a super-strong
steel space frame

466
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,919
clad in lightweight body panels

467
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,760
that makes the Rally1
a full 100kg lighter.

468
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,439
However, the extra performance

469
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,199
that all this and that modern
hybrid power brings

470
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,959
does come at a price.

471
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,479
It costs about
three-quarters of a million quid,

472
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,879
which I know is quite steep,
but right now,

473
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,399
I can't think of anything
I'd rather spend

474
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,039
the same amount of money on
more than this.

475
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,359
Whoa-ho!

476
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,519
ENGINE ROARS

477
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,999
You'll notice
I'm using a gear lever.

478
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,439
I've not seen that in about 25 years
in World Rallying.

479
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,919
The regulations want a more
mechanical, analogue car this year -

480
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,079
they've certainly got one.

481
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,480
Woohoo!

482
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,639
It's a fascinating car to drive

483
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,439
because, in some respects,
it's exactly what I expected.

484
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,759
In others, it requires
a lot more management,

485
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,239
and I've got so much respect
for the drivers now.

486
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,799
They really aren't just
arcade game machines.

487
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,240
They require concentration
and more skill than I've got.

488
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,239
ENGINE ROARS

489
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,920
Oh, yes. Listen to that.

490
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,560
Or, in fact, don't...

491
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,039
ENGINE ROAR STOPS

492
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,159
..because another advantage
of the Rally1

493
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,439
over its more affordable cousin

494
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,079
is that on the regular commute
between your rally stages,

495
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,600
you can drive
in clean, green silence.

496
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,959
Nothing to see here.

497
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,440
Just driving along
in my electric World Rally car.

498
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,799
It's a genuine hybrid.

499
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,759
Ooh! I wonder if M-Sport
kept the MegaBox.

500
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
We can maybe stop for provisions.

501
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,199
The Rally1 can do
12 miles in EV mode,

502
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,519
so long as you drive it gently.

503
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,319
Hello.

504
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,080
ENGINE ROARS

505
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,639
But it has to be said,

506
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,559
if you ever do find yourself
behind the wheel of one,

507
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,400
driving it gently is
the last thing you'll want to do.

508
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,399
Oh, my Lord, it's fast. It's fast.

509
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,160
HE LAUGHS

510
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,839
To be honest with you, and you
might have already guessed this,

511
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,599
this thing's got about
as much to do with a Puma

512
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,320
as I have a fighter jet...

513
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,919
..but on these roads,
in these conditions? Unbeatable.

514
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,600
Fastest car on the planet.

515
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,280
Sensational!

516
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

517
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,599
That is a monster.

518
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,239
It's a monster. It really is.

519
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,119
So let me get this right,
you went off to review

520
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,759
a sensible car
that people could afford. Yeah.

521
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,319
And you ended up driving
a £750,000 rally car?

522
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,119
Yeah, apologies. But in my defence,

523
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,039
there was some take-home
consumer advice there. Wasn't there?

524
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,759
If you want a small crossover,
day-to-day stuff,

525
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,759
perfect - Puma ST.

526
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,839
If you want to enter
the World Rally Championship,

527
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,279
take the rally car.

528
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,359
Helpful as ever, Chris.
There you go.

529
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,839
And now we move on to a question.

530
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,519
What's the best letter in motoring?

531
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,759
Do you know, you two?
The one on the old boot lid.

532
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,799
Ooh, this is
my kind of question, this is.

533
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,279
I'd say R -
could be race or rally.

534
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,799
If you see R, you know it's
going to be something special.

535
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,199
I'm going T. Turbo. Touring.

536
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,079
You like tourers. Love a tourer.

537
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,079
All right, strong guesses.
Both wrong.

538
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,000
Because the best letter
in motoring is this one...

539
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,240
M, as in BMW's legendary...

540
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,359
..M Division,

541
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,279
the German engineering geniuses
who've been churning out

542
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,520
some of the world's finest fast cars
for five decades.

543
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,799
This year, 2022,

544
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,159
marks 50 years of the M Division.

545
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,759
So, to celebrate,

546
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,559
I thought I'd invite along
some VIP guests.

547
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,439
And what a guest list this is.
Oh, yes!

548
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,119
Over the years, the M Division
has given us some proper legends.

549
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,519
But just think,
none of these would be here today

550
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,760
if Ford hadn't been
so annoyingly good.

551
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,039
You see, back in the late '60s
and early '70s,

552
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,759
Ford was dominating
world motor sport.

553
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,079
Its GT40 was a four-time
Le Mans winner,

554
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,159
and in the European
Touring Car Championship,

555
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,759
its gorgeous Capri
was busy trashing rivals...

556
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,880
..like BMW.

557
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,159
Hellbent on getting
their own back,

558
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:36,039
in 1972, BMW poached Ford's
motor sport boss, Jochen Neerpasch.

559
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,199
His brief was to build
world-beating cars

560
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,399
for the racetrack and road.

561
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,840
His department would become
the M Division.

562
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,479
And here's what
they cooked up first.

563
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,479
This is the precursor to all
those wonderful M cars to come.

564
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,439
This, my friends,
is a three-litre CSL,

565
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,999
also known as the Batmobile.

566
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,319
# Nobody gonna take my car

567
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,479
# Gonna race it to the ground... #

568
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,999
Lightweight, tuned-up,
with proper working downforce,

569
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,639
it was nothing short
of a race car for the road,

570
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,119
that wasn't technically road legal.

571
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,799
The idea was,
you took it on a track,

572
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,599
you whizzed round all day,
humming the theme to Batman,

573
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,679
and then,
before you got back on the road,

574
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,839
you whipped off the rear wing,
put it in the boot and off you went.

575
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,079
Obviously, it was the '70s

576
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,319
and, obviously, no-one did that.

577
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,680
Happier times!

578
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,520
The Batmobile was an instant icon.

579
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,799
And what better way
for the M Division to follow it

580
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,080
than with a supercar.

581
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,159
The M1 arrived in 1978,

582
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,319
proof to the world
that it wasn't just Italy

583
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,719
who could do the whole slinky,
mid-engine performance thing.

584
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,879
But, pretty as it was -
and reliable to boot -

585
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,400
the M1 was really
a bit of a sideshow...

586
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,079
..because the car that would
come to truly define the M badge

587
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,679
would arrive a few years later,

588
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,879
in 1986.

589
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,239
The birth of a legend.

590
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,279
MUSIC: Blue Monday
by New Order

591
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,240
The original BMW M3.

592
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,160
It might be nearly 40 years old,
but this is peak M car right here.

593
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,799
Pure,

594
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,479
raw,

595
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,879
joyous...

596
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,519
TYRES SCREECH

597
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,680
..M!

598
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,159
Just like the old Batmobile,

599
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,280
the M3 was shot through
with motorsport DNA.

600
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,039
Suspension, brakes, gearbox -

601
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,839
all of it came
from the racing world.

602
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,479
It might have had
just 200 horsepower,

603
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,520
but trust me,
that was all it needed.

604
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,039
It's light, it's sparkly.

605
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,119
It feels alive, this thing!

606
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,839
TYRES SCREECH

607
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,839
It's like a Border collie
itching to get out for a walk.

608
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
"Get down, Shep, get down!"

609
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,439
MUSIC: Relax
by Frankie Goes to Hollywood

610
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,399
In fact, the only downside
to the original M3

611
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,239
was that it did attract
a certain crowd.

612
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,279
SHOUTS: Hello? What's that?
No, I'm in an M3!

613
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,639
# Relax, don't do it... #

614
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,840
Yes, the '80s saw
the arrival of the yuppie.

615
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,359
Those wannabe Wolves of Wall Street

616
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,119
all needed something
cutting-edge and continental

617
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,280
to match their monster Motorolas
and flash Rolexes.

618
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,760
The M Division's finest
was the perfect choice.

619
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,679
Which meant the M3 did gain
a little bit of a bad reputation.

620
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,079
You know all those typical
BMW driver stereotypes?

621
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,359
Well, this is the car
that started it all.

622
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,199
# Relax, don't do it... #

623
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,079
LAUGHING: But I can forgive all that

624
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,839
because this thing
is absolute perfection.

625
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,240
Oh...

626
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,719
And now that the M Division
had found their formula,

627
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,999
they set about refining it.

628
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,319
Understated on the outside,
race-bred underneath,

629
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,599
the next couple of decades
brought bigger engines,

630
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,320
more power, more speed.

631
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,159
And it all reached
a bit of a head...

632
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,639
..with this.

633
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,719
The 2004 BMW M5.

634
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,399
You see, in the early noughties,

635
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,639
BMW's F1 car was powered
by a big, revvy V10 engine.

636
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,999
So the good people
at the M Division thought,

637
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,040
"Hey, why can't we put one of those
in a family saloon?"

638
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,999
Well, it turned out...

639
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,079
..they could.

640
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,999
And it sounds like...

641
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,279
INTENSE ENGINE REVS

642
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,880
..the end of days.

643
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,440
Ha-ha! This is fast!

644
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,360
Whoa!

645
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,000
500 brake horsepower.

646
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,079
It'll still spin past 8,000 RPM.

647
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,160
If you take the limiter
off this thing...

648
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,719
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

649
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,880
..they reckon it'll go up to 200mph.

650
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
It's absolutely bananas!

651
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,199
This was the M Division
declaring to the world

652
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,799
that, when it comes
to supercar-quick saloons,

653
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,840
nobody else comes close.

654
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,359
These are what the M Division
are all about.

655
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,639
And, yes, over the years,
they've dabbled with quick SUVs

656
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,799
and other odds and ends,
but these?

657
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,719
These are the heartland.

658
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,039
In fact, you can trace a line
right from the original M3,

659
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,600
through all of these,
all the way up to this...

660
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,839
..the new M3.

661
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,240
A car that's channelling 50 years
of M Division know-how.

662
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,720
HE CHUCKLES

663
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,040
Get round there!

664
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,919
Man alive!

665
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,999
It's packing 500 horsepower

666
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
from a twin-turbo
six-cylinder engine.

667
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,400
And that's just the start.

668
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,560
It's got an eight-speed
automatic gearbox.

669
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,520
A clever four-wheel-drive option.

670
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,599
You can configure
the steering, dampers...

671
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,480
You can even do the brake pedal!

672
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,880
It is big, and it is clever.

673
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,279
Oh, and did I mention?

674
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,119
Very, very fast.

675
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,000
ENGINE REVS

676
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,800
Yes! You little German beauty!

677
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,880
But on the subject of beauty...

678
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,639
..it's hard to ignore

679
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,919
that massive-nostrilled
elephant in the room.

680
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,239
There's no getting
around it, is there?

681
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,599
Who signed that off?

682
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,919
I know they say beauty's
in the eye of the beholder,

683
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,159
but come on!

684
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,959
Whoever designed that

685
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,519
needs to have a long, hard look
at theirself in the mirror.

686
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,439
And talking downsides,
for a car wearing that badge,

687
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,640
there is a bigger one.

688
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,439
It's overcomplicated.

689
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,359
Yes, it's fast
and it's fun to drive,

690
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,279
but you feel disconnected from it.

691
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,359
The computer takes over
and does everything.

692
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,919
So if you look at it on paper,
it's the ultimate machine.

693
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,440
But is it the ultimate
driving machine?

694
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,160
I'm not so sure.

695
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,199
The trouble is, over the years,

696
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,599
all cars have become bigger,
heavier and more complicated.

697
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,399
And that's where
M cars have gone, too.

698
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,599
But then, every now and again,

699
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,039
they go and build a car
that lets you know

700
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,360
they haven't completely forgotten
where they came from.

701
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,959
The 1M.

702
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,919
A purified, pocket-sized,
back-to-basics coupe

703
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,559
that turned up back in 2011

704
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,960
as a true spiritual successor
to the original M3.

705
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,519
It is good to be back.

706
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,559
I used to own one of these.

707
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,639
And, yes, I absolutely loved it.

708
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,480
Let's see if it's as good
as I remember.

709
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,559
MUSIC: Block Rockin' Beats
by The Chemical Brothers

710
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,239
ENGINE REVS

711
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,360
Oh-ho! Here we go.

712
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,999
This is what it's all about.

713
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,239
TYRES SCREECH

714
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,000
No fancy dampers,
no multi-mode brake pedal.

715
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,999
Just a dinky car...

716
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,119
Whoa!

717
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,079
..with a punchy engine,
rear-wheel drive,

718
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,720
and someone clinging onto
the steering wheel for dear life.

719
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,760
Yes! Come on!

720
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,199
What made the 1M so special
was that,

721
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:51,079
with just 335 horsepower,
it was never about raw performance.

722
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,000
Its M-car genius
was all in the feel.

723
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,600
Woohoo!

724
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,559
Oh, man, I love
the little short gear changes.

725
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,359
I love the steering wheel.
I love everything about this car.

726
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,000
You're totally connected to it.

727
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,639
Do you know what?

728
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,119
When they get it right,
they get it right.

729
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,920
This thing is absolute driving joy.

730
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,999
Why did I get rid of it?!

731
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,359
Well, I know why -

732
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,200
me wife told me to.

733
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,239
Happy birthday, M Division.

734
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,519
And here's to
50 more glorious years.

735
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,680
TYRES SCREECH
Get out there!

736
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

737
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,599
Double teapot.

738
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,799
I'm not happy either.
Not happy.

739
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,919
McGuinness, how could you
go and do that without me?

740
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,679
BMW M cars is my specialist subject.
I can talk about them for hours.

741
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,479
That's exactly
why we didn't send you.

742
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,959
LAUGHTER

743
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,719
Looking down the line, they're not
getting any prettier, are they?

744
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,799
Well, I mean, what's going on
with these grilles, Christopher?

745
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,639
I don't know. The car looks
better if I stand here. Yeah.

746
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,479
Why, though?
What was the reasoning behind it?

747
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,839
Well, they apparently designed it
after Fred Flintoff -

748
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,279
two massive teeth
down the front end. Oh! Oh!

749
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,359
Why? Oh... Why? I've got feelings.

750
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,079
And now, we must move on
to talk about the future.

751
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,159
Cos we all know the petrol era
is coming to an end,

752
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,319
which, for your
traditional petrolhead,

753
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,919
might sound like bad news.

754
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,999
But don't worry, because we're here
to tell you that the future of fuel

755
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,560
is starting to look
very interesting.

756
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,480
Let's begin...

757
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520
..with battery power.

758
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,879
Because for a long time now,
if you wanted to go green,

759
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,519
batteries have been pretty much
your only option.

760
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,319
But, let's be honest,
it's only just lately

761
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,920
that they've really
started turning heads.

762
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,719
Take the sensational
Back To The Future styling

763
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,519
of Hyundai's IONIQ 5.

764
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,519
The Mustang Mach-E -

765
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,440
a family crossover that packs
nearly 500 horsepower.

766
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,599
Or how about a car
that looks to be heading

767
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,000
where no EV has gone before?

768
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,439
The CUPRA Born.

769
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,040
Strange name, interesting car.

770
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,880
This could be the first-ever
all-electric hot hatch.

771
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,360
Wahey!

772
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,960
Now, it's based
on VW's not-very-hot ID.3.

773
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,239
But over in the Spanish sunshine,

774
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,239
CUPRA, the new sporty wing of SEAT,
has been busy heating things up.

775
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,079
Compared to the ID.3, this is lower,
the suspension's sharper,

776
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,839
and this particular one
is around 200 horsepower.

777
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,800
All very hot-hatchy. Whoa-ho!

778
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,039
What's a bit less hot-hatchy,
though,

779
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,760
is that old eco problem of
lugging around a big, heavy battery.

780
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,759
The weight's all low down,

781
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,199
which means it's pretty flat
into the corners,

782
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,399
but it's just missing
a little bit of zip,

783
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,720
a little bit of zing.

784
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,520
Nah.

785
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,960
It's more of a lukewarm hatch.

786
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,439
Tepid. Cool to the touch.

787
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,160
Cool-to-the-touch hatch.

788
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,159
So, no, at just over 30 grand,

789
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,199
the Born isn't going to
tempt you away from your Golf GTI.

790
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,919
But it does show
that more affordable EVs

791
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,560
are just starting to have some fun.

792
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,679
The Born is injecting
a little bit of Latin flair

793
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,760
into the beige world
of electric hatchbacks.

794
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,879
Which is all well and good.

795
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,719
But up at the top of the range,

796
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,160
EVs have been putting on a very
convincing show for a while now.

797
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,520
Mostly thanks to this.

798
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,719
TYRES SCREECH

799
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,959
The Porsche Taycan.

800
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,639
The unbelievably quick,
incredibly capable four-door saloon

801
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,919
that has been embarrassing
petrol performance cars

802
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,239
since it launched
a couple of years ago.

803
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,800
And now, to keep the great
battery charge advancing...

804
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,320
..the Germans have sent in
some backup.

805
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,199
The Audi e-tron GT.

806
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,839
This might just be
the first electric car

807
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,559
you could buy on looks alone.

808
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,600
It's an absolute knockout!

809
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,439
And it's beautiful inside too.

810
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,399
They've not gone
Tesla minimalist here.

811
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,159
It feels like a posh Audi -
an even posher Audi than normal!

812
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,359
Underneath the fantastic
fit and finish,

813
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,559
the GT actually shares
the same chassis, gearbox,

814
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,720
and a lot of the same technology
as the Taycan.

815
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,119
And do you know what?

816
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,919
It might actually be better
to drive than the Porsche.

817
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,519
It's a bit more comfortable.

818
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,359
The whole chassis feels
just a bit more intuitive.

819
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,119
This is an Audi
that's better to drive

820
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,719
than the equivalent Porsche.

821
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,679
I mean, the world's
been turned upside down.

822
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,080
There are no rules any more.

823
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,440
What there is instead...

824
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,640
..is power.

825
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,879
Now, this version
has over 500 horsepower,

826
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,759
and this isn't even
the fastest one.

827
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,919
But this is still absurdly quick,
it really is.

828
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,560
You don't need a car
faster than this.

829
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,639
And here's the best bit.

830
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,999
Crusty old journalists like me
have complained for years

831
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,039
that Audis don't oversteer.
Watch this.

832
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,480
TYRES SCREECH

833
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,400
Straight away, massive, massive
rear-wheel-drive skids.

834
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,120
HE LAUGHS

835
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,599
So new electric cars -
no longer boring.

836
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,600
And it doesn't stop there.

837
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,479
Because whether
it's a charged-up Cobra,

838
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,079
a battery-powered Beetle,

839
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,879
or a Defender
that's swapped diesel for DC,

840
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,519
there are now loads
of companies out there

841
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,959
giving timeless classics
a new lease of life

842
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,320
by swapping their fumey old engines
for batteries and motors.

843
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,199
Although, it must be said,

844
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,360
for your traditional petrolhead,
this is...

845
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,839
..a tricky area.

846
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,519
Hey, now, this is a bit of you
at the end, innit?

847
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,919
What do you reckon about
having an electric motor in one?

848
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,839
I just don't know. I'm so confused.
Mm. I love my 911,

849
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,079
and I love it because of the sound
of the flat-six. Absolutely.

850
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,519
I mean, this is what I lie awake
at night thinking about.

851
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,959
So, I...
HE SIGHS

852
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,599
I were going to say,
we're going to drive one apiece.

853
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,719
I think I know which one
you're going to go for.

854
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,919
I've got to have a go in it. Yeah.
Do you know what I'm going to do?

855
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,000
The old e-Defender.
I'm going to give it a whirl.

856
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,399
Why's it got exhaust pipes?
Has yours got exhaust pipes?

857
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,680
What?

858
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,039
Sacrilegious as it may seem, though,
what cannot be denied

859
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,519
is the performance
this kind of transplant yields,

860
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,399
as we shall now demonstrate
with a drag race.

861
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,880
Electric classics versus their old
fossil-fuelled equivalents.

862
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,000
MAN ON RADIO: Three, two, one, go!

863
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,640
Whooooa! Oh, my God!

864
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,440
I've just been done by a Defender.

865
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,159
I'm in a Defender! Wow!

866
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,520
Wow, look at him go!

867
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,399
But now I'm going.

868
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,880
CAMERA CLICKS

869
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,040
There's the Porsche. Yes!

870
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,359
And now we're going away.

871
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,000
Over the line at 120. That's quick.

872
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,719
Wha-hey-hey!

873
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,000
Whoa! Oh!

874
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,199
Oh, my...

875
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,359
That Defender off the line,
good Lord!

876
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,959
Oh, here's the other little Porsche.

877
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,719
Here he is.

878
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,320
Too late now. Already got it.

879
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,359
OK, electric...

880
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,160
..demolishes petrol
in a straight line.

881
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,839
I have just literally left
a Porsche for dead

882
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,920
in a Land Rover Defender.

883
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,360
What a time to be alive!

884
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,120
I want one of these.

885
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,519
Can you imagine
just someone pulling up

886
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,519
at the side of you at the lights
thinking, "Oh, I'll burn this off"?

887
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,920
And you're like, "Will ya?"

888
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,759
And the best part is...

889
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,719
Whaaaaaaaaa!

890
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,559
..when it comes
to the future of fuel,

891
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,120
batteries aren't even
the most exciting tech going.

892
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,679
Time for our next fuel
of the future,

893
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,080
with Professor Harris.

894
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,999
Hydrogen.

895
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,319
The most abundant element
in our universe.

896
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,839
And if you can get it on its own,

897
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,039
it's something
you can power your car with.

898
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,879
Now, the science behind it
is pretty straightforward.

899
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,999
In one end comes some hydrogen,

900
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,679
and it mixes with oxygen
from the atmosphere.

901
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,119
There they go - mix, mix.

902
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,319
And through a complicated
exchange of protons

903
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,759
and electrons and other things,
you get - this is the clever bit -

904
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,799
electricity.

905
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,679
That and that equals that.
Isn't it brilliant?

906
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,039
And the only by-product,

907
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,279
the thing that comes
out of your exhaust,

908
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,999
is this - good old H2O.

909
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,159
Water.

910
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,279
Now, if you've extracted your
hydrogen using green electricity,

911
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,479
the whole process
is carbon-neutral.

912
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,399
And the even cleverer thing is...

913
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,680
..hydrogen packs a punch.

914
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,839
Now, in rocket A,
we have two grams of petrol.

915
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,599
And in rocket B,
we have two grams of hydrogen.

916
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,319
And we're going to find out
which produces the biggest bang.

917
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,519
Serious science, this.

918
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,039
So, first up - petrol.

919
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,119
Lovely, explode-y petrol.

920
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,240
BEEP

921
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,079
OK.

922
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,319
And now - hydrogen.

923
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,360
BEEP

924
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,920
That's a clear win for hydrogen.

925
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,720
The only problem is...

926
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,159
..while a few companies

927
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,599
are developing this exciting,
elegant technology,

928
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,719
up to now,
the most exciting, elegant car

929
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,640
that anyone's found to put it in...

930
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,000
..is this.

931
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,999
The Toyota Mirai. Yes.

932
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,679
It essentially just drives
like an electric car.

933
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,279
Well, that's what a hydrogen car is.

934
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,319
It's just storing its energy
in different ways.

935
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,599
A normal electric car conventionally
has a battery. This stores hydrogen,

936
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,319
and then uses a fuel cell
to convert it.

937
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,079
You have a tank out the back,

938
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,079
and you can fill this thing up
like you would a petrol car.

939
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,319
It's a liquid. So, fill it up,
away you go.

940
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,599
A couple of minutes,
400 miles of range.

941
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,839
Try that in an electric car.
Now, I must say,

942
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,199
that is quite a good thing
compared to electric cars.

943
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,079
That's what drives me mad
with electric cars.

944
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,279
Exactly. Is the amount of time
you've got to put...

945
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,199
So where do you fill up
an hydrogen car?

946
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,279
There are fuel stations
all over the country.

947
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,879
How many? 12.

948
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,199
12? 12.

949
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,839
Last year... Yeah?

950
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,199
..there were 15 people born
in this country... Yeah?

951
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,079
..given the name Lucifer.

952
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,959
LAUGHING: No, there weren't!

953
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,639
So you've got more chance
of running into a baby Lucifer

954
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,319
than you have of finding
a hydrogen fuel station.

955
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,919
Well, it's got its downsides, OK?

956
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,519
But these are the upsides,
all right?

957
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,159
First of all, we're not carting
around a great big battery,

958
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,519
which is really, really heavy.

959
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,799
Second of all, you read
all these stories about

960
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,799
digging up nasty metals
from the ground

961
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,479
and all the stuff
that goes on with that.

962
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,359
Cobalt. There's none of that, OK?

963
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,599
And thirdly, you can use
the existing petrol network.

964
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,559
So, if you go to BP,

965
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,719
where there's LPG,
there could by hydrogen.

966
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,119
Come on, get on board, Pad.

967
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,319
I am on board, believe it or not.
And this goes quite well. Come on.

968
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,279
Yeah, the science stacks up,
no denying that.

969
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,359
So why have they put it all
in something so vanilla?

970
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,959
We need a hydrogen supercar.

971
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,039
I agree. Er, can we now do
something more exciting?

972
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,600
Cos I am getting quite sleepy here.
Yes.

973
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,360
Indeed we could.

974
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,399
Because what if
there was a way to go green

975
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,639
without giving up
on the combustion engine?

976
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,679
MOTOR REVS

977
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,639
A way to go green
without giving up all that noise.

978
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,959
MOTOR REVS

979
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,439
That drama.

980
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,639
That soul.

981
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,360
MOTOR REVS

982
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Introducing synthetic fuel.

983
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,440
TYRES SCREECH

984
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,000
Look at the go on that Lamborghini!

985
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,320
Man alive!

986
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,560
Whoa-ho-ho!

987
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,399
What a machine.

988
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,559
These synthetic fuels,

989
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,559
they're pretty big news
at the moment.

990
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,279
The fuel that's in this car

991
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,919
was the brainchild of genius
Formula 1 engineer Paddy Lowe.

992
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,680
So I am literally Paddy-powered,
but in the right way.

993
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,599
What very clever engineers
like Mr Lowe have managed to do

994
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,959
is create a petrol made not from oil

995
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,199
but from carbon dioxide
captured from the air

996
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,240
and hydrogen extracted from water.

997
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,479
The result is a fuel
that, when burned,

998
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,839
emits only the CO2
that was extracted

999
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,400
to make it in the first place.

1000
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,079
So, as long as you're using green
electricity to power production,

1001
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,600
it is completely carbon-neutral.

1002
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,519
And the really good thing
about this is,

1003
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,319
it'll work in any petrol car,
no matter how old or how new.

1004
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,479
You can even mix it
with your regular fuel.

1005
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,120
It's absolute genius!

1006
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,439
And it might just save
some of these old dinosaurs

1007
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,160
from extinction.

1008
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,519
Ah!

1009
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,959
They say the Aventador
will be the last Lamborghini

1010
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,640
without electrical assistance.

1011
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,879
The last free-breathing, pure V12.

1012
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,360
And just listen to that noise!

1013
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,679
759 horsepower.

1014
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,680
ENGINE REVS

1015
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,279
This new GT3
just ticks all the boxes.

1016
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,759
Flat-six, normally aspirated,
revs at 9,000 RPM.

1017
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,439
ENGINE REVS

1018
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,639
Whoo!

1019
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,639
Before you go thinking
this is the answer

1020
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,279
to all our petrolhead prayers,
though...

1021
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,719
Ah!

1022
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,480
..we should point out
a couple of drawbacks.

1023
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,999
The main issue being you can't just
pop into your local petrol station

1024
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,359
to fill up with synthetic fuel.

1025
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,439
This stuff is experimental.
It's extremely rare.

1026
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,399
Which means it's expensive.

1027
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,759
And if you want a number -

1028
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,200
at the moment,
about ten quid a litre.

1029
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,639
But, while we wait to see
whether synthetic fuels

1030
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,599
will one day become affordable
enough for the masses,

1031
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,680
what we do at least now know...

1032
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,680
..is that with the sun setting
on fossil fuels...

1033
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,640
..the new dawn is starting
to look very bright indeed.

1034
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1035
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,679
Oh, just stupidly fast.

1036
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,039
Huh?

1037
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,999
I thought it was going to do
a wheelie. They're crazy.

1038
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,119
Oh, man. That was
very informative, boys.

1039
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,839
But what I want to talk about
is these electric classics,

1040
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,919
cos if I was going to get
an electric car,

1041
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,599
apart from that Rivian,
that's how I'd do it.

1042
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,319
All the fun, all the looks,
none of the maintenance.

1043
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,079
And I've got to say,

1044
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,399
the first five seconds
of being in this car,

1045
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,439
that acceleration,

1046
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,079
compared to everything
I've driven on Top Gear,

1047
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,879
that's the most fun I've had, ever.
Anything?

1048
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,799
Aston Martin Victors,
Ferrari Romas, DB5s...

1049
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,759
This, for that first five seconds,
was bonkers.

1050
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,039
You know how he squeaks?
That was peak squeak.

1051
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,919
That was. Oh, it was.
Right up there.

1052
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,919
It was amazing.
It was full squeaking.

1053
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,559
And also, synthetic fuel,
hey, hey? I'm all over this.

1054
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,759
He's been on the internet again.
Here we go. Oh, no.

1055
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,479
It's all the fun of a petrol engine,
completely green.

1056
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,599
That's the magic bullet right there.
It could be, but it just depends

1057
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,479
if they can make it
cheap enough, doesn't it?

1058
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,279
If they can, then we might be
having a lot more fun

1059
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,999
in silly petrol-engine cars
for some time to come.

1060
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,319
Fingers crossed.

1061
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,599
And on that unusually
optimistic note,

1062
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,239
we must end the show,
and the series. What?!

1063
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,799
AUDIENCE AND HOSTS GROAN

1064
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,279
It was like being in panto, that.

1065
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,079
We'll be back later in the year.

1066
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,599
Thank you so much for watching.
Goodnight.

1067
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,840
CHEERING
