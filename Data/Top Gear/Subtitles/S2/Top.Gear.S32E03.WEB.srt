00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,679
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,439
Tonight, a very exciting show
for me,

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,839
because I get to fulfil a proper
bucket-list ambition of mine.

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,959
You finally got your Greggs
gold card.

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,519
No, not that. No?

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,679
Did you read a book?
Don't go mad! Don't go mad.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,999
Tonight's the night I become
a proper trucker.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,879
Yes, we're kicking off
by talking about HGVs.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,039
PADDY HONKS

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,519
That's...me impression of an HGV.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,119
Yes, we are, Pad. Thank you.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,599
Because, as you may have heard,

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,199
Britain is in the grip of an
HGV crisis.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,399
There's not enough drivers
to get the stuff we need

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,599
to the places it needs to go.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,399
But what does it take to be
an HGV driver?

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
We decided to do some
trucking research and find out.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,119
PADDY: Because there's no better way
to learn than "in at the deep end"

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,359
our mission to become
fully fledged HGV drivers

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,519
would start in the sensibly
wide-open space...

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,039
..of Leeds East Airfield,

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,279
where the producers had blagged
a couple of colourful examples

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,479
to see what we'd make of 'em.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,680
Hey, the big leagues.

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,119
Look at these. The big leagues.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,719
Have you driven one of these before?

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,839
Never dri... I've driven a 22-tonne
dump truck. Right.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,079
But I've never been behind
the wheel of an HGV.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,279
And me dad was an HGV driver.
Was he?

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,159
Oh yeah. The romance of it.
Did he let you pull the...?

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,559
HE HONKS

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,279
Oh, all that. I'm all over it.
So... I cannot...

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,399
I think everyone growing up
wants to drive a lorry.

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,759
I'm nervous about it.
You're nervous? Yeah.

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,719
This is the ideal vehicle
for you.

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,799
Your trouble is you've been
getting into little sports cars

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,359
and everything, you've not...
This is you now.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,079
This is you. And as well,
might I add, I've spotted mine.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,319
"McGuinness."

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,839
Do you know what?
I can't even argue, can I?

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,959
That's got you on.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,359
Mine's called Lynda!

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,320
Hey, do you know what...what's
missing here? What?

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,559
The little fella. Yeah.

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,079
But... How's he gonna get in?

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
Exactly! How's he gonna get in?
Exactly!

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,119
Oh, here we go.

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,840
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Come on, get in.

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Oh, there's a bed and everything!

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,639
Oh, look at...
What the hell's this?

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
This can't be right, this.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,159
Oh! This is good.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,479
Oh, seat belt. What's going on?
Come on.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,360
Why's that not coming down now?

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,599
Oh, there we go. That's better.

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,240
Ooh, ooh. Look!

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
Come on. Don't do this to me.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,320
This seat belt's...
Me seat belt's stuck.

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,199
ON RADIO: Ah, good buddy, ten-four.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,959
I'm having a bit of trouble
with me seat belt.

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,359
Has yours locked up as well?
I can't get mine out.

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,560
I didn't see Kris Kristofferson
having this problem in Convoy.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,799
I'm wondering if you've gotta turn
the engine on, Fred, first.

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,520
ENGINE STARTS

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,039
Hey!

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
Oh!

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,999
ON SPEAKER: We've done it!
We've cracked it!

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
Right, come on. Handbrake's off.

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
Is that off?

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,280
Oh!

72
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm moving, Pad.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,639
Oh, hang on.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
We're trucking, young buddy!

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,000
If me dad could see me now. Go on!

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,999
It's so long at the back.
I keep looking.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,520
I don't know where the back is.

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,119
I've driven everything
on Top Gear,

79
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,119
from £1,000 bangers
to £4 million supercars,

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
and this tops the lot.

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,799
I've gotta say, Fred, I've got
the biggest grin on my face.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
This is fantastic.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,519
What gear are you in?

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,719
I "think" third.

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,799
Well, if the early signs
were anything to go by...

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,599
What gear's that?

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,799
..we were natural-born truckers.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,599
GEAR CRUNCHES

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,839
which was just as well,
because it turned out someone else

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
had been busy sneaking in
his own early practice.

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,720
'Ey up - I can spy another rig.

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,399
Not that it mattered.

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,360
BLEEP! Where's the brake pedal?
Sh...

94
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,240
Bit sharp on the brake, but...

95
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,399
What did matter,
now we were all together,

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,759
were a couple of crucial bits
of trucking business.

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,239
Right, now, before we go,
I've got a little app on me phone

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,320
for your official CB call name,
your trucker name.

99
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,279
OK, Chris, we'll start with you.

100
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,120
So it's your initials, CH,
so C...

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,639
..Chopper!

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,319
H... Hog.

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,359
Chopper Hog. That's you.

104
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,279
Right, here's mine. P...

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,520
..Professor.

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,759
Moose. Professor Moose.

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,039
Right, Fred, now I'm gonna give you
the option here.

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,319
Do you wanna start with F or A?

109
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,719
Let's try A first.
I'll go for me Sunday name, Andrew.

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,719
Admiral.

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,360
I chose well.

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
F...

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,280
So you are Admiral Fiddler.

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,199
I am not having that.
I am not having that!

115
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,479
You've just made
my entire year, McGuinness.

116
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,719
Admiral Fiddler!

117
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,080
No!

118
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,319
Official naming ceremony done with,
next on the trucking to-do list

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,280
was the obligatory drag race.

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,159
And since Sean Taylor also seemed
to be a racing enthusiast,

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,079
Harris had to perform.

122
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,559
Now, my brief experience
of this vehicle,

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,239
I was told not to hurry
the gearbox.

124
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,799
I'm gonna be slow gear shifts,
and use the torque.

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
STARTER: Standing by.

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,879
In three, two, one...

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,079
I've stalled it. I've stalled it.

128
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,640
Oh-ho!

129
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,240
STARTER: Standing by to go
in three, two, one.

130
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Go!

131
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,999
Yeah! Here we go.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh! We've done 'em!

133
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,559
Oh, Paddy's off.

134
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,559
Breaker one-nine. Breaker one-nine.

135
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
We've got a big rubber duck.

136
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,319
FREDDIE'S ENGINE SPLUTTERS

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,799
Ooh, that's not right.

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,279
Oh!

139
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,320
He's got... McGuinness has got
a much bigger engine than me.

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,439
What is going on here?

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,919
I'm coming up on Paddy now.

142
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,119
Oh! Yeah, we're going, we're going,
we're going!

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,560
A bit too soon, Fred.
Watch me go, boys! Look at this!

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,199
Oh, God, no! He's back on me!

145
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,560
Damn you, Harris!

146
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
Oh-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho!

147
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, I was in the wrong gear!

148
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,519
We're flying, me and the Scania.

149
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,759
Come on! Come on!

150
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,279
Not a chance, Fiddler.
Not a chance.

151
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,440
Admiral, it is. Admiral!

152
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,360
Look at that!
It's a massive victory!

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,519
Well, lads, I don't know what to
say. That was an annihilation.

154
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,839
Did you stall on the line, Paddy?
I can't remember.

155
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,559
Did you? Was it you or was it Chris?

156
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,839
Yeah, I don't think I stalled.
Did you stall, Fred?

157
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,080
No, I didn't.
I just got in it and did it!

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,079
Now, if you're thinking that,
in the world of HGVs,

159
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,439
a drag race is about
as irrelevant as it gets,

160
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,639
then it's just as well this next bit
was much more important.

161
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,999
Horn.

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,159
I wanna hear your horns.
Let's go, lads. Fred horn first.

163
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,359
DEEP BLAST

164
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,399
It's like the QE2.

165
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,999
HORN CONTINUES

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
McGuinness, let's hear yours.

167
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,279
DAINTY TOOT

168
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,879
What's that?! What's that? "Meep!"

169
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,159
PADDY TOOTS

170
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,439
Gotta be honest,
that's ruined the day for me.

171
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,639
Right, lads, here we go.

172
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,439
LOUD, MELODIC BLARE

173
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,799
Oh!

174
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
HORN CONTINUES

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,159
That's proper!

176
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,639
FREDDIE GROANS

177
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,439
And to make sure we'd turned over
every page

178
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,240
of the HGV driver's playbook,
we still needed to test precision.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,919
So, in the time it took
to lay out a few cones,

180
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,960
we had ourselves
a reversing race.

181
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,479
First to back up into their bay
is king of the big rigs.

182
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,159
STARTER: Three, two...
Come on.

183
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,400
...one, go.

184
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,920
Oh, oh, oh.

185
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
Right, we've got this.

186
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
Here we go.

187
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,319
Straight back.

188
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,039
I can't really see
down the side of it.

189
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm making the turn.

190
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,359
Left hand down.
Left hand down.

191
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,039
Ho-ho-ho. This is tricky!

192
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,599
Oh, God. I'm all over the place.

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm gonna go forwards again.

194
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,639
Whoa!

195
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,279
You've cut me off, Fred.

196
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,519
I can promise you

197
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,039
it's not intentional.

198
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,439
I'll straighten it out.
This is awful!

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,919
Come on. Come on, Harris.

200
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,680
PADDY: You're in my bay,
you clown.

201
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,920
CHRIS LAUGHS

202
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,119
Come on. Come on.

203
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,159
Get out of me bay!

204
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
I'm in, I'm in.

205
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,239
I'm in.

206
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,599
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in, boys!

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,279
How am I supposed to get in?

208
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,079
It doesn't matter
cos I've already won.

209
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,599
You've won because I've had
to wait cos that...

210
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,519
...gormless get cut me off
and then went in my bay!

211
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,360
DEEP HORN BLAST

212
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,479
I'm blocking him in.

213
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,680
LOUD, COMMANDING HORN

214
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,879
I tell you, you'd be causing
murder at Moto services,

215
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,199
you here, Paddy.

216
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,759
You OK, Patrick?

217
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,759
That'll teach you
for taking my bay!

218
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,159
What's happened?

219
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,519
You literally cut me off
and parked in me bay!

220
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,239
This ain't...
Nobody said...

221
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,359
That's yours,
that's his, that's mine!

222
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,079
Nobody said, "That's my bay."

223
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,239
They did...

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,919
Now, at this point,
it was suggested to us that,

225
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,919
if we were ever to become
real-life HGV drivers,

226
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,479
we should probably get
a few lessons,

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,039
so we all booked in on
an intensive training course,

228
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,680
and set out to get our licences
as soon as possible.

229
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,079
Oh, yes!

230
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,080
One qualified truck driver
at your service.

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,479
You are now looking
at a graduate from

232
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,680
the HGV University.
Ho-ho! Nothing can stop me now.

233
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,159
And as the newest member
of the HGV Club,

234
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,399
I was ready to take my place

235
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,680
alongside the great hauliers
of Britain.

236
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,999
Look, look, there's one there.
Look at that.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,479
I can drive that!

238
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,759
I am driving that.
I'm driving this.

239
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,120
It's just bonkers!

240
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,959
HORN HONKS

241
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,519
Ah-ha-ha! Who's this I spy?

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,399
Here we go, Mr McGuinness.

243
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,639
Fully certified
and ready to truck.

244
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,439
This feels very grown-up indeed.

245
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,119
I tell you what, little Chopper,

246
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,519
get yourself up in front, son.

247
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
Go on, tuck in there.

248
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,079
Just one more for a full house.

249
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,759
The Admiral reporting for duty,
sir.

250
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,319
Hello, the Admiral!

251
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,399
Go on, lead us out, son.

252
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
PADDY CHUCKLES

253
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Oh, yes, we had ourselves a convoy.

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,799
Come on, then, lads,
time to own up.

255
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,759
On your HGV test,

256
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,119
how many minor faults?

257
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,439
Just one for me.

258
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,239
Two for the Professor.
Three.

259
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,080
What were yours for,
Chris? Not reaching the pedals?

260
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,999
What about the theory?
First time?

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,399
A first-time pass
for the Professor,

262
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,719
but that was just a given.

263
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Well played, Pad. I must admit,
second time for me.

264
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,199
What about the Chopper?

265
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,639
I technically passed

266
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,039
the first time that I took
the examination.

267
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,999
Explain, Christopher.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,999
The first time, I didn't have
my licence with me

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,599
and they sent me home.

270
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,999
I drove four hours to London
and they sent me home.

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,080
CHUCKLES

272
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,439
It's a cursory lesson

273
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,359
to everyone out there -
follow the rules.

274
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,959
And as I'm realising with
the whole world of trucking,

275
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,760
it's a more grown-up world
than driving a car, isn't it?

276
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,239
Oh, yes, it is,

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,719
especially when you're driving

278
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
the world's most powerful truck.

279
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,079
Welcome to the Scania 770S,

280
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,239
the big dog of the trucking world.

281
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,719
770 horsepower and
a turbo-charged 16-litre V8.

282
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,119
What I'm driving here

283
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,799
is the Bugatti Chiron
of the trucking world.

284
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
Ohhh...

285
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,119
The envious looks
I get off the other truckers!

286
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,480
They all want to be behind
the wheel of the big ol' Scania.

287
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,799
Do they, though?

288
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
Because when you're hauling
serious miles,

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,560
real truckers
know that comfort is king.

290
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,559
You're a trucker, you're in this
for hours and hours every day.

291
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,399
You don't need 700 horsepower,

292
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,879
what you need is space,

293
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,399
somewhere to stretch out.

294
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,919
This is the biggest, most spacious,

295
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,160
most comfortable cab money can buy.

296
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,999
This is the DAF XG+,

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,440
the Rolls-Royce Phantom
of the trucking world.

298
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,600
I've gone tech.

299
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,439
This is the new
Mercedes-Benz Actros,

300
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,600
and it really is
the Tomorrow's World of HGVs.

301
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,359
All the tech you see here,
the camera mirrors,

302
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,439
all the screens,

303
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,159
all the self-driving help
for the HGV driver,

304
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,119
it's going to percolate down

305
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,599
into HGVs over the next five years.

306
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,640
I am driving, quite literally,
the future.

307
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,959
In fact, forget Actros,

308
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,440
this is the Mercedes S-Class
of the trucking world.

309
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,199
And I tell you what,

310
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,080
it's naffing comfortable
and very, very quiet.

311
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,080
So, three proper truckers
in three proper trucks.

312
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,759
It was just as well
that we'd been given

313
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,440
our first trucking mission.

314
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,079
Each of our trailers
had been loaded

315
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,079
with a mystery cargo
that we'd have to deliver

316
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,640
to the south coast of Wales
by early the next morning.

317
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,359
And that meant
we had plenty of time

318
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,519
to squeeze in that
new trucker's rite of passage,

319
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,999
taking a break at a good
old-fashioned truck stop.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,199
I tell you what, they look well,

321
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,719
the three of them together,
don't they?

322
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,919
They do.

323
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,559
I can't believe you boys
haven't embraced

324
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,999
the trucking attire.

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,559
That's not trucking attire!

326
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,759
It is!

327
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,439
Can we walk in a bit behind him?

328
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
The thing is, though,
truck stops these days...

329
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,119
This is way too nice!

330
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,839
...aren't quite as
old-fashioned as you'd think.

331
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,040
Oh...

332
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,600
Oh, very nice.

333
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,479
Chris?
Yes?

334
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,079
I don't want to stereotype
truckers,

335
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,959
but I didn't realise
they wore cufflinks.

336
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,719
I know.
This is...

337
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,439
This is... This is next-gen.

338
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,159
Hello, I'm sorry to ask,
but do you do

339
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,559
an oat-milk latte?
I do.

340
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,079
MILK FROTHING

341
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,759
Hey!

342
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,719
They only do the oat-milk lattes!

343
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,160
Do they?
I can't believe it!

344
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
I've got to say...

345
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,839
...this isn't what I expected.

346
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,879
I thought it was going to be
a greasy-spoon job.

347
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,720
No, this is...
This is proper.

348
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,599
I tell you, I'm spoilt for choice.

349
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,279
Buy a TV!

350
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,040
Look at this, here! Pillows!

351
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,079
What tractors do you drive, anyhow?

352
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,119
I've got the Scania.
The Scania R450.

353
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,159
Ooh.
I'm a 770S man.

354
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,399
Ooh, Scania's quick.
It is quick.

355
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,759
They've got some really nice
ratchet straps here.

356
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,359
I'm thinking of doing
a big shop.

357
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,840
Very civilised. This is lovely.

358
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,239
Lads, if this is trucking,
I'm in.

359
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,879
This is a nice coffee.
If this is trucking, I'm in!

360
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,239
That's a lovely coffee.

361
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,839
I can't understand why there's
a shortage in the industry.

362
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,119
What a way to live!
Best job ever.

363
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,039
And, once we'd fully brimmed

364
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,840
on foamy milk
and freshly baked goods...

365
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,799
...back on the road,

366
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,239
we were soon discovering
that real-world trucking comes

367
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,119
with even more unexpected perks.

368
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,479
I tell you one thing all car drivers

369
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,759
would appreciate about trucks -

370
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,960
the windscreen wipers
are fantastic.

371
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,919
They just give you
the cleanest, crispest wipe -

372
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,639
for want of a better phrase.

373
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,719
And the washers.

374
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,239
Watch this.

375
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,919
Look at that!

376
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,960
Just...perfect sweeping!

377
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Joyous! I love a good wiper.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,439
Do you know what else is lovely
about driving these trucks?

379
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,079
When you're driving past cars,

380
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,959
you can have a good nosey down
at inside the cab.

381
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,119
You get a glimpse into
someone's life, don't you,

382
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,039
when you look into
the car from this angle?

383
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,639
Each to their own.

384
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,159
I'm easily pleased.

385
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,760
CHUCKLES

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,520
And it turns out
so are the producers...

387
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,719
...because since we were making
such effortless progress,

388
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,359
they'd decided it was time
to see who had really come out

389
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
top of the trucking class.

390
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,400
And that meant making a stop
at an RAF base.

391
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,679
Lads, that looks
like two helicopters.

392
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,000
That's a wide load, that is!

393
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,280
Yes, it was.

394
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,879
To test our precision
truck-driving skills,

395
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,319
we'd now take turns towing

396
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,439
an inconveniently arranged
pair of helicopters

397
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,760
through a twisty slalom course.

398
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,679
With a time penalty
for any gates clipped,

399
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,719
the cleanest, fastest run would win,

400
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,719
which meant I'd need
to summon all 625 horsepower

401
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,360
from the mighty Mercedes
15.6-litre straight six.

402
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,119
Yeah, before I set off,
and in advance of you doing it,

403
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,279
I can tell you

404
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,879
that the old camera mirrors
weren't designed for this!

405
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,759
BOTH LAUGH

406
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,519
Well, good luck.

407
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,080
Three, two, one, go!

408
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,399
Hoh!
Ho-hooo!

409
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,039
That's a slow start.

410
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,679
Wowsers!

411
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,919
Why's he going so slow?
I don't know.

412
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,559
Towing two helicopters.
I'm not aware of the weight.

413
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,719
I've got over
2,000 foot-pound of torque.

414
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,159
That's a penalty.
The state of it!

415
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,359
Is that about the middle?

416
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,719
Oh, he's panicking.
Oh, here we go.

417
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,079
This is him now.
Oh, he's at an angle.

418
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,920
Oh, it's at an angle, that,
as well. Look at it!

419
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,919
CLANG!

420
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,399
CHEERING

421
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,439
There we go. That's one over.

422
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,599
First one, bosh!
Knocked it over.

423
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,679
I'm going to give it beans.

424
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,079
We're going to save some time.
I'm giving it beans.

425
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,079
Go on, hit it, hit it,
hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it!

426
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,919
He's got to  get through this one.

427
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,639
Wah-ho!

428
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,799
Straight through at speed!

429
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,280
THEY GROAN
That's disappointing.

430
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,599
I've got to  say,

431
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,159
this place,
like a penthouse.

432
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,759
It's lovely, innit?
I tell you what,

433
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,040
you've not seen any of it.
Absolutely fantastic!

434
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
Right, again,
I'm going flat-out.

435
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
CLANG!
Oh, hit that one.

436
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,879
Ohhh!

437
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,760
BOTH LAUGHING

438
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,519
Oh!
I tell ya. Look at it all.

439
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,439
You've got everything...
I could get into it.

440
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,800
Everything's digital.
...on screens. Apple CarPlay.

441
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,480
Have a try at the
driving seat. How comfy?

442
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,359
CLANG!

443
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,039
Ohhhh! Oh, he's here!

444
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,800
He's back! We forgot about him!

445
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,359
Over the line! For glory!

446
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,799
That... Ohh!
EXHALES

447
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,639
I tell you what, we loved that.

448
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,359
That bit you did down there
and round the back?

449
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Oh, fantastic.

450
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,359
Next, time to see
what Flintoff could do

451
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,280
with 100 less horsepower
in his DAF.

452
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,879
I've got to be honest, Fred,
being back

453
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,439
in the old Scania,
I'm a bit envious of yours.

454
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,799
I tell you what,
the DAF is lovely, isn't it?

455
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,999
And what's that?

456
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,159
I can stand up.

457
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,839
I can stand up with my arms up.

458
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,080
This is my tummy out.

459
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,119
Here we go!

460
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,679
Three, two, one...

461
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,199
Go!
Whoa...

462
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,639
Oh, I expected more
off the line.

463
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,959
Foot's on the floor.

464
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,479
Now, let's watch him
on the first bend, as per.

465
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,239
Now, this is where you caught
one, Christopher.

466
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,439
I caught one on the right.

467
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,839
I'm just guessing.
Just guessing.

468
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,959
CLANG!

469
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,639
Oh, same one!

470
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,119
He's knocked it over.
Same one. So, there you go.

471
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,159
Oh, I tell you what,

472
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,399
it's a different beast
with a bit of weight.

473
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,399
I've got to  say,
being in that DAF,

474
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,599
there's loads of room,
all the tech on it.

475
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,919
The bed, it was electric...

476
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,639
Although I have got
a fridge, here.

477
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,040
Can I show you me fridge?

478
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
Why have you got almond milk?

479
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,959
Oh, oh, oh, not too fast!

480
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,439
Oh, it's cutting in on me.

481
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,159
That wasn't me, that.
It was braking for me.

482
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,760
Oh, he's winged that through,
hasn't he?

483
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,719
Come on.
Straight, straight, straight!

484
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,359
CLANG!
Oh, no!

485
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,239
Knocked the last one.
Ohhhh!

486
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,479
On the left, there!

487
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,039
HORN HONKS
Ho-hooo!

488
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,079
Two down.

489
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,679
Well done, the Fiddler.

490
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,319
BOTH LAUGH

491
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,559
I am not the Fiddler.
I'm the Admiral.

492
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,359
And I don't want a roof neither.

493
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
LAUGHTER

494
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,719
Finally, the Professor

495
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,999
in the world's
most powerful truck.

496
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,759
You're under
a bit of pressure here, Paddy,

497
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,879
with your 700 horsepower.

498
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,359
Watch the power.

499
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,639
OK, here we go!

500
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,920
Three, two, one, go!

501
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,080
Phwoar! Come on!

502
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,199
Whoa. Ooh.

503
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,560
Here we go.

504
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,079
CLANG!

505
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,159
He's clattered it.

506
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,919
I don't even know
if I took one out or not.

507
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,720
I literally cannot see
the end of these propellers.

508
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,479
Oh, he's through.
He's through.

509
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,039
He's not getting
through this one.

510
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,880
He's going to panic.
Oh! Jesus, where am I?

511
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,559
Ho-ho!

512
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,759
The Scania might not be
as luxurious inside,

513
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,640
but, by God, she can go.

514
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,679
Bosh!

515
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,519
Got to have made that through.
He's through there!

516
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,999
He's through there.
Ooh, he's through!

517
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,079
Whoa...!

518
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,399
Whoa!

519
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,719
We don't need this.

520
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,119
OK. It's always a better day
when he doesn't win.

521
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,639
Go! Go! Go!

522
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,639
Oh, I took that quick.

523
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,479
CLANG!
Ho-ho-ho! Hey-hey!

524
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,999
Oh, he's smashed that!

525
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,519
Yea-ah. Yeah!

526
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,119
Come on, the Scania!

527
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,799
Go on, son!

528
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
HORN HONKS

529
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,440
We're over.

530
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,959
I went for speed over precision.

531
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,119
It's an odd look seeing a man

532
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,519
wearing a cheap cowboy hat,

533
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,879
towing two helicopters

534
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,799
in the world's most powerful truck.

535
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,040
Welcome to the BBC!

536
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,239
Where the results were in.

537
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,480
Ah!

538
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,759
Thank you, sir.

539
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,399
Thank you.

540
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,119
Christopher Harris.

541
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,119
Ooh!
Two minutes, 15 seconds,

542
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,799
and that's including

543
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,799
a 15-second penalty
for three hits. Shoddy.

544
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,679
Freddie Flintoff...

545
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,359
...two minutes,

546
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,559
plus a ten-second penalty
for two hits in the DAF.

547
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,879
But...

548
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,239
Oh, no...
...in first place, boys,

549
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,359
was there ever any doubt,

550
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,319
with the 770 horsepower
of the Scania?

551
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,159
One minute, 47 seconds.

552
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,479
LOUD, COMMANDING HORN
Plus a ten-second penalty

553
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,519
for the two hits.

554
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,439
Thank you, boys, giving me
the big... I love that.

555
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,519
That's the truckers' salute.

556
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,039
They recognise...

557
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,559
They recognise a winner.

558
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,559
I've got to say,
he might have been the slowest,

559
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,999
but Chris Harris wins
for that horn.

560
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,879
Let's hear yours, Pad.

561
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,039
HIGH-PITCHED TOOT

562
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,559
Ohhhh!
No!

563
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,199
LAUGHTER

564
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,439
700 horsepower and a little squeak!

565
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,719
No! No!

566
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,560
LOUD, COMMANDING HORN

567
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

568
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,879
You're thinking what?
World Championship!

569
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,119
THEY LAUGH

570
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,359
Hey!

571
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,359
Trucking's in the blood, lads.

572
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,879
I was born to do it.

573
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,839
That Scania V8, what a machine!

574
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,479
Everywhere I went
in that thing,

575
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,079
truckers would come over
to me like, "Respect."

576
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,479
Respect. It was a beast
of a thing, that, a beast.

577
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,479
I must say, I did like
the comfort of the DAF.

578
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,119
That was some truck. And
we found your motorsport, Pad.

579
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
Helicopter transportation.

580
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,279
I've found a niche, Fred.

581
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,759
And I'm going to fill it.

582
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,039
Can I say that on the telly?
I think you just did.

583
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,199
I did, yeah!

584
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,399
Anyway, we'll get back to
that film later in the show,

585
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,319
when things get
a whole lot stormier.

586
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,599
But now, we must move on

587
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,960
to big Chrissie Harris
and a very small car.

588
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,559
Yes, this is the Lotus Elise,

589
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,599
the back-to-basics British
sports car that arrived in 1996

590
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,639
and has been on sale ever since.

591
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,319
Until now,

592
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,559
because Lotus has finally
killed off the Elise

593
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,760
and, in its place, given us
something completely new.

594
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,759
Straight out of Norfolk comes...

595
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,879
...the Emira.

596
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,079
And first impressions are,

597
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,680
it's not what you'd call ugly.

598
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,799
In fact, this two-seat,
mid-engine sports car

599
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,960
looks a million dollars.

600
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,319
But thankfully, this Lotus
doesn't cost $1 million,

601
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,680
or anything close.

602
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,559
The car I'm driving right now -
75 grand.

603
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,559
I know that's not chicken feed,

604
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,079
but you tell me anything
near the same price

605
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,199
that is anything near as good.

606
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,839
There isn't one!

607
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,080
This is supercar looks
for half the supercar price.

608
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,159
And it's from Norfolk.

609
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,800
I love it.

610
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,320
And the good news
doesn't end there.

611
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,559
I hate the word,
but look at it -

612
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,479
it's nice in here.
It's pleasant.

613
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,959
I've got modern screens,
I've got padding on the seats.

614
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,759
There's no water
coming through the roof.

615
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,039
I'm not whacking my elbow
against bits of metal.

616
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,520
This is bold new territory
for Lotus.

617
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,319
Yes, on the road
it's bigger than an Elise,

618
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,799
but, frankly,
there are pencil cases

619
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,679
that are bigger than an Elise.

620
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,719
But I'm on a damp Welsh road,

621
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,559
and this is Lotus territory.

622
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,639
This car is sublime
in these conditions.

623
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,159
It just glides
over the surface.

624
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,760
It breathes with the road.

625
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,279
Lotus is better at making cars

626
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,360
for bumpy British roads than
any other sports car company.

627
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,119
But it's not enough
for this new Emira

628
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,319
just to do the business
on the road. Lotus's history,

629
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,719
its very DNA,

630
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,199
is racing.

631
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,559
And that means

632
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,960
the Emira really has to do
the business on the track...

633
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,079
...where at first glance
you'd be forgiven

634
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,759
for thinking
they've missed a trick.

635
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,999
The engine is
a supercharged V6

636
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
with about 400 horsepower.

637
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,000
ENGINE ROARS

638
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,199
0-60 -
four and a half seconds,

639
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,520
and over 180mph.

640
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,759
I know. Hardly
tear-your-face-off quick

641
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,919
in this day and age.

642
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,079
The truth is, though, Lotus has
never really been too obsessed

643
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,599
with those big numbers.
Lotus's obsession

644
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,319
has always been
what makes the difference

645
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,319
between a car
that's good to drive

646
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,280
and a car that's great to drive.

647
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,359
The steering is just razor-sharp.

648
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,919
The front of the car
follows the direction

649
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,320
exactly you want it to do.

650
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,519
Every other sports car maker
now electric.

651
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,440
But Lotus has a hydraulic power
steering rack purely for feel.

652
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,559
Boy, does it make a difference!

653
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,400
The steering on this car
is sublime.

654
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,879
Especially as it's been paired with,

655
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,359
yes, that manual gearbox.

656
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,799
Lotus's founder, Colin Chapman,

657
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,879
always insisted
that the gear lever be no more

658
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,319
than a hand's width away
from the steering wheel.

659
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,479
And, look, in the Emira -
perfection!

660
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Perfection.

661
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,439
TYRES SCREECH

662
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,600
HE LAUGHS

663
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,199
For price and power,

664
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,279
this thing is bang on
a Porsche Cayman rival.

665
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,800
And that is some stiff competition.

666
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,759
Would I really choose
one of these over the Porsche?

667
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,359
Well, I think, as a road car,

668
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,079
the chassis
is more comfortable in this.

669
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,159
It's probably got it licked.

670
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,799
And it looks better
to my eyes as well.

671
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,240
I can make a very good argument
for having one of these.

672
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,280
TYRES SCREECH

673
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,679
The Emira, then, looks great,
it goes great,

674
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,639
it costs a not insane amount
of money.

675
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,240
So what's the catch?

676
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,119
The catch is...
this all-new Lotus

677
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,199
isn't quite so all new as
Lotus would have you believe.

678
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,279
The engine,
borrowed from Toyota -

679
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,359
basically the same as the one
from the old Evora.

680
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,839
Same with the gearbox.

681
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,919
Under the skin,

682
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,959
this is the same
old Lotus formula

683
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,160
wearing designer sunglasses
and a fancy new scarf.

684
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,520
But you know what -
that doesn't matter one bit.

685
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,880
The old Lotus formula
was great.

686
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,679
You don't want your local
chippy pivoting towards

687
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,759
Mongolian fusion cuisine, do you?

688
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,680
You want an honest
lump of battered cod.

689
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,639
It might be an old recipe,

690
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,239
but it is still a classic.

691
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,079
I don't need more
than 400 horsepower.

692
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,600
How fast can you actually go
on the road?

693
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,839
You can enjoy more
of a car like this...

694
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,200
...in more places, more often.

695
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,640
It's fit for Britain.

696
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,119
And we need to enjoy it
while we can,

697
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,479
because the Emira
might just be...

698
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,799
...the end of an era.

699
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,799
They say this is the last
petrol-powered Lotus.

700
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,079
From here on in, it's electric.

701
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,639
I'm OK with that. Times change.

702
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,719
But when it is all electric,
let's not forget

703
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,040
how good this car was.

704
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,479
I said last year

705
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,159
that this was one of the cars

706
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,840
I was most looking forward
to driving in 2022.

707
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,680
So, does it live up to expectations?

708
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
Absolutely!

709
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,640
Absolutely!

710
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,480
HE LAUGHS

711
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

712
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,799
Do you know, I've got to  say,

713
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,159
for the money,
that is a beautiful car.

714
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,239
And it gets even better.
This one that I drove -

715
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,839
75 grand.

716
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,239
Next year, there's going
to be a cheaper one,

717
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,599
under 60 grand,

718
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,239
with a turbo-charged
four-cylinder engine

719
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,319
from the Mercedes A 45 hot hatch.

720
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,559
I cannot wait to drive that one!

721
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,959
My problem with Lotuses...

722
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,159
I can never get in 'em. I'm too big.

723
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,719
You struggled with the HGV!

724
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,839
LAUGHTER

725
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,919
And I'm looking at this

726
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,559
thinking there might be
a chance.

727
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,479
Do you mind if I...?
Slip on in, Fred.

728
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,839
New idea for a show here,
Pad. Can Fred Fit In It?

729
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,319
LAUGHTER

730
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,479
Ooh! No problem.
I cannot believe it.

731
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,119
I thought we were gonna
have to put lard

732
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,839
round the doorframes
or summat like that.

733
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,279
It's like a TARDIS.
It is.

734
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,519
I tell you what this is.
I want one.

735
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,479
Are you enjoying it?
Genuinely, I want one.

736
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,959
OK. All right. Well, while
Fred makes himself comfy,

737
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,079
it's time to batten down
the hatches

738
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,040
and get back
to our big HGV adventure.

739
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,999
NEWS THEME MUSIC

740
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,399
NEWSREADER: BBC News at ten
o'clock. This is Nick Quraishi.

741
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,599
The Met Office has issued
a rare red weather warning

742
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,759
for parts of South West England
and South Wales

743
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,039
tomorrow morning,

744
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,320
as Storm Eunice moves in
from the Atlantic.

745
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,000
Our mighty convoy
was closing in on Wales.

746
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,840
Look at this, boys!

747
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,599
But with our destination
on the south coast

748
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,039
now within easy reach,

749
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,839
approaching the Severn

750
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,679
we were bracing ourselves

751
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,839
for another
of trucking's rites of passage.

752
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,319
Feel it now, Chris.
We're coming onto it.

753
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,519
I can feel the wind.

754
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,679
WIND GUSTS

755
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,999
HE CHUCKLES

756
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,360
HE LAUGHS

757
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,559
The back of your trailer's

758
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,399
having a little sway there, Chris.

759
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,759
Even though I'm getting
blown around a bit,

760
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,559
the whole thing does feel
very stable, though.

761
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,439
I don't feel I'm having
to steer into it much.

762
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,039
What about you?

763
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,000
Not even deviated off
the straight, this thing.

764
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,119
Truth be told,

765
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,719
our modern HGV masterpieces

766
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,719
weren't in the least bit
bothered about the breeze.

767
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,799
Tell you what, though,

768
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,760
being this high up,
the views are amazing.

769
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,359
But if you're starting to think

770
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,239
this trucking game
might be for you,

771
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,919
it's worth mentioning that life
isn't just about mega-machinery

772
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,480
and comfy cabs.

773
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,559
When you're a trucker,

774
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,479
your life is ruled
by the tacho.

775
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,959
And I'm not on about
the tasty Mexican snack either.

776
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,919
I'm on about
this bit of kit up here.

777
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,279
That's a tachograph.

778
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,959
And a tachograph logs all
your hours behind the wheel

779
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,440
to make sure
you stick within the rules.

780
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,639
Rules like you've got nine
hours of driving every day,

781
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,760
apart from twice a week,
where you've got ten hours.

782
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,199
Then you've got 11 hours
of consecutive rest,

783
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
apart from three times a week,

784
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,679
where it can be nine hours.

785
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,559
Then you've got
56 driving hours a week,

786
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,759
or no more than 90 hours
every two weeks.

787
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,559
Oh, and every
four and a half hours,

788
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,600
you've got to take
a 45-minute break.

789
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,319
And trust me,
if you don't know those rules,

790
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,600
they'll come down on you
like a ton of Yorkies.

791
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,999
Of course,
you do soon become familiar

792
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,080
with all the rules and regs.

793
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,360
You might even start
to have a bit of fun.

794
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,879
OK, I'm coming past,
Frederick. I'm coming past.

795
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,839
Oh, he's making a move.
Go on, Chris,

796
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,279
I'll flash you in, Chris.

797
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,000
Not yet, not yet.
Double flash, please.

798
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,080
In you come. In you come.

799
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,919
Tell you what, boys,
we are making such good time,

800
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,759
I think we might need to head off

801
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,439
and find some proper,
open trucking roads.

802
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,719
What do you reckon?

803
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,880
Well up for that.

804
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,759
But in the world of trucking,

805
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,920
it turns out
nothing is straightforward...

806
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,160
...least of all when you leave
the motorway behind.

807
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,559
Remember I told you

808
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,159
we were gonna find
some nice open roads?

809
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,639
I'm not sure this is

810
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,359
what I had in mind, Chris,
to be honest.

811
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,759
This is tight!

812
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,279
This is where I really
admire seasoned truckers.

813
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,639
The way they navigate these
small towns is very impressive.

814
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,279
You're testing
our skills here, Christopher.

815
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,400
I feel like I'm on a constant
hazard perception test.

816
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,679
That right-hander
is hideous. Be careful.

817
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,000
Nice and wide, Paddy, lad.
Nice and wide.

818
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,840
BYSTANDER: Go on, Paddy!

819
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,839
Driving through Abergavenny there,

820
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,639
if I'd have done that in a car,
I'd have swore blind

821
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,519
you'd have never have got
an HGV through there.

822
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,999
I mean, it is a bit tight,
don't get me wrong,

823
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,199
but it's amazing the roads
you can get along and through -

824
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,479
providing everyone
moves out of the way.

825
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,880
Which, of course,
you soon find they often don't.

826
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,079
Bit of a div parked
his Kia right here

827
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,280
on a double yellow.

828
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,560
Where?

829
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,720
Bloomin' heck,
it's tight round here.

830
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,839
Watch this little white car coming
towards you an' all.

831
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,879
This is actually
one of the advantages

832
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,079
of being at the back.

833
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,239
Jeez, that was tight.
That wasn't fun there.

834
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
That was tense.

835
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,279
But stick with
the trucking game long enough,

836
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,240
and every now and again you'll
discover a little bit of magic.

837
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,800
Wales is beautiful.
Look at those hills.

838
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,680
I've got to say, this is proper.

839
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,439
Welsh hills, sunshine's out,

840
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,559
and I've got over 600 horsepower.

841
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,040
What a recipe!

842
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,679
Genuinely strange, coming on
all the roads that I've used

843
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,999
for 20 years to test
supercars...in a truck.

844
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,160
It's really quite pleasant.

845
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,919
What a machine this is!

846
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,839
The DAF is loving it.
Absolutely loving it.

847
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
Just skipping up the hills.

848
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,199
Tell you what, boys,

849
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,599
when we did the time trial
before,

850
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,679
with the old helicopters
on the back,

851
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,719
and you started having
a go at me about me horn,

852
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,239
well, I've found a little button

853
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,439
in the Scania cab which turns
the average horn

854
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,919
into a super-horn. Do you want to
have a little listen?

855
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,239
Fire away.

856
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,640
HORN BLARES

857
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,320
Lovely stuff.

858
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,919
It is stunning, though.
What a day to see it.

859
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,679
I know there's a bit
of wind knocking about

860
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,600
but the sun's out. Beautiful.

861
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,400
It really was.

862
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,319
But as we climbed higher
into the Brecon Beacons,

863
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,879
that "bit of wind
knocking about"

864
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,320
was definitely getting stronger.

865
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,999
WIND GUSTS

866
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,240
Oh, it's blowing now!

867
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,239
Ho-ho, dear me!

868
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
Having to concentrate
a bit harder now, aren't we?

869
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,040
They are amazing
bits of engineering.

870
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,799
I know we're saying it's tough,

871
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,679
but just twirling a wheel,
foot on the brake,

872
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,159
the vehicle does the rest.

873
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,639
Just incredible bits of engineering.

874
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,639
Although on a narrow,
winding road,

875
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,999
in increasingly blustery conditions,

876
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,319
things soon become less
incredible when one of those

877
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,319
"bits of engineering"
comes the other way.

878
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,360
BLEEP!

879
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,000
Whoa!

880
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,319
That was horrible. Did you see that?

881
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,679
Literally that come from nowhere.

882
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,160
That was a close one, that.

883
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,439
And it was just another
timely reminder

884
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,400
of what truck driving
is really all about.

885
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
So much responsibility
in driving one of these.

886
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,679
You've got to be on it
all the time.

887
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,959
And you think about that

888
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,240
day after day
after day after day.

889
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,240
This is hard graft.

890
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,439
Truckers watching this,
they'll know what I'm on about.

891
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,680
I'm not sure I've got it in me,
to be honest.

892
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,199
With the day drawing in
and the weather deteriorating,

893
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,519
it was time to leave

894
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,920
the scenic detour behind.

895
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,639
The priority now
was to get as close

896
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,160
to our final destination
as we could...

897
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,240
..before this.

898
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,799
NEWSREADER: Storm Eunice
hits the UK,

899
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,679
with powerful winds causing
injury, damage and destruction.

900
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,679
Oh, my God!

901
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,639
For what's thought
to be the first time ever,

902
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,999
both bridges here across
the Severn Estuary have closed

903
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,560
because of the high winds.

904
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,200
Storm Eunice had been giving
Britain a bashing.

905
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,239
And once the worst had passed,

906
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,280
how grateful we were to reach
the end of the road.

907
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,079
Oh, there she is. Pembrey
Circuit. We made it, boys.

908
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,720
I've had easier drives than that
in me life.

909
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,720
A lot of sympathy for HGV drivers
in these conditions. It's horrible.

910
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,679
But we weren't done yet,

911
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,119
because we had finally pulled up

912
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,759
at the home of Welsh motorsport,

913
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,639
where it turned out, all this time,

914
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,399
we'd been hauling everything
we needed to go...

915
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,120
...truck racing.

916
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,079
With over 1,000 horsepower,

917
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,719
ten times the torque
of your average supercar,

918
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,999
all reined in by enormous,

919
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,439
steam-billowing,
water-cooled brakes,

920
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,559
these five-tonne,

921
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,119
rear-wheel-drive,
custom-built monsters

922
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,800
are not for the faint of heart.

923
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,039
A typical race sees grids
of up to 20 trucks

924
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,800
doing battle
at speeds of 100mph.

925
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,879
And because
on an unfamiliar track during

926
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,719
an extreme weather event,

927
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,079
diving straight
into this kind of action

928
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,479
would be just plain stupid...

929
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,200
What a lovely day
for a truck race!

930
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,799
...before giving it
a go ourselves,

931
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,079
we'd generously been given
a couple of laps

932
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,199
to get to grips...

933
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,759
...with our new rigs.

934
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,119
These things are huge.

935
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,160
Tell you what, though,
it's exciting.

936
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,360
Here we go.

937
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,640
Pad, Pad, Pad, no, Pad!

938
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,919
CRASH!

939
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,039
Ohhh!

940
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,440
BLEEP!

941
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,999
These racing trucks
are tough old birds.

942
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,719
And with no harm done...

943
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,439
...apart from that bit,

944
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,639
back at the pits,
it was just a case of waiting

945
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,959
for Eunice to pepper
the track with a hailstorm,

946
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,200
and then, apparently,
it was time to go racing.

947
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,160
Here we go, little bit
of damp on the road.

948
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,399
Practise, don't you, in the dry,

949
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,399
then it's hailstones
and we're in the damp.

950
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,599
Oh, and just for good measure,

951
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,159
we'd be starting from
the front of the grid.

952
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,199
Got to be honest, I...

953
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,319
...I'd have sooner have been
at the back of the grid.

954
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,240
Now I've got the cast of Convoy
hurtling past me.

955
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,279
Yes, truck racing
traditionally plays out

956
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,919
in 15-minute bouts,

957
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,280
often using a reverse grid system.

958
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,879
Putting the slowest drivers
at the front

959
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,399
is a good way to ensure

960
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,839
lots of high-octane action.

961
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,719
Never thought I'd do
a formation lap behind

962
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,879
Flintoff and McGuinness.

963
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,399
Putting us lot at the front,

964
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,839
on the other hand, is madness.

965
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,599
Paddy, what you doing?

966
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,159
Formation, Pad.

967
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,039
Fred needs to get by
the side of him.

968
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,159
What is Paddy doing?

969
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,599
This is the only time
I'll be at the front.

970
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,240
So, I'm just enjoying it!

971
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,600
Here we go, lead car's pulling out.

972
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,880
Let's go.

973
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,880
Come on!

974
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,280
Ohhh, I'm all over the bloody shop.

975
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,680
Blooming heck, he's muscled me
out already, Pad.

976
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,440
Let's try and get away from him.

977
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,800
This is sketchy.

978
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,479
I'll tell you what,

979
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,279
it's completely different
in the wet.

980
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,239
Slow down.

981
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,400
Into the hairpin.

982
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
Whoooo-ho-ho!

983
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,000
Lost it.

984
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,279
Oh, Paddy's off again.

985
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,359
Can I get back out?

986
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,679
Oh, no!

987
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,439
No. Come on!

988
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,199
Paddy McGuinness is off.

989
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,320
Oh, absolutely devastated!

990
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,759
Just one minute
into our 15-minute race...

991
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,359
It's a red flag.

992
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,399
It's a red flag!

993
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,719
...we'd all been told

994
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,200
to stop.

995
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,719
And while McGuinness's truck
was recovered to safety,

996
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,719
we headed back to the grid,

997
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,039
ready to restart

998
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,599
from where we were sitting
when the race was red-flagged.

999
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,399
That meant Harris was up front,
I was in fourth,

1000
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,999
and McGuinness would be
at the back.

1001
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,279
And I've got to be honest,

1002
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,480
it feels nicer here.
It feels a lot nicer.

1003
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,080
Here we go. And we're away again.

1004
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,359
So we now appear to be in P-1,

1005
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,679
which in my experience

1006
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,599
is exactly where
you don't want to be for

1007
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,680
a restart, cos you've just got
a massive target on your back.

1008
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,759
With 14 minutes left
to survive...

1009
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,799
Get your wipers on,

1010
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,079
it's starting to rain.

1011
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,840
...it was time to go racing again.

1012
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,839
Bloody hell.
I say it's better at the back,

1013
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,679
but it actually feels worse.

1014
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,199
Cor blimey,

1015
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,839
look at the congestion here.

1016
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,680
Go, go, go, go, go.

1017
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,239
Dear me.

1018
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,520
I've got someone
right up my chuff now.

1019
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,799
Oh, I went wide.

1020
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,360
Oh, there's one coming up
the inside there, he's got me.

1021
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,639
Get the windscreens on,
get the windscreens on.

1022
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,240
I can barely see.

1023
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,279
Ohh, got it back.

1024
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,080
My word.

1025
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,680
He's coming for me,
he's coming for me.

1026
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,720
I've got to cover
that inside line.

1027
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,640
This is tricky.

1028
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,519
Jeez, come on, keep going.

1029
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,519
Yes, Fred, that's better.

1030
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,640
Not too fast round here.
No, no, stay on.

1031
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,399
As the minutes ticked away,

1032
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,599
the midfield were
gradually picking me off.

1033
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,959
Going up me inside.

1034
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,359
Keep going, Fred.

1035
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,719
And it's safe to say
me and McGuinness were really

1036
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,159
just trying to bring
our 150-grand racing rigs

1037
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,040
back in one piece.

1038
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,040
The windscreen wipers
have gone. I can't see.

1039
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,279
My word!

1040
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,079
But up at the front,

1041
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,279
Harris had spent most
of his first-ever truck race

1042
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,359
in the lead.

1043
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,920
Come on!

1044
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,479
And now, with just
a few minutes left

1045
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,279
to the chequered flag,

1046
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,200
the fight for the podium was on.

1047
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,679
Sliding everywhere now.

1048
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,159
They've got a surprising amount
of grip,

1049
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,399
but if ever the grip goes away,

1050
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,240
it's catastrophic.

1051
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,079
No, no, no, no, no,

1052
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,439
not this time.
No, no, no, come on.

1053
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,999
Get it back, get it back,
get it back.

1054
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,319
Get it back. Yes, yes,

1055
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,479
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1056
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,600
Ohhh. Got it back.

1057
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,000
Come on, old girl.

1058
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,999
This big fella's coming through.

1059
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,200
Come on!

1060
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,959
Oh, a bit of a lock-up.

1061
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,520
BLEEP! I let him through.

1062
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,999
Whoa.

1063
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,799
Didn't really think
that was gonna happen.

1064
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,200
Got thumped out the way.

1065
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,600
Come on, keep going, keep working.

1066
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,160
I can stay with them,
but I can't catch them.

1067
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,920
Bit of oversteer there.

1068
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,840
P-3. I'll take that.

1069
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,399
I'll take that.

1070
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,680
Wow. Wonder where the others are.

1071
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,800
There we go.

1072
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,759
Tell you what,

1073
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,960
concentrated so hard, jeez!

1074
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,519
Woooo!

1075
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,639
Wow, that was sketchy.

1076
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,240
That...

1077
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,760
...was trucking.

1078
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,920
CHEERING

1079
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,799
That was intense.

1080
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,039
That was intense. It was, it was.

1081
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,319
But, congratulations, Chris Harris,

1082
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,399
a podium on your very first outing!

1083
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,759
Go on, Chrissie!

1084
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,120
CHEERING

1085
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,999
They were not messing about.

1086
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,119
I had many more love taps
than I expected.

1087
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,119
They were, they were aggressive.
They really were.

1088
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,079
So we set out to learn more
about the trucking life.

1089
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,279
We certainly did that.
We got the full experience,

1090
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,279
all the highs and all the lows.

1091
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,239
We did indeed, and when
everything's going well,

1092
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,999
trucking's great.
You're king of the road.

1093
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,079
But as soon as the weather turns,
it's a different story.

1094
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,199
Oh, the wind.

1095
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,839
Yeah, the wind, yeah.

1096
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,799
Jeez. And it has changed
how I see trucks on the road.

1097
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,119
Now, every time I see one,
I think, "Big respect."

1098
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,359
Absolutely.

1099
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,199
Yeah, hats off to the truckers,
that is a tough job.

1100
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,999
It is indeed,
and if anyone wants

1101
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,879
a couple of disused military
helicopters shifting,

1102
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,879
give us a call!
That's it for tonight.

1103
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,999
We'll be back next week,
when Chris drives

1104
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,119
a very fast Maserati,

1105
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,759
Fred drives a very futuristic
pick-up truck,

1106
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,039
and I drive
a cheap old Honda Civic.

1107
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,439
Living the dream.

1108
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,639
Thanks so much for watching.
See you, then, goodnight.

1109
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,560
CHEERING
