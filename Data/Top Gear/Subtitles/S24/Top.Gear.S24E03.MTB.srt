00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,136
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:32,136
On tonight's show, we go supercar
hunting in a Volkswagen Golf,

3
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:35,136
and discover the perfect
run about for the fashion

4
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,782
conscious Bond villain.

5
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:40,519
But fist, let's talk about Aston Martin.

6
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,028
Now, Aston Martin, they've
always made beautiful cars,

7
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:49,053
but the truth is, in recent years,
Aston's been a bit left behind.

8
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:51,053
You know when we first saw this DB9?

9
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:52,629
2003.

10
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,453
In car years, that's ancient, right?

11
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:59,565
But now the DB9 has been replaced
by a new car, promising to bring

12
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,565
Aston right up-to-date.

13
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:07,100
This is the all-new DB11.

14
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:10,664
Aston Martin says it's
the most important model

15
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,640
in its 100 year history.

16
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,425
No pressure there, then!

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,945
Thankfully, it still looks great.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,212
But look beneath the body work
and there are a few surprises.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,861
Aston's given the DB11 a smaller
motor than the old DB9,

20
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,614
and for the first time
ever, accessorises it with

21
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:35,754
a pair of turbo chargers.

22
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:38,754
Now this - this is controversial.

23
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:44,712
The free revving, naturally
aspirated Aston Martin V12

24
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:49,737
is a British institution, like
the Royal Family - or crumpets.

25
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:53,558
Aston Martin going turbo is big news.

26
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:58,548
So, have they ruined it?

27
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:01,054
Well - no.

28
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,256
Not at all.

29
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:12,074
In fact, this might just be
the best all-round Aston

30
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,709
in the last 20 years.

31
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:15,961
Or 40 years.

32
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,520
Or...

33
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:20,213
Damn, I'm old.

34
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:27,562
The engine might be smaller, but
those controversial new turbo

35
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:34,131
chargers means Aston's V12
now produces 600 horsepower,

36
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:36,171
which is, you know, enough.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,771
Enough, in fact, to make
this the first DB car that

38
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,854
will do over 200mph.

39
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,007
It goes like hell!

40
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:50,700
Sounds like hell, too.

41
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,911
Woo-hoo!

42
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:59,030
And hey, it's still rear wheel
drive, the gearbox is still out

43
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:02,307
the back for better weight
distribution, and now there's even

44
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,679
proper multilink rear suspension.

45
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:10,765
So if you do happen to accidentally
end up in a massive power slide...

46
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,344
Then, yeah, it'll do that too.

47
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,846
Oops, there it goes again.

48
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:24,884
I'm so careless.

49
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:34,194
Now, some might complain that
this British icon has sourced

50
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:38,311
all of its electronic computery
stuff from Mercedes.

51
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:44,062
Frankly, I don't care if the stuff
behind the scenes is programmed

52
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:48,495
by German guys in wire-rimmed
glasses, it doesn't bother me at all,

53
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:51,663
mostly because, unlike old Astons,

54
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:53,611
it actually works.

55
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:58,648
Besides, all the tactile stuff
is still just as it should be.

56
00:03:58,648 --> 00:03:59,591
There's leather.

57
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,912
It's very leathery.

58
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:05,253
And this metal is very metally.

59
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,737
And this wood is very - ooh!

60
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:12,017
I'm just kidding, that's nice wood.

61
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,369
Now the armrest.

62
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:17,475
You don't have to go through
all that effort of manually

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,394
sliding it back to get to the little
bit of storage underneath there.

64
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,564
No, there's a switch here
that does that for you.

65
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,834
I cannot believe that I
have been manually sliding

66
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:34,011
armrests all these years, like an ape.

67
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,426
That is time I cannot get back.

68
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,527
So it's great to drive.

69
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,777
Great to spend time in.

70
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:46,807
But it should be.

71
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:49,706
The DB11 is 155 grand.

72
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:53,040
Which does raise that old debate.

73
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,988
For about half the money, you
could have a Nissan GTR,

74
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:01,900
which has about the same
power, and four wheel drive,

75
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:06,706
and will annihilate this Aston
around any circuit on earth.

76
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:14,674
But come on, that's not
the point of the DB11.

77
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,497
This is a luxury yacht.

78
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,251
Not a speed boat.

79
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,370
It's a private jet.

80
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:27,041
Not a jet fighter.

81
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,331
It's about understated elegance.

82
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:39,236
Sophisticated, effortless, cool.

83
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:40,725
Yeah.

84
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:49,633
Which means this race track is not
where the DB11 was meant to live.

85
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:55,837
However, we've installed a useful
new feature on this race track.

86
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,992
Narnia had its wardrobe, Bill
and Ted had their phone booth

87
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,623
and Stargate had its...

88
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,911
its Stargate.

89
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:07,411
Top Gear now has its left at hammer head.

90
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:08,818
That's right.

91
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,478
Left turn at hammer head.

92
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,137
OK.

93
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,954
First time for everything.

94
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,287
Let's do this.

95
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:41,030
Oh, yeah!

96
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:48,264
Now we're talking.

97
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
Sweet!

98
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:55,461
Yeah.

99
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,810
Just call me...

100
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:58,461
Le Bond.

101
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:00,935
Matt Le Bond.

102
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,318
Would have been nice if
it came with the pants.

103
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,454
Of course, every hero needs a villain.

104
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,782
Introducing...

105
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:28,599
The Mercedes S63 AMG coupe, a
two door with an evil streak.

106
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:33,399
It's huge, it is ostentatious.

107
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,712
I mean, I've got cameras that
scan the road ahead for bumps,

108
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:41,578
and for some reason I have Swarovski
crystals in the headlights.

109
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,330
I'm coming to get you, Le Bond.

110
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,312
Who the hell is that?

111
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,608
Oh...

112
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey.

113
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:05,731
I get it.

114
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,459
Bond villain?

115
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,469
Let me guess, Dr No-hair?

116
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,917
You're loving this, aren't you?

117
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,161
You've got the car, you've got the suit.

118
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:19,684
Oh, hey, listen, Hillary Clinton
called - she wants her jacket back.

119
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,306
Look, I didn't even choose this!

120
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:26,063
Oi!

121
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:32,316
That's a V8, right?

122
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,833
Well, a twin turbo V8, yes.

123
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:35,858
V12.

124
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,858
Twin turbo V12.

125
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:38,858
Horsepower?

126
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:39,772
580.

127
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:40,460
You?

128
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:42,602
Only 600.

129
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:46,820
OK, look, pretend Mercedes, real
Mercedes, more talk and let's

130
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:49,291
face it, it's a better driver.

131
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:52,118
It's on.

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,031
Bulldozer, bulldozer!

133
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,056
That's actually an articulating loader.

134
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:03,852
Get out of the way.

135
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,274
I've got a smug American to kill.

136
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,149
Let's see how you cope with this, Le Bond!

137
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,020
Full beam, is there no limit to his evil?

138
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,747
Where's he going?

139
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,149
Decision, decisions.

140
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,538
He's lost!

141
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,289
Here's good.

142
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:56,613
Such a picturesque country.

143
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,771
Ooh.

144
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,231
Sorry.

145
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:06,960
Enjoy your lunch!

146
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:17,024
130...

147
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,564
140...

148
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:20,892
150...

149
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,272
Wow, this car's quick.

150
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,624
Live with this, Le Bond.

151
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:33,929
You see, the thing about that
Merc is, it's limited to 155.

152
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,542
This DB11 isn't.

153
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,474
Later, Harris.

154
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:42,828
Whoa.

155
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:45,530
That was a New Holland TN90 F.

156
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:46,822
Classic.

157
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:05,341
Did you see the police?

158
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,226
Of course I saw the police,
and I think they saw us.

159
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:28,947
Ooh!

160
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:34,191
What kind of police cars
are those, Dr No-hair?

161
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,657
They are Vauxhall Astras, Le Bond.

162
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,383
We can outrun those, right?

163
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,635
Absolutely.

164
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:00,994
This is cool.

165
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:02,007
Oh, yes.

166
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:38,999
Police.

167
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:41,654
Police everywhere.

168
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,336
We're surrounded, Le Bond.

169
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,621
We're surrounded.

170
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:58,869
Oh, it's very bad.

171
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,839
It's very, very bad.

172
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,474
Where are your trousers?

173
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,329
Don't draw attention to it.

174
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,227
That was fun, that was really fun.

175
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:37,227
Yeah.

176
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:38,879
Thank you.

177
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:41,573
So, left at hammer head.

178
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:45,573
Yes, I think it opens up a
whole new world of opportunities, right?

179
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,573
You just have to pack
an extra pair of pants.

180
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,135
That would be wise.

181
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,029
OK, let's talk about the cars.

182
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,209
You love this Mercedes, right?

183
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:58,717
It is fantastic, it's 20 grand
cheaper than the Aston Martin.

184
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:01,228
It's the best GT car I have ever driven.

185
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:04,228
I mean, I arrive at places feeling
more relaxed than when I started.

186
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,696
Double glazing, best hi-fi I've ever heard.

187
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,422
Best GT car you've ever driven?

188
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:11,399
It's wonderful, just a great car to be in.

189
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:12,064
It is very subtle.

190
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:12,774
I like that.

191
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:15,229
Yeah, yeah, it's not overstated,
and you say you really like it.

192
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,224
But it does miss one thing.

193
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:19,249
There is one important
thing it doesn't have.

194
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,028
Are you ready?

195
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:22,992
It doesn't have THIS.

196
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,325
This badge, right here.

197
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:26,709
It doesn't have that.

198
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:27,629
You're so vain!

199
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:31,545
This badge here was founded
by Karl Benz in 1885.

200
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,570
He invented the motor car.

201
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,704
This thing has provenance.

202
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,642
But it doesn't have THIS badge.

203
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:38,642
This one right here.

204
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:39,849
THIS badge.

205
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,849
And do you want to know
why that's relevant?

206
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,677
I'll show you.

207
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,159
Who here would take the Mercedes?

208
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,302
That woman over there.

209
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:49,808
OK.

210
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:51,621
And who here...

211
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,123
OK, let me finish.

212
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,167
Who here would have the Aston?

213
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:58,968
Ouch!

214
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:01,843
I am disappointed in each
and every one of you.

215
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:02,742
You've let yourselves down.

216
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,567
It's a great car, it's a great
car, but it's not an Aston Martin.

217
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,069
Fair enough.

218
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,739
Right, OK.

219
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,104
Now there's one thing to do.

220
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:12,861
Find out how fast the DB11
went round our test track.

221
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:16,528
You know what that means -
it's time for the Stig!

222
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,658
Here he is then, on the line in the DB11.

223
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:23,672
600 horsepower, twin turbo V12.

224
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,440
Pretty good traction off the line.

225
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,818
Howling up past the heli-shot.

226
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,055
Braking zone, looks heavy,
doesn't it, look at the roll

227
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,023
on the car straight away.

228
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:34,023
Stig, very relaxed in there,
very leathery and woody.

229
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:35,023
A bit of tyre smoke coming out.

230
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,901
This has got so much power.

231
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,579
Braking hard, look at the pitch,
look at the weight moving around.

232
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,397
Hammerhead.

233
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:42,779
Managed to hold his line, but
watch the oversteer on the exit.

234
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:43,846
Managing it all the way.

235
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:45,297
That was sexy driving.

236
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,981
Over to the right-hand side now.

237
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,874
Braking hard into Hammerhead.

238
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,899
Again, it stops well,
but it does look heavy.

239
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,934
Look at the lean, a bit
of understeer to start with,

240
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:55,934
then Stig gets on the
throttle, neutralises it.

241
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:56,934
What happens on the exit?

242
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:57,756
Here we go.

243
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,053
That's just showboating.

244
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:00,610
Super slick oversteer.

245
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:03,219
Look at the smoke there,
the diff opening up a bit.

246
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:04,625
Maybe the diff isn't that tight.

247
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,554
Through the follow-through.

248
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:08,840
That's really fast and
skilful through there.

249
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:11,307
Bang, that was aggressive.

250
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,454
Braking hard into second to last.

251
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:16,982
What's it like here?

252
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,880
Looks very, very stable to me.

253
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,389
But it doesn't look that grippy.

254
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:22,621
That was using all the track.

255
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:26,186
Now left into Gambon and over the line.

256
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:31,887
That looked fast.

257
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:41,201
OK, the new Aston Martin DB11 went
around the track in one minute 21.5.

258
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,538
Right there.

259
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,679
It's ahead of the M3.

260
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,607
Before you ask, before you
even ask, we had the Stig take

261
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:53,632
the S 63 around as well.

262
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,239
What do you think?

263
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,094
It's perfect.

264
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:58,623
Yeah, right, absolutely.

265
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:03,389
So the Mercedes AMG S 63 did
it in one minute 24 flat.

266
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:08,654
Oooh, that goes there.

267
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,362
Well, it's totally irrelevant.

268
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:13,390
What?

269
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:18,340
Hold on, you, Chris Harris,
pro racing driver, car guru,

270
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,653
is going to tell me that in the
context of comparing two cars

271
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:26,398
that the lap time between those
two cars is totally irrelevant?

272
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,362
It's totally irrelevant!

273
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:31,596
This is a comfort game.

274
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:32,999
This is a comfortable car.

275
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,241
I can sometimes be, you know, rational.

276
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,266
You can also sometimes be a sore loser.

277
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:38,620
Rory.

278
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,846
And a bit later on in the show,
I'll be proving you don't need

279
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:46,132
to spend supercar money to
keep up with supercars.

280
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:47,902
You just need the right machinery.

281
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:48,910
And the right driver.

282
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,850
Yeah. Not you!

283
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:55,910
All right, now it is time
to meet this week's guest.

284
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,395
Star of Green Wing, Friday Night Dinner
and Episodes.

285
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,452
Great show.

286
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,251
Please welcome Tamsin Greig.

287
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:15,402
Wow.

288
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,517
All right?

289
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:24,315
How are you?

290
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:26,359
So glad to see you. So glad you're here.

291
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,098
Tamsin and I have been
friends for a long time.

292
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:29,858
We do the other show together, obviously.

293
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,724
And we have kissed on camera.

294
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,214
- On camera.
- On camera.

295
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,839
- I vomited on you.
- Yeah.

296
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,328
- On camera.
- You did.

297
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:43,815
And you kicked and punched me
repeatedly on and off camera.

298
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,702
Yeah.

299
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:49,198
But we never have had the chat.

300
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:51,817
The what?

301
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,796
The chat, you know?

302
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,414
The chat, what chat?

303
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:58,767
Tamsin Greig...

304
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:02,350
We want to know about your first one.

305
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:05,914
Oh. Because this is a car show, right?

306
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:08,730
Yeah, your first car, what did
you think I was talking about?

307
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,405
Your first car, come on.

308
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,644
A Fiat Uno.

309
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,328
Oooooo!

310
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:18,840
Yeah, guys!

311
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,270
And it gave me this kind of exultant
feeling of liberty

312
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,189
 and I was very, very happy in that car.

313
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,602
An exultant feeling of liberty?

314
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,257
You don't get a lot of that.

315
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:33,606
That's the first poetry
ever induced by a Fiat Uno.

316
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:37,609
But the Fiat Uno became a, kind
of like, gangster car after that.

317
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,051
- Did it?
- It did.

318
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,135
No, no.

319
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,249
In Chipping Norton.

320
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,603
In Kilburn, where I grew up.

321
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:47,244
And, yeah, it became...
The souped up version.

322
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,269
The Turbo IE.

323
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,269
Thank you.

324
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:50,835
Is that the one you had?

325
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:54,350
No, I had the basic one
that sounded like a fridge.

326
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:57,871
The door made that really satisfying noise.

327
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,950
And did things move up after that car?

328
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,811
After that car, then I got
a Citroen AX, which...

329
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,113
Yeah, guys!

330
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:09,127
Aren't you glad you've got me on your show?

331
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:12,220
- I have a Citroen AX now.
- What, still?

332
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,703
- I still have one.
- How old is it?

333
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,571
It is 1988.

334
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:18,675
They were famously unreliable,
though, so did you ever

335
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,084
break down in it?

336
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:22,796
Yeah, I did. I did break down once.

337
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,162
There's a tiny little road that
goes over the Lake District

338
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:27,995
called Rhino's Pass.

339
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,447
And I was on my own with a dog.

340
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:32,165
And I thought to myself,
this would be a really bad

341
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,526
place to break down.

342
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,095
At which point my gear
stick came off in my hand,

343
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:38,095
and this was before mobile phones.

344
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:41,530
And so I got out of the car
with the dog, at sundown,

345
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:44,133
so I'm walking down the
mountain of this little road,

346
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,479
and managed to find a little house.

347
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,471
And there was a house
there, a couple there,

348
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:51,471
and I used their phone and
phoned the breakdown services

349
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:52,816
and they found me.

350
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,344
I said to the AA guy...
Are we allowed to say AA?

351
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:57,948
- Can we say that?
- Is that advertising?

352
00:20:57,973 --> 00:20:58,427
Yeah, you can.

353
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:01,427
The man from Alcoholics
Anonymous came, and he said...

354
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:06,566
I said, it's so brilliant to see
you, I was really, really worried.

355
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:10,241
I'm here on my own, and
I'm female, I'm female!

356
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,496
And it could have been a nightmare.

357
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:15,225
And the guy, without blinking,
said to me, "It's not a nightmare."

358
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,665
"It would have been a nightmare
if I'd had a knife."

359
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,119
That's horrid!

360
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,958
That's what the recovering alcoholic said.

361
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,822
The recovering alcoholic
said, hiding his weapons.

362
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,822
Can we stop the horror stories,
because that's frankly harrowing.

363
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:35,407
Can we talk about Episodes,
because I'm a big fan.

364
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:38,582
You've just filmed the last season.

365
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,012
Why does it have to end?

366
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,607
Tamsin didn't want to do it any more.

367
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,644
Well, boo to you.

368
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:47,644
Awwwww, well I'm glad we're
leaving you on a high.

369
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,903
I think it's really good to
know when to end stories.

370
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,438
Yeah. Don't you?

371
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:53,472
It's great to just know when you're done.

372
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:55,364
I kind of feel like we've told our story.

373
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,364
Leave them wanting more.

374
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:58,364
We have tried to get a clip of this.

375
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:00,047
It was quite difficult
to get a pre-watershed,

376
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,500
friendly clip, but here we go.

377
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,750
You want to loosen up, don't
hunch your shoulders.

378
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:06,853
Still hunching...

379
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:09,457
Still hunching...

380
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,809
Still hunching!

381
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:12,843
Those are my shoulders.

382
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:13,487
Really?

383
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:17,800
Both hands tight on the grip.

384
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:18,780
It's loud!

385
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:19,784
It's loud!

386
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:20,931
It's loud!

387
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,215
Holy crap!

388
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,516
Well done, darling.

389
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,501
That was no bloody car door.

390
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:34,178
I'm never doing this again,
because it was loud!

391
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,458
All right, my turn.

392
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,458
What?!

393
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Well done, well done.

394
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,458
Great wrist action.

395
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,398
Thanks, did that look like...

396
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,398
Yeah, what was that? Was it a .357?

397
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,399
No, no.

398
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:53,488
No!

399
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,027
It was a Smith Wesson .44.

400
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:57,027
It's a big cannon.

401
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:57,815
Yes.

402
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,815
I mean, I stood there for a long time.

403
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:02,503
That's why my arms look so toned.

404
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:06,663
Because it was the whole day
I was stood there like that.

405
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:09,491
OK, I want to show you something
very special now, OK.

406
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,491
A couple of years ago, Renault
thought they had spotted

407
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,491
a gap in the market place, and
they have just created this.

408
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:15,491
Have a look at this.

409
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,491
This is delicious.

410
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:18,952
The Alpine 110.

411
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:19,977
Al-peen?

412
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,977
"Al-peen", yeah.

413
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:22,889
It's a fast Renault.

414
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:23,562
Not Al-pine?

415
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:24,474
It's an Al-peen.

416
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:28,505
OK, now, the Porsche Cayman
is worth 40,000 pounds and up, so Renault

417
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,172
thought, we can offer a cheaper car.

418
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:33,947
So it's about 250 horsepower, 1250 kg.

419
00:23:33,972 --> 00:23:36,862
It's mid-engined, it's sexy as hell.

420
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:38,135
Look at that, it's just perfect.

421
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:40,229
And it's developed by the guys
at Renault Sport, and they know

422
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:43,103
a thing or two about
making great, fast cars.

423
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,463
Except there's one problem.

424
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,815
It's not cheaper than a Porsche Cayman.

425
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:49,434
Is it?

426
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:51,226
It's about 60,000 pounds.

427
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,433
That is the slight issue.

428
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,639
They identified the gap in the
market and then they totally

429
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,304
missed the gap in the market!

430
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:02,246
And it's actually more expensive
than a Porsche Cayman.

431
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:03,193
Yeah.

432
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,991
And it's also named after a toilet cleaner.

433
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:10,083
Alpine? Al-peen.

434
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:11,060
Al-peen.

435
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,085
Alpine, it's Alpine fresh.

436
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:15,935
Does he look like a man who
buys his own toilet cleaner?

437
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,354
Yeah, he doesn't know
what we're talking about!

438
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:22,058
Why can't I buy my own toilet cleaner?

439
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,917
Do you go to the shops
and buy toilet cleaner?

440
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:27,590
Whoa, why is everybody
talking like this to me?

441
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,619
Ask him, Rory. Do it
from that side as well.

442
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:30,908
Name one brand of toilet cleaner.

443
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:31,768
Al-peen.

444
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:32,557
Ermmmm...

445
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:34,198
Fairy liquid! Fairy liquid!

446
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:38,400
Toilet.

447
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
You wash your...

448
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,772
Fairy liquid.

449
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:42,685
You wash your toilet with fairy liquid?

450
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:43,685
After doing the dishes. OK.

451
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:44,686
409.

452
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:45,904
That's in the States.

453
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:46,800
That's a car.

454
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,462
It's the stuff with the funny neck
on it, so you can get under the rim.

455
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:52,192
Duck. Duck.

456
00:24:56,235 --> 00:24:58,920
All right, time to see how
your training session

457
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,920
went with the loving, caring, kind, tender,

458
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
gentle Chris Harris.

459
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,217
Let's take a look.

460
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,400
What's the fastest you've been in a car?

461
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:14,333
- I think about 90 miles an hour.
- 19?!

462
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,238
Or 90? 90!

463
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:18,360
90, OK, this could be interesting.

464
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:19,202
Let's go.

465
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,727
Just be nice, all right?

466
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,054
No, nothing gets done if you're not nice.

467
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:31,177
OK, I'll try. OK, full power.

468
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,519
You've got 7000 revs, use them! Louder.

469
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,519
Second, third gear now.

470
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,455
Whoa, it's in there somewhere.

471
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:38,455
Sorry. Fourth gear.

472
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:42,161
You know the bit on the show where
you have to set the fast lap?

473
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,143
That's this bit.

474
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,955
You are aware of that, aren't you?
Is this it?

475
00:25:44,955 --> 00:25:45,654
Fourth gear.

476
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:46,426
Keep going.

477
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:48,426
We need a sundial to time
this, not a stopwatch.

478
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:49,426
Be clear.

479
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:53,038
Down here, straight. Braking
hard now, right, right.

480
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,857
No, left of the... You said right!

481
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:55,998
Just say every bit.

482
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,805
Round there, round there, to the right.

483
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,021
This is the famous Hammerhead.

484
00:25:59,021 --> 00:25:59,914
Don't get it wrong.

485
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:01,516
Left, left, left, left.

486
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:03,375
Right.

487
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,491
That's no bloody good, is it.

488
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,446
What are you...? What are you doing?

489
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,795
I'm really glad you're here.

490
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:13,795
You've been very helpful in many ways.

491
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:16,660
But I'm feeling a kind of...

492
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,660
A wave of anger coming from you.

493
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,858
I'm just interested in
what that's all about.

494
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,948
I'm angry because we're trying to go
fast and you're not going fast yet.

495
00:26:25,948 --> 00:26:26,948
I just want to go fast.

496
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:29,444
I am going fast, faster than I was.

497
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:31,227
You think you're going fast.

498
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:32,227
OK, you're a teacher.

499
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:37,064
If you get angry when I can't quite
do what you're asking me to do,

500
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:39,434
that's going to reflect badly on you.

501
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:40,974
Not on me.

502
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,435
So I think you just need to calm down.

503
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:47,011
And maybe we can just
start by saying please.

504
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,518
Or, and, thank you.

505
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:54,629
But if I use those pleasantries,
will you go faster.

506
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:55,177
Yes.

507
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:56,362
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I will.

508
00:26:57,176 --> 00:27:00,176
All right, are we ready? Yeah.

509
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:00,176
Teach me.

510
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,519
Don't point.

511
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,982
Can we go, can we please
move the steering wheel

512
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,531
in a rightward direction.

513
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,456
Now, before we're driving? Now, please.

514
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:09,308
Before we go.

515
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:10,103
Let's go.

516
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:14,913
Now accelerate and use the throttle
and into second gear, please.

517
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,195
Thank you.

518
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:19,206
And into third gear, please,
if you feel like it.

519
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:19,763
Thank you.

520
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,788
Now four. Thank you.

521
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:23,660
Now over to the left but
avoid the cameraman,

522
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,022
because that would be bad.

523
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Now down the end here. Come on!

524
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,437
Get on... Please hurry up.

525
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,748
Where am I going?

526
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,436
Left, left is good. Over there.

527
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:36,461
Maybe just also say...

528
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:39,461
OK, OK, OK. Come on, Tamsin!

529
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:41,705
I know you've got it in you, come on!

530
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,563
And can you please, please, brake
between the 100 and the 50.

531
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:47,097
Brake, brake!

532
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,895
Don't shout. Third gear, please.

533
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Left, left.

534
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,277
I feel like we've been
through something there.

535
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,277
How do you feel?

536
00:27:53,277 --> 00:27:57,082
I feel that you have improved as a driver,

537
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,613
and that I have improved as a human being.

538
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,053
Win, win, win.

539
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,287
Now get out the fucking car!

540
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:06,785
And just think about how
you've been behaving.

541
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:12,944
That was great. You see what you get?

542
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:16,589
I can't help it.

543
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:18,598
No, she was very, very good.
She really was.

544
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:19,283
Yeah.

545
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,098
It looked pretty slippery out there, too.

546
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:24,497
It's the worst conditions there have
ever been experienced on Top Gear.

547
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:25,827
In three episodes?

548
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:29,920
No, ever. Ever?

549
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:30,956
Wasn't it?

550
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,939
I'm not sure I agree with that,
but sure, whatever you say.

551
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,955
I can't wait to see your time now.

552
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:38,621
But we'll do that little bit later.

553
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:43,621
Now, I want to talk about
ancient history, the 1970s.

554
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:46,622
You see, 40 years ago, if you
lived in Britain and wanted

555
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:50,044
a fast car that wasn't a pain
to live with, you were stuck

556
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,683
with something like this.

557
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:54,045
The Triumph Dolomite Sprint.

558
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,414
Yeah, the 70s kind of sucked.

559
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:59,537
But one humble hatchback
was about to change

560
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:01,462
all of that forever.

561
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:06,983
1977.

562
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:11,063
The original Volkswagen
Golf GTI lands in the UK.

563
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:17,069
Its mission, to prove you can have
practicality and proper performance.

564
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,225
Mission successful.

565
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:22,476
The GTI was quicker than most sports cars.

566
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:25,477
0-60 took barely eight seconds.

567
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:28,477
By 70s standards, that was warp speed.

568
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:31,580
The GTI was a game-changer.

569
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,580
And in the mid-1980s, with
the rest of the world

570
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,580
running to catch up, VW dropped this.

571
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,928
The second-generation Golf GTI.

572
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:44,315
Big bumpers, and big attitude.

573
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,315
Damn, this thing's good!

574
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:52,190
But then came the 1990s, and the
GTI became heavier and uglier.

575
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:56,722
The Mark 4 was so porky, it
was actually slower to 60

576
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,364
than the 70s original.

577
00:29:58,389 --> 00:30:00,976
But VW wasn't done yet.

578
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,761
Argh!

579
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:07,124
That is more I like it.

580
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:08,823
Yes, the Mark 5.

581
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,550
Loads more power, way more nimble.

582
00:30:11,994 --> 00:30:14,749
This was a hot hatch for the noughties.

583
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:23,660
And by 2009, with the Mark 6, VW had
officially rediscovered its mojo.

584
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,697
The GTi was back.

585
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:33,061
That brings us, 40 years after
the original GTi landed

586
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:39,816
in the UK, to this - the
Volkswagen Golf GTi Clubsport S.

587
00:30:40,835 --> 00:30:44,297
The most powerful production Golf ever.

588
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:53,295
306 horses, nearly three
times as many as that

589
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,645
original GTi from the '70s.

590
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:59,720
And that's the kind of inflation
I think we can all get behind.

591
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:08,143
And because it's a proper old school
Golf, all the power heads that way.

592
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:14,082
By rights, front wheel drive
cars like should understeer,

593
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:19,175
but the Clubsport S doesn't, it
just grips and grips and grips.

594
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:21,788
How is it doing this?

595
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:24,812
That just makes no sense!

596
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:28,473
This is a fast, fast car.

597
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,236
Woo-hoo!

598
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,001
Yes, yes, yes!

599
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:41,218
You can almost smell the
engineering quality.

600
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:45,939
It feels like 40 years of
perfecting the hot hatch formula.

601
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:47,864
It feels sophisticated.

602
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,481
It feels expensive.

603
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:55,294
Which, I'm afraid, it is.

604
00:31:55,294 --> 00:32:00,110
In fact, this Clubsport S model cost 34,000 pounds.

605
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:03,563
That's nearly three grand
more than a Ford Focus RS,

606
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:07,865
which has more power, four
wheel drive and rear seats.

607
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,383
Did I not mention that?

608
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:13,755
Well, yes, as part of their weight
saving measures, Volkswagen has

609
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:18,174
chopped out the rear bench
and replaced it with a pole

610
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:19,696
and some garden netting.

611
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,654
The rear parcel shelf has also gone,
along with most of the insulation.

612
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:27,185
They've even ditched the floor mats.

613
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,725
And there's no armrest.

614
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:32,768
And guess how much that crash diet saves?

615
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:35,058
30 kilos.

616
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:38,342
I mean, you can put that
back on after a big kebab!

617
00:32:40,144 --> 00:32:43,895
The Clubsport has all the
performance, but almost none

618
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,066
of the practicality.

619
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:48,066
It's like it's forgotten
what hot hatches stand for.

620
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:52,751
I'd argue this isn't
really a hot hatch at all.

621
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:57,137
So, if it's not a hot hatch, what is it?

622
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,248
Well, ask Volkswagen and
they will tell you it's

623
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:04,381
a two seater sports car, with
an appetite for race tracks.

624
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:06,747
One race track in particular.

625
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:08,874
The Nurburgring.

626
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:12,869
The scariest circuit on the planet.

627
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:16,832
13 miles and 73 corners of twisting.

628
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:19,382
Terrifying tarmac.

629
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,911
And the spiritual home of the Clubsport S.

630
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:28,400
This is officially the fastest
front wheel drive car

631
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,298
ever to lap this track.

632
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:32,987
It was developed here, tested here.

633
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:36,582
Every detail has been tweaked
to make this go as fast

634
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,612
as possible, out there.

635
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:44,275
It even has sticky tyres, fade
resistant brakes and proper

636
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,868
functional spoilers.

637
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:50,035
So what's this track
ready Golf really like?

638
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:54,732
To find out, I've turned up to
a typical German track day,

639
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:58,965
to see if the Clubsport S can
keep up with the locals, who,

640
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,523
let's face it, seem to take
things pretty seriously.

641
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,973
Yes, getting the very best out
of the Golf in this field

642
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:09,541
was going to take some real driving talent.

643
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,082
Right.

644
00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:12,973
Let's do this.

645
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:14,973
Hi Rory, welcome.

646
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:17,855
Yes, why don't you show me round?

647
00:34:17,979 --> 00:34:20,555
For you, I've got a special present.

648
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:24,053
A map of the track and then you
know where we are exactly.

649
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,539
You think we can keep up?

650
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,368
No problem!

651
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:35,072
With Sabine in confident
mood, we headed out to see

652
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:36,845
what the Golf was made of.

653
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,837
It's like a little go-kart.

654
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:41,881
A front wheel drive go-kart - so much fun.

655
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:43,660
OK.

656
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:46,025
I love the carousel.

657
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:46,654
OK, now I'm scared.

658
00:34:48,314 --> 00:34:49,503
I love it.

659
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,416
Argh!

660
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:57,524
Your name is Rory Reid, not Rory Worried.

661
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:59,462
I'm very worried right now.

662
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:00,619
Oh my God.

663
00:35:00,947 --> 00:35:04,122
Now I was keen to really
drill down into the merits

664
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:06,064
of the Golf's chassis dynamics.

665
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:07,946
Sorry!

666
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:09,863
But then Sabine spotted some prey.

667
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,008
They're our enemies.

668
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,232
OK, we have some cars up ahead.

669
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:17,440
So we went hunting.

670
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:19,179
Come on, little Golf.

671
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,654
What is it?

672
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,353
That's a 3 Series BMW.

673
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:23,731
Later!

674
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,560
I wonder how he feels,
being overtaken by a Golf?

675
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:32,464
I think we need another victim.

676
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,583
I can see a Porsche.

677
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,887
That looks like a - it's a Cayman R.

678
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:39,691
Cayman R.

679
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:40,701
The quick one.

680
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:44,744
Bye, bye, baby.

681
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,744
It's a Cayman GT4.

682
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:49,566
We're just giant killing right now.

683
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,871
I'm going to start writing these down.

684
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:52,896
Oh yes.

685
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:56,566
In the hands of Sabine, the
Golf wasn't just keeping

686
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:57,566
up with the locals...

687
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:58,566
Loser, loser!

688
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,066
It was owning them.

689
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:03,590
Come on, little Golf.

690
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:05,889
Coming closer.

691
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,161
Look at this!

692
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,375
That was a Carrera 4 GTS.

693
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:13,726
That is a 90,000 pound car.

694
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:14,840
Oh, cool.

695
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:18,726
Which made me wonder
while we were out here,

696
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:22,493
could the Golf overtake
a million quid's worth?

697
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:23,990
OK.

698
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:27,555
Only one way to find out.

699
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:30,857
Go, go, go, go!

700
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,263
Come on, come on, come on!

701
00:36:33,515 --> 00:36:34,740
What's that?

702
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,596
That's a Corvette.

703
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:36,596
That's the C6.

704
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:37,595
Seriously?

705
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,595
It's 90 grand.

706
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:42,225
There's a Golf GTA on your tail!

707
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:44,671
Bye!

708
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:48,075
Sabine, I'm trying to write here!

709
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,150
But Sabine was in the zone.

710
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,996
She was braking later.

711
00:36:56,612 --> 00:36:58,533
On the power earlier.

712
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,597
Woo!

713
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:00,852
That's a GT3.

714
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,126
They're 100 grand.

715
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,619
The Golf was astonishing.

716
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:07,852
Nissan GTR.

717
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,379
80 grand.

718
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,453
Now past the half million pound mark.

719
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:16,812
We need more.

720
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,542
Sabine wasn't done yet.

721
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,021
Come on, come on, come on.

722
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:20,788
What is it?

723
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:23,101
That looks like a Porsche 911 Turbo.

724
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:24,853
I'll catch you, my friend.

725
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,379
You are on it, you are on it.

726
00:37:28,404 --> 00:37:29,404
No brakes.

727
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:34,977
We're catching him.

728
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,969
Get out of my way.

729
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:40,453
911 Turbo.

730
00:37:40,453 --> 00:37:41,453
Destroyed.

731
00:37:42,715 --> 00:37:44,039
How much is it?

732
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,064
That's 130k!

733
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:47,089
Wow.

734
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:49,063
Woo-hoo!

735
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:54,612
With 700 grands-worth of overtakes
now in the bag, nothing was safe

736
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,263
from our little hatch back.

737
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:57,049
What is that?

738
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:58,049
That's a Lamborghini.

739
00:37:58,048 --> 00:37:58,981
A Lamborghini!

740
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:01,981
That's a 570 Superleggera!

741
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,836
And I mean nothing.

742
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:09,190
Oh my God.

743
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,714
Oh my God!

744
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:13,832
Then, around the next corner...

745
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:15,479
One more, one more.

746
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:16,500
Yes.

747
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:18,406
911 GT3 RX.

748
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,359
If you get this, you've done it.

749
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,093
Get him.

750
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:20,675
Come on, little Golf.

751
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:25,849
Are we going to get the GT3?

752
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:26,849
Are we going to get it?

753
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:27,849
Can we overtake it?

754
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,849
We've got him, we got him!

755
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,849
We got him!

756
00:38:37,058 --> 00:38:38,130
Have some of that!

757
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:42,709
You are not human.

758
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,411
This car...

759
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:49,656
I love my job!

760
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,270
Very nice.

761
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:03,117
Great driving, Sabine.

762
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:05,525
Great driving, you crossed everything.

763
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:08,933
Yeah, even him.

764
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:12,184
No, the car was really great.

765
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:12,788
Yes.

766
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:15,788
Good handling, like a little
go-kart, so I had so much fun.

767
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,058
I think you had a little
bit fun as well, Rory?

768
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,578
I was having fun up to a point,
and then, you know, my stomach

769
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:21,578
was churning around a little bit.

770
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:22,527
But we got there.

771
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,015
How bad?

772
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:23,718
Not too bad?

773
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:24,718
It was touch-and-go.

774
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:25,547
Touch-and-go?

775
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:28,830
Not that we don't trust Rory's
math, but we added it all up back

776
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,641
at the office, and you
passed?1.1 million worth

777
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,666
of cars out there.

778
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,666
Way to go!

779
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:45,551
But I must say, I could have done two
million, but I had the heavy fat

780
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:48,135
oak in my passenger seat.

781
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,553
I thought we were friends!

782
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:53,030
Down hill, yes, but uphill, no.

783
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,731
Can we just take a minute to
appreciate the Clubsport S.

784
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:02,191
34 grand is a lot for a hot hatch,
but that's cheap for something that

785
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,534
can annihilate six figure supercars.

786
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:07,633
Yes, if you have a Sabine driving it.

787
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,658
If it's you or me driving
it, it's just an expensive

788
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,039
Golf with no back seat.

789
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,396
I take your point.

790
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:16,720
Sabine, we will talk more about that
lap over in Extra Gear later on, OK?

791
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,047
We'll do that.

792
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:17,564
That's right.

793
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:18,136
Check it out.

794
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:20,039
Ladies and gentlemen, Sabine Schmitz.

795
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,669
So no pressure then.

796
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,694
What, so I have to follow that?

797
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,694
Yes.

798
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:32,694
Is that deliberate?

799
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:33,940
Well, yes.

800
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
How cool was that?

801
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,965
That was really, really brilliant.

802
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,678
Yes.

803
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,313
All right.

804
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,313
Now, it's dream garage, OK.

805
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,922
You have?100,000 to spend,
you want something exciting,

806
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:46,873
but just a little bit scary.

807
00:40:46,873 --> 00:40:50,665
Something that will get the blood
pumping, but not too much, you know.

808
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,532
What do you get?

809
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,115
OK, I could go BAC Mono.

810
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,849
The car that looks like an F1 car.

811
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:56,641
Oh yes.

812
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:59,614
Superb engine, a Chevy
Corvette, maybe, Stingray.

813
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,630
What is it with you and Corvette Stingrays?

814
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,547
Cayman GT4, with shaved down rear
tyres for a bit of slidy slidy.

815
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:06,096
Perfect.

816
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:07,639
OK.

817
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:10,947
Both good answers, both wrong answers.

818
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:14,682
Because if you want to
spend?100,000 on something

819
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:17,889
exciting but a bit scary,
you want one of these.

820
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,095
Huh?

821
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,217
That is the Bunning
Lowlander, Widebody 380HD.

822
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,504
That's what you want.

823
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:27,718
What the hell is that?

824
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,190
That's a rear end muck spreader, obviously.

825
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,649
HD stands for high-definition.

826
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:35,004
How do you know that?

827
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,789
Everybody knows that.

828
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:38,150
I don't know that.

829
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:39,661
These people all know that.

830
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:40,661
You know that?

831
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:41,661
Yes.

832
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:41,661
Yes, thanks, cheers.

833
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:47,063
So that thing just spreads poo?

834
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:50,557
Well, yes, it spreads poo, but
that's not all it spreads.

835
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:51,469
Oh no!

836
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:52,469
Want to know what else it spread?

837
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,470
What else does it spread?

838
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:57,253
A melon, a shed and a Volvo.

839
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,805
Check this out.

840
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:06,148
This is the Bunning Lowlander
Widebody 380HD and it spreads muck.

841
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:07,427
Really well.

842
00:42:07,452 --> 00:42:08,776
Check this out.

843
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:14,557
OK, I got my trusty
assistant with me today.

844
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:15,582
She's super competent.

845
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:17,136
Her name's Tamsin Greig.

846
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:18,873
Let's rock and roll.

847
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:22,258
Mind my melons!

848
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,883
I think this is going to be fun, Tam.

849
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:31,564
Oh, it's a melon storm.

850
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:33,627
Wow!

851
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:37,262
What a mess!

852
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:40,057
Next is the shed.

853
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:44,458
OK, Tam, he's all loaded.

854
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:46,092
That is a shed in the chute.

855
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:48,829
Let's make some matchsticks.

856
00:42:51,824 --> 00:42:53,288
Ooh!

857
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,940
Are you having fun?

858
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:03,847
There is still one side of it
left, being a bit stubborn.

859
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,246
OK, Tam, I got the perfect
thing to get rid of that

860
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:08,079
last piece of wood.

861
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,439
Our scrap Volvo.

862
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:13,927
OK, this is the big one, Tam.

863
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,052
We're going to need full power, I think.

864
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:26,947
There goes the bonnet.

865
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:32,061
Oh, the poor Volvo.

866
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:34,841
I've never you so excited!

867
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:36,118
Woo-hoo!

868
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,631
Oh, there goes the wheel.

869
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,892
There's a lot of leg room in that car now!

870
00:43:58,633 --> 00:43:59,865
So there you have it.

871
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:03,865
That is the Bunning
Lowlander Widebody 380HD.

872
00:44:03,865 --> 00:44:05,662
It spreads stuff.

873
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:07,631
All over the place.

874
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:16,907
Hold on - that's a poo spreader.

875
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,534
What kind of animal produces
the kind of poo that needs

876
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:21,534
a machine like that?

877
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,243
It doesn't matter.

878
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,063
Any animal.

879
00:44:24,063 --> 00:44:27,063
It'll spread anything, anywhere, any time.

880
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:29,480
I have never seen you look so happy.

881
00:44:30,198 --> 00:44:32,198
I think you enjoyed yourself
too, in the big tractor.

882
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,199
That was good, because I was
the one making the things

883
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,252
and the things and the...

884
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:40,481
But I knew you'd know about this
stuff, because you play a farmer

885
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:41,506
in The Archers, don't you.

886
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:46,450
I play a farmer on Radio 4's,
you don't know about this

887
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,075
because you never ask me any
questions, on a programme

888
00:44:50,075 --> 00:44:51,075
called The Archers.

889
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:52,075
The Archers?

890
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:53,075
The Archers.

891
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:55,237
Is that an archery show, what is that?

892
00:44:56,746 --> 00:44:57,815
Tell him.

893
00:44:57,815 --> 00:45:00,935
The Archers is a long-running
radio show on Radio 4.

894
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,975
It started in 1951, I think. Mm-hm.

895
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:04,975
And it's about a made up
a place called Ambridge.

896
00:45:04,976 --> 00:45:07,490
You've been on a radio show since 1951?!

897
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:10,699
Not that long. '91.

898
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:11,601
Yeah. That long?

899
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:13,970
Yeah, I let them warm up for
30 years before I joined it.

900
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,006
How did I not know this?

901
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,302
Because you don't ask me any questions.

902
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:18,427
That's right.

903
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:23,936
I've done a lot of stuff with muck
spreading and my character drives

904
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:26,961
a huge combine harvester, which is
kind of the size of a bungalow.

905
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:28,443
What kind of combine harvester?

906
00:45:28,443 --> 00:45:29,422
A big one.

907
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:30,422
The size of a bungalow.

908
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,632
Is it an International
Harvester, a John Deere?

909
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:35,505
What is it?

910
00:45:38,022 --> 00:45:40,755
It's like a chair in a radio studio.

911
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:46,819
But I stand on the chair to
get height differential.

912
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,661
Why?

913
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,661
Because then you can hear the
difference in height when I'm up

914
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:51,680
there and someone is shouting
to me from down there.

915
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,508
So it sounds like a tall machine.

916
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:55,215
So you record your pieces
standing on a chair?

917
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,164
Yeah, and shouting down
to the person who's not

918
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,855
in the combine harvester.

919
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,880
You should see me when I'm riding a horse!

920
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,452
All right, now it's time to see how
you went around our test track.

921
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:09,238
Are you ready?

922
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:10,221
The big moment. Yeah.

923
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:12,652
How do you think you did? Well...

924
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:16,172
I was really afraid. Great.

925
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,172
Really afraid. Great.

926
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,899
And I was most afraid of the weather.

927
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:24,011
And being in the car on my own.

928
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:25,750
Was it fun, did you enjoy it?

929
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:26,749
I did.

930
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:28,858
It was kind of like, you
know when you've just

931
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:30,731
had too much coffee... Yeah.

932
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:33,686
And you remember each coffee,
but then you're left with this

933
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:35,731
feeling that you don't
know what to do with.

934
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:36,332
Yeah.

935
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:38,719
So if that's enjoyment, then yes.

936
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:42,568
What do you think? Do you
think she had a good time?

937
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:43,041
Definitely not.

938
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,482
All right, well, shall we take a look?

939
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:48,025
Before we watch the lap,
though, it needs to be said,

940
00:46:48,025 --> 00:46:49,556
it was really, really slippery.

941
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:50,885
Almost flooding conditions.

942
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:52,515
It was horrendous out there.

943
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,129
Just shy of ice.

944
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:59,204
Let's take a look. OK, here we go.

945
00:46:59,204 --> 00:47:01,204
Tamsin Greig, GT 86.

946
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:03,093
Pretty good off the line.

947
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:05,953
Slick gear up into third.

948
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:09,324
Don't know if I should change
gear, should I change gear?

949
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:10,721
It's telling me to change gear.

950
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:11,834
Well, it's too late.

951
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:15,721
Look at this, good speed, look how
wet it is with puddles everywhere.

952
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:16,945
Third gear.

953
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:18,755
Not quite on the line.

954
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,009
Grass!

955
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:22,009
That's the grass there, Tamsin.

956
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,009
You must have...

957
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:25,009
You were a bit scared there, weren't you?

958
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,460
You went on the grass.

959
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:28,341
Here we go, third gear.

960
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:30,341
I think you're in second there.

961
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:33,745
I think you're being cautious,
that's the word there, cautious.

962
00:47:33,745 --> 00:47:35,745
Whoa, sorry, I'll pay for that.

963
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:36,939
Matt will pay for that.

964
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:39,058
Was that the gearbox again?

965
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,441
Third gear, down the
straight and breaking out.

966
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:42,603
Look how wet it is.

967
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:44,603
I do feel sorry for you. It's properly wet.

968
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,726
Get on the power.

969
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:54,760
Sorry, I'll pay for that one.
Matt will pay for the first.

970
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,235
Down the back straight.

971
00:47:58,005 --> 00:47:59,363
Breathe, come on breathe.

972
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,717
You weren't breathing
in training, were you?

973
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:03,632
No, you weren't.

974
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:05,632
There's the follow-through.
Safely navigated.

975
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,632
It's really brilliant when
you go fast around corners!

976
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:12,148
Through the tyres.

977
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:15,106
You can actually accelerate around corners!

978
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:18,090
I've never been able to do
that in north-west London.

979
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:21,945
Look at your line, it was always
really good into that corner.

980
00:48:21,945 --> 00:48:22,945
That was the one.

981
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:23,603
Was it?

982
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:25,603
That's the most unsighted
corner on the circuit,

983
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:26,603
but you always nailed it.

984
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:30,371
OK, Gambon.

985
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,519
Pfft! It's not...

986
00:48:33,268 --> 00:48:36,268
It's what we call controlled driving.

987
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:41,097
Yeah! Yeah.

988
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:47,498
OK, now considering it was
a swimming pool out there,

989
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:48,646
are you happy with that?

990
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:52,617
It looks a lot slower than it felt.

991
00:48:52,617 --> 00:48:55,447
It was like an old lady going to the shops.

992
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:58,242
Chris, how do you think she did?

993
00:48:58,242 --> 00:48:59,242
I'm confident.

994
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:02,846
I think we've got a good solid time,
and we've got someone that's alive.

995
00:49:03,948 --> 00:49:05,373
OK, are you ready?

996
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:11,860
The time to beat is still
1:39.5 set by Max Whitlock,

997
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:13,373
the Olympic demigod.

998
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:15,527
Have you ever seen his scissor
work on the pommel horse?

999
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:17,930
Fantastic. Calm down.

1000
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,709
Tamsin Greig...

1001
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:25,267
You went around our track in one minute...

1002
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:26,089
Yes!

1003
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:31,420
58.7.

1004
00:49:31,445 --> 00:49:34,445
Yes! That's a wet time.

1005
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:36,133
That is a wet time.

1006
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:39,133
You're OK.

1007
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:42,535
Look at that.

1008
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:49,872
That's the second-fastest wet time.

1009
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,730
And the last wet time we had
was not nearly that wet.

1010
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,389
It wasn't. That's a good wet time.

1011
00:49:58,414 --> 00:50:01,928
We are here, we are alive, and
I haven't brought too much

1012
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:02,953
shame on the family.

1013
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:05,150
No shame. We all win.

1014
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:08,087
I did really, really secretly enjoy it.

1015
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,603
You should be proud of yourself.
That was great.

1016
00:50:09,603 --> 00:50:11,519
Ladies and gentlemen, Tamsin Greig.

1017
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:17,972
You were great, fantastic.

1018
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:21,202
Thanks. Thank you, well done.

1019
00:50:24,165 --> 00:50:27,349
You're still alive, so we're all good.

1020
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:34,538
OK, now I want to talk sports cars.

1021
00:50:34,538 --> 00:50:37,881
Not big, intimidating,
fire-breathing supercar

1022
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:42,084
monsters, but affordable,
adorable, attainable cars.

1023
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:44,689
Cars with romance, you know?

1024
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:47,307
The thing about sports cars
like that, there's only

1025
00:50:47,307 --> 00:50:50,307
one place that springs to mind, right?

1026
00:50:58,986 --> 00:50:59,841
Italy.

1027
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,500
There's just something
about it, isn't there?

1028
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:08,890
Especially if you're in a classic
Italian sports car, like this.

1029
00:51:09,685 --> 00:51:12,055
The Fiat 124 Spider.

1030
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:14,469
Bella, huh?

1031
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:26,602
Born in 1966, the 124 Spider
was designed by Pininfarina.

1032
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:30,443
It had a sparkling twin cam
engine, a cutting edge

1033
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:32,502
5-speed manual gearbox.

1034
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:35,830
And it weighed about as
much as an actual spider.

1035
00:51:37,904 --> 00:51:40,807
And it was bellissima to drive.

1036
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:42,266
It still is.

1037
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:44,333
Still is...

1038
00:51:53,064 --> 00:51:58,914
The 124 Spider was so good, so
timeless, that Fiat kept building

1039
00:51:58,939 --> 00:52:00,859
it for nearly two decades.

1040
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:04,562
But that was 30 years ago.

1041
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:10,616
And ever since, fans of simple,
sensibly-priced Italian two seaters

1042
00:52:10,948 --> 00:52:12,997
have been left kind of hungry.

1043
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:16,719
But now, Fiat has a new dish on the menu.

1044
00:52:21,894 --> 00:52:25,685
This is the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.

1045
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,835
A classic name, classic recipe.

1046
00:52:31,433 --> 00:52:35,546
Small, lightweight,
brilliantly back to basics.

1047
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:44,773
It's stick shift, rear-wheel
drive, and the roof is not some

1048
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:48,487
complicated, Transformer
robot of metal and motors.

1049
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:52,192
It's just a little scrap of fabric
you operate using one of these.

1050
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:57,495
Just pop it up and pop it down.

1051
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,565
Simple as that.

1052
00:53:06,223 --> 00:53:09,907
And when you get it out on the road,
you can really start to appreciate

1053
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:11,530
that beautiful simplicity.

1054
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:19,232
Hello, parmigiana, panna cotta.

1055
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:24,267
Oh right, the car...

1056
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:30,729
See, this 124 is a throwback
to a less complicated age.

1057
00:53:33,352 --> 00:53:37,110
Sure, sometimes you want a
state-of-the-art sports car

1058
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:42,294
with your torque vectoring and
your magnetic adaptive damping

1059
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,319
and a double clutch gearbox and
a Wi-Fi enabled milk frother.

1060
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,383
But sometimes you just want
to keep it simple, right?

1061
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:02,746
So, after a 30 year absence, is
this finally the genuine Italian

1062
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:04,776
sports car we've been waiting for?

1063
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:17,694
Buongiorno.

1064
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:20,533
Une caffe espresso si prega?

1065
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:26,887
Well, here's the problem.

1066
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:29,386
I'm not really in Italy...

1067
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,752
Hiya!

1068
00:54:33,656 --> 00:54:37,136
I'm in Los Angeles, and this is a film set.

1069
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:41,782
And this waiter, he's not
called Alessandro or Giuseppe.

1070
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:43,606
His name is Hunter.

1071
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:44,716
Hey.

1072
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:47,079
Can you read my film script?

1073
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,209
Oh, sure.

1074
00:54:49,622 --> 00:54:53,613
And this 124 is not an Italian car.

1075
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:57,180
Sure, it's got a Fiat badge
on it and a few bits

1076
00:54:57,205 --> 00:55:01,003
of it come from Italy, but
underneath, this is Japanese.

1077
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,217
Specifically, it's one of these.

1078
00:55:07,606 --> 00:55:11,185
A Mazda Miata, or MX-5,
as you guys call it.

1079
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:14,877
And while pretty much every
car in the world shares

1080
00:55:14,902 --> 00:55:20,052
something with another car,
these two share pretty

1081
00:55:20,077 --> 00:55:22,077
much everything.

1082
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:25,878
Check out the Mazda's cabin.

1083
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:32,145
And now check out the Fiat's cabin.

1084
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:34,836
Mazda.

1085
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:36,357
Fiat.

1086
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,329
Mazda.

1087
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:39,203
Fiat.

1088
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,922
Wait, hang on, which is which?

1089
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:47,479
The 124 is even built in Japan, on the same

1090
00:55:47,479 --> 00:55:49,878
production line as the MX-5.

1091
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,175
Now, if you're going to borrow
from a little sports car,

1092
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:05,754
the MX-5 is definitely
where you want to start.

1093
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:15,815
However, the stuff the Italians have
added seems to have made it worse.

1094
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:20,020
You see, where as the Mazda uses
a naturally aspirated motor,

1095
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:23,543
this 124 uses a turbo motor.

1096
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:31,494
Yeah, you get a bit of extra power,
168 horsepower, to be exact.

1097
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:38,447
And this 124 goes 0-60 in 6.8 seconds
and has a top speed of 144 miles an hour

1098
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,239
Quick enough to leave a Mazda its dust.

1099
00:56:42,173 --> 00:56:45,853
But, and this may sound picky,
but that's kind of my job,

1100
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:51,696
these kind of cars are meant to be
all about instant throttle response

1101
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:55,009
and high revs and keeping you
connected to the chassis.

1102
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,882
But here, when you put your foot
down, there's just a little bit

1103
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:03,567
of turbo lag, a slight hesitation
before things get going.

1104
00:57:03,614 --> 00:57:05,777
Just enough to break the connection.

1105
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,779
It's like trying to tie your
shoelaces with boxing gloves on.

1106
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:11,949
It's a pain in the ass.

1107
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:17,857
So the Mazda has the Fiat beaten on feel.

1108
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:21,186
But at least the 124 is cheap, right?

1109
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:22,624
Well, no.

1110
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:26,982
This one cost nearly 30
grand, almost nine grand more

1111
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,634
than the fastest MX-5.

1112
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:31,027
Mamma Mia.

1113
00:57:38,025 --> 00:57:41,771
Don't get me wrong, this
isn't an awful car.

1114
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:48,606
But this was Fiat's chance to summon
the ghost of all those classic

1115
00:57:48,606 --> 00:57:52,680
Italian sports cars to
revive that 60s spirit.

1116
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:58,847
Yeah, it's a fun car to flick
around on a winding canyon road,

1117
00:57:58,872 --> 00:58:01,872
but to call it the 124...

1118
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:04,241
I don't know.

1119
00:58:04,266 --> 00:58:06,883
That name feels like it
should have that 60s spirit,

1120
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,284
and this car, it just doesn't.

1121
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:18,617
It's like, the way it looks,
all 21st-century retro.

1122
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:22,949
It's just a bit... Fake.

1123
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:27,013
So if you want a two seat
Italian sports car that takes

1124
00:58:27,013 --> 00:58:30,408
you back to the golden age,
and come on, who doesn't?

1125
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:34,012
I'm afraid I can't recommend the Fiat 124.

1126
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:38,925
I can, however, recommend the Fiat 124.

1127
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,443
Seriously.

1128
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,950
If you want to live out all
those 60s Italy fantasies,

1129
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,950
and I really don't blame you
if you do, then why not do it

1130
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,771
in a car from 60s Italy?

1131
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:51,730
Molto bene.

1132
00:58:52,939 --> 00:58:54,426
Bonasera.

1133
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,957
Pappa da pupeda.

1134
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:03,800
♪ On days like these

1135
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,800
♪ I wonder what became of you

1136
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,800
♪ Maybe today you're singing
songs with someone new...

1137
00:59:22,284 --> 00:59:24,284
I tried, I wanted to like it.

1138
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:26,703
I really did, I really wanted to like it.

1139
00:59:26,703 --> 00:59:27,923
Yeah, you're right.

1140
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:29,109
It's a let down.

1141
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:31,007
I just can't get on board with the styling.

1142
00:59:31,007 --> 00:59:33,433
To me it's kind of, I don't
know, a little droopy.

1143
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,023
Such a disappointment.

1144
00:59:35,023 --> 00:59:37,707
And the worst thing is, it doesn't
even feel rear-wheel drive,

1145
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:38,538
because it's got so much grip.

1146
00:59:38,538 --> 00:59:41,330
Yeah. This is a beautiful moment.

1147
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:43,615
What? What?

1148
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:44,829
We agree!

1149
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:50,092
We all hate it!

1150
00:59:52,341 --> 00:59:56,229
On next week's show, I'm
the first person ever

1151
00:59:56,229 --> 00:59:58,214
to review the Bugatti Chiron.

1152
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:00,372
Yeah.

1153
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:03,222
And I'm the first person ever
to review the new Ducati

1154
01:00:03,222 --> 01:00:05,005
1299 Superleggera.

1155
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,112
And they gave me a Renault Twingo.

1156
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:13,981
It's a big, big show.

1157
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:15,270
We'll see you then.

1158
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,784
Good night.
