00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:27,034
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:28,033
On tonight's show,

3
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,473
we've got a world exclusive
on four wheels and on two wheels.

4
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:36,074
That's right, we're doing a bike.

5
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:39,714
But first, if you like
huge horsepower hypercars,

6
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:42,634
and if you're watching this
it's safe to assume that you do,

7
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,514
now is a great time to be alive.

8
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:48,394
There's not a week that goes by
without another 1,000 horsepower,

9
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:51,074
million-pound monster
appearing on the scene,

10
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:52,474
but where did it all begin?

11
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:56,234
Well, here's Chris Harris,
with a quick history lesson.

12
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:03,834
Once upon a time, there was
a car called the Bugatti Veyron.

13
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,914
Volkswagen's passion project,

14
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:10,194
it launched in 2005
and promptly rewrote the rule book.

15
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:17,074
Not only was it the world's fastest,
most powerful production car,

16
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:20,434
it cost an unprecedented
one million euros.

17
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,314
This was hypercar 1.0 and,
without it, we might never

18
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:28,954
have seen the likes
of the McLaren P1, the LaFerrari

19
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:31,514
or the Porsche 918 Spyder.

20
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:38,234
But now it's gone -
and been replaced by this.

21
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:45,034
The new £2 million Bugatti Chiron.

22
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:49,554
Like the Veyron,

23
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:54,394
it has an eight-litre, 16-cylinder
engine, with four turbochargers.

24
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:59,554
And because this is the car
to replace the Veyron,

25
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:04,034
you would expect it to pack some
sort of extra futuristic shove.

26
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:10,154
But you'd be wrong, because this
is basically a very modified Veyron.

27
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:14,514
The same huge petrol engine,
four-wheel-drive system, gearbox -

28
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:18,394
it's all been tinkered and improved,
but this is the old formula.

29
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:25,274
So, if the Veyron was revolutionary,
the Chiron, I'm afraid, isn't.

30
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,314
But it does have...

31
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:31,914
..1,500 horsepower.

32
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:40,514
And that...
Well, that's a really long runway.

33
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:43,994
I'm quite nervous.

34
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,674
I don't really know how you
prepare yourself for this,

35
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:51,714
so I think you just go, don't you?

36
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,514
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,874
60. That's 100.

38
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:02,754
That's 125, that took six seconds.

39
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:07,634
That's 190. That's 200.

40
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:10,114
215. I'm trying to read
the speed and look ahead.

41
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:13,794
225. 228.

42
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,834
231. 233.

43
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,834
236 and that's the limit to there.

44
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:28,714
That is absolutely mind-bending.

45
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:33,994
I'm sorry, but that...

46
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:36,114
..needs another go.

47
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,514
This is looking insane.

48
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:49,074
You can almost hear it
gulping down the fuel.

49
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:53,474
The Veyron could empty its
100-litre fuel tank in 12 minutes.

50
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,634
This thing can do it in nine!

51
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:02,034
And the force
on those tyres - 3,800Gs!

52
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:08,234
Which means at this speed,
the 12mg valve caps weigh 13.5kg.

53
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:14,754
This is the edge of physics!

54
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,514
At this speed,

55
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:22,234
this Chiron is gulping
1,000 litres of air a second.

56
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:25,314
Drink in, Mr Chiron!
Get it down you!

57
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,914
That's a drug. That's a drug.

58
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:39,714
I know it's just going fast
in a straight line, but...

59
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:44,474
just the motive force required
to smash you through the air!

60
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:50,274
Now, if you're thinking, hang on,
the Veyron goes quicker than 236,

61
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:54,114
well, you'd be right,
but so does the Chiron.

62
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,914
You see, the Chiron
is a two-key vehicle.

63
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:58,594
The first key nestles in the
dashboard here and that gives

64
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:01,794
you 236mph, but down here, there's
another one, if I can find it.

65
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,674
There you go. Look at that.

66
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:08,354
Put that and turn it down there
and you're allowed 261mph.

67
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:12,394
And because Bugatti
is still testing the tyres,

68
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:17,114
even that speed is still limited.
How fast will it go?

69
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:20,274
270? Maybe 280?

70
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:23,634
I think we can speculate that,
at some point during its life,

71
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:27,674
the Chiron might well do 300mph.

72
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,554
300mph.

73
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:36,754
It goes like
a £2 million car should, then.

74
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,274
But what about the way it looks?

75
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:43,154
When I first saw pictures of the
Chiron, I was totally underwhelmed.

76
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:46,914
It looked too much like a Veyron,
but now I'm here with it in the raw,

77
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:51,154
I can get a sense of proportion and
the details, and it really works.

78
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:55,274
This lovely C that houses the air
intakes, then round the back here,

79
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:59,274
to this floating light bar,
massive diffuser and huge wing.

80
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,194
It's a stunning-looking thing.

81
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,834
The only problem is this
rather nasty 3 door handle,

82
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:10,714
but otherwise, well, it looks
every inch the £2 million car.

83
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:13,034
As does the interior.

84
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:17,314
It isn't complicated by
huge screens or rows of unfathomable

85
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,394
buttons and switches.

86
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:23,954
Bugatti intends the Chiron
to be timeless...elegant.

87
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:28,074
Then again, no-one ever criticised
the old Veyron for feeling cheap.

88
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:35,314
But they did criticise it
for being a bit, well, dull.

89
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:40,074
You see, it was admired,
but never really adored.

90
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:45,434
It was so competent, so stable,
it all felt a bit joyless.

91
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:49,714
With the Chiron though, Bugatti
has started to have some fun.

92
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,034
To start with, it's got
adaptive dampers all round,

93
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,154
so they can slacken off
and make the car comfortable

94
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:58,554
when it needs to be, and firm
and responsive when it needs to be.

95
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:02,154
And the steering is
a different world to the Veyron.

96
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,474
It's now electromechanical,
it's into the wrists.

97
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:10,434
The car now feels so much more
agile, but easier to place as well.

98
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:12,954
It's got a front end
you can lean on.

99
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,074
And with the four-wheel-drive
system revised, as well,

100
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:18,514
there's even mention of the D word.

101
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:23,234
Yes,
Bugatti says this thing will drift,

102
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,834
so I suppose we'd better
find out, hadn't we?

103
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,034
This is my
"BLEEP don't crash it" face.

104
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:40,354
It's like wrestling a shark.

105
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:42,074
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

106
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,434
The traction is mega.

107
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:53,234
All the power goes to the back
wheels, then it goes all

108
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,474
to the front and you have
to just grab armfuls of lock.

109
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,874
Rail breaker bit, get the rear
to rotate, then follow the gas on.

110
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:17,234
Yeah. You can drift the Chiron.

111
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:22,274
Now, of course, I'm not saying
Bugatti has gone and built

112
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:26,394
some P1 918 LaFerrari
baiting trap weapon.

113
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:31,274
The truth is, the more time
you spend with the Chiron, the more

114
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:34,394
you get the impression those
three upstarts don't even feature

115
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,634
on its radar.

116
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:39,314
What Bugatti has built here is
a car with a different purpose.

117
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:45,914
Above all else, the Chiron
is about straightforward speed.

118
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:56,074
And when it comes to speed,
it has no equals.

119
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:58,354
You can talk about
which one of the McLaren,

120
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:01,194
the Ferrari and the Porsche
you would buy, but you don't

121
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,234
with the Chiron.

122
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:07,154
You either buy a Chiron or no
Chiron. There is no competition.

123
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:13,634
A class apart, then.
Well, the Chiron isn't the Veyron.

124
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:17,074
It doesn't rewrite any rule
books or change the way we look

125
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,274
at the automobile,

126
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,234
but there's something
oddly appealing about that.

127
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,754
This is no longer the Volkswagen
group trying to demonstrate

128
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:28,194
its technological superiority.

129
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,034
It just wanted
to go really, really fast.

130
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:34,114
It wants to win at car
Top Trumps and that's

131
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,554
a pleasingly,
pig-headed aim in my book.

132
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,914
And talking
of going very, very fast...

133
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:51,114
Come on. If you were me,
you would, wouldn't you?

134
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,434
I'll never tire of this!

135
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:16,874
Amazing.

136
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,474
Amazing!

137
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:21,354
I'm a very, very lucky boy.

138
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,554
That's the fastest
I've ever been in a car.

139
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,354
- OK, now, you hit the limiter
at 236mph, right? - Yeah.

140
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,594
OK, so I've got to ask you,
you had the second key,

141
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:33,034
why didn't you use the second key
and hit the limiter at 261?

142
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:35,674
- I knew you'd ask that. - Of course
I'm going to ask you that.

143
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:38,034
Look, this car
isn't quite finished yet.

144
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:40,754
Bugatti's still working on it.
That's the reason it can't go

145
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:43,554
- around our lap, by the way.
It's not quite finished. - OK.

146
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:45,834
It's so complicated,
it's a leap into the unknown.

147
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,634
They're still developing it
and I was, sort of, part of that

148
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:51,674
- development process, actually.
- You are so selfless.

149
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:56,554
Risking your life for
the millionaires of the world.

150
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,354
- I mean, it's amazing.
- It's not a millionaire's game,

151
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,994
- this is a billionaire's game.
- Yeah! - Let me give you some stats.

152
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:08,234
- Bugatti tells us the average
Chiron owner has 42 cars. - OK.

153
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:13,274
Two yachts and 1.6 helicopters.

154
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,794
OK, which 0.6 of that second
helicopter do they have, though?

155
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:22,274
- The expensive bit. - OK.

156
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:25,474
Anyhow, of all
the mind-bending stats,

157
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:30,194
I think the tyres might be the
most mind-bending part of this car,

158
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:32,514
because when Bugatti
developed this machine,

159
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,834
it had to go faster than anything
else had gone before, so it

160
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,274
went to Michelin and said,

161
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,794
"We need a new tyre,"
and Michelin said, "OK."

162
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,994
But they'd never tested
a tyre to 300mph before,

163
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,674
so they had to test it on their
aircraft rig to get the tech right

164
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:48,154
and that's how you have
to think of this car.

165
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:53,154
- It's not so much a car, it's like
a land-based jet. - Yeah. All right,

166
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,674
let's think of it that way.
And we're not done with the Chiron,

167
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,194
because later in the show,
this car is taking part in a very,

168
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:02,274
very special race. Trust me,
you don't want to miss that one.

169
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:05,914
- Rory! - That's right.
This has the most horsepower

170
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:10,034
of any Top Gear film ever
and that's not all, because,

171
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:12,994
and I don't think I'm giving away
too much when I say that tonight's

172
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:17,834
show also features an exclusive
appearance from the Smart Fortwo.

173
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,114
Yeah. - That's right.

174
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:29,034
Now it's time to welcome
this week's guest. I love this guy.

175
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,794
This is great. OK.

176
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:35,114
He is the platinum-selling,
Brit Award-winning, chart-topping

177
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:38,274
megastar who loves to go low.

178
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,434
Ladies and gentlemen, Tinie Tempah!

179
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:43,434
Girls Like
by Tinie Tempah

180
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,994
You all right? Yeah.

181
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,594
- How's it going? - Pretty good.
- Where do you want me, here?

182
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:04,234
Yeah, right there is good. So glad
to have you here, right? Come on.

183
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,994
Finally! Finally!

184
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:13,674
- Yeah, yeah. This isn't your first
time here. - No, it isn't, actually.

185
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:17,234
So, basically, I was supposed
to shoot the video for the song

186
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:21,074
Girls Like in Dunsfold,
I was supposed to shoot it here.

187
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:24,354
And as soon as I got here,
it was rainy, rainy as hell.

188
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:28,394
The light went by, like, 3pm or
4pm, so we couldn't do anything

189
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:31,354
and then, by 6pm,
the director said it was a wrap.

190
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,474
I watched the video back
and it was absolutely BLEEP.

191
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,994
It's the worst video
I've ever seen.

192
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:39,194
The worst video I've ever seen
in my life, so then we had to rush

193
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,954
over to South Africa, to do
Top Gear, where we met. Yeah. Right.

194
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,834
And then,
after we finished doing that,

195
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,674
then I got to reshoot the video
in South Africa, so actually,

196
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:51,714
Top Gear and Girls Like have a lot
of synergy, there's just a lot

197
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,754
- there. - Speaking of Girls Like,

198
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:57,074
- that kind of became an unofficial
Top Gear anthem. - Oh, yes.

199
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,314
On shoots, everywhere we go,

200
00:13:58,314 --> 00:14:01,074
you can always guarantee
this man is playing Girls Like.

201
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:05,114
- You are in his head 24/7.
- I think he just likes to...

202
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:07,114
I'm not sure he even likes the song,

203
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,794
he just likes, "Go low,
go low. Everybody get low."

204
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,194
That's what he likes. I love it.

205
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,834
- You're a bigger part of the show
than you think. - I appreciate that.

206
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,234
- That's on the new album?
- Yeah, it's on the new album, Youth,

207
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,874
coming out pretty soon
and I'm excited.

208
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,914
I've been working
on it for two years.

209
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:22,594
I'm like a Londoner,
it's an artist from the UK,

210
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,314
born and bred in London
and I wanted to be

211
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:28,994
a rapper when I was growing up
and everybody said it was naff.

212
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,434
You could never be a rapper.

213
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,994
A rapper would never get on the
radio or get on a show like this

214
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:37,274
and times have changed. Youth
is basically a celebration of that,

215
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,634
you know, just doing
something that wasn't really

216
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,834
a thing before and it's a thing now.

217
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,554
Speaking of growing up,
what was your first car?

218
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:49,834
- Oh, OK, so my first car
was a Vauxhall Corsa. - Yes. - 1.1.

219
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,554
- Humble beginnings. - Yes.

220
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:55,194
Y Reg, I remember
that very vividly and I used to...

221
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,314
Outside my mum and dad's house there
was a driveway and I'd, literally,

222
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,794
because I wanted to listen
to my music loud and stuff,

223
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:02,474
I'd just keep
the car in the driveway,

224
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:06,394
invite all my friends, technically,
to my house, but to the car,

225
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,914
so they'd get, "No, no,
don't go in there. Come in here."

226
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,394
And it was, literally, like,

227
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:12,474
my little, kind of,
like, domain for a while.

228
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:17,874
- What do you drive now? - At the moment
I'm driving the Lamborghini Huracan.

229
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,754
- Nice. - We talked about this.

230
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,514
I thought
you were going to get a Porsche?

231
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:23,674
Yeah, I kind of...

232
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,274
I don't know, we spent a week
together and I realised that you was

233
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,394
talking a lot, bro, and I was
listening to everything

234
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,434
you was saying.

235
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:34,394
You know you're with, like, Matt
LeBlanc, it's like, he's a legend.

236
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,394
I'm just like, "Yes, Matt.
Of course, Matt. I will, Matt."

237
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,954
And I got home and I was like,
"No, I don't want the Porsche."

238
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:42,274
- "Screw what he said."
- Yeah, "Screw his advice."

239
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,874
- And how do you like it?
- It's good, yeah. It's a good car.

240
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:47,674
I'm quite glad he wasn't the guest
two weeks ago, when I was...

241
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:50,754
less than kind
about the Lamborghini Huracan.

242
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,074
What did you say about it, bruv?

243
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,954
I said it was a wonderful car
for wonderful people.

244
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:58,994
And I went
and got it matted as well,

245
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:00,594
so I got MATT black colour.

246
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:01,754
Oh, thank you.

247
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:06,034
OK, what do you think?

248
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,114
Let's see how you did
in your training lap with Chris,

249
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:12,634
who just finished his Tamsin
Greig school of social etiquette.

250
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:15,434
- How did it go out there
with him? Good? - It was good, man.

251
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,594
I've heard a lot
of bad things about you, bro.

252
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,354
I've heard a lot
of bad things about Chris,

253
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,754
so I wasn't looking forward to it.

254
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:23,834
It was raining. It was raining,

255
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,274
then we started getting a bit
of sunlight, but too much,

256
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:29,114
so there was glare in the
windshield and I was thinking,

257
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,274
"This is probably all
because of Chris, somehow."

258
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,594
Like, he's just got...
There's just something about him.

259
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,274
He brings misery to the role.

260
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:39,114
Yeah, he brings misery,
but then I started to get upset

261
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:43,154
and then, after that, I started
to realise that he has got a soft...

262
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,994
quite a soft, sentimental side.

263
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:47,434
Because as I started
to get quite worked up,

264
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:50,754
he was immediately there,
to be like, "Don't worry, T..."

265
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:54,274
- Who has a soft, sentimental side?
- Chris. This guy over here, yeah.

266
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,514
I'm very giving.
Just watch the film.

267
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,474
Whatever! OK, let's take a look.

268
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,954
- Right, first gear, please. - Right.
- First gear, please, Tinie. - Cool.

269
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:04,994
- Handbrake off, please.
- Nice and positive.

270
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:07,514
- See, you like that? - I love it.
- Now just get on with it, come on.

271
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,874
- It's really slippery. - Yeah.

272
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:16,674
And we both want to go home
with all of our limbs, don't we?

273
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:17,754
Yeah, nice and safe.

274
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:21,954
- Feel that understeer, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

275
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,874
- Now feel that oversteer
on the exit. - Yeah.

276
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:26,754
- Whoa! - Got it, got it, got it.

277
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,034
Now you're alive. Got to
go left here at the blue line.

278
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:30,994
To the left of the tyres.
Brake, brake, brake.

279
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:33,554
- Remember, look for the red line
now on your right-hand side. - Yes.

280
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,314
- It's there. It's there,
it's there. - Oh, spinning out.

281
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:39,474
- Understeer, understeer, understeer.
- There we go. Am I within the line?

282
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:41,954
- Is that cool? - That's good,
that's brilliant. Up here.

283
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,674
- Let's go.
- Admittedly, begrudgingly...

284
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,034
Come on! Come on!

285
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,434
It's time for some tunes, man.

286
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,794
Brake, brake, brake, brake,
or we're off. Brake or we're off.

287
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:05,394
You know, Toyota make an offroader,
as well. It's called a Land Cruiser.

288
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:07,474
- Is it? - It's not
this one, though. - Oh, OK.

289
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,434
I'll bear
that in mind for next time.

290
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:13,314
- Good Lord! - I've got it.

291
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:16,234
- And over the line.
- Over the line! - Yes!

292
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:19,594
- You nearly braked before the line!
- The pressure's too much, man.

293
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:21,794
I don't know
if I can deal with this.

294
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,954
I'm going to get
high blood pressure. Come on.

295
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,714
How did you do it?
Teach me the dance move.

296
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:32,834
Look at this one. Do this one.
Just a slow one. Just a slow one.

297
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,274
This is about my Lamborghini.

298
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,554
Yeah, just have
to dance like a grandad now.

299
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:40,394
- That's all you have to do. - Your
Lamborghini looks like a shark?

300
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,474
Yeah,
my Lamborghini looks like Jaws.

301
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:55,834
What was that dance
you were doing in the car?

302
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:58,474
I don't really understand.

303
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,434
I was taking some lessons
from Tinie about how I should dance

304
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:03,354
and he said, very reassuringly,

305
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:06,074
"Dance as you want to. Be a
grandpa." So I thought, OK, I would.

306
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,194
I mean, obviously,
when my children see that,

307
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:11,474
that's just going to be appalling,
but I tried my hardest.

308
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:14,674
Look, he dealt very well with the
conditions, because it was so wet

309
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:17,474
it was flooded. The tyre
wouldn't deal with the water,

310
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,714
so we were aquaplaning,

311
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:21,954
and then, the sun came out, so
he couldn't see where the line was.

312
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,114
- It was just like a glass surface,
wasn't it? - It wasn't easy, bro.

313
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,514
- It was tough. - Yeah, that was wet.

314
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,394
We'll see how you did
in your timed lap.

315
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:30,194
- We'll check
that out later on. - Cool.

316
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:34,154
Now, usually these two get to
hoon about in Ferraris and Lambos

317
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:36,074
and such,
but a couple of months ago,

318
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,314
the producers told me
there was a new rear engine,

319
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,834
rear-wheel drive sports car
that I should take a look at.

320
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:46,874
Maybe a rival for the Porsche 911.
So, I went to check it out.

321
00:19:56,114 --> 00:20:01,234
And this is that rear-engined,
rear-wheel drive sports car. Yeah.

322
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:04,754
I've been stitched
up here, haven't I?

323
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,674
It's called the Renault Twingo GT.

324
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,794
And, yeah, like the Porsche 911,

325
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,914
it does have
the engine in the back.

326
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,834
And, like the Porsche 911,

327
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,034
that engine
does drive the rear wheel.

328
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:24,154
But I'm calling foul on the
whole sports car thing, I'm sorry.

329
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:26,354
What sport?

330
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:28,794
What is sporty about this?

331
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,314
Well, right now, not a lot.

332
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:36,194
Even on a dry day, 0-60 takes
over 9.5 seconds and it's got

333
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,474
a top speed of just 113mph.

334
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:41,994
Those are not numbers
to worry Porsche.

335
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:43,794
They're not numbers to worry anyone.

336
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:48,874
But according to Renault,
this really is a sports car.

337
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:53,954
Compared to the standard Twingo,
the one driven by your nan,

338
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,914
the GT has bigger alloys,

339
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:58,994
firmer suspension
and twin tailpipes.

340
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:03,154
And, on the left-hand side only,
a small intake, which feeds

341
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:06,634
cool air into the three-cylinder,
turbo-charged engine,

342
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,554
which makes 20% more power.

343
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:21,034
All right, that still
only gives it 108 horsepower.

344
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,034
But that doesn't actually matter,

345
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,594
because this Twingo is
a different kind of sports car.

346
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:32,034
It doesn't need power. It weighs
less than a ton. It's light.

347
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:37,394
And the GT costs
under £14,000, so it's cheap.

348
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:41,754
This is a baby hot hatch.

349
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:48,034
And that is a very good thing.

350
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,154
Because unlike a big hot hatch...

351
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,994
..you're not paying
for anything you can't use.

352
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:57,274
Ha-ha!

353
00:21:58,874 --> 00:22:01,834
Your Ford Focus RSes
and your Golf Rs and the like,

354
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,314
great cars,
but they're so damn fast.

355
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:05,754
In Britain at least,

356
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:10,154
you can only use a fraction of their
firepower a fraction of the time.

357
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,314
Not in the Twingo, though.

358
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:15,594
You can keep your foot
buried for 20, 30 seconds,

359
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:19,154
safe in the knowledge
that it's not going to kill you.

360
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:22,194
It's one of those cars
that encourages you to drive

361
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,794
like an absolute hooligan

362
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:27,314
and, yet, you always stay
on the right side of the law.

363
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,354
It's just a really
rewarding car to drive.

364
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:36,474
OK, it's not a Porsche,
but it is good.

365
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:41,234
So, yes, if your name's
Chris Harris and you commute to work

366
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,434
sideways over empty,
sweeping moorland B-roads,

367
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:48,834
the Twingo IS going
to leave you a bit cold.

368
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,354
But because you're not Chris Harris,
and, thank God, neither am I,

369
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:57,314
we don't commute to work over
empty, sweeping moorland B-roads.

370
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,274
We spend most of our time...

371
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:01,594
..in the city.

372
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:05,874
And that is what
the Twingo is all about.

373
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:09,834
Because there's no oily,
petrolly, motory stuff jammed in

374
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:13,154
by the front wheels, I can
get an insane amount of lock on.

375
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:18,354
That means it's a cinch to park.
It also means I'm agile, I'm nippy.

376
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:21,234
I'm like a big,
orange hummingbird on wheels.

377
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:27,514
What I'm saying is,
you don't need loads of horsepower

378
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:29,194
to have a good time.

379
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:32,074
Remember the Peugeot 205 GTi
from the '80s?

380
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:34,514
One of the best
hot hatches of all time.

381
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:39,794
And yet, the Twingo GT
has almost exactly the same power

382
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,074
and performance.

383
00:23:42,194 --> 00:23:44,354
This car is retro.

384
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:47,514
And I do love a bit of retro.

385
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:53,354
The thing is, if you're
after a playful little city car

386
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:57,274
with that old school appeal,
the Twingo does have its rivals.

387
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,794
And helping find
the right car for you

388
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:03,674
is something we take very seriously.

389
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:04,834
Oh, yes.

390
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:09,154
Welcome to what, for legal reasons,
I'm obliged to refer to as

391
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:13,754
the Top Gear arcade-based
maze re-creation challenge.

392
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:22,274
Yes, like all classic arcade games,
here, the rules are simple.

393
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:25,754
There's a big maze covered in dots
and me and the Twingo

394
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:29,034
have three lives to drive
around eating said dots

395
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,594
without getting got by the ghosts.

396
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:35,954
And by ghosts, I do mean
similarly-priced city car rivals.

397
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:41,194
Ghost number one
is the Brabus ForTwo.

398
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:44,194
It has the same engine
and performance as the Twingo

399
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:47,354
but only has
two doors, two seats and,

400
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:51,554
for tonight at least,
is being driven by a speedy German.

401
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:54,114
I see you, man pack.

402
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:57,194
No, it's not man pack,
it's... Never mind.

403
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:00,394
Ghost number two
is the new Volkswagen Up!

404
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:04,114
Yes, it might be five years old,
but the king of modern city cars

405
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:07,754
now comes with a turbocharger,
to give it more zip -

406
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:10,554
especially in the hands
of Mr Happy here.

407
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:13,794
Rory, do you know what
corrugated steel tastes like?

408
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:16,994
I'm sorry, did they have arcade
games when you were growing up?

409
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,594
Or were you part of
the stick and hoop generation?

410
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:22,514
Less talky, more smashy.

411
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:25,914
'Right, three lives
to eat up all the dots

412
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:29,354
'and one handy sat nav map,
to help me find them.'

413
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:31,754
Get ready
for an arcade masterclass.

414
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:36,554
See you later, suckers!

415
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,954
He's going left! Follow, Harris!

416
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,714
Catch me if you can, losers!

417
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,674
Give me them dots,
give me them tasty dots.

418
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:45,794
Yummy, yummy, yummy, come on.

419
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,834
This is good fun!

420
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:53,274
One thing I've got on my side
is that this is the most

421
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:55,554
manoeuvrable car of the bunch.

422
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:59,834
A little car.
Such a tiny little thing.

423
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,434
And for this job, just perfect.

424
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:07,154
Now, officially,
the Up! is the cheapest car here,

425
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:08,834
but it has the highest top speed.

426
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,754
'Which is of no use
in an arcade maze.'

427
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:12,954
Handbrake!

428
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,074
Yes! Whoo!

429
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,794
- That was - BLEEP - great.

430
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,154
Oh, yes.

431
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:26,714
This is the best
city car, bar none.

432
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:30,314
Oh, no, no, no! Come on!

433
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:32,594
Come on!

434
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,434
I'm dead. Already!

435
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:40,514
OK, two lives left, and with nearly
a third of the maze cleared,

436
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:42,794
lots of dots still to eat.

437
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:45,274
Rory,
be a bit less rubbish this time.

438
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:54,274
We're off. Here we go, here we go.

439
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:56,554
Don't let them beat you, man.
Don't let them beat you!

440
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:58,594
I'm right behind you.
Right behind you!

441
00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:00,474
Oh, Harris is quick!

442
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:02,594
- He's quick! - Go, Harris!

443
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:05,194
'Immediately, the ghosts
were closing in again.'

444
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:06,834
Go, go, go!

445
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,794
'But no retro arcade game would
be complete without the odd...'

446
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,434
Here we go! '..power up.'

447
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,634
- Ha-ha! - Whoo!

448
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,874
- You hit me! - What are you doing?
What's the red light thing?

449
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:21,074
The red light means stop, Grandad.

450
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,714
'And that gave me
ten whole seconds...

451
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,514
'Of ghost-free dot-munching.'

452
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:31,514
I am on a dot spree now, baby.

453
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:33,354
I think you'll find
they're called biscuits.

454
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:36,234
Literally,
nobody calls them biscuits.

455
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,794
Well, except old people.

456
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,834
- Oh, we can go again.
- Let's go! - Now we're blocked in.

457
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:45,394
Whoa!

458
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:50,314
Oh, the turning circle!
The turning circle!

459
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:53,474
I haven't quite got the turning
circle of a Twingo, have I?

460
00:27:56,154 --> 00:28:00,794
Oh, delicious dots.
Delicious dots! Mine!

461
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:04,914
'And with Harris still halfway
through his million-point turn...'

462
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:06,914
I'm not going to catch
anyone at this rate, am I?

463
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:09,794
'..I tried a new tactic. Stealth.'

464
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:11,274
Stay under the radar.

465
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:16,034
- Off the grid.
- Ah, we're away. Right, come on.

466
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,754
Where is he?

467
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:20,234
Think stealth. Think ninja.

468
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,234
Rory! Where are you?

469
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,154
He's hiding. We'll find him.

470
00:28:24,154 --> 00:28:25,634
I'm right behind him.

471
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,754
I'm right behind him.
He doesn't even know.

472
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:32,194
'Yep, my awesome ninja
stealth skills let me sneak in

473
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,514
'a few more dots before...'

474
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:35,994
I got him, I got him!

475
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:40,554
Yeah, I can see him.

476
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,594
Run away! Run away!

477
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:45,074
'The city car ghosts
were back in the hunt.'

478
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:48,354
I'm going to catch you, Reid.

479
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:50,674
Which way? Which way?
Which way? Which way? Which way?

480
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:52,994
- Got him! - No, no, no!

481
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:54,514
Oh!

482
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:55,554
Mate!

483
00:28:57,434 --> 00:29:00,034
Dude, it's a brand-new Twingo!

484
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:02,154
'You're better than this, Reid.

485
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:04,474
'Right, still a load of dots left.

486
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:07,434
'Last life, no continues.'

487
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:10,234
Rory, just give up.
You're not going to win.

488
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:13,434
Come on, Twingo, help me
out here. Please, please, please.

489
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,434
You can do this, you can do this!

490
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:25,194
'Game time.
Hunting out the last of the dots.'

491
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:29,074
You're not supposed
to wreck all the lights, Reid.

492
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:32,914
'The Twingo and I were using
every trick in the arcade manual...'

493
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:34,874
Dots, dots, I need dots. Come on.

494
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,434
'..which isn't even a thing..

495
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:38,594
Oops.

496
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:40,994
All right, we've got to stop him
getting these last biscuits.

497
00:29:40,994 --> 00:29:42,274
I have an idea.

498
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:46,714
Come on, Twingo!
Come on! Yes, yes!

499
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:48,154
The last dots! Come on!

500
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:52,514
'We were nearly there, but with the
last dots almost within reach...'

501
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:56,074
That's them.
The last dots. Let's go.

502
00:29:57,314 --> 00:29:58,554
Argh!

503
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:00,274
'..Sabine had set up a dot block.'

504
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:01,794
Sneaky German ghost!

505
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:07,954
Oh, no, you don't,
Mr French shopping trolley.

506
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:10,274
Ha-ha! Ken Block who?

507
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,634
Good skills.

508
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:16,594
Ah, yes!

509
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:18,234
- Oh, no! - Here we go, here we go!

510
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,834
Yes! Nearly there, Twingo!

511
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,634
That's them - the last dots!

512
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,234
Yes! Yes!

513
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:25,594
Go!

514
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,434
Yes! Yes!

515
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:30,914
We did it! We did it!

516
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,434
Oh, look,
he's doing a victory doughnut.

517
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:37,994
In your face!

518
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:39,594
It's not really a doughnut, is it?

519
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:42,314
More of a kind of crap teacake.

520
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:47,754
In your face!

521
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,474
- Victory for the Twingo!
- Victory for the Twingo.

522
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:02,314
That was... That was great.

523
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:03,674
That was great.

524
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:06,714
You know, not a day goes
by where I don't find myself

525
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:09,234
trapped in a maze of shipping
containers and wonder,

526
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,714
"What would be the best car
to help me escape?"

527
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:13,794
- Yeah, exactly. - Now I know.
- Exactly, exactly.

528
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:15,914
You know what I like
about the Twingo, right?

529
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,514
It's the fact that all city cars
were, kind of, all becoming the

530
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:21,314
same, they were becoming clones,
but the Twingo is a different way

531
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,834
of answering the question.

532
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:25,794
It's not the front-wheel drive,
it's not, kind of, boxy.

533
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:28,274
All right, it's not perfect
but it's got character.

534
00:31:28,274 --> 00:31:30,674
And when you want to go somewhere,
you just pop it in the boot

535
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:33,554
of your real car and off you go.

536
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:36,714
OK, now it's time to find
out which of these teeny, tiny cars

537
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,514
is fastest around our track,

538
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:41,434
and that means handing
them over for testing.

539
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:45,194
Not by The Stig,
but by The Stig's teenage cousins.

540
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:51,394
So, there they all are,
standing around Snapchatting,

541
00:31:51,394 --> 00:31:53,634
photo bombing, looking for
Pokemon Go...

542
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:56,514
And off the line, the Twingo,
rear-engine traction,

543
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,474
has got a little bit
of a march there.

544
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:01,514
There's no room up the inside for
that particular adolescent lunatic.

545
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:04,874
Oh, my God. Imagine what's inside
that helmet - all the acne.

546
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:13,074
Right, turning in, there's not
enough room for you there.

547
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,594
Oh, dangerous - headphones on.

548
00:32:14,594 --> 00:32:16,674
What are they listening to?
Tinie Tempah, maybe.

549
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:19,234
Some cool tunes.
OK, this is worrying now because

550
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,554
there's not room for two of them
going in here.

551
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:24,394
The Up looking a bit sneaky
at the back there.

552
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:26,554
A tighter line... This is clever.

553
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:28,674
..and he's going
to get the march on the Smart

554
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,194
coming down the back straight.

555
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:33,394
They don't look very fast, do
they? No, not in a straight line.

556
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:35,514
What's he doing there?

557
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:38,874
I don't know, talking to his
pals on Face Chat thing...

558
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,994
OK, breaking hard
down into the Hammerhead.

559
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,314
What's going to happen here?

560
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:46,714
Well, the Up has got
a massive advantage because...

561
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,234
I think because it's front-engined,
it looked better.

562
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,394
But look at that sneaky
git on the inside there.

563
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:53,514
Three abreast.
I don't how this is going to end.

564
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:57,274
This looks like a massive insurance
claim in waiting, doesn't it?

565
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,714
So let's go through
the Follow-Through...

566
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,154
Oh, that's rude! That's rude!

567
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:04,354
He's cut him right
off at the nose there.

568
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:07,474
And that Smart just looks
unstable to me... It looks so short.

569
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:09,234
So short. OK...

570
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:12,554
Oh, that's a
buttock-clenching moment there.

571
00:33:12,554 --> 00:33:14,794
But the Smart's
got the run on the Twingo

572
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:16,914
heading down towards second-to-last.

573
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,234
Really unstable under breaks -

574
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:20,034
I don't know what
they're playing at here.

575
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,754
I think the
Twingo's got this wrapped up.

576
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:24,954
Second-to-last, Twingo runs wide.
Carry... That's just rude!

577
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:27,954
OK, that's rude! So effectively,
a moral victory to the Renault

578
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,874
because he had
to get out of the way,

579
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,314
otherwise he'd
have crashed into that Stig.

580
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:41,794
All right, now, because
that got a bit out of hand,

581
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:45,154
we also got The Stig himself
to lap all three cars.

582
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:47,754
Now, only the fastest one of the
three earns a place

583
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:53,914
on the leaderboard, and that
was the Smart in 1.49.1.

584
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:55,594
Which is...

585
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:57,394
a way down there. OK...

586
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:07,074
- I told you. - All right, now...

587
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:09,274
Hold on, hold on. I want to
talk about the internet

588
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:10,714
- for a second... - Yes.

589
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:13,914
..because I hear that you
and Chris Harris have the same

590
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:18,314
favourite website, which I've got
to say, I find hard to believe

591
00:34:18,314 --> 00:34:20,714
because I know Chris
and he's disgusting!

592
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:24,314
Oh, we definitely do, then.
No, I'm joking!

593
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:27,434
No, my favourite website
is actually Auto Trader, bro.

594
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,834
- I love it. Do you love Auto Trader?
- Yeah, I'm addicted.

595
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,914
I love it.
Ever since I've been a kid...

596
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:34,794
For me, I grew up in, like,
a council estate, south-east London,

597
00:34:34,794 --> 00:34:38,634
didn't have much, so being able to
go online and look at all these cars

598
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:40,834
at all these ridiculous prices...

599
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:44,954
I used to type in
"£200,000, £1 million,

600
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,474
"let's see what cars come up."

601
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,634
And you'd see all these rare
cars, and I just...

602
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:51,274
I was obsessed with it. So, yeah,
it's my favourite website.

603
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:54,354
- OK. And that's your favourite
website, too? - It is, yes.

604
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:58,234
To avoid any confusion,
that is my favourite website.

605
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,834
What's you second...?
No, never mind! Let's not do that.

606
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:05,234
Tinie, I heard you enjoy an
Aston Martin.

607
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:07,754
Yeah, bro. I... Oh, God!

608
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:11,474
So I... Luckily, when
they launched the One-77

609
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:13,594
they invited me down
to be factory.

610
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:17,114
So they said to me, "Do you want
to borrow one for a week?"

611
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:20,194
So I borrowed the
Aston Martin Virage

612
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:24,674
and I remember rolling around like
just the coolest kid in the world.

613
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:27,194
I was like 23 years old at the time

614
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,954
and I was dating this girl
at the time,

615
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:33,634
and so when she saw the car,
and she was in the car,

616
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,114
she got really, really giddy
and excited.

617
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,314
And she said, "We should celebrate.
We should..."

618
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:43,514
- Should what? - Yeah. - Should what?
- What? What? What?

619
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,554
Don't make this harder
than it already is, please.

620
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:49,354
- But, yeah...
- Is that what you said to her?

621
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,674
Choose your words more carefully.

622
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:00,034
That Aston Martin badge, I told you.

623
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:03,554
Yeah, I felt like James Bond for,
like, 20 seconds, which was great.

624
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:05,354
20 seconds?

625
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:09,194
The good thing is, they don't make
the Virage any more

626
00:36:09,194 --> 00:36:10,634
because I don't want to borrow one.

627
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:13,874
Yeah, don't ever buy... Like,
if you see used one floating around,

628
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,594
don't get that one.
What do you think?

629
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:19,154
I think it's time to take a look
at Tinie's lap around the track.

630
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:21,474
- Who wants to see that?
- Yeah!

631
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:24,114
Let's do it. Yeah? How do you think
it went? How did you think you did?

632
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:26,754
I think it was cool. I mean,
I don't really know how I did.

633
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:27,994
And it was a swamp out there.

634
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:31,034
Yeah, the conditions were horrible,
but I'm not going to be a moaner.

635
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:34,474
I'm not going to make excuses.
All right, let's take a look.

636
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:38,474
Off the line.

637
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:40,474
It's time to make the family proud.

638
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:45,434
It's a freezing day in England,
but I'm actually sweating.

639
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:48,394
It's nerves, I've got gas today.

640
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:54,194
OK, well, you're using most
of the circuit, that's good.

641
00:36:54,194 --> 00:36:58,594
Third gear...
Look, at the flooding there!

642
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:01,874
- Wetter than...
What was going on there? - Whoa!

643
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:06,074
That was properly lairy. A bit of
understeer here. Get on the gas.

644
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:09,234
- A bit of oversteer
on the exit. - Come on, son!

645
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:12,154
You're letting it just dance
around, aren't you?

646
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:15,874
- Braking hard now into Hammerhead.
- It's started to rain again.

647
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:17,714
You're really not...

648
00:37:17,714 --> 00:37:19,754
Really trying to rain
on my parade.

649
00:37:23,514 --> 00:37:27,234
Oi, oi! It's all about
the smoothness, T.

650
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:30,554
It's all about the smoothness.

651
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:33,354
Smoother than a baby's bottom.
Come on.

652
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:35,434
OK, coming down now
to the Follow-Through.

653
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:37,354
This is going to be tough.

654
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:40,394
I think I've just
farted out of nervousness.

655
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:43,754
I don't know what to say about that.

656
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:46,674
That is a massive moment!

657
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:50,114
Do you know what that face is?
That the new underwear face.

658
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:52,274
So we're going to roll
into Second-to-last.

659
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:54,954
It's slippery here.
You got that one right that time.

660
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,954
Breaking hard, keeping it tight.
Do you know what?

661
00:37:56,954 --> 00:37:59,034
I think that was the toughest
conditions so far

662
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:01,114
for any of our drivers
over the line.

663
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:11,634
- That face! - Are you happy with that?
What do you think?

664
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:15,714
It's weird because it feels a lot
faster than it looked on the screen.

665
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:18,354
- Yeah, always. - So while I was
driving, it felt way faster

666
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:21,154
and there it didn't really look
that fast, but, I don't know.

667
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:22,594
Who knows, bro? I don't know.

668
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:25,034
Yeah, the same thing happens
to me in performances.

669
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,074
It always looks a lot
better when I'm doing it

670
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,994
then what it actually looks like.

671
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:31,194
You watch it back and you're like...

672
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:34,154
All right, now, the top of our
leaderboard is still Max Whitlock,

673
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:36,874
the iconic gymnast.
You give that guy a foam horse

674
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,314
covered in suede and he just gives
you poetry. Is it not nice...?

675
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:43,514
Incredible. But, because it was
so wet, you have a wet time,

676
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:47,554
so you have to beat
James McAvoy's time of 1.47.1.

677
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:50,074
Don't say it like,
"You only have to beat..."

678
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,594
Don't say that.

679
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:56,554
OK, Tinie Tempah,
you went around the track...

680
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:59,034
in one minute...

681
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,834
- 50... - Oh!

682
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,994
- Point four. - Good effort.

683
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:04,434
That's a good effort.

684
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:06,194
Considerably wetter.

685
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:08,434
Considerably...
Considerably wetter.

686
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:11,514
..three seconds slower out
there for you. Yes, it was.

687
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:17,034
Yeah, that's solid.
That's solid for those conditions.

688
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:19,114
Ladies and gentlemen, Tinie Tempah!

689
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,074
What a hero.

690
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:34,874
OK, now, earlier on you
remember Chris was driving

691
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:37,714
the 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron.

692
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:40,394
Which, so long as you have more
money than Mark Zuckerberg,

693
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:43,714
- is pretty much as fast as you
can go in a car. - Yes, that's true.

694
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,834
But, of course, if you have more
money than Mark Zuckerberg,

695
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:49,274
you're not limited to just cars.

696
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:52,234
So, since we had
a day to kill with the Chiron,

697
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:54,194
we decided to have a little race.

698
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:02,074
It's the age-old question
we've all pondered -

699
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:05,434
you're a billionaire oil mogul
based in downtown Dubai,

700
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:08,034
you knock off work at lunch
on a Friday,

701
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:11,754
or a Thursday as they do here,
so what's the fastest way

702
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:15,274
to reach your luxury weekend
retreat in the Omani mountains?

703
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,674
Car or not car?

704
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:28,194
- Hello. - Well, I'm what they call
suitably equipped, Matthew. - Yeah.

705
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:31,554
I can't help noticing
you have no transport.

706
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,834
Are you planning
on walking to Oman?

707
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,874
No, no, no. Don't worry.
Off you go.

708
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:38,234
I'll be the guy at the hotel bar
with all the empty drinks

709
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,994
- in front of him.
- No, you're going to lose.

710
00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:43,794
It's not possible to get anywhere
faster than in this car.

711
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,514
Yeah, and what a car!

712
00:40:49,274 --> 00:40:51,114
Does come in men's?

713
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,274
You're better than that,
you know you are.

714
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:56,114
- And, also, what's in that rucksack?
Why's it so big? - This?

715
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:58,674
My lunch.

716
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:00,954
Three, two, one, go.

717
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:03,434
- Oh, hang... - You're going to lose.
- Wait, wait, wait!

718
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:05,754
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

719
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,674
- You're going to lose.
- I'm already in front of you!

720
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:18,154
Now, the winner of this
billionaire's commute-off

721
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:21,154
would be the first to get
from the heart of Dubai

722
00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:23,154
to a luxury five-star retreat,

723
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:26,234
perched high in the mountains
of neighbouring Oman.

724
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,714
And with Chris driving the Chiron,

725
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:31,154
I would have
to travel by other means.

726
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,834
No driving.

727
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,314
I won't be driving.

728
00:41:34,314 --> 00:41:36,834
Not one bit of driving.

729
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,354
I have a plan.

730
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:43,354
I think I can safely say
I'm the only Chiron driving around

731
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:47,474
on the public highway
in the world at the moment.

732
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:49,794
One of us is currently winning...

733
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:51,354
and it's not Joey!

734
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:55,274
Anyone can take a car.

735
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:58,074
A billionaire doesn't take a car.

736
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:05,794
So you are actually
walking to Oman.

737
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:09,514
- Very luxurious. - You're wasting
time you don't have, keep going.

738
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:16,634
An angry small man in Dubai,

739
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,274
rocks up in his Chiron,
says, "Hi," What a...

740
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:25,154
Unfortunately, I quickly encountered
a problem unfamiliar to most

741
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:27,314
billionaires, rush hour.

742
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,594
There's about 19 lanes and yet
everyone's stuck stationary.

743
00:42:30,594 --> 00:42:32,914
Oh, come on!

744
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:36,754
Don't drive into me.
This is worth 2 million quid.

745
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,314
'Silly Harris, you see,
traffic was not something

746
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:40,634
'I needed to worry about.'

747
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:43,514
That's right, it's a boat.

748
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:48,554
'And this was just stage one
of my four stage master plan.'

749
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:50,834
This is the
frustrating part of the race

750
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,074
because we have to adhere
to this five-knot speed limit.

751
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:57,634
Once we get out on the
open water, we can pin it.

752
00:42:57,634 --> 00:43:02,274
The Riva Rivarma is 44 feet long,
costs £1 million -

753
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:06,314
half the price of Harris's car,
which is only a third the length

754
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:10,954
of this boat, and he doesn't
even have an onboard ice-maker.

755
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:11,994
Or a toilet.

756
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:14,994
He's in trouble.

757
00:43:14,994 --> 00:43:17,154
Well, not quite...

758
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:19,794
Because when you're
a billionaire for the day,

759
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:22,114
you can call in the odd favour.

760
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,954
Yes, yes, yes!
Now, this is what I call a plan.

761
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:31,394
I'm being escorted out of Dubai
at speed

762
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:34,554
behind a Dubai police i8.

763
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:37,114
There's a McLaren 570 ahead,

764
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,514
behind me, a Nissan-GTR -
and to my left

765
00:43:41,514 --> 00:43:46,514
is an Audi R8 V10 Plus.
It has 610 horsepower.

766
00:43:46,514 --> 00:43:51,354
That's 900 less than
the one I'm in. 900 less!

767
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:53,994
This is cool!

768
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:58,434
'Whatever.
See, I was now clear of the marina.

769
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:01,594
'Fast as you like.'

770
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:04,474
Oh, yeah, baby!
That's the stuff right there.

771
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:12,234
- Hello! - Have you located
some proper transport yet?

772
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,274
I can't really hear you too good.

773
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:16,714
It's a little windy
out here on the sea.

774
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:19,354
- What are you on, a boat? - Yeah.

775
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:23,474
Just having a
good old time racing you.

776
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:27,874
I've got through the Dubai traffic
by using a police escort

777
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,594
and I'm now heading
towards the border.

778
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:32,874
I can't possibly see how
you can win.

779
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:39,394
Yes, an hour in and with Admiral
LeBlanc bobbing around in his boat,

780
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:41,474
I was well on my way to Oman.

781
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:44,994
Frankly, this wasn't
much of a race after all.

782
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:50,594
Maybe I could just spend the next
hour conjugating the verb "to win."

783
00:44:50,594 --> 00:44:54,634
I win, you win,
he, she or it wins...

784
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,594
we win, you win, they win...

785
00:44:58,914 --> 00:45:01,474
Or you're Matt LeBlanc,
and you lose.

786
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:06,274
What has Matthew got planned?

787
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:09,874
Well, since he asked, it was time
for the second stage of my commute.

788
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,914
OK, here she is!

789
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:17,554
Now, that is the
Bentley Mulsanne EWB.

790
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:18,874
Extended wheelbase.

791
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:28,274
Now, of course, I'm not driving.

792
00:45:28,274 --> 00:45:31,954
'No, no. Like any good billionaire,
I have a chauffeur -

793
00:45:31,954 --> 00:45:34,714
'The Stig's Emirati cousin.'

794
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:36,714
OK, vamos!

795
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,594
Andiamo!

796
00:45:39,594 --> 00:45:40,714
Allez?

797
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:43,074
Go!

798
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:54,634
Meanwhile, basking
in my comfortable lead,

799
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:59,074
I had time to consider
some of the Chiron's utter madness.

800
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:01,594
Remember when you were a kid
and you'd get into cars

801
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:04,714
and always look how fast
the speedometer read to?

802
00:46:04,714 --> 00:46:07,994
And you'd assume that
if a speedometer said 140,

803
00:46:07,994 --> 00:46:09,554
the car could do 140?

804
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:12,754
Ha-ha!
In the Chiron, the game is over.

805
00:46:12,754 --> 00:46:16,474
This reads
to 500 kilometres per hour.

806
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:19,194
That's 300 miles an hour.

807
00:46:21,754 --> 00:46:25,514
How do you out-Chiron a Chiron?
What do you do?

808
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:29,794
Come on.

809
00:46:29,794 --> 00:46:33,154
Now, I had hit some traffic,
but to be honest,

810
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:35,594
in the Mulsanne,
it was hard to care.

811
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:39,154
Oh... Oh, yeah.

812
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:42,674
Yeah, it gives you a massage...

813
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:51,714
Oh... That is maybe the nicest
car seat that was ever made.

814
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:01,714
Let's give him a call,
see how old Chris is doing.

815
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:02,954
Hello?

816
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,994
Well, well, well, how are you?

817
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:06,754
Pretend you're not going
to hear this...

818
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:08,554
- Super, please. - Super? - Super.

819
00:47:10,434 --> 00:47:13,714
How many fuel stops have you made so
far? Is this your second or third?

820
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:15,994
It's my first, don't be stupid.

821
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:17,114
'Where are you?'

822
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,634
I, my friend,
am sitting in the back of

823
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:23,234
a beautiful Bentley Mulsanne EWB.

824
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:28,234
So, you've taken a boat
to get in the back of a Bentley

825
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,514
that you know is slower
than my car, and now you're

826
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,914
just going to drive
all the way to Oman?

827
00:47:32,914 --> 00:47:34,714
'I had you down as a clever man.'

828
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,434
I didn't say anything about driving
all the way to Oman.

829
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:39,754
OK.

830
00:47:39,754 --> 00:47:42,834
Oh, do you want some money?
Do you want money?

831
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:44,714
'Yeah, you have to pay
for that fuel.'

832
00:47:44,714 --> 00:47:45,794
Hey, listen...

833
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:49,474
Oh, he's gone.

834
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:52,714
A small, angry man in Dubai

835
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:54,914
Rocks up in his Chiron,
says, "Hi..."

836
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:59,954
With his mad little grin
Cos he thinks he'll win...

837
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,114
OK, my plan to avoid all of Dubai's
traffic with the speedboat

838
00:48:12,114 --> 00:48:15,954
had backfired,
and after two hours of racing,

839
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:18,114
I was still stuck downtown,

840
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:22,114
while Chris was approaching Oman,
100 miles ahead of me.

841
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:25,834
Ah. The border.

842
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:32,034
Which looks strangely similar
to the Mound Stand at Lord's.

843
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,594
What's going to happen here?
Don't we just go through?

844
00:48:36,354 --> 00:48:37,594
He's got a gun.

845
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:41,514
He's got a gun as well, actually,
I didn't notice him.

846
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:45,634
What's going on here?
Come on, let me through...

847
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,754
Yes! I'm liking the look of this!

848
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:54,834
You see...?

849
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:58,674
The Bugatti Chiron improves
international relations -

850
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:02,874
just smile and look as if you are
comfortable with what you're doing.

851
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:10,674
What's he doing?
He wants me to wait here?

852
00:49:10,674 --> 00:49:13,234
Or what? Wait here?

853
00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:14,914
Good, OK, OK.

854
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:22,514
So...

855
00:49:23,514 --> 00:49:26,514
They're all tweeting
and taking photos of the car.

856
00:49:26,514 --> 00:49:30,994
- Hashtag - can I please get on
with it? - How are you, sir?

857
00:49:30,994 --> 00:49:34,474
- Hello, how are you? - Welcome back.
- Thank you. Hello.

858
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:37,634
- Sir, I've got to change
this number. - What?

859
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:44,074
So they're re-registering the car
cos we've entered Oman.

860
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:47,194
This is a disaster,
I've been here 30 minutes now.

861
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:49,994
Matt LeSmuggins is going to be...

862
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,514
I don't know where he is.

863
00:49:53,514 --> 00:49:56,794
Well, I had finally reached
stage three of my plan...

864
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,154
Thanks, Stig!

865
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:02,434
'..and really had
some catching up to do.'

866
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:03,874
How are you?

867
00:50:03,874 --> 00:50:06,954
Nice to see you. Hello.

868
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:11,914
OK. Did not plan on
that much traffic.

869
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:14,954
Worse still, Chris had crossed
the border into Oman.

870
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:19,994
'Luckily, stage three...
was a good one.'

871
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:22,474
Ho-ho! There it is.

872
00:50:22,474 --> 00:50:27,354
The Honda Jet,
as in a jet made by Honda.

873
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:29,674
Howdy, boys. Let's go!

874
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:34,554
This thing's quick!

875
00:50:36,394 --> 00:50:38,154
Oh, that's a steep climb.

876
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:39,874
Yeah, baby.

877
00:50:41,114 --> 00:50:42,994
That's what I'm talking about.

878
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,034
Hey, how fast are we going?

879
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:50,434
About 480mph. Maxed out, boom!

880
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:54,234
It's like we're rolling up here.

881
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:58,514
You know, somewhere down there
there's a very small man

882
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:01,794
in a very fast car,
and though that very small man

883
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:03,674
is still talking a very big game...

884
00:51:04,674 --> 00:51:07,594
..deep down, deep, deep down,

885
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:11,274
that very small man knows very well
that he is going to lose.

886
00:51:12,594 --> 00:51:15,114
It's very sad.

887
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:21,434
That border check situation...
That lost me a lot of time.

888
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:26,994
Come on, Mr Bugatti... We might just
have to deploy a bit of your speed.

889
00:51:26,994 --> 00:51:30,954
Meanwhile...at 15,000 feet...

890
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:37,114
The Honda Jet, £3.6 million,
20 years in the making.

891
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:40,594
Its ground-breaking
overwing engine design

892
00:51:40,594 --> 00:51:43,274
maximises performance
and efficiency.

893
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:45,434
It comes with snacks too.

894
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:50,394
But what it all really adds up to
is a great way to overtake a Chiron.

895
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:54,274
You're what...? You're in a Honda?

896
00:51:55,674 --> 00:51:57,594
No, it's not a Civic.

897
00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:00,674
No, it's not an Accord.

898
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:03,434
It's not the NSX either.

899
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:04,674
It's the Honda Jet.

900
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,994
Git! Utter git!

901
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:13,674
I can't even boast that I've got

902
00:52:13,674 --> 00:52:16,314
the fastest, most expensive
toy now, can I?

903
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,474
'The Honda had definitely
put me back in the game.'

904
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:23,634
Making time, making time...

905
00:52:23,634 --> 00:52:27,634
'But my one-hour flight would
touch me down in Muscat,

906
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:29,874
'which was still a good 100 miles

907
00:52:29,874 --> 00:52:32,394
'from the mountaintop finish line.

908
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:36,234
'So, Chris was technically
still in the lead...'

909
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:38,234
Speed's dropping again.

910
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:39,554
'..for now.'

911
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:43,394
We're coming into another town...

912
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,674
It's becoming a pain, this.

913
00:52:48,194 --> 00:52:50,834
You know when your brain tells you
you just have to keep moving

914
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,674
when the traffic stops, so you
dive off and take another route

915
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:56,114
and think that keeping moving
is the thing...?

916
00:52:56,114 --> 00:52:57,874
But it turns out to be rubbish?

917
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,514
Yeah, that's where I am now.

918
00:53:01,994 --> 00:53:03,194
Matt's going to be quivering

919
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:05,394
when he finds out how fast
I'm driving through here.

920
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:11,714
This is ridiculous.

921
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:14,314
No, no, no, no, no...

922
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:16,594
This thing is two metres wide!

923
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:19,874
I hate this!

924
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,754
A-a-a-a-nd...touchdown.

925
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:26,434
Thanks a lot, take care.

926
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:29,914
'Stage four, it was time to open up
the backpack.'

927
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:31,914
Excuse me one second,
I'll be right back.

928
00:53:31,914 --> 00:53:34,034
I've got to take care of something.

929
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:40,434
So, the rules said no driving...

930
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:44,714
Nobody said anything about riding.

931
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:51,914
This is the new
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

932
00:53:53,674 --> 00:53:58,394
Hey, Chris, I don't know where
you are or what you're doing,

933
00:53:58,394 --> 00:54:01,034
but I'm pretty confident
I'm going to win.

934
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:02,914
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and, no,

935
00:54:02,914 --> 00:54:04,234
your average billionaire

936
00:54:04,234 --> 00:54:06,754
probably wouldn't finish
their commute on a bike,

937
00:54:06,754 --> 00:54:11,114
but that's probably because
they haven't tried THIS bike.

938
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:19,154
The Superleggera will do 0-60
in about two and a half seconds,

939
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:21,834
which is the same as the Chiron.

940
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:25,514
The only difference is I don't need
1,500 horsepower to do it,

941
00:54:25,514 --> 00:54:26,994
just a bit of bravery.

942
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:32,354
The top speed is
190-something miles an hour.

943
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:34,994
Now, some people will look at that
and say,

944
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:36,954
"Well, that's just stupid,

945
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:39,834
"that's more speed than anyone
would ever need."

946
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:42,074
To which I say, "Exactly."

947
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:51,114
The small, angry man in Dubai
Rocked up in his Chiron, said, "Hi"

948
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:55,394
With a mad little grin
He thought he could win

949
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:57,754
But at the bar in the mountains
he'll cry.

950
00:54:57,754 --> 00:55:00,074
That's it, that's the rhyme.

951
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:04,314
But as I made short work of
my 100-mile ride from Muscat,

952
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:07,074
Chris had found his way
back onto the open road.

953
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:08,594
Are you off the plane?

954
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:11,434
- Yeah, I'm on a bike.
- What do you mean, you're on a bike?

955
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:12,594
What bike?

956
00:55:12,594 --> 00:55:15,434
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

957
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:18,994
- You what?!
- Yeah, you better stand on it, buddy.

958
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:24,394
That bike is basically
a personal teleportation device.

959
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:26,914
Thankfully, so is the Chiron.

960
00:55:28,914 --> 00:55:30,234
Let's get a move on.

961
00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:35,474
Now we're talking.
A little bit of open road here.

962
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:40,554
Come on, push, push!

963
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:44,634
Come on! Come on! Come on!

964
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:48,794
Foot down.

965
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:50,354
- This thing's - BLEEP - fast!

966
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:52,714
Approaching the mountains
from opposite sides,

967
00:55:52,714 --> 00:55:54,954
we were entering the final stage
of the race.

968
00:55:54,954 --> 00:55:56,914
With no way of telling
who was in front,

969
00:55:56,914 --> 00:55:59,594
there was just one road up
to the finish line...

970
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:02,034
Oh, look at that.

971
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:04,794
..and it was a good one.

972
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,314
This is about to get fun.

973
00:56:10,554 --> 00:56:11,794
Wow!

974
00:56:13,594 --> 00:56:15,634
Now this is a proper road!

975
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:19,154
Look at it, fantastic!

976
00:56:21,954 --> 00:56:23,434
Now we're talking.

977
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:26,834
This is nice!

978
00:56:28,474 --> 00:56:35,514
God, it goes left to right so good.
It just holds the line perfect.

979
00:56:38,074 --> 00:56:40,434
And I know this is a car show...

980
00:56:40,434 --> 00:56:43,074
so you probably want the Chiron
to win, but if it doesn't...

981
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:44,874
I mean, when...
When it doesn't...

982
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:48,154
..don't blame the car...
blame Harris.

983
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:52,594
I don't know if I'm hunting him down
and catching him

984
00:56:52,594 --> 00:56:54,274
or maybe he's catching me.

985
00:56:57,034 --> 00:57:00,994
I don't see that big gold Bugatti
in my mirror.

986
00:57:00,994 --> 00:57:04,194
Got to be in front. He's got to be.

987
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:08,394
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Please let me be ahead of him!

988
00:57:08,394 --> 00:57:11,674
Please let me be ahead of him!

989
00:57:11,674 --> 00:57:12,914
Come on, push, push!

990
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:14,914
Push, LeBlanc!

991
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:20,794
Come on, Mr Chiron!
We have to win this!

992
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:24,554
This is it, this is it.

993
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:32,194
OK, thanks, buddy.

994
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:37,114
Where is he?

995
00:57:37,114 --> 00:57:38,834
That's it, that's the spot.

996
00:57:41,194 --> 00:57:44,634
He's small, but he's not that small,
I don't see him.

997
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:47,874
I think we have a winner!

998
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:53,874
Oh, yes, that's what I'm
talking about, look at that view!

999
00:57:55,914 --> 00:57:58,114
Harris is going to be so mad.

1000
00:57:58,114 --> 00:58:00,714
I can't wait to see the look
on his little...

1001
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:03,874
..bald face.

1002
00:58:07,674 --> 00:58:11,634
There you go...
Have a Chiron. And no-one there.

1003
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:15,074
I think we've got this, boys.
I think we've got...

1004
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,594
Oh, come on, no.

1005
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:19,754
Welcome to Oman!

1006
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:21,954
- No! - How are you, my friend?

1007
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:24,594
Why so slow...bro?

1008
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:26,954
I haven't even thought of my line!

1009
00:58:26,954 --> 00:58:28,834
Oh...

1010
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:30,474
What was your line?

1011
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,794
It's like you're always stuck
in second gear,

1012
00:58:32,794 --> 00:58:35,274
which looking at it now
wasn't very funny, was it?

1013
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:39,834
- I was stuck in top gear, my friend.
- Yes, well done. Well done.

1014
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:43,674
Oh! - Oh, yeah.

1015
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:45,794
I can't believe I lost.

1016
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:47,354
You didn't lose.

1017
00:58:47,354 --> 00:58:50,234
If you say I just came second,
I'll throw you off that balcony.

1018
00:58:50,234 --> 00:58:51,554
- No, no, no. - OK.

1019
00:58:51,554 --> 00:58:55,354
No, you lost.

1020
00:58:55,354 --> 00:58:58,154
No! Just get me off of here!

1021
00:58:58,154 --> 00:58:59,274
Cheers.

1022
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:02,554
That's a good beer.

1023
00:59:02,554 --> 00:59:04,994
It never tastes as good as
a winning beer, though, does it?

1024
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:07,114
- You want to try that one? - Yeah.

1025
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:08,354
Thank you.

1026
00:59:09,794 --> 00:59:11,754
Oh, yeah, that's better.

1027
00:59:11,754 --> 00:59:14,714
Oh!

1028
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:22,034
You just missed the sunset,
it was beautiful.

1029
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:24,274
We could have held hands
and everything.

1030
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,514
So close. So, so close.

1031
00:59:40,514 --> 00:59:41,714
That was so close.

1032
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:44,114
You know, I think if it wasn't
for that border crossing,

1033
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,314
you would have had me.

1034
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:48,394
Well, the border crossing and
the fact that I had my own jet.

1035
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:53,954
- Look, I'm gutted, but I made the
Chiron look good value. - What?!

1036
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:56,554
Well, add up the cost of the boat,

1037
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:59,994
the limo and then the plane
and the bike... How much is that?

1038
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:01,914
- About £5 million. - OK.

1039
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:05,314
Double the price of the Chiron and
I only lost by a couple of minutes.

1040
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:08,274
- You still lost. - Mm. - Or, or...

1041
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:12,114
I maximised my time in the most
extraordinary car of the millennium.

1042
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:14,554
Ah! No, you lost.

1043
01:00:14,554 --> 01:00:16,634
On next week's show,

1044
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:19,874
a motorsport battle
as we find out who's quickest...

1045
01:00:19,874 --> 01:00:21,834
Chris Harris or Sabine Schmitz?

1046
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:25,754
And an American man drives
an American car in America.

1047
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:28,394
Yes, he does, the Ford GT.

1048
01:00:28,394 --> 01:00:30,274
Whoo!
That's right.

1049
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:32,394
- We will see you then. Good night.
- Night.
