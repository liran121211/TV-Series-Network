1
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,879
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,919
We're back!

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,759
- And we've got lots and lots of shiny new cars.
- That's right.

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,239
That's right.

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,080
In fact, here's a look at what's
coming up over the next seven weeks.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,679
♪ My mother told me "Son, let it be"... ♪

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,879
Oh, it's on!

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,319
♪ Sold my soul to the calling... ♪

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,599
Let's go racing!

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,919
♪ Sold my soul to a sweet melody... ♪

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,479
♪ Now I'm gone, now I'm gone now I'm gone

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,079
♪ Oh, gimme that fire... ♪

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,799
It's got a chicken!

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,159
I'm done. Have the car, I'm out.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,039
Oh, the acceleration is enormous!

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,080
Whoo!

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,359
The way this is written,

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,639
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,919
♪ Oh, gimme that fire... ♪

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,839
My knob's come off!

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,639
♪ Oh, gimme that fire... ♪

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,519
Oh, yes! What a thing!

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,359
♪ Oh, gimme that fire... ♪

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,640
THAT is immature.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,599
Ooh. OK.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,919
All righty.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,079
Wow, that's a lot for the eyes.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,239
Looks OK to me.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,719
OK... let's kick it off with this.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,919
The LaFerrari.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,679
Costs £1 million, and only
500 will ever be built.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,359
Interesting, isn't it,
that adding "La" to a name

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,479
makes it sound more exotic,

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,519
whereas "Le" - not so much, really.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,319
I get it. I see what you did there.
You got... You got me.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,119
We don't need to go into your last name.
All right.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,319
Anyhow, the LaFerrari.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,279
You hear that, you think,
"Ferrari's VIP area," right?

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,279
The fastest, the most
advanced, the most exclusive.

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,359
Well, nearly. Because,
in the world of Ferrari,

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
turns out there's a V-VIP area -

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,239
- somewhere off-limits to us mere commoners.
- Mm-hm.

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,960
Somewhere home to a truly
extraordinary machine.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,239
Here it is, the Ferrari FXXK.

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,360
And, no, that name is NOT accidental.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,159
- Oh, my
- days.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,239
It's based on the bones of
the LaFerrari hypercar,

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,120
but it's been intensified
in every department.

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,679
Only 40 will ever exist,

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,320
and it costs over £2 million.

51
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,039
Or at least it would, if you could buy it.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,639
Which you can't. Even if
you're a zillionaire,

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,639
you don't just phone up Ferrari
with your credit card details.

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,159
Oh, no.

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,319
First, you must have been
judged, in Ferrari's words,

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,559
to "have the right mind-set."

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You must be invited.

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,799
In fact, the FXXK is so unattainable,

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm the first outsider ever
permitted to drive one.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,479
So, just for today,

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,879
you can keep your LaFerraris,

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,639
your everyday hypercars.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,359
Run by Bring Me The Horizon

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,839
Today, I've got more power,

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,679
more lightness,

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,439
more grip.

67
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,080
So much MORE.

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh! Oh!

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
The speed is preposterous!

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,999
If you believe it,

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,440
it has 1,050 horsepower.

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,720
That's 87 more than the LaFerrari road car.

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,599
It's SO physical.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
It gets inside your body.

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
Sensational, addictive,
mighty, corrupting power!

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,599
0 to 60 takes just over two seconds,

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,319
but this car lives way beyond that.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,159
Just keeps going...

79
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,920
until your brain implodes...

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
..like a collapsing star!

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,839
Like the LaFerrari, the
FXXK has a KERS system

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,679
harvesting energy wasted underbraking.

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,119
If I brake hard now,

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,519
I can feel a kind of pressure behind
my eyeballs, forcing them forward.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,479
But here the system is F1 spec,

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,039
and when it uses that energy
to boost the performance

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,280
of the 6.3-litre V12 engine...

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,399
..it just bungs you down the road.

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,239
It's not like a normal car
experience of acceleration.

90
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,199
Here we go. I accelerate in third and...

91
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,559
..I'm 100 yards further than I thought.

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
Good Lord.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,599
And then there's the traction control.

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,359
Because Ferrari doesn't want to
kill its wealthiest customers,

95
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
they're some of the most
sophisticated systems

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,799
I've ever encountered.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,599
I can just bury the throttle
coming out of turns,

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,319
and it just manages it beautifully.

99
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,639
I suppose part of the
thrill of this car is...

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,039
building up the courage to switch them off.

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
Well, you only live once.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Oh, yes! I'm alive! I'm alive!

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,680
Now, this is a good way to ruin
some very expensive tyres.

104
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,799
Fortunately, changing them is easy,

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,679
because your £2 million FXXK

106
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,160
also comes with its very
own Ferrari pit crew...

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,679
..just like a modern Formula One car.

108
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,439
But, unlike a modern Formula One car,

109
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,959
it doesn't need to comply
with a great big rule book.

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,000
In fact, it doesn't need to comply
with the rule book... well, at all.

111
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,239
Ferrari basically said to its engineers,

112
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,759
"Knock yourselves out, do
whatever the hell you want.

113
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,319
"Just make it fast.

114
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
"CRAZY fast!"

115
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
And this being Ferrari...

116
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
..crazy fast on the straights
is just the start.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
The true nature of this car
lies in the way it corners.

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,799
The faster you go, the harder it sticks.
It's like a giant magnet.

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,920
You can't see it but, boy, can you feel it.

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,480
It's lawless, savage.

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,640
It's motorsport unlimited.

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,999
Unbound by rules,

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,839
the FXXK can delve deep
into the dark art of aero.

124
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,399
From that enormous active
wing to the insane diffuser,

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,720
its hunger for downforce crushes
the tyres into the tarmac.

126
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,519
The aero through this left-hander.

127
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Wow! Into the deck.

128
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Right now, it feels about the
fasted thing ever made, to me.

129
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,159
'The performance of the
FXXK is so extraordinary,

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,679
'it recalibrates your understanding of...

131
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
'what a car is capable of.

132
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,159
'It's wonderful, intoxicating.

133
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,119
'It's so cutting-edge, it's...'

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
I got quite a high water temperature
now, so I need to just cool it down.

135
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,560
'..well, it's high maintenance.

136
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,039
'And that means your pit crew
will spend a lot of time

137
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,799
'fiddling about with stuff
you don't understand.'

138
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,999
Needs a reset on the, er...

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,239
Er...

140
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,679
And this ultimate Ferrari
thoroughbred is so extreme,

141
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,039
you can't drive it on the road,

142
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,079
and it doesn't qualify for
any existing race series.

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,519
So, as a car, the FXXK
doesn't really make sense.

144
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,239
But it's not meant to.

145
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,960
It's not really a car.

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,199
What it is is a ticket...

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
to the most exclusive private
members club on the planet.

148
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,120
And this club has one final
members-only benefit.

149
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,199
You see, up to now, the car
has been holding back,

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,920
saving power to make sure its
batteries never run flat.

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,279
But the FXXK has something
called Qualify Mode,

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,599
and that gives you all the petrol power

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,800
and all the electric power
in one massive hit.

154
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,079
Maximum attack for one lap only.
And, well...

155
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,319
since I've only got one lap left, well...

156
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
you can't take it with you.

157
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,879
1,050 horsepower!

158
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
What a car! What a day!

159
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Drink it up. Drink it
up, it's the last lap.

160
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,199
Unbelievable. I'll never
get to do that again.

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm staggered I've had a chance
to do it in the first place.

162
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,200
When the world's electric...

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,600
..I think I'll remember this
day more than every other.

164
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,199
- Well, I didn't crash.
- No, you didn't. No, what an incredible car.

165
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,999
And I've got to be honest,
you drove the ass off it.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
One tiny point though, and
I don't mean to be picky,

167
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,999
- but you know this whole exclusive club thing?
- Mm-hm.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,479
OK, so what you're saying is,

169
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,919
if you're a very, very
special friend of Ferrari,

170
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,279
you might just be lucky enough
to receive an invitation

171
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,599
- to give them £2 million.
- Correct.

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,679
And in return, you get a car that, yeah,

173
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,759
is very fast and very pretty, but
it's essentially useless, right?

174
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,679
I mean, you can't drive it on the road,

175
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,559
you can't enter it in any race series,

176
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,119
you need a team of mechanics
to keep it running...

177
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,359
Also correct.

178
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,159
That's good business.

179
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,199
It is if you're Ferrari.

180
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,519
Now, this is the point we usually
hand the car over to Stig

181
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,199
to thrash around our test
track, but today, we can't.

182
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,759
It's just too cold out there.

183
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,559
The FXXK is on racing slicks and it
just won't get hot enough to work.

184
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,599
We're sorry.

185
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,879
But we'll try to coax it back again
for a lap later in the series

186
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,999
- when the weather warms up a bit.
- Yes, we will. Rory.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,519
What a car.

188
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,959
And the high horsepower
thrills don't end there,

189
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,119
because later this series, and I
can't believe I got to do this,

190
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,559
but I drive the new Renault Twingo.

191
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,039
- Oh, yes.
- Wahey!
- Oh, yes.
- Ho, ho! APPLAUSE

192
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,600
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

193
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,279
OK. Now it is time to introduce
this week's studio guest.

194
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,479
He's the star of Atonement,
X-Men and Split.

195
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,879
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome James McAvoy.

196
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,320
Welcome, welcome.

197
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,559
Now, James, I know you didn't get a
chauffeur to drop you down today.

198
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,119
- You drove yourself, right? - I did, yes.
- OK, what did you drive?

199
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,959
- I drove my RS3. - Nice, little pocket rocket.
- Little ninja, yeah.

200
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,719
- 300 plus horsepower there.
- Uh, if you say so.

201
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,359
Yeah, I just know it goes fast, man.
It goes fast.

202
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,919
So you have a driver's licence now,

203
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,519
but didn't you drive for years without one?

204
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,399
This is the weird thing. I
played a car thief in Shameless

205
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,199
and I had to drive many beautiful cars

206
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,759
and nobody ever asked me if
I had a driver's licence,

207
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,279
so I didn't, I didn't offer it up.

208
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,519
- I didn't get a driver's licence until six years later.
- Hang on.

209
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,639
You're painting quite a picture for us.

210
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,879
Any other bad behaviour you
want to come clean with?

211
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,759
I do actually have a clean driver's
licence, but I did have a...

212
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,639
I had a provisional driver's licence
just for riding a 125 scooter

213
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,199
before I grew up and got
a big bike, and, erm...

214
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,359
I got 11 points on my provisional licence.

215
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,919
Yeah.

216
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,719
The guy, the policeman that took me aside

217
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,239
was like, "I'm probably going
to let you off with it",

218
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,359
and his partner was like shouting
from the car going, "No way!

219
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,959
"He's going down! This is unbelievable!"

220
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,759
So, yeah, they put me
in the back of the car

221
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,319
and made me feel like a drug dealer.

222
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,399
All right, now, you didn't just come
down here to enjoy our company,

223
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,719
because, frankly, who would do that?
No, no.

224
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,519
- You came here to drive fast around our track.
- Yes.

225
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,519
And the first thing that everyone
here should know is that

226
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,479
the original Top Gear track is back!

227
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,199
And here's the other thing you
need to know, we've got a new car.

228
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,439
And after all those Lianas
and Lacettis and Cee'ds...

229
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,879
- I'm still a big fan of the Cee'd.
- That's cos you were quick in it.

230
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,039
We decided it was high time for
something a bit more exciting,

231
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,759
something rear-wheel drive, something fast.

232
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,239
That's right, but not too fast,

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,279
cos we're talking about celebrities here,

234
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,519
not responsible adults.

235
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,839
Which meant there was
only one car for the job,

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,639
and I mean literally only one car.

237
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,839
Introducing our new reasonably fast car,

238
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,959
it's the Toyota GT86.

239
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,039
Drive it well and it's so much fun,
but get it wrong and you will spin.

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,679
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, so do I. From experience I can guarantee it.

241
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,399
Right, so, obviously we're not
going to send you out there

242
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,759
without a little bit of instruction, so...

243
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,639
Do you remember at school that one teacher

244
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,519
who really inspired you,
nurtured you, believed in you?

245
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,239
Well, our instructor is
exactly the opposite of that.

246
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,799
He's mad, he's tiny, his head is
very shiny, it's Chris Harris.

247
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,759
Welcome to the Toyota GT86.

248
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,559
Your performance reflects on me.

249
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,440
- All right, mate.
- So you've got to listen.
- What?
- OK?

250
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,399
Aim for the 50 metre board.

251
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,759
Don't try and be funny. Fourth gear.

252
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,319
When I say "brake", brake. Brake!

253
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,439
- Listen! Listen, James.
- I am.

254
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,559
Over that way. Do what you're told.

255
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,239
My hand's over there. Look, third gear.
Third gear.

256
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,079
Third gear, that's second, you...

257
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,520
Third! Third!

258
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,599
Argh!

259
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,759
Aw!

260
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
- OK.
- Whoo!

261
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,439
You have to listen to the next bit,

262
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,599
otherwise we both end up being
looked for through dental records.

263
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,119
Fourth gear. Fourth gear.

264
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,039
Yes!

265
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,719
I wish they'd given me someone
talented for this first episode,

266
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,480
cos it would look so good
for my coaching skills.

267
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,799
Oh, my lord.

268
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,479
And over the line.

269
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
And stop.

270
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,279
And never...

271
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,319
..do that to me again.

272
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,799
- You loved it.
- Jesus Christ.
- You loved it.

273
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,999
Well, very nice, very nice.

274
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,239
I'm beginning to see why that
career as a hostage negotiator

275
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,639
never worked out for you.

276
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,399
OK, seriously, Harris, that is
no way to speak to our guest.

277
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,999
Absolutely not.

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,399
Do you know what? I kind of liked it.

279
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,919
I like to be treated rough sometimes.

280
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,079
That's just...

281
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,919
Well, anyway, we are looking
forward to seeing your timed lap

282
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,719
a little bit later. But
first, here's a question...

283
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,839
£150,000, something fun for
the summer, what do you buy?

284
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,479
- Er, GT3 RS.
- OK, Rory?

285
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,759
- McLaren 570?
- Mm-hm.

286
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,879
Yellow Ford Capri with black stripes on it.

287
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,839
- OK, all good.
- Thanks.
- All good. All wrong.

288
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,079
Because the most fun you can have
for £150,000 is one of these.

289
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,039
- That's a Hobbit caravan.
- No. No, that's a pressure washer.

290
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,359
So it's a pressure washer
for £150,000 Sterling.

291
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,759
What are you going to wash with that?

292
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,479
I'm going to wash a melon, a shed
and a Volvo. Check this out.

293
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,919
This is the Karcher Ecomaster mark three.

294
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,759
It runs at about 2,800 bar of pressure.

295
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,079
That's... about 40,611 PSI.

296
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,799
Roughly. Exactly.

297
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,879
This cleans stuff really well.

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Watch this.

299
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,879
There you have it!

300
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,439
Clean!

301
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Clean as a whistle!

302
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,160
Am I right? That's good.
That thing's great.

303
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,799
Your handwriting is appalling.

304
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,359
Don't pretend you're not jealous.

305
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,479
Right, I need to vent about something.

306
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,679
The other night I was watching Ronin, OK?

307
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,479
- Ronin, that film that came out, what? 20 years ago?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,119
- Always up-to-date.
- Stop that. Look,

309
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,039
one of the best on-screen car
chases of all time. Agreed?

310
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,679
- Yes.
- OK.

311
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,039
But I've spotted something
that's troubling me, vexing me.

312
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,080
Have a look at this.

313
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,959
Wait there! There!

314
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,599
- How annoying is that? Did you see that?
- What? - See what?

315
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,839
- You saw that. - What?!
- There.

316
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,919
BMW E34 M5 1990, turbine design wheel,

317
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,359
cool for brake distance,
that kind of thing.

318
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,399
Cut to... That's not an M5 wheel.

319
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,439
That's the...

320
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,399
That's from a 535i. It's
a continuity nightmare.

321
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,639
How long are you planning
on being a virgin?

322
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,999
I could help you out.

323
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,799
Look, you work in film, you
saw that, that's a nightmare.

324
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,639
- Yeah, right? - This has been bothering
me... Can I do one more? - Go ahead.

325
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,039
..bothering me since 1987. Withnail And I.
Great film?

326
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,199
- A wonderful film. - You must know it line by line.
- Yeah... Go on, then.

327
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,439
Continuity nightmare.

328
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Watch this.

329
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,239
Withnail, car.

330
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,599
There!

331
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,919
- Where? What?
- You saw it.

332
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,519
- Saw what?
- You saw it!

333
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,359
Withnail is set in 1969, OK?

334
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,839
It's the end of the '60s, it's apocalyptic.

335
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,599
Right in the background is a
Volvo 340 DL, launched in...

336
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,839
1976! Even worse, the red smudge behind it,

337
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,599
Nissan Sunny, 1981.

338
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,599
It's terrible.

339
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,519
Imagine, OK, Gladiator,
Russell Crowe struts in,

340
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,359
"I'm the father of someone... got murdered,

341
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,079
"I'm generally fed up with
life," toga, look down below.

342
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,119
Air Jordans.

343
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,319
You're not going to suffer that.
It's not good.

344
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,999
It is literally,

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,079
literally... nothing like that. OK?

346
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,039
In fairness, though, I
do hate film mistakes.

347
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,719
- You know Mad Max Fury Road?
- Yeah.

348
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,679
OK, if you look really close,
really, really closely,

349
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,359
don't blink, you'll miss it,

350
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,239
you'll see that they cast
Tom Hardy instead of me.

351
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,359
Look real close. You can see it.

352
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,279
Anyway, moving on, a couple
of months back the producers

353
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,079
told us to tackle a serious
consumer question.

354
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,759
Specifically this one...

355
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,439
What is the most reliable
new car on sale today?

356
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,439
And we said, "Well,
that's a stupid question.

357
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,279
"New cars can't be reliable. They're new.

358
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,719
"You have to earn reliability
over lots and lots of miles."

359
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,559
If a car's driven to, say, the moon
and back, and it's still going,

360
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,039
now that's proof of reliability.

361
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,999
That's right, so our producer
said, "All right, you're on."

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,639
They told us each to go buy a car

363
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,759
that HAD driven to the moon and back.

364
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,679
Well, the Earth equivalent.

365
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,559
480,000 miles on the clock. So we did.

366
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,519
And they shipped them off for a
series of reliability challenges

367
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,279
in the middle of nowhere.

368
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,800
A little place called Kazakhstan.

369
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,999
So...

370
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,879
Kazakhstan.

371
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Shall we go and find our cars?

372
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,559
- Three containers, gentlemen.
- Who wants to go first?

373
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,080
- Can I go first?
- Go for it.

374
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
You're going to love it.

375
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,559
What do you think he's got?

376
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,359
Some kind of mental issue.

377
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,999
- It's definitely a sports car, no?
- Yeah, it's got to be.

378
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,519
- A high mileage Ferrari, perhaps?
- Maserati.

379
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,399
- High mileage Maserati?
- Yeah.

380
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,839
Which is, you know, a horrible idea.

381
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,319
- 'But Chris surprised us both.' Oh!
- That's not Italian.

382
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,959
That's not Italian at all.

383
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,759
A Volvo?

384
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,999
The Volvo V70.

385
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,239
You want reliability, you go to
Sweden, gentlemen. You know that.

386
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,959
She's a minter.

387
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,199
I don't want to patronise you, but
you know that in the Arctic Circle

388
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,199
a reliable car is the difference
between life and death.

389
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,759
But you're not playing a housewife
in this film. That's the thing.

390
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,479
Look, I know, it's not going
to set any pulses racing,

391
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,159
but V70s in this generation
are very, very strong.

392
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,759
Manual gearbox for a bit of fun,
and there's a button in there

393
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,239
that's for heated seats,

394
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,879
and I wonder whether either of
you two have that function.

395
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,440
Shall we see your car, Matt?

396
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
That's really sad, mate.

397
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,639
Forget Sweden.

398
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,359
You want reliability?

399
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,559
He's got it!

400
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,879
- Right, here we go.
- He's got a Merc.

401
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,479
Now, he thinks he's just
bought into the ultimate brand

402
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,920
- of reliability, but little does he know.
- Come on now.

403
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,239
- Huh?
- Explain yourself.

404
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,239
Mercedes, the symbol,

405
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,599
the quintessential symbol
of quality, right?

406
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,119
You go anywhere in the world,

407
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,719
you see these E-Classes
just rattling along,

408
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,039
clicking off the miles, reliability,
reliability, reliability.

409
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,639
Do you understand the
significance of the colour?

410
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,479
It's like a beige, kind of like
a granny's living room colour.

411
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,999
- You know why it's that colour?
- I don't know.

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,079
That was a taxi cab, that
was a German taxi cab,

413
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,239
- probably from the Berlin area.
- What?

414
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,199
So that's had the hardest life imaginable.

415
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,319
While Matt came to terms
with his new taxi...

416
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,159
- But it's still an E-Class.
- ..I went to fetch... mine.

417
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,959
London Calling by the Clash

418
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,599
Oh, my God.

419
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,959
What were you thinking?

420
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't know what to say.

421
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,799
Look, you want to talk reliability?

422
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,799
This has got to be in the conversation, OK?

423
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,479
London taxi, utterly bombproof.

424
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,839
Come the apocalypse, there will only
be cockroaches and London cabs.

425
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,719
I don't know where to begin, Rory.

426
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,039
Look, first of all,

427
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,519
these vehicles are designed to
cover very short distances.

428
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,919
Maybe 40, 50 miles at a stretch.

429
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,079
Beyond that, they are purgatory.

430
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,119
Well, that's neither here nor there.

431
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,279
Also, people visit London to come
and see the London black cab.

432
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,559
No, they don't.

433
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,159
They get in that piece of crap
to go see something else.

434
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,519
Tell me the best thing about this car.

435
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,959
The best thing about this car,
turning circle, 7.62 metres.

436
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,399
I can run rings around your cars.

437
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,999
Right.

438
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,959
But before he could get in and show
us, a man appeared in an old Lada.

439
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,680
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

440
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
Wheel bearing's gone.

441
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,759
"You and your high-milers
will now undertake

442
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,039
"a series of reliability
challenges as you cross Kazakhstan

443
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,239
"to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

444
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,359
"which is home to the Soviet
Union's space programme.

445
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,079
"There's a rocket launch in two days.
Be there."

446
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,799
- We're going to a rocket launch?
- No, no, no.

447
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,519
Those of us that have a car that's
going to make it to a rocket launch

448
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,959
are going to a rocket launch.

449
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,359
You two are going to die on the Steppe.

450
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Why do you have to be like that?

451
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,839
Yes, ahead of us lay the Steppe,

452
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,839
a vast desert of unforgiving
terrain and extreme temperatures,

453
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,359
certain to test our
high-miler's reliability.

454
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,679
The journey would lead us
to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

455
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,040
the world's largest, oldest
space launch facility.

456
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,239
And the home of the
Russian space programme.

457
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,639
Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin,

458
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,879
even the first piece of the
International Space Station,

459
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,399
all were launched from
this 3,000 square mile

460
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,120
Russian-controlled facility...

461
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,119
..but with only two days to get there,

462
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,840
we had a lot of ground to cover.

463
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,519
I was just thinking, you see a
car with 100,000 miles on it,

464
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,359
you think, right, time to get a new
one, that's pretty much worn out.

465
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,479
That's not what we've
done, we've gone for cars

466
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,039
that have 500,000 miles on
them, and mine runs fine.

467
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,799
- How does yours run?
- My cab hasn't aged a bit.

468
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,039
What did you say? It was a piece of

469
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,679
This taxi is a bit of a shed.

470
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,479
I've just discovered that
my heating doesn't work -

471
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,439
and that's a bad thing,
because in Kazakhstan

472
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,000
it's currently minus 12 degrees outside.

473
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,079
First impressions, very impressive.

474
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,559
Doesn't really rattle or
shake, it's remarkable.

475
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,799
Let's face it, Volvos are so reliable.

476
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,319
If this thing does break down,

477
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,120
there'd probably be a national
day of mourning in Sweden.

478
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,079
Guys, I don't have any heating
whatsoever in my cab.

479
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,599
The sun's out, Rory. Think
positive, think warm.

480
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,639
I'm going to die of pneumonia, man!

481
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,479
'Heading out of town, we
made a start for Baikonur

482
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,159
'and the bustle quickly dwindled.'

483
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,879
Look at it, it's just acres
and acres of nothing.

484
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,599
It's like... Stoke!

485
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,599
'And, as the road turned to dirt,

486
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,079
'we got the feeling this might not
be the way to Baikonur after all.'

487
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,239
Why are we doing this? Can't
we find another road?

488
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,879
'But then...'

489
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,999
Look at that.

490
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,839
- That is huge.
- Thanks, Chris.

491
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,759
'We had stumbled across
our first opportunity

492
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,319
'for a spot of competition.'

493
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,919
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

494
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,719
I think I am thinking what you're thinking.

495
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,799
That looks like a race track to me.

496
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,400
I think we need to get it on.

497
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,279
'Our first test of reliability
would be an impromptu quarry race

Three, two, one... go.

503
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,679
Oh, that's hopeless. I've just been
overtaken by a bloody London taxi!

504
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,479
I've got better traction than Chris! Yeah!

505
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,799
Oh, Matt's quick, though.

506
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,359
- Oh-ho!
- Ah, he's in front.

507
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Come on, chase him down, chase him down.

508
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
Oh, he's gaining.

509
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,879
Come on, come on.

510
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,119
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

511
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,280
Ha-ha!

512
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,680
Oh, Rory with the big move up the inside.

513
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,280
We're in front! The black cab is in front!

514
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,679
Oh, get out of the way!

515
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,839
Hey, hey, watch the paint!

516
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,759
Come on, baby, come on, hold it together.

517
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,839
OK, we're coming around the loop.
Ah, the turning circle coming in.

518
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,919
More than handy there.

519
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,679
79 horsepower! 0-60 in 21 seconds.

520
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,839
Sorry!

521
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,079
And we've destroyed the Merc and the Volvo.

522
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,679
Oh, this is hopeless.

523
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,719
Slow up the hill. I got him, I got him.

524
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,680
Matt's gaining, Matt's gaining.

525
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,320
Here we go.

526
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,559
Ah, no!

527
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,879
- Thank you!
- No!

528
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,160
- Yeah.
- Oh!

529
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
Right, come on, old girl.

530
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,159
Here comes Chris.

531
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm on the defensive.

532
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,840
Hold him off, hold him off! Hold him off!
Hold him off...

533
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,079
Matt's slowing down.

534
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,440
What the...?

535
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,719
What the

536
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,999
Whoo!

537
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,679
Come on! Yes!

538
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,159
Ha-ha!

539
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,440
Not quite the end I'd expected.

540
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,759
- Well, what happened?
- What do you mean, what happened?

541
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,599
- You weren't moving.
- I lost drive.

542
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,839
Coming up the hill, the
transmission kind of let go.

543
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,519
I'll tell you what happened.

544
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,079
- I just won the race in the black cab!
- Honestly, I'm disappointed.

545
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,239
I was coming past you,
and you were stationary.

546
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,759
- You weren't coming past me.
- I was. I was pushing you up the hill.

547
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,439
No, I was putting the moves
on you, I was blocking you.

548
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,519
So you reckon you were not
being pushed up the hill?

549
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,239
I was defensive driving
the hell out of you.

550
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,519
- You weren't aware you were being pushed up the hill?
- Yeah,

551
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,479
but that was enough to stay ahead!

552
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,839
You would have pushed me
over the finish line!

553
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
I'm feeling slightly guilty.

554
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,199
This car has lived for 13
years and 570,000 miles.

555
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,679
And I've had it 42 miles.

556
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,439
42 miles!

557
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,959
The last one was probably the most special.

558
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,759
- Meanwhile... - Yeah.
- Pristine, good as new.

559
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,359
I can change that quite quickly for you.

560
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,799
'Our quarry race had taken its toll -

561
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,359
'but, after a few hours,
we were back on the road.'

562
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,480
Your Volvo looks like the Terminator
near the end of the film.

563
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,999
I removed a quarter of the front of the car

564
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,399
and the warning system simply tells
me, "Bulb failure, dipped beam".

565
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,920
That's how tough this car is.
That's Nordic strength.

566
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,999
And also, the airbox has
been a bit squashed

567
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,959
which means it now sounds like
a full-house Audi Quattro.

568
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,039
So, actually, I've improved the car.

569
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,479
It does sound good.

570
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,559
That is nice.

571
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,680
Ba-a-ah!

572
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,719
'At last, we were on the road to Baikonur

573
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,999
'and the producers had told us
to make a stop at the next town,

574
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,919
'a place called Kyzylorda.

575
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,919
'So, we pressed on,

576
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,879
'and Chris took it upon himself
to keep us entertained.'

577
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,119
Were you to drive from one side
of Kazakhstan to the other

578
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,959
it's the same as driving
from London to Istanbul.

579
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,759
It's basically the size of Western Europe.

580
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,599
Is it really?

581
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,519
On a smaller scale, this country
was the origin of the apple tree,

582
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,679
so the apple was invented here.

583
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,239
Was it really?

584
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,119
The Kazakhs were also the first
people to domesticate the horse,

585
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,520
the humble horse.

586
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,599
'But, before Chris could go full corduroy,

587
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,439
'we arrived in Kyzylorda and,
at the local sports ground,

588
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,039
'we discovered apples and horses
weren't all they had invented.'

589
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,199
'They were playing a game called kokpar.
Basically, that's goat polo.

590
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,399
'It's a professional sport in Kazakhstan,

591
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,560
'and the aim is to get the
goat carcass in the goal.'

592
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,319
I got to say, this is, uh, right
up there with some of the, um,

593
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,519
grossest shit I've ever seen.

594
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,719
'As we wondered what else
the afternoon had in store,

595
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,639
'a challenge arrived.'

596
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,959
It says, "You will need now take
on some local high-mile heroes"

597
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,639
"in a simple game of tag."

598
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,879
"If you tag another car, they're out."

599
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,479
"If you get tagged, you're out."

600
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
"Last car driving is the winner."

601
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,919
Apparently, goat polo was just a warm up.

602
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,719
And, as we took to the field,

603
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,760
the atmosphere in the stands was electric.

604
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,319
To prove which of our high-milers

605
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,679
was the most rugged performance machine,

606
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,839
we'll be going up against
not just each other

607
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,599
but three Steppe-hardened Lada workhorses.

608
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,999
Proven benchmarks of reliability...

609
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,960
..driven by a crack squad of local talent.

610
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,599
So, with all six cars
spaced out around the track,

611
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,400
'it was time for tag.

612
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,800
Whoop, whoop, whoop. Let's go racing!

613
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,999
Here we go!

614
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Come on, baby. Let's do this one to London.

615
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,079
Oh, that Lada is mine!

616
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,840
Hey, little red Lada, I'm coming after you.

617
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,640
They're surprisingly quick,
these Ladas, these local hands.

618
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,440
I think I've got the Kazakhstani
rallying champion in front of me.

619
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,639
'With the Volvo and taxi both
struggling in the early stages...'

620
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,559
..it was Matt's Mercedes
making all the moves.

621
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,679
I got this red guy, I got him, I got him!

622
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,199
Matt's got the red Lada.

623
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,080
But Matt had forgotten
to check his mirrors.

624
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,799
Damn!

625
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,719
I'm out. I'm out.

626
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,279
'Having taken out the Merc,

627
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,039
'the little blue Lada
had a taste for blood.'

628
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,080
I'm going to hit the brake
and let him fly past me!

629
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,519
He's missed! The blue Lada has missed!

630
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,799
But then, it wasn't the blue
Lada I needed to worry about.

631
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,439
Oh, Harris is behind me.

632
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,720
No, no, no, no!

633
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,639
Give you a little tap, Rory.

634
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,360
Oh, Harris has got me!

635
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,479
A slight bonnet issue now,
a slight bonnet issue.

636
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,719
With one increasingly battered
Volvo left in the running,

637
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,879
'it should have been easy pickings
for the two remaining Ladas,

638
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,439
but Harris doesn't give up easily.

639
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm on the blue Lada now.

640
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,159
Come on, Harris, get him, get
him, get him, get him, get him!

641
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm going to tap him, I'm going to tap him.

642
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,160
A bit harsh, but there we go.
He needed to know I was there!

643
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,400
Right, come on. This is the endgame.

644
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,160
He's chasing down the last Lada right now.
I think he might do it.

645
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,999
I can't actually see anything. Where is he?

646
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,919
Ooh, there he is. Nudge.

647
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,519
He's got him!

648
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,679
Victory.

649
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,440
Finally, the Volvo gets something.

650
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,439
Way to go, Harris, all right!

651
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,559
Why is he always finishing
races with his bonnet up?

652
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,439
Oh, I... It's an aero device, gives
me a bit of extra front downforce.

653
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,919
A couple more screws in the
bonnet this time, I think.

654
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,399
Yeah, I think so. We'll get there.
We'll get the old girl to Baikonur.

655
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,639
I want to see a rocket go off.

656
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,120
To Baikonur!

657
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,759
You know, honestly, before that trip,

658
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,359
I had no idea that Kazakhstan was real.

659
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,479
I thought it was one of
those made-up places

660
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,439
like Timbuktu or Guernsey.

661
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
Those are both real places.

662
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,879
I know.

663
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,119
OK, James, to recap what happened there

664
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,119
for everyone's benefit and yours is that

665
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,319
the taxi won the race around the quarry.
All right!

666
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,279
- Yeah, yeah?
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance!

667
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,359
I won the race around the
goat sacrifice temple.

668
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,119
Yeah, and Matt's Mercedes...

669
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,319
No, no, no, don't, don't do it.
Don't bad-mouth the Mercedes.

670
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,159
Don't do it, because we're in the presence

671
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,799
of another lover of classic Merc, right?

672
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,679
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Am I right? Now, is it true

673
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,079
that you once owned Idi Amin's Mercedes SL?

674
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,039
Erm...

675
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,119
I was in a movie called The
Last King Of Scotland,

676
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,279
and at the end of that movie, they
gave me this car that I drove in,

677
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,879
which I didn't know at the time

678
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,759
but it had belonged to somebody

679
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,159
and Idi Amin had given it to that person.

680
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,119
So they said at the end of
the movie I could have it.

681
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,239
But, again, I didn't
have a driver's licence

682
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,359
and I didn't really fancy
driving it back from Uganda.

683
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,439
So I left it. I just left it there.

684
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,959
I think they gave it to my driver,
he was a nice guy called Fred.

685
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,359
Nice. Way to go, Fred.

686
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,159
Right, now, it's time to find out
how you went around the track

687
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,799
in our new reasonably fast car. Come on.
How did it go out there?

688
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,439
Well, I don't think it went that well.
But it was a tonne of fun.

689
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,319
- Well, what do you think? Let's see how you did.
- OK.

690
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,959
'So, here we go, then.
Soaking wet track for James.

691
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,079
Off the line. Traction control on.

692
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,999
Big balls. Big, big balls,
that's all you need.

693
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,879
I don't disagree with you. Coming
up towards the first corner.

694
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,439
Wetter than a waterfall in a monsoon.

695
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,439
This braking's going to be tough.

696
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,799
There's a direction change
and also a surface change.

697
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,879
The grip levels there are terrible.

698
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,959
Best to stay on the track, I find, there!

699
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,559
Shut it!

700
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,159
Blending left, turning right into Chicago.

701
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,199
The inside line is off the
frame at the moment so,

702
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,119
actually, there's grip
around the outside.

703
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,400
Come on!

704
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,119
Now, this is the long
drag toward Hammerhead.

705
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,119
Big braking has triggered
the warning lights,

706
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,959
you were braking so
hard, that must be good.

707
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,559
The car's going to oversteer a bit, is it?
Yeah, there it goes.

708
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,599
Whoo!

709
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,679
I'd like to say you caught that. It
wasn't, the electronics caught it.

710
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,999
And again! That was a
mid-gear change slide.

711
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,639
That's just showing off!

712
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,199
Now we've got this fast right here,
down towards the follow-through.

713
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,439
Yeah! Whoo!

714
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,359
You think you're saving that, you're not.
The computer's doing it.

715
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,519
Through the follow-through.
That looks terrifying.

716
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,759
Oh, my Lord. It looks...

717
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,479
You're like a sort of Scottish
Ari Vatanen, aren't you?

718
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,559
Now, coming hard into second
to last, does he make the apex?

719
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,959
He does. He clips it.

720
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,199
- That's so slippery, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's horrible.

721
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,559
'Through Gambon. Nowhere
near the racing line.

722
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,799
And over the line.

723
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,199
- Thank you.
- Good effort.

724
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,759
Honestly...

725
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,039
Can I just say, before we go anywhere,

726
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,079
it was so slippery out there today.

727
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,679
- It really was treacherous.
- Yes.

728
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,319
- But it was a lot of fun because it was.
- It was a good run.

729
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,799
OK, new car means a new lap board.

730
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,919
We've already had a test day
where we sent a bunch of celebs

731
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,039
out in the GT 86 to lay down some markers.

732
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,879
You can watch how they
did over on Extra Gear.

733
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,639
But the fastest time so
far is one minute 39.5

734
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,559
from Olympic double gold-winning
gymnast Max Whitlock.

735
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,439
Oh, I loved his pommel routine,
did you ever see that?

736
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,119
Elegant...
Anyway, all right.

737
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,919
James, and Chris, because,
frankly, this is your fault

738
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,439
if he doesn't go straight to the
top, you were his instructor. Right.

739
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,519
- Feeling confident?
- Mm, not really. A little bit...

740
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,119
- Come on!
- Go on, show me.

741
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,839
All right. You did it in the
wet, so it's a wet time.

742
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:33,199
- One minute... 47.1.
- Yes... yes..

743
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,079
Oh! That's not bad. That's not bad.

744
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,439
That's not bad.

745
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,959
- Thank you. That's not bad.
- That's awesome. Not bad at all.

746
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,119
Right underneath Ore Oduba there.

747
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,119
- A fine effort. - Congratulations.
- I'm the only one in the wet.

748
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,839
That's good. That is good.

749
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,079
Only one in the wet.

750
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,079
I think you guys will have
a lot of fun this season

751
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,479
with the celebrities in that car

752
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,839
because you just can't control it

753
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,639
like you could that Cee'd
that we both drove.

754
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,919
- When you say "fun", do you mean death?
- Yeah!

755
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,879
All right, James, thank you so much
for coming down and playing with us.

756
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,159
Ladies and gentlemen, James McAvoy!

757
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,600
Thank you!

758
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,199
Now, time to return to
our high-mile challenge.

759
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,759
Earlier on, the three of
us each had bought a car

760
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,879
that had driven to the moon and back.

761
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,439
And we were crossing Kazakhstan

762
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,520
for an appointment with the big rocket.

763
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,719
We awoke to the chill of
another morning in Kazakhstan.

764
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,039
And Chris noticed that
overnight I had been busy.

765
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,719
Matt, what's going on with
the back of your car?

766
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,039
Was it abducted last night by a
band of amateur scaffolding people?

767
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,159
You know that the little thing you gave me

768
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,840
that lifted the ascent of
the car up about four feet?

769
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
Well, that's me being cautious

770
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,839
and just trying to preserve the
rear end of this Mercedes.

771
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,519
Despite the previous day's trials,
all three of our high-milers

772
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,479
were still in the hunt for Baikonur.

773
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,679
But since we had the place to ourselves,

774
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,759
Rory had an idea to see whose
car was holding together best.

775
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,519
How about a top speed challenge?

776
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,599
But here's the twist - this
is all about reliability.

777
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,959
So I think we should find
out whose car gets closest

778
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,879
to their manufacturer's claimed top speed.

779
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,519
- That sounds good.
- Chris, you're up first.

780
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,959
And the Volvo's top speed?

781
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,439
125mph.

782
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,879
Three, two, one, go for it!

783
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,600
- It's pretty aggressive.
- Yeah.

784
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,279
That's the half a million mile
clutch he's working with.

785
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,479
Come on, Volvo!

786
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,039
Fourth, come on.

787
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,519
That's 90.

788
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,680
If Volvos are as reliable as he says
they are, this should be no problem.

789
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,239
I'm not even 100.

790
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,280
Not even 100, come on!

791
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,000
- How are the kids? - Good. Yours?
- Yeah, not too bad.

792
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,959
- All right.
- Right.

793
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,519
- How did we do?
- I blame you for what just happened there.

794
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,479
I've got terrible aero and no
power cos my airbox has moved

795
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,279
because you stopped your vehicle on
the first challenge, and I hit you.

796
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,799
- That's my fault?
- Yeah, that's your fault.

797
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,239
- Who hit who? - Who stopped?
- Who hit who? - Who stopped?

798
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,999
- Who hit who?
- I couldn't have hit the thing if it hadn't stopped.

799
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,079
If there's a policeman standing
there, you'd be in trouble.

800
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,119
Do they have policeman at race circuits?

801
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,199
It wasn't a race circuit, we
were in a hole in the ground.

802
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,479
Look, the news is, 104mph,

803
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,719
which is not good enough cos
this thing should do 124, 125.

804
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,839
So I'm 20mph back. So go and do
your worst, I'm going to lose.

805
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,319
Next up, my European E-Class,

806
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,839
with its 180 kilometres per hour top speed.

807
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,160
Go!

808
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,600
There's 100.

809
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,680
There's 120.

810
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,600
- Did they really invent apples in Kazakhstan?
- Yeah, apparently.

811
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,879
I just think, if they invented the apple,

812
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,479
then we should try an
actual Kazakhstani apple.

813
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,839
I'd love to have an apple.

814
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,319
155.

815
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,039
Russet's that sort of thick-skinned,
amber-coloured apple,

816
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
delicious things. The juice from
them makes a very good drink.

817
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,239
- Come on, then, what's the number?
- Take a guess.

818
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,879
160.

819
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,079
- Wow, on the money. - 160?
- 160, that's about 100 miles an hour.

820
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,239
So, by getting within about 12mph
of my top speed, I had edged Chris.

821
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,879
But I'd left the door open
for Rory's 81mph taxi.

822
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,599
Go!

823
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,519
- Come on, black can.
- Takes off like a shot.

824
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,039
40.

825
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,199
45.

826
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,119
He was hardly the figure of
humility when he won last time,

827
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,959
what's he going to be like this time?

828
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,999
81mph.

829
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,039
Ahhh! Yeah!

830
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,079
Unbearable.

831
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,559
It just gets better with time.

832
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,519
Like a fine wine.

833
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,559
Right, gentlemen.

834
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,839
Give me the good news or the bad news.

835
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,319
Well, I'm afraid it's bad news
for you, but good news for me.

836
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,080
I managed 84mph.

837
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,319
3mph more than the
manufacturer's quoted top speed.

838
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,279
- What? - 84mph.
- Really?

839
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,799
- Hey, come on, you got to give it up for the taxi, right?
- Yeah.

840
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,960
- I guess so, yeah.
- Jump back in your cars, see if you can keep up.

841
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,519
Nice one...

842
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,239
I didn't expect the taxi
to go faster than it did

843
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,319
when it left the factory.

844
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,759
That's amazing.

845
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,399
With begrudging respect for
the black cab, we headed on.

846
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,359
And before long, I made a discovery.

847
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,559
Hey, there's a David Hasselhoff
cassette in the stereo.

848
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,919
Check it out.

849
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,119
♪ I've been looking for freedom

850
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,320
♪ But it can't be found... ♪

851
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,360
He's been looking for freedom,
but it can't be found.

852
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,720
But as the hours dragged on...

853
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm finding the flatness
quite imposing now.

854
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,080
You wouldn't want to break
down out here, would you?

855
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,879
..we were told to head to
our last overnight stop...

856
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,039
So that's it, that's quite
literally the end of the road.

857
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,799
..located somewhere
within the vast emptiness

858
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,560
that surrounded the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

859
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,719
That's a dried up salt bed.

860
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,199
Wow!

861
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,760
That's like Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

862
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,119
Driving on into the dark, inky gloom,

863
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,039
eventually we arrived at our overnight stop

864
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,840
where our final challenge awaited.

865
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,959
- Oh, hello.
- What does it say?

866
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,199
It says, "Tomorrow you drive to Baikonur.

867
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,239
"You must reach the border gate by 2pm.

868
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,039
"At 9am tomorrow, your
mileage trips will be reset.

869
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,919
"The winner is the high-miler
that racks up the most miles

870
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,239
"over the subsequent five hours.

871
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,559
"Only the winning car
will attend the launch.

872
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,759
"The two losing cars will be
sentenced to hard labour."

873
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,159
All right, OK.

874
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,199
♪ I'm looking for freedom... ♪

875
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,439
You know what I'm going
to do when I get home?

876
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,519
I'm going to dig out my Hoff collection.

877
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,960
You should go to a doctor.

878
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,400
With the rest of the night to
consider our strategies...

879
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,080
..the next morning, we awoke
to a tantalising sight.

880
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,759
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, yeah, look at that!

881
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,440
Yes, the Baikonur Cosmodrome
was almost within reach.

882
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,439
But with our trip meters covered and reset,

883
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,399
first there was a challenge to win.

884
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,199
And Chris was late.

885
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,039
What have you done?

886
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,280
Mind your own business, Matthew.

887
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,439
All right, all right. Most miles
when we get to Baikonur wins.

888
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,719
Three... two...

889
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
one, let's rock.

890
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,279
If he's going to roar it,
why's he not moving?

891
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,520
I don't know, and maybe the
taxi finally packed it in.

892
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,079
So, clearly I'm not going to beat
those guys in a head-to-head race.

893
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,519
I need to be smart about this challenge,

894
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,760
and approach things with
a bit more cunning.

895
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,159
A cagey start from the others,

896
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,039
but my plan was simple -

897
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,239
more speed means more miles.

898
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,479
The easy way to make your car
quicker is to lose weight.

899
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,959
Seats are gone,

900
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,680
door panels gone.

901
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,519
And I figured the best place to
take my new superlight racer

902
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,999
was back to Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

903
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,159
Even if that did mean...

904
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,840
another lengthy, off-road
drive to reach it.

905
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,759
Meanwhile, in Harris's Volvo...

906
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,879
Ha-ha, a road!

907
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,159
..Chris was heading for a nearby town

908
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,719
with his own harebrained strategy.

909
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,519
Speed is in the mind, so
to change my mind-set,

910
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,240
I've invoked Volvo's racing history here.

911
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,559
You remember?

912
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,679
The year was 1994 and
British touring car legend

913
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,000
Rickard Rydell debuted
the Volvo 850 Estate.

914
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,480
Surely the coolest estate car ever.

915
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,919
Add to that a... perfectly
safe range-extending fuel tank

916
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,599
and you have the ultimate
high-mileage maker.

917
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,319
I just needed somewhere to use it.

918
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,199
So, I did a bit of research last night.

919
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,959
There is an airfield near here,
I don't quite know where,

920
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,679
but I know it's nearby.

921
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,439
The second thing I did last night
was to learn a Russian phrase.

922
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,119
"Where's the airfield?"

923
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,079
Here we are, I'll ask this woman here.

924
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,719
No, she didn't want to know.

925
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,719
She didn't want to...

926
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,839
Now, while the others wasted valuable time

927
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,479
finding places they could up the pace...

928
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,960
Into gear.

929
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,799
Now for some revs.

930
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,200
..I opted for a short cut.

931
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,079
Right, this is it.

932
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,560
Let the high mileage begin.

933
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,200
Woohoo!

934
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,639
No, that's not happening.

935
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,799
Though I swear I heard one of them
say, "Is that Rickard Rydell?"

936
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,039
That was it.

937
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,120
We're on. This direction.

938
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,840
Woohoo!

939
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,439
Now, this is what I call easy miles.

940
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,439
Nice and soft terrain,
not too hard on the car.

941
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,920
What the hell was that?

942
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,119
Something's come wildly loose,

943
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,919
I don't know if it's that
bar on the back or what.

944
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,199
In fact, it was worse.

945
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,999
And with no time to lose,

946
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
the Mercedes needed the delicate
touch of a professional.

947
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,920
Saved a little more weight.

948
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,840
After a slow start over in the Volvo...

949
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,840
..Rickard Rydell had finally
found his airfield.

950
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,960
100 miles an hour.

951
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,600
What a place!

952
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,239
High banking at Daytona.

953
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,879
I really like this car.

954
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,519
She may be old, she may be almost worn out,

955
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,039
but she's got heart, she really does.

956
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,199
After three hours of flat-out,
lightweight racing though...

957
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,359
A fuel light just came on.

958
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,559
..it was time to start
the long drive back.

959
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,560
OK, Baikonur!

960
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,760
Now, Rory was also running low on
fuel, but he had thought ahead.

961
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,520
Ouch!

962
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,680
No!

963
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,360
Oh, that is dead.

964
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,680
That's dead, isn't it?
That's definitely dead.

965
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,879
Oh, man!

966
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,160
Back in my range-extended Volvo,
things were looking tasty.

967
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,479
I'm averaging a lot of miles an hour here.

968
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,280
A lot of miles an hour.

969
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,439
And while I was piling
on the miles, Matt...

970
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,839
wasn't.

971
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,439
All right, finally a
little bit of smooth road.

972
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,319
Oh, spoke too soon.

973
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,000
But then, somehow...

974
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,320
..the cab was back.

975
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,800
How is this car still running?
Unbelievable!

976
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,920
I love this car.

977
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,439
We're a team.

978
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,720
Whatever happens, we're a team.

979
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,079
And at last...

980
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,959
This is it, this is it.

981
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,959
..this team reached the
entrance to the Cosmodrome.

982
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,359
I'm the first one here,

983
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,799
so I may as well do a few of my
legendary tiny turning circles.

984
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,120
Every mile counts. Every mile counts.

985
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,359
And with just a few minutes left...

986
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,679
Hey, there you are!

987
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,479
..it was a desperate fight to add distance.

988
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,160
I can add some miles too, man,
two can play at that game.

989
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,560
Where's Harris?

990
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,240
Oh,

991
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,880
Rory, Rory, that's it. Two o'clock.
Two o'clock, the party is over.

992
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,479
How's your head? Dizzy?

993
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,520
Dizzy.

994
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,279
That is becoming his signature look.

995
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,480
Maybe he can't see where he's going.

996
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,999
- Gentlemen.
- How did you do?

997
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,639
- Well, quietly confident, but let's see what happens.
- Who's this?

998
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,120
He must be checking the mileage.

999
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,440
He's got a lovely wrist
action on that ratchet.

1000
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,680
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- OK, Matt.

1001
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,319
OK, I have here the results.

1002
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,719
In third place, with 211 miles...

1003
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,359
Mr Chris Harris.

1004
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,600
- Oh!
- Congratulations.

1005
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,000
In second place, with 284 miles...

1006
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,799
- ..Mr Matt LeBlanc.
- Come on!

1007
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,679
- That's right.
- Say it, say it.

1008
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,400
In first place, with 329 miles,
Mr Rory Reid in the black taxi.

1009
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,840
Way to go, man.

1010
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,520
Hang on, hang on, look at this.

1011
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,520
Oh, really? Is that what's happening?

1012
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,280
The losers lose their cars.

1013
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,079
So we had our winner.

1014
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,519
And as the others set off
toward their new life of service

1015
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,319
on the Kazakh Steppe...

1016
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,919
I'd become rather fond of my Volvo, Matt.

1017
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,559
Yeah, I'm going to miss that old car.

1018
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,039
The truth is, all our high-milers
had proven their worth.

1019
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,599
And now, all that remained
were the last few miles

1020
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,879
into the heart of the
Cosmodrome and the launch site.

1021
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,719
This would be the black
cab's victory lap.

1022
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,560
- Where you headed? - Rocket launch?
- Jump in.

1023
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,199
And it gave us a chance
to consider something.

1024
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,800
You see, to most people, cars
are just a tool, a runaround.

1025
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,479
You might run one for 60, 70,

1026
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,599
even 100,000 miles and
think it's had its day.

1027
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,119
But the truth is, it
could do so much more.

1028
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,839
Back in the '50s, the US and
Soviet Union's fierce battle

1029
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,320
for global engineering dominance
propelled mankind into space.

1030
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,639
The Cold War thawed just for a moment

1031
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:43,079
as the world stood in collective
wonder at what we could achieve.

1032
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,519
It was an event that marked one
of the most intense periods

1033
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,519
of technological development
in human history -

1034
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,199
and it brought us to
today, where right now,

1035
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,079
sat on your driveway, you could have a car,

1036
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,279
a car, that's been so well engineered,

1037
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,040
it'll go the distance to the
moon and back, and beyond.

1038
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,080
Wow!

1039
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,759
I still can't get that
Hasselhoff song out of my head.

1040
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,119
Amazing cars, indestructible.
Indestructible.

1041
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,199
OK, so, Rory, we know why
our cars aren't here,

1042
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,359
they're doing hard labour in Kazakhstan.

1043
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,159
But where's your little black cab,

1044
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,999
did you not want to drive it back
the 3,000 miles from Baikonur?

1045
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,159
I'd have loved to have driven my taxi home,

1046
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,319
but it had a higher calling, a public duty.

1047
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,879
Check this out.

1048
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,079
See that?

1049
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,479
That's been immortalised, OK?
It's a symbol of hope.

1050
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,279
Yeah, you know, that was really nice.

1051
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,639
The good men and women of Baikonur,

1052
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,159
they can look up at your humble taxi,

1053
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,239
symbol of Britain, of London,

1054
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,959
and think, thank God I don't
have to drive one of those.

1055
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,599
Don't hate a winner, Matt.

1056
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,079
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance.
- No dancing.

1057
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,319
OK, next week, convertible
supercars in the USA,

1058
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,919
the Alfa Romeo Giulia and
one very broken windscreen.

1059
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,519
- Thanks for watching.
- Yeah, we'll see you all next week.

1060
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,720
Goodnight.
