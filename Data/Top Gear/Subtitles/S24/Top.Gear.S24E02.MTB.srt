1
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,169
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,849
Tonight, we've got Porsche vs Lamborghini.

3
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,200
And Chris Harris vs a large wall.

4
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,369
But we begin with Alfa Romeo.

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,162
Back in the '60s, Alfa created
cars like this, the GTA,

6
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:44,987
that were genuine world-beaters -
fast, cutting edge and brilliant.

7
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:47,107
The trouble is since those heady times,

8
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:49,241
the Alfa story has been
one of disappointment,

9
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,641
false dawn and disappointment.

10
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:54,962
But now there's a new Alfa
that finally promises

11
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:57,042
to bring back the good old days.

12
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:09,002
This is the Alfa Romeo Giulia and,
like any good Alfa, it's a looker.

13
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,042
But, like no Alfa four-door
in a very long time,

14
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:16,762
the Giulia is rear-wheel
drive and under the bonnet

15
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:19,642
of this £59,000 Quadrifoglio version

16
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:24,962
is a twin turbo V6, making over 500hp.

17
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:32,402
Exciting headlines, but,
come on, this is Alfa.

18
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:36,042
It can't possibly live up
to the promise... can it?

19
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:44,802
Oh, yes, it can!

20
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:49,562
This thing is mighty...

21
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,802
..in just about every area.

22
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,202
But I've got to start with that engine.

23
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:04,602
It's effectively a Ferrari V8 with
two cylinders lopped off the front.

24
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:10,202
So, what you have is an Alfa Romeo
saloon powered by a Ferrari engine.

25
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,922
How cool is that?

26
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,362
And then there's the way it works.

27
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:23,442
It does an incredible impression
of a normally aspirated engine.

28
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:26,442
At the top where most turbo
engines kind of run out of puff,

29
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:27,682
this one keeps going.

30
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,322
That V6 is a fraud in the most perfect way.

31
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,122
It's so fast!

32
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:46,762
But there's no point having all that power

33
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:48,602
and torque if the chassis can't cope.

34
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:55,722
And that's the genius of this
car - the chassis can cope.

35
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:00,562
There's so much grip on these roads,

36
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:05,442
you can just fire it into
turns at unbelievable speed.

37
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:10,402
And the whole thing just feels so composed.

38
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:12,002
That's the word - composed.

39
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:22,042
They've even done serious
things, like weight saving.

40
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:25,802
Large areas of the bodywork
are made from carbon fibre.

41
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,962
Most of the interior is covered in the stuff.

42
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:35,442
And what isn't carbon fibre is aluminium.
It's all very convincing.

43
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:38,442
And then there's where you sit.

44
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,362
Italy has spent decades perfecting the art

45
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:44,922
of the awful driving position.

46
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:47,402
It's a matter of national pride,
but somehow they've managed

47
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:51,522
to forget it all with this car
because these seats are perfect.

48
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,842
This steering wheel is
in just the right place.

49
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:01,882
I can only assume that, at
some point in the early '70s,

50
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:06,322
all the Alfa engineers that knew
about making a car fun to drive

51
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:08,882
got accidentally locked in a store cupboard

52
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:14,082
and that at some point last
year, Alfa found the key.

53
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:29,162
All those years spent reworking
flabby front-wheel drive Fiats,

54
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,562
all those disappointments we've endured -

55
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:37,762
at last, this Giulia is the real deal.

56
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,842
I can't believe this is happening.

57
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:46,042
This is one of the best moments
of my year so far. Ha-ha!

58
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:51,402
And I know this is the bit where I'm
supposed to reveal the big "but" -

59
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:55,082
to conclude that, yes, the
Giulia is interesting,

60
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:57,762
but still basically rubbish.

61
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:00,922
But it isn't.

62
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:06,442
It isn't rubbish at all. It's magnificent!

63
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:12,202
And that, ironically, is the problem.

64
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:23,122
Now Alfa's finally created
a car capable of mixing it

65
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,042
with the best in the world,
it's going to have to...

66
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,802
Well, you can see where this is going.

67
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:33,162
That is the BMW M3.

68
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:39,202
The sort of car unlikely to be amused

69
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:42,562
by some pretty-faced Italian
muscling in on its patch.

70
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,602
Oh, no, you don't, Wolfgang!

71
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:03,122
The M3 really is the defining
super saloon of our era.

72
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,442
It's a spectacular car and
I adore it, I really do.

73
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,962
This thing really can live with it.

74
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:19,162
I've got more power, I've got more
torque, I've got less weight.

75
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,682
What's not to love?

76
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,242
This Alfa is all over this BMW,
whether he likes it or not!

77
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:30,962
Ooh-ah! Thug!

78
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,562
He may have a bit more lowdown punch

79
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:36,442
and his interior plastics
may be a bit better.

80
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,362
Look, this arm rest, that
could come off at any point,

81
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:44,562
but I know which car I'd rather be
in right now and it's not the M3.

82
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:47,162
I can't believe I'm saying
that, but it's not the M3.

83
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:55,962
I'm going sideways in a 500hp Alfa Romeo!

84
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,442
And that's a beautiful thing!

85
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:03,162
You can slide this car anywhere you want.

86
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,082
Wow!

87
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:10,042
And just look what happens when
you get it onto the straight.

88
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:13,442
0-100mph in 8.2 seconds

89
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,642
and 190mph flat out.

90
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,122
God, this thing is fast!

91
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:29,962
So, and I almost can't believe
I'm finally saying this,

92
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:34,682
Alfa's done it - built a super
saloon to beat the very best.

93
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:37,682
It's like England finally
winning the World Cup -

94
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:41,762
a day many had hoped for, but,
in their heart of hearts,

95
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,682
never believed could really happen.

96
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:48,842
- Rory, what are you doing?
- Well, I couldn't help but hear you saying...

97
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:53,642
Stop there! That you could slide
this car anywhere you want.

98
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:55,442
Well, I thought you might want to prove it.

99
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,002
So, you want me to skid
sideways through that?

100
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,962
Exactly.

101
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:03,882
- What's it made of?
- It's a frangible material.

102
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,562
- What, so it's made of almonds?
- No, it's frangible.

103
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,242
What does that mean?

104
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,482
I don't actually know.

105
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:20,002
Right, my comprehensive review
being a little high-brow for some,

106
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:23,282
my childish colleague would now
have me put the Alfa sideways

107
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:25,962
through a hole in a wall.

108
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,562
OK, come on, Giulia.

109
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,082
We've made a boast.

110
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,922
I know you weren't involved, but
I've made a boast to Mr Reid.

111
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:36,882
You've got to help me out now.
Don't let me down.

112
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:40,242
And frangible, it turns out, has
nothing to do with almonds.

113
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:41,842
It means fragile.

114
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:44,882
Apparently.

115
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,762
This feels very, very wrong.

116
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,162
Rory, why are you in an umpire's chair

117
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:53,362
Please don't question the umpire, Chris.

118
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:56,482
- You're so childish.
- Bring on the wall!

119
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,282
There is no way on earth
he's going to do this.

120
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:19,002
Everything in my brain is saying,
"Don't drive at the big grey wall."

121
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:32,282
That wasn't good. Big damage to
the car, big damage to the car.

122
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:35,042
So, not that frangible.

123
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,882
I thought you said you
could drift this anywhere.

124
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,802
You seen the windscreen?

125
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:43,562
That went really well!

126
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,922
(God!)

127
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,682
What do you think went wrong, mate?

128
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:52,642
What a mess!

129
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,762
Disaster!

130
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,282
- I want to do it again.
- You want to do it again? - Yeah.

131
00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:59,242
Set it up. I'm not giving up.

132
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:07,442
'Honestly, I was feeling about
as wounded as the poor Giulia.'

133
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:15,562
I've got to get this right. I can do this.
We can do this!

134
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:20,202
'So, with the wall rebuilt, Chris
lined up for another attempt.'

135
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,082
Come on! Come on, Giulia!

136
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,962
Bring on the wall!

137
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,042
Already, stop saying that.

138
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:30,642
This is going to go so horribly wrong.

139
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:37,842
'And this time, he would try
a slightly different line.'

140
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,122
No, that's not worked, either.

141
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:50,122
Yeah.

142
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:55,602
Mate, you went through the wall,

143
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:58,762
just not quite in the shape of the Giulia.

144
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:02,762
- Do you understand the concept we're working
towards here? - Set it up.

145
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,722
- I'm not giving up.
- I think the car can do it.

146
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:09,282
'OK, Harris was running out of time,

147
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:13,202
'but somehow still confident he could
do it before the day was out.'

148
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:15,922
- Bring on the wall!
- Shut up, Rory!

149
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,802
'My tenacious colleague set off
to make it third time lucky.'

150
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:22,002
Drift the car through the wall.

151
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,162
'Then again...'

152
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:34,042
I accept, as Chris Harris, that my statement

153
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:38,202
that I could drift it through
anything was, on reflection, unwise.

154
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,282
I want to do one more.

155
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:47,122
As much as I want to see him fail,

156
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:49,922
there's a small part of me
that wants him to succeed.

157
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:57,602
'And so day became night and
with supplies of frangible wall

158
00:11:57,602 --> 00:12:04,122
'now critically low, Chris settled
himself for one final attempt.'

159
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:07,042
I just want to get this done.
I want to succeed.

160
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,082
'Oh, just one more thing.'

161
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:12,922
Bring on the wall!

162
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:14,562
Here we go, then.

163
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:19,802
Come on, Chris.

164
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:22,322
Come on!

165
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:25,842
Is this really going to work? I
can't even see what I'm doing here.

166
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:29,362
I think you can do this. Come on, mate.

167
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:37,042
- Whoa-hoa-hoa!
- YES!

168
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:42,082
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa! YEAH!

169
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:54,042
Yes, baby!

170
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,922
Oh, my God! I can't believe we did it!

171
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,762
I always knew you could do it.
I always knew you could do it.

172
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,162
Oh, yes! Celebratory doughnuts!

173
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:23,202
- Nailed it! Shame about the windscreen, though.
- Yeah, I know.

174
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,402
Look, no-one felt worse about
damaging the Alfa than me.

175
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:28,642
- But, look, I fixed it.
- You did, yeah, I see that.

176
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,602
I also see that you moved the steering wheel

177
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,882
to the other side of the car.

178
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:34,042
Oh, yeah, you noticed that. I'm sorry.

179
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,322
And, Rory, didn't you
just steal that wall idea

180
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:38,562
from that BMW ad a few years ago?

181
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:41,802
You know that that was all
CGI in that ad, right?

182
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,082
No.

183
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,282
You could have killed Chris!

184
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,442
You can't just jump to the
front of the queue like that.

185
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,962
- Oi!
- Hey, I'm kidding.

186
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,002
Now it's time to put the Giulia
around our test track...

187
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,682
and you know what that means.

188
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,682
It's The Stig! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

189
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:01,122
Here we go, then, off the line,
a bit of launch control.

190
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:05,162
This is so powerful, this car -
over 500hp, carbon fibre bodywork.

191
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:08,082
Stig getting very lively
into the first turn, there.

192
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:10,882
The little straight down
to Chicago really is...

193
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:13,602
Look, he's managing the throttle
there, oversteer everywhere,

194
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,602
using the systems. They'd have
been on in race mode here now.

195
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,562
Through Chicago, bit of understeer.

196
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:20,362
Gets on the gas, neutralises it.

197
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:22,482
Look at the back end now.

198
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,362
Well controlled by our white-suited friend.

199
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:29,002
Into the braking zone, into Hammerhead.

200
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:32,362
Again, look at those brake rotors
glowing red hot, carbon ceramics.

201
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:34,162
Round Hammerhead again.

202
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,962
He starts with understeer then
he neutralises it with the gas.

203
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:38,602
It starts to suggest oversteer.

204
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:41,482
Now, the long straight back down
towards the Follow Through.

205
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:46,162
That's quick through there. Follow Through...
Oh, that was fast.

206
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,842
All the way down, now, to Second-to-Last.

207
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,962
Look at the front brake rotor glowing.

208
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:53,762
There it is. Look at that, red
hot, even on a nice sunny day.

209
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:57,642
Now through Second-to-Last... Oh,
oversteer, that's just showboating.

210
00:14:57,642 --> 00:15:00,402
And Gambon... and over the line.

211
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:07,482
So, the fastest four-door ever
to lap our track I believe

212
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:11,322
was the Mitsubishi Evo VIII, at 1:24.8.

213
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:15,242
- So...
- We have a new fastest saloon car.

214
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,402
- Ooh.
- Cos the Alfa did it in...

215
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:19,362
1:21.4.

216
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:21,242
- Ooh.
- Nice, very nice.

217
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:28,242
Not only that, same day, same conditions,

218
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,762
we lapped the new M3...

219
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,162
and it was slower, two tenths slower.

220
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:36,002
So the Alfa is officially faster than an M3!

221
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,042
- That's great news for them.
- That is...

222
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:42,042
- Well done, Alfa.
- That's the benchmark, right?

223
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,682
Wow. There you have it.

224
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,562
Great stuff.

225
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,762
The European exotica doesn't
end there, because we are now

226
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:55,042
a week closer to me driving
the new Renault Twingo!

227
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,602
Yeah.

228
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:58,762
Can't wait for that(!)

229
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,602
But now, it's time to
welcome this week's guest.

230
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:03,762
He stars in Broadchurch

231
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,202
and was once voted the
planet's greenest celebrity -

232
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:08,602
this should be interesting. LAUGHTER

233
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,522
Please welcome - David Tennant!

234
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,922
Woo!

235
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:20,642
- Hello!
- Hey!

236
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:23,322
- Welcome, welcome.
- Nice to be here. - Have a seat.

237
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:32,762
All right. David, thanks for joining us.

238
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:35,442
- Pleasure, nice place you got here.
- Thanks. Thank you.

239
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:39,162
Now, how did you become the
planet's greenest celebrity?

240
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:40,322
Tell us about that.

241
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:42,802
I have absolutely no idea.

242
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:48,002
The only reason I can fathom
is that I drive a Prius.

243
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:49,362
That seems to be it.

244
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:51,922
But now, because I have too many children,

245
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,082
we had to get, like, a big, old van as well.

246
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:57,402
So I now have a Mercedes Viano
to get everyone in the back,

247
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:59,802
and that's a big diesel-guzzling monster,

248
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:02,722
so I think I've lost any
prizes that I ever won.

249
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,402
But you got rid of the Prius?

250
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,602
We've still got the Prius as well.

251
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:07,922
What's wrong with a Prius?!

252
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:10,322
Look, I'm on David's side.

253
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,722
Everybody is always saying the
Prius is this horrible car,

254
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:15,442
it's disgusting to drive,
but I think it deserves

255
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,042
a little bit of respect, OK?

256
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:21,242
Because it represents the biggest
evolutionary step in the history

257
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,082
of the automotive industry, OK?

258
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:28,082
- What?!
- Without the Prius we wouldn't have the LaFerrari,

259
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:30,722
- the P1...
- Oh, come on. - ..or the Porsche 918.

260
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:33,402
It's time to show the Prius respect.
Who likes the Prius?

261
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:40,242
- Thank you OK, great...
- The silence is deafening.

262
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,682
The single greatest step
in automotive technology?

263
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:44,842
The disc brake? The seat belt?

264
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:46,162
Enough of that.

265
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:50,242
And in honour of the world's
greenest celebrity...

266
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:52,482
- Thanks!
- FORMER greenest celebrity. - Yeah.

267
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:55,522
..we've filled the studio with a
selection of sustainable stuff.

268
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:56,962
Take a look at this.

269
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:59,282
It's the Jaguar I-Pace. Look at this.

270
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:03,722
It's an SUV, but it's Jaguar's
answer to the Tesla Model X.

271
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:06,042
It wasn't so long ago
that the Jag brand image

272
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,562
was a little bit Prescott, shall we say,

273
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,722
but this thing is more Silicon Valley.

274
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,042
Forget the Prius, David,

275
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,402
this is the electric
family car that you want.

276
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,842
Are you going to give me one?
Is that my prize?

277
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,882
There's one problem,
though, Rory, isn't there?

278
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,562
- It's not real.
- Of course it's real.

279
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:24,442
OK, it's not real YET, but it
will be ready for production

280
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:28,362
by the end of the year and it will
probably cost about 60 grand.

281
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:29,602
Guaranteed hit.

282
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:31,802
Why are you so resistant to
the idea of electric cars?

283
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:33,202
Well, I'm not resistant.

284
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:35,762
- "Because it's all
about putting a nozzle in a hole

285
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:37,002
"and filling it up!"

286
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,962
Matt, I've got something amazing for you.

287
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:43,082
It comes from Mercedes, it's
called the Maybach G650 Landaulet.

288
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:45,202
And here it is, check this thing out.

289
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:46,562
Ooh...

290
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,522
- Ooh. - Nice, huh?
- That is revolting.

291
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:55,322
It's not revolting, it's decadent!
According to Mercedes...

292
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:57,242
Decadent? For Lego.

293
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,322
They say it demonstrates...

294
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:07,122
"That the definition of unique
luxury can be taken to a new level."

295
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:09,682
Yeah, they're not wrong, Rory(!)

296
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,922
It's got a massive V12 engine,
massive ground clearance,

297
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:14,922
two thrones in the back.

298
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:20,162
It's an off-roader that's also a
limo that's also a convertible -

299
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:22,282
what box is that not ticking?

300
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:25,562
The one that reads "The
buyer is of sound mind".

301
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:32,162
It looks like a Suzuki Vitara slammed into...

302
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:34,482
Mr T's jewellery box.

303
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:39,682
You're saying that like it's a bad thing.

304
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,522
- Now, you've been around our track before back in the days...
- Yes.

305
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:45,082
- ..of the humble Lacetti.
- Yes.

306
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,442
But this time you're taking on

307
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,842
- the fearsome, fire-breathing Toyota GT 86.
- Yeah.

308
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:52,322
You had some fun training with
Chris Harris, what was he like?

309
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,722
I mean, to be fair...

310
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,962
I think driving lessons do bring out

311
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:02,082
the worst in people. It's a
strangely stress-making time.

312
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:05,002
- Didn't you once play a driving instructor?
- I did, yes.

313
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,562
I assume you researched the part.

314
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,242
What did you learn about your
average driving instructor?

315
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,322
I think it's quite a miserable life.

316
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:16,722
They do a very difficult job for
relatively low remuneration.

317
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:18,202
- So they're miserable?
- Yeah.

318
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:20,242
That's like our guy, here!

319
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:23,122
- All right, let's see how you did.
- Yeah. - Let's take a look.

320
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:27,682
As a Doctor Who fan, I'm
looking for a bit more

321
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,882
Tom Baker than Peter Davison here, OK?

322
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:31,322
Don't diss the Davison.

323
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:34,322
First gear, please.

324
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:35,562
- OK.
- Go.

325
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:41,802
- Third gear, third gear!
- Third gear! - Brake, brake!

326
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,402
- Woohoo!
- Left, we're going to make it!

327
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,362
Waaa!

328
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:52,602
Flat out, flat out, come on!

329
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:55,242
It's flat out, what do you want?

330
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:58,442
- Second gear.
- Second gear? Oh, now you tell me.

331
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:01,522
Put your hands on the
wheel, what are you doing?

332
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:05,762
- Through here. I don't like this at all.
- It's nippy!

333
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:10,042
That was nearly death.

334
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,522
Having fun yet?

335
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:19,162
Over there... No. Over here.

336
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,482
Now, we've got to find our
route between the grass

337
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,802
and the white thing. I'm
just going to close my eyes.

338
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:25,922
Woo-hoo-hoo!

339
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,242
OK, up to the right-hand side.

340
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:33,642
Good, good, good.

341
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,842
Brake at the hundred, brake at the hundred.

342
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:38,002
- Brake hard, brake hard!
- Braking, braking.

343
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:40,402
- Braking, sir, braking.
- Brake, brake, brake - or we're off!

344
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:42,322
Brake or we're off.

345
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:44,762
- Beautiful. - SO nearly.
- Come on, that was wonderful, wasn't it?

346
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,082
- Second gear, second gear.
- Oh, - BLEEP.

347
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,962
You nearly-killing-me horrible person, you.

348
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,482
Hoo-hoo!

349
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:53,562
God, stop, stop.

350
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:56,082
Did you enjoy that?

351
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,642
I had a great time.

352
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:06,002
- How was it?
- Loved it.

353
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:10,442
I think you have got to start
being nicer to the guests.

354
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:13,082
I'll try, as long as they
don't scare me so much.

355
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,802
- You've got to chill out a bit, I had a great time.
- I'm sure you did.

356
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:18,682
- He didn't look scared.
- No. - He looked fine.

357
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:19,842
Why were you so scared?

358
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:23,322
Because it felt like he was
trying to hurt me and the car.

359
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:27,762
OK, I would like to tell you about a
new performance hybrid from Japan.

360
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:31,562
- The NSX?
- No, way better than the Honda NSX.

361
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,842
It's this.

362
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:38,682
The Komatsu HB365LC-3.

363
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:40,642
Yeah, Matt, that's a digger.

364
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:45,522
No, no, no, that is not a digger, OK?

365
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:52,042
That's a tracked excavator.
Diggers do this, yeah?

366
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,242
Excavators do this.

367
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,322
And dozers do this.

368
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:58,682
Anyway, look, this thing is awesome.

369
00:22:58,682 --> 00:23:02,362
36 tonnes, 340 horsepower, it's
got a diesel electric hybrid

370
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:05,362
for a power plant and it is just...

371
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:08,322
You really, genuinely care
about this stuff, don't you?

372
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,562
Of course I do, don't you?

373
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:15,482
David, back me up, you look
like a tracked excavator fan?

374
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,762
I'm not entirely sure...

375
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:27,642
..what this is telling us...
about your fascinations, Matt.

376
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:29,442
I can be a little grabby.

377
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,802
Another treat for the
world's greenest celebrity.

378
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:38,282
A new all-electric supercar.
Comes from Croatia, the Rimac.

379
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:44,162
It's in our studio. It looks
brilliant, and it's fast. 221 mph.

380
00:23:44,162 --> 00:23:47,642
There's a motor in each of the
wheels so it's four-wheel drive.

381
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:50,522
It will do 200 miles per charge AND

382
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,922
beat a Bugatti Veyron in a drag race.

383
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:56,882
- How cool is that?
- What is this big fascination with electric cars?

384
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,002
Did you lick batteries as a kid?

385
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:03,762
- Did you?
- The little nine volt ones, yeah.

386
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,002
- Yeah, a little tingle.
- Get a little tingle.

387
00:24:06,002 --> 00:24:07,762
- You're not supposed to do that.
- No? - No!

388
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:10,482
- That explains a lot.
- It does!

389
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,442
Have you noticed, Rory, every week

390
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:14,682
there's a new electric super hyper car,

391
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:16,842
and one that promises it
will beat a Bugatti Veyron

392
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:19,682
- in a straight line?
- That's because they CAN beat Veyrons.

393
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:21,482
That's the whole point of electric cars.

394
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:24,442
- What did you say it was called again?
- Rimac. - Rimac?

395
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:29,122
Sounds like something you use to remove hair.

396
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:31,122
From where?

397
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:33,202
From your... rim. I don't know.

398
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:38,042
I think it's time to move on at that point.

399
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,682
Fair enough. Come on, Chris.

400
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:42,962
Your classic convertible supercar -

401
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:45,242
theatrical, flamboyant,

402
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:48,562
and according to our producers, pointless.

403
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:51,282
Great for the two days of the
summer when it's warm and dry,

404
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:55,362
utterly useless for the rest
of the icy, wet, cold year.

405
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,402
We said, "Get with the times."

406
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,962
Yes, roofless supercars were once like that,

407
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:03,282
but the modern breed, you can
really use them all year round.

408
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,442
So the producers said, "Prove it."

409
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:07,882
Matt and I were each told
to pick a four-wheel drive

410
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:12,002
convertible supercar and to report
bright and early Monday morning

411
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:13,802
for a series of tests in...

412
00:25:13,802 --> 00:25:14,882
Las Vegas.

413
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,322
All right, all right, I'm coming.

414
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:49,122
That's... That wasn't me.

415
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,002
Hey. Ooh, breakfast, nice.

416
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:02,602
Oh, not breakfast.

417
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,202
Can I... order breakfast? No?

418
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:09,722
"Welcome to the Four Seasons
Supercar Challenge.

419
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:14,362
"You will now drive from Las Vegas
to the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains

420
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:18,562
"encountering spring, summer,
autumn and winter on your way.

421
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:21,122
"PS - you're late, get a move on." Ooh.

422
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,122
Yo, Harris, get up, we've got to go!

423
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:31,682
Our four season cars were waiting
downstairs, and my ace card?

424
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:38,002
The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder -
5.2 litre V10, 610 horsepower,

425
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:41,082
all lurking under a body of
pure Italian flamboyance.

426
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:46,722
I put my chips on the Porsche 911 Turbo S.

427
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,762
It might only have a 3.8 litre flat-6,

428
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:53,962
but trust me, in the real world,
this is the fastest car you can buy.

429
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,802
Ooh. Whoa, hang on.

430
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:03,362
This is the supercar challenge,
did you not hear the rules?

431
00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:05,002
Bring a supercar.

432
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:08,282
0-60 in under three seconds,
top speed over 200mph -

433
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:11,122
what's not super about that?

434
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:13,042
Yeah, but it's a 911.

435
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:16,082
It's got rear seats, it's a sports car.

436
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:19,762
Don't get me wrong, I love
911s, it's a super car...

437
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:21,922
but it's not a SUPERCAR.

438
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:24,962
Coming from the man that's chosen
the lifestyle Lamborghini?

439
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:27,602
What'd you mean? "Lifestyle",
what does that mean?

440
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,522
In other words, that's the car for the driver

441
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,882
that doesn't like driving,
it's all about image.

442
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:34,122
No. No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:35,562
Look at it.

444
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:39,402
They said don't bring a blue car
and don't wear a blue shirt.

445
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:41,482
So let's go drive them.

446
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:42,802
Cheater.

447
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,642
What do you mean, "cheater"? It's a supercar.

448
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,802
It's not a supercar, Chris.

449
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:49,842
Well, this wasn't going to
be settled in the car park.

450
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:54,922
Time to hit the road.

451
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:11,602
Yeah.

452
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:17,562
I chose this car because
this is a proper supercar.

453
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,162
It's low, it's pointy, it's
noisy, it's impractical.

454
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,362
But that's what you want in a supercar,

455
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:29,242
you want that over-the-top styling,

456
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:32,642
you want that larger-than-life
superhero feel.

457
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:38,882
Inside that Lamborghini, Matthew
will be giving a detailed,

458
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:41,402
impassioned explanation as to
why he's driving a supercar.

459
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,442
I don't need to bother with that.

460
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:44,802
I can just tell you the following.

461
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:47,122
This is faster to 60, it uses less fuel,

462
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,882
it's bigger, more practical,

463
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:51,522
it costs less money, it's all-round better.

464
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,922
AND, best of all, I don't look
like a part-time pornographer

465
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:56,162
when I drive it.

466
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:06,602
Out of the city limits, we
began our epic journey.

467
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,402
From the intense heat

468
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:12,922
of California's vast desert plains

469
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,122
to the brutal sub-zero snow and ice

470
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:17,242
of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

471
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,882
Four seasons, 400 miles.

472
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:26,722
And for this challenge,
the Lamborghini really is

473
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,122
in a class of its own.

474
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:32,682
The Huracan is the last of the
naturally aspirated supercars.

475
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:35,602
The McLaren 650S - turbo-charged.

476
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:39,082
Ferrari 488 - turbo-charged.

477
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:43,642
The 911 Turbo, um... turbo-charged.

478
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,082
This is a dying breed.

479
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:51,842
And that's because, these
days, Turbo is the way to go.

480
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:56,602
The 911 has a higher top
speed than the Lambo.

481
00:29:56,602 --> 00:30:00,482
And according to Porsche,
it's 2.8 second 0-60 is

482
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,042
half a second quicker, too.

483
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,922
But the best bit...

484
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:07,282
Every time you actually do it - it's faster.

485
00:30:07,282 --> 00:30:11,362
I've done it in 2.6 in this car.
It's outrageous!

486
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,242
Sounds so nice.

487
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,402
Supercars are about presence.

488
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,202
They're about that image.

489
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:22,842
That feeling, you know?

490
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:28,242
They're about posters on a bedroom wall.

491
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:30,442
The 911 just doesn't give you that.

492
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:35,362
The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder,

493
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:37,442
like walking into a room and shouting,

494
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:39,162
"HELLO, I'M HERE!"

495
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:43,962
We were told to report to a local race track

496
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:46,562
for our first four seasons challenge,

497
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:48,642
but before we got going,
we went out for a few

498
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:51,282
sighting laps, to really
get to know our cars.

499
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,522
Huh, it would have been rude not to.

500
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,802
It cheats physics, this thing.

501
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:05,402
It shouldn't be able to do what it does.

502
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:07,402
Cos the engine is in the wrong place,

503
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:09,682
so it should understeer
horribly, but it doesn't.

504
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:12,722
It has got mega-traction.
The engine is an animal,

505
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:15,922
it just pulls and pulls and
pulls from no revs whatsoever.

506
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,642
It's just a fantastic motor vehicle.

507
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:27,522
Harris calls this "The lifestyle Lambo".

508
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:30,162
It's not a bad lifestyle, if you ask me!

509
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:34,482
It does understeer a little bit.

510
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:38,522
But that's OK. Let's you find
the limit without crashing...

511
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:42,042
and this car is all about the drive train.

512
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,322
The double-clutch gearbox is super-fast.

513
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,002
The motor is just fantastic!

514
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:52,202
It's a bit faster in a straight
line than I expected, Matthew.

515
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,962
Soon though, we were told to pull over.

516
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:56,802
It was time for our challenge.

517
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:03,802
"Welcome to Spring Mountain
Raceway." See what they did there?

518
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:07,402
- I do, yes. - Four seasons.
- Very clever! Clever!

519
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:10,682
- "Spring is a season of unpredictable weather..."
- Yeah.

520
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:11,922
I can tell,

521
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:14,962
- it looks like it's going to rain any minute.
- Mm.

522
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:20,322
"When a fast-action roof is essential.
Time for a one-lap race.

523
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,162
"You must start with your roof down

524
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:24,602
"and finish with your roof up.

525
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:26,402
"First to cross the line wins."

526
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,922
OK.

527
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:31,962
Two supercars.

528
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:36,362
Well, one supercar. One lap of the track.

529
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:40,282
First one past the chequered
flag with their roof up - wins.

530
00:32:42,122 --> 00:32:45,282
OK! Thrust mode possible. I'm ready.

531
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:48,002
Are you ready? I'm ready!

532
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:50,442
This car is violent off the line.

533
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:55,602
Going to get my roof down
towards the end of the race.

534
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:59,002
I bet that's what he'll do. OK, here we go!

535
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:01,842
Three, two, one... Go!

536
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:07,962
- There he goes!
- Oh!

537
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:10,442
She comes out of the hole good!

538
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:16,722
An impressive start, but
I had a different plan.

539
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:18,722
Launch control... Go!

540
00:33:21,202 --> 00:33:23,882
That's outrageous! I'm done.

541
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:26,242
I don't have to worry about this any more.

542
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,842
OK... he's got a different strategy.
He's putting

543
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,962
his top up there.

544
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:36,202
The Lamborghini roof goes up in 17 seconds.

545
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:40,042
Annoyingly, Harris's Porsche
does it in just 13.

546
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:43,402
I've got to get a little bit
of an advantage here, because

547
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:46,602
he's got a four-second-quicker
roof mechanism.

548
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,842
But just as I was building my lead...

549
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:56,002
..spring sprung!

550
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,122
Oh, what is that?

551
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,282
I can see him.

552
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:09,522
Roof down, peacocking around!

553
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:11,322
Oh, there he is.

554
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:13,922
- Come on, Lambo!
- They've wet the track!

555
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:21,682
That's so slippery!

556
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:26,642
There he is! He's still
got to put his roof up.

557
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:31,522
And to do that, Matt had to slow down to

558
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:33,442
a steady 31.

559
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:36,442
Come on, baby! Where is it? Where is it?

560
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,642
Not so super now!

561
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,602
Hello, sweetheart!

562
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:48,282
- Yes!
- He got me!

563
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:52,242
So, what do we think, then?

564
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:54,682
Does you being beaten make me a supercar?

565
00:34:54,682 --> 00:34:56,402
Or am I not a supercar?

566
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:59,042
Well, this is a test of practicality.

567
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:03,042
So your sports car has a very
practical four-seconds-quicker

568
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,442
roof mechanism.

569
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:07,762
A supercar, which this is, and
that is not, is not supposed

570
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:11,322
to be practical at all.
Which this isn't. At all!

571
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:17,922
This was going to be a long trip!

572
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,842
And as we moved on to the next challenge...

573
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,922
Fantastic out here. This is America, baby!

574
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:33,002
- Cowboy country!
- It is absolutely stunning!

575
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:37,202
Even the incredible scenery was bringing out

576
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,442
our competitive streak.

577
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:42,922
- Big.
- Big and vertiginous!

578
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:46,282
- Now, there's a word!
- Yes.

579
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:49,322
You are quite the sesquipedalian!

580
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,962
One hour later, we arrived at our

581
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:56,202
next challenge location and
the signs didn't look good!

582
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:01,962
Death Valley is one of the
hottest places on Earth.

583
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:04,002
And before we went any further,

584
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:06,082
Harris insisted on taking supplies.

585
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:10,562
I'm taking no chances with
this Death Valley thing.

586
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:13,922
I've got water, snacks, a shovel

587
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,802
- and spare radio batteries, should they run out.
- Ah-ha.

588
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:21,962
For me, to survive this
potentially deadly crossing,

589
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:25,882
I'm teaming a cinnamon latte with
a poppy seed blueberry muffin.

590
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:28,802
Oh, smells so nice!

591
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:30,522
It's just embarrassing!

592
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,402
Are you sure you don't want a muffin?

593
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:35,682
I don't need a muffin. I
need water and practicality.

594
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:38,082
What are you going to do with that shovel?

595
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:39,722
Hey!

596
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:44,722
Thank you!

597
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:47,682
Happy trails.

598
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:50,682
- I'll take that.
- That's a cowboy!

599
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:53,202
"Welcome to summer. The holiday season.

600
00:36:53,202 --> 00:36:56,282
"Time to take a vacation from your car.

601
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,122
"You will now switch vehicles."

602
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:02,362
- Did you organise this?
- No. - "Then drive across Death Valley."

603
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:04,522
- This is a stitch-up, isn't it?
- OK, yeah.

604
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,882
- I'll take the muffin.
- I'll keep the muffin.

605
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:09,802
Thanks for stocking my car up with goodies!

606
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:12,042
MUSIC: Green Onions by Booker T and The MGs

607
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:14,682
- Hey, Chris...
- Yes.

608
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,722
These chips that you bought,

609
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,962
they are delicious! Thank you.

610
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:22,082
Leave those alone!

611
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,282
Tasty snacks aside, though,

612
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:30,122
life in Harris's Porsche was
definitely not as special.

613
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,282
Quite a bit different than the Lambo.

614
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,802
It feels, really, a lot taller.

615
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:38,122
It feels definitely more practical.

616
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,842
What's it like being in the peacock?

617
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,042
The engine is a masterpiece.

618
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:47,322
8,500 RPM with a lovely step at about 4.5.

619
00:37:49,122 --> 00:37:51,202
Buffeting, not very good.

620
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:55,522
I'm a very, very short man, as my
co-host is very keen to point out,

621
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,562
and I'm pretty much in the airflow here.

622
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:01,362
If you were the size of a normal human being,

623
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,522
this wouldn't work!

624
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,282
Now, come on! Tell me the truth...

625
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:12,962
- You like that car!
- I mean, the sense of theatre, if you

626
00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:15,762
wanted to feel that you'd
bought something special

627
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:19,242
with your money, I have
to say, it's more special

628
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:22,122
than the Porsche. But it's just lacking

629
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:23,962
ANY kind of sense.

630
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:26,082
But that's the whole point.

631
00:38:26,082 --> 00:38:29,842
It's not supposed to make sense!
It's a supercar.

632
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:31,482
Here we go again!

633
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:35,682
Summer was getting us nowhere.

634
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:37,882
So, for the rest of the challenge,

635
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,802
we agreed to just enjoy
the cars and the view.

636
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:45,762
Look at this! This is special.

637
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:47,962
That is some epic scenery right there.

638
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:52,002
And reaching the foot of the
Sierra Nevada, it was time

639
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,802
to deliver our verdicts.

640
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:58,722
So, what do you think? Huh?

641
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:01,282
- Well, I think...
- This is your last bottle of water, by the way.

642
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:04,362
What? Look, if you are a
dental hygienist from Florida,

643
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:06,242
or you keep a Chihuahua,

644
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:09,762
- or you take selfies, I think it is a great car. Great, Matt.
- OK.

645
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:13,722
What about my car? Come
on, tell me about my car?

646
00:39:13,722 --> 00:39:17,162
Well, that is a nice car. I
mean, if you are in the market

647
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:20,362
for a supercar that is
the most bland supercar

648
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:21,882
you can find - that is it.

649
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:24,562
I'm telling you, that is a bland supercar.

650
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,002
That's a meaningful 50-year marriage.

651
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,962
That's a one-night stand!

652
00:39:36,602 --> 00:39:39,362
We called summer a no-score draw.

653
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:42,042
And after a long day, the
producers had kindly laid on

654
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:44,762
accommodation in a quaint local village.

655
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:58,362
Wow, look at this place!

656
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:08,922
Ever had the feeling you were being watched?

657
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:11,922
To help us blend in...

658
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:15,122
..I had a plan!

659
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,602
OK, follow my lead!

660
00:40:19,322 --> 00:40:21,082
Oh, yeah, that should do it,

661
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:25,002
erecting the roof will cover
all bases in this situation.

662
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:26,482
Just put your roof up!

663
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:33,722
I just erected four seconds faster than you!

664
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,562
'Stop saying erect!'

665
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:39,042
This is the last place you want
to get caught with an erection!

666
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,282
OK, now, what you need

667
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:54,562
to know about that film -
is that when I got my Lambo

668
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:57,362
back from Harris, it was disgusting!

669
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:01,282
OK! Crumbs on the seats.
Chocolate on the wheel.

670
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:04,922
I am pretty sure you got
hummus on the rev needle.

671
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,522
I don't even know how you did that. OK,

672
00:41:07,522 --> 00:41:10,642
- you, my friend, are a pig!
- I'd rather be fast than clean.

673
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:13,642
You know, you can be both, right? I
think it says something about the

674
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:17,562
- kind of person you are.
- Work with me, are you a car slob, like me?

675
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:21,042
Personally, I am not. But I have four kids.

676
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:25,562
So, my car has a thin layer of
raisins and snot at all times.

677
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:28,482
It's sort of impossible to...
manage with anything else.

678
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,682
But you, yourself, are quite
clean within the car?

679
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:32,362
I would like to be, but I have given up

680
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:36,482
until my children reach, you know,
46, I'm just going to accept

681
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:39,282
that that is how we're going to live.

682
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:41,482
I can be dirty, as well, in the car.
But unlike you,

683
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,002
I keep the outside of the car pristine.

684
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,162
You have a different attitude
towards that, I gather.

685
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:49,082
Well, I just... You know...

686
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:51,122
Especially driving around in London,

687
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,882
the odd scrape, the odd scratch -

688
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:55,362
anything that doesn't disable the vehicle...

689
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:58,842
..I don't think is worth worrying about.

690
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:01,562
What constitutes a scrape or a scrunch?

691
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,722
Well, there's certainly

692
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,802
a panel, that if you drive too fast,

693
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:07,722
flaps out the black.

694
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:09,562
But you can kick it back in

695
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:11,602
and it does for about a week each time.

696
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:14,082
Are you the kind of person,
that when you parallel park

697
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:16,042
you kind of nudge the car in front a little?

698
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,842
I don't nudge... I am very beady about other

699
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:22,722
people's cars. But if you
are in a multistorey and...

700
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:25,922
you rub against a wall to sneak
into that little tight space,

701
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:28,162
- what's the harm?
- There's a voice inside him now...

702
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:31,882
- Just a bit of paint...
- ..that's crying and screaming about this, he simply can't...

703
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,242
- I can't take it.
- The thought of damaging something!

704
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:36,642
All right, moving on, now
you are back on our screens

705
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:38,202
for a new series of Broadchurch.

706
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:39,682
The final. This is it.

707
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,882
I think we should do three
and then leave them

708
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:45,242
wanting more. It's a small town,
if there was revolving door

709
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:49,202
of horrendous crimes happening, it would
start to get a bit preposterous, so...

710
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:51,642
The writers, I hear they
are super, super secretive

711
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:53,362
about the storylines. Is that true?

712
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,002
Yeah. It's always been... the way.

713
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:58,362
Anything that is a thriller that has...

714
00:42:58,362 --> 00:43:00,122
elements of plot that you want to hold back,

715
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,162
I think everyone gets it, particularly

716
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,602
in this modern era, the idea that someone

717
00:43:04,602 --> 00:43:07,802
could misplace an e-mail, or that the Kremlin

718
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:10,802
could hack into your account.... You know...

719
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:15,442
It means being on the show
gets really tiresome.

720
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:17,682
Because everything gets
sent out with a password.

721
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:20,562
One script has one password,
another has a different password.

722
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:23,482
And then the script amendments,
that come through the night before

723
00:43:23,482 --> 00:43:25,202
and they are not passwords you choose.

724
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,242
They give you a password and that is
in a different e-mail, that has a

725
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:30,522
different password that
you have to remember from

726
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:32,882
last week... when they sent out...
I just can't keep up.

727
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:35,562
- It is just impossible.
- If you don't know your lines, you can

728
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:38,402
- just say, "I didn't get the e-mail..."
- Exactly. - Beautiful!

729
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:40,842
I end up being a terrible
grumpy old man about it -

730
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:42,922
and phoning up - "Just send me some paper.

731
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:44,562
"I can't deal with this!"

732
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:47,002
All right, are we ready?
Because the time has come...

733
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:50,362
- Is this it?
- ..to see how you did around the track,

734
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:51,842
on your own, in the GT86

735
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:55,242
I'm very optimistic. I fear
crashing disappointment.

736
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,642
- Before we do, there is something we need to discuss, I think.
- Yeah.

737
00:43:58,642 --> 00:44:01,202
- After I left you at the end of our coaching session...
- Yeah.

738
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:04,242
..you agreed you'd then go off and do

739
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:07,042
your timed laps. But between those
two events, I gather you went for

740
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:08,882
a little bit of extra training on your own.

741
00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:12,162
- A bit of a sneaky extra training lap...?
- Well...!

742
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:15,202
What happened?

743
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:18,402
I... I just... I kind of think
you've got to go for it.

744
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,842
You've got to learn what the car can take.

745
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:22,482
You've got to push your boundaries.

746
00:44:22,482 --> 00:44:25,842
And sometimes you slightly
overstep your boundaries.

747
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:28,122
Can we see the image, please?

748
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:30,322
Oh, no!

749
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:32,962
Anything that doesn't disable the vehicle...

750
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:36,602
..doesn't count as an accident!

751
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:41,682
We've only had that car two weeks.

752
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,442
And now it's got character!

753
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,482
What did you hit? There is NOTHING out there!

754
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:48,842
It was one of those sort of foam signs

755
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:50,602
that tell you when to turn left.

756
00:44:50,602 --> 00:44:53,802
Oh, now I can talk to you
about foam that damages cars.

757
00:44:53,802 --> 00:44:56,242
- It really can. I can sympathise there.
- Yeah, you see? You see?

758
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:57,442
- I can sympathise.
- Yeah, yeah.

759
00:44:57,442 --> 00:45:00,362
- OK, but you did manage to record a timed lap, yeah?
- Yeah.

760
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:03,402
- Oh, yeah, that was in training.
- OK.

761
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:05,922
- Well, let's take a look at that then.
- Let's have a look.

762
00:45:05,922 --> 00:45:09,522
- Here we go, off the line.
- Oh, poor. - Average at best. - Ugh!

763
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:10,642
Look at the massive dent!

764
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,882
Come on! Come on! Oh, that was nasty.

765
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:15,602
Oh, you look very serious.

766
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,402
We're flying, we're flying.

767
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:20,322
A really good view of the damage
caused to the panel again.

768
00:45:20,322 --> 00:45:21,842
Lovely, isn't it? Looking good.

769
00:45:21,842 --> 00:45:24,002
The line's not too bad.

770
00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:25,642
We're on FIRE!

771
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,242
OK, braking hard into Chicago.

772
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:29,882
Braked a bit early, I think.
What's it like through here?

773
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:33,042
Bit of understeer, and then
a massive clog of throttle

774
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:35,762
- which triggered the ESP and slowed you down.
- Oh, shut up!

775
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:38,562
And the trick is to use the whole
circuit, not half the circuit, OK?

776
00:45:38,562 --> 00:45:40,882
Over to the right-hand side.
Here are your braking boards.

777
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,682
- Oh, look, there's one you didn't hit!
- Yeah.

778
00:45:42,682 --> 00:45:44,762
Now we go left, right round Hammerhead.

779
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:46,642
Let's see your line through Hammerhead.

780
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:48,442
Not... Ooh, again, triggered the ESP.

781
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:49,562
Oh, yes!

782
00:45:49,562 --> 00:45:51,162
Here we go.

783
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:59,282
Nice! Nice!

784
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,762
And now flat-out through the Follow Through.

785
00:46:04,122 --> 00:46:06,762
If you hadn't had ESP
there, you would have died.

786
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,162
Well, I did - it's fine.

787
00:46:08,162 --> 00:46:10,322
Braking hard, braking
hard into second to last.

788
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:11,722
Very good line through there.

789
00:46:11,722 --> 00:46:13,362
Ooh, we did it, we did it, we did it.

790
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:14,602
Second gear, come on.

791
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:15,642
Through Gambon...

792
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:18,762
..and over the line.

793
00:46:20,762 --> 00:46:24,042
All right. That was pretty good. How
do you feel? What do you think?

794
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,402
Yeah. You know.

795
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:27,522
- I think you did all right.
- Thank you. - I do.

796
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:28,922
I was feeling quietly confident

797
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:31,802
- until I heard your barrage of criticism.
- Well, no... I was just...

798
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:34,562
- You set yourself high standards, I want to help you to get there.
- OK.

799
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:38,122
And I'm just glad that you didn't
apply any more damage to our car.

800
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:40,762
- One little dent.
- What do you think? How do you think he did?

801
00:46:40,762 --> 00:46:43,322
I think that was quite quick. I
think it was daring in places.

802
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:46,002
He scrubbed off some speed.
But I'm-I'm confident.

803
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:47,682
- I think he's done me proud.
- OK!

804
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:52,042
Well, the best time on our
board is still Max Whitlock,

805
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:55,922
the Olympic gold medallist, with 1:39.5.

806
00:46:55,922 --> 00:46:57,962
You ever see his flic-flacs? LAUGHTER

807
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:00,842
- So graceful, the extension that guy... Anyway.
- You haven't seen...

808
00:47:00,842 --> 00:47:03,442
- You haven't seen my flic-flacs.
- I have your time right here.

809
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:06,442
- Yeah?
- David Tennant, you did it...

810
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:08,162
- Yeah?
- ..in one minute...

811
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:09,922
Forty...

812
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:11,802
four, flat.

813
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:14,522
Yes! - Come on!

814
00:47:14,522 --> 00:47:15,682
Huh?

815
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:19,122
Well done. Really well done.

816
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:24,362
Second place, I'll take that.
I'll take that. Yeah.

817
00:47:24,362 --> 00:47:26,402
- Second quickest.
- Yeah, that's OK.

818
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:29,922
So I think that's
congratulations to both of you.

819
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:31,122
You had a little help from him.

820
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:33,042
I couldn't have done it without my teacher.

821
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,842
I think you'd have been first without Chris.

822
00:47:36,602 --> 00:47:39,962
- No, I'm kidding.
- I-I... Yeah, I'll take second place. That's all right.

823
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:42,202
- That's good, that's good.
- I think that's really good.

824
00:47:42,202 --> 00:47:44,442
- Ladies and gentlemen, David Tennant!
- Thank you!

825
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:47,202
Nice to see you again.

826
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:48,602
Thanks for coming.

827
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:50,602
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

828
00:47:51,762 --> 00:47:54,922
Now, earlier on, Matt and I
had finished the first day

829
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:59,882
of our big convertible supercar trip
in the charming town of Darwin.

830
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:02,882
And because what happens in
Darwin stays in Darwin -

831
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:04,442
really, that's their motto -

832
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:06,922
we pick up the story the following morning.

833
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:17,602
'We got up early, as it was time to
leave California's desert plains...'

834
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:19,842
Ooh, I think we might be about to

835
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:22,762
enter into a bit of twisty,
windy road, Mr Harris.

836
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,682
'..and start our climb into
the Sierra Nevada Mountains.'

837
00:48:29,442 --> 00:48:31,562
There is no guard rail.

838
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:33,602
Look at that, that's a
sheer face right there.

839
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:35,522
You go off there, that's bad.

840
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:40,442
'We wondered what our
next challenge might be.'

841
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:43,602
Ooh, Smokey the Bear up ahead.
Smokey the Bear up ahead.

842
00:48:44,642 --> 00:48:46,922
'And with no idea what Matt was on about,

843
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:50,442
'we came across a policeman
waiting with the answer.'

844
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:52,282
Hello, officer.

845
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:54,002
Oh.

846
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:55,202
Well, thank you.

847
00:48:56,562 --> 00:49:00,042
"Welcome to fall, a season
of tricky road conditions.

848
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:03,762
"You and your cars will now FALL

849
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:06,162

"no touching the accelerator.

"Quickest to the bottom wins."

852
00:49:09,602 --> 00:49:12,282
That sounds like a completely
relevant real-world test.

853
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,082
This will be fun. I do this with
my buddies on the motorcycles.

854
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:17,642
Neutral all the way down the mountain.

855
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,562
But I've got to say, it
doesn't feel like fall.

856
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:25,242
Ah, there we go. It does now.

857
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:26,322
Very funny

858
00:49:26,322 --> 00:49:28,562
Anyway, it's not fall, it's autumn.

859
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:29,802
No, it's fall.

860
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:33,242
English car show - autumn.

861
00:49:33,242 --> 00:49:35,722
We're in America, so it's fall.

862
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,802
We invented the language. It's autumn.

863
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:38,882
It's fall.

864
00:49:38,882 --> 00:49:40,802
We're not going to "autumn" down the hill.

865
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:42,082
That's just a bad pun.

866
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,962
Look, whoever wins the challenge
gets to name the season. Deal?

867
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:46,922
Deal. That's fair enough. Yeah, deal.

868
00:49:46,922 --> 00:49:48,082
Fall.

Three, two, one!

874
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:11,442
OK.

875
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,682
Here we go. Come on.

876
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:16,002

00:50:19,242 --> 00:50:20,882
OK, stay off the brake.

879
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:24,402
Stay off the brake.

880
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:25,442
Piece of cake.

881
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,482
Let it run, let it run.

882
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:33,002
'But as this 1½-ton, 200 grand
rock gathered momentum...'

883
00:50:33,002 --> 00:50:34,562
Oh, this is weird.

884
00:50:34,562 --> 00:50:36,242
Such a weird feeling.

885
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,162
'..this was becoming a
test of not only skill...

886
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:41,602
Oh, this is a tight one, here's a tight one.

887
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:42,882
'..but bravery.'

888
00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:46,282
Oh, I got to brake, I got to brake.

889
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:48,282
Ah, scrubbed too much speed right there!

890
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:51,682
Come one, don't be a chicken.
Stay off the brake.

891
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,202
'Although the further I went...'

892
00:50:53,202 --> 00:50:54,242
Come on.

893
00:50:54,242 --> 00:50:55,682
'..the easier it became.'

894
00:50:55,682 --> 00:50:57,242
Be brave, the brave.

895
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:00,762
All right, here comes the hairpin.

896
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:02,362
Set up way out here.

897
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:04,642
BRAKES SCREECH Brake.

898
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:06,402
Do not go off the cliff.

899
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:10,002
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

900
00:51:10,002 --> 00:51:11,762
Jesus.

901
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:14,322
Right. Whoo.

902
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:17,682
'And with the little blue bull
really starting to run...'

903
00:51:17,682 --> 00:51:19,002
Whoo!

904
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:23,682
'..nearing the bottom, we were flying.'

905
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:27,362
76, 78, 79, 80, 81,

906
00:51:27,362 --> 00:51:30,282
82, 83, 84, 85, 86!

907
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:33,602
Across the line.

908
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:34,842
Whoo.

909
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,162
'Felt fast,

910
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:39,762
'but Harris's Porsche was heavier
and potentially quicker.'

911

Three, two, one.

912
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:47,562
Come on!

913
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,522
'OK, it's fair to say...'

914
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:51,722
Eight, nine, ten.

915
00:51:51,722 --> 00:51:54,162
'..this isn't the sort of
challenge I'm used to.'

916
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:56,682
Oh, this is bloody awful.

917
00:51:56,682 --> 00:51:59,762
Now, if you're speeding
with the car in neutral,

918
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:02,362
is it still speeding on the road?
Can you get a ticket for that?

919
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:04,842
- Yeah, it's still speeding.
- Just curious. OK.

920
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:10,282
'And I admit, I did find the whole
"lack of engine" thing a bit...

921
00:52:10,282 --> 00:52:11,842
'tricky.'

922
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,522
Oh, I shouldn't have braked!

923
00:52:13,522 --> 00:52:16,082
Oh, I've really wiped a load speed off there.

924
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,922
Come on, here we go. Here we go.

925
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:26,322
Oh, I don't know what's round the corner.
I keep wanting to brake!

926
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:30,682
Oh! Now I'm nervous!

927
00:52:33,122 --> 00:52:35,082
74, 75...

928
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:39,562
Yeah-heh-heh-heh-heh!

929
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:41,562
Could I have gone quicker? Yes.

930
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:43,202
Would I want to? No.

931
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,522
- OK, so you did it...
- Yeah?

932
00:52:47,522 --> 00:52:49,922
..in two minutes and 46 seconds.

933
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,162
- Sounds reasonable.
- That's pretty good.

934
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:53,842
- And I did it...
- Yeah?

935
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:55,922
..in two minutes and three seconds.

936
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:01,282
- That's a typo.
- I don't...

937
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:03,842
- How can you be 43 seconds quicker?!
- That is, er...

938
00:53:03,842 --> 00:53:07,082
- You're a third quicker, basically, than me.
- Yeah, I...

939
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:08,162
One third?!

940
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:11,242
- Yeah, I...
- Sorry, I'm just looking...

941
00:53:11,242 --> 00:53:14,162
- Is there a parachute behind my...?
- I don't know. Let me see that.

942
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,442
Cos the way this is written,

943
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,842
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

944
00:53:20,162 --> 00:53:22,202
'Stupid challenge anyway.'

945
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:24,162
'Now, as the winner of FALL...'

946
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,642
43 seconds?!

947
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:29,402
'..I had made it one apiece, with
just one challenge remaining.

948
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:34,282
'And as we climbed higher
into the mountains...'

949
00:53:34,282 --> 00:53:36,082
Everything's getting whiter.

950
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:39,322
And this is slightly concerning.

951
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:43,162
'..winter was definitely coming.

952
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:47,562
'And, arriving at Mammoth Mountain,
our Four Seasons decider

953
00:53:47,562 --> 00:53:50,522
'looked like it would be the
toughest challenge of them all.'

954
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,122
Wow!

955
00:53:54,122 --> 00:53:55,922
So this is winter.

956
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,082
Er...

957
00:53:57,082 --> 00:53:59,322
When does heavy snowfall become a blizzard?

958
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:02,122
I don't know, but this
feels pretty blizzardy.

959
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:03,962
Ooh!

960
00:54:03,962 --> 00:54:06,922
- Oh, look. There's something in there. What is that?
- Hm.

961
00:54:09,802 --> 00:54:14,482
"Time for your final challenge -
winter, a season of ice and snow.

962
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:17,362
"You claimed your supercars
could handle any weather.

963
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:21,722
"You will now prove it by racing
across Mammoth Mountain."

964
00:54:21,722 --> 00:54:24,562
We have to race across Mammoth Mountain?!
That's a big mountain!

965
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:25,602
Now, look here.

966
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:28,402
After the last challenge, I
fully intend to win this one.

967
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:30,242
- OK. - OK?
- Well, good luck to you.

968
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:35,602
Mammoth Mountain sits at the heart
of the Sierra Nevada range.

969
00:54:35,602 --> 00:54:39,442
To cross it, our challenge would
start over 9,000 feet up,

970
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,642
at the top of an icy ski slope.

971
00:54:41,642 --> 00:54:45,002
Plunging to the bottom, a two-mile
drive through deep-drift snow

972
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:49,482
would bring us to the final stage
a climb through dense forest,

973
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:52,722
and a race to the finish on the
other side of the mountain.

974
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:57,802
It's 1-1. This is the decider.
Winner takes all.

975
00:54:57,802 --> 00:55:01,922
All-wheel drive, 600
horsepower, £200,000 car.

976
00:55:01,922 --> 00:55:03,802
What could possibly go wrong?

977
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:06,762
Three! Two! One!

978
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,962
Go!

979
00:55:09,962 --> 00:55:11,282
Yes, baby!

980
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,482
Oh, he got the jump on me.

981
00:55:17,802 --> 00:55:19,042
- I can't see
- BLEEP.

982
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:25,402
Ugh. I'm doing about 80 in a snowdrift!

983
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,402
So I've got to get to the
other side of the mountain,

984
00:55:27,402 --> 00:55:29,322
where apparently it's not snowy.

985
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,562
You know, when manufacturers
talk about 0-60 times,

986
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:38,002
they assume you're going to be on a road.
But if you're on, say...

987
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:42,642
Oh, I don't know, a ski slope,
those times may vary slightly.

988
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:44,402
Consumer advice right there.

989
00:55:46,122 --> 00:55:49,402
'Harris's all-weather
Porsche had started well.

990
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:50,442
'But then...'

991
00:55:50,442 --> 00:55:51,922
Whoa!

992
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:54,602
Oh, I'm stuck.

993
00:55:56,882 --> 00:55:59,962
There's the pass. There's the pass.

994
00:56:01,482 --> 00:56:02,722
That is immature.

995
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:05,602
Is this a blue run?

996
00:56:05,602 --> 00:56:07,562
It is now. HE CHUCKLES

997
00:56:10,962 --> 00:56:15,242
'To stay in the race, Harris had
been forced to call in some backup.'

998
00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:20,642
'And, on the other side of the
mountain, the weather had cleared...

999
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:23,802
'..and I was ploughing ahead.'

1000
00:56:23,802 --> 00:56:25,962
Yeah, Lambo! Come on, baby! Come on!

1001
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:30,802
'But I was now out of the
deep stuff and gaining fast.'

1002

'Going into the second stage,
it was uphill all the way.'

1003
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:39,682
Flat pinned in third gear,
going up a ski slope!

1004
00:56:41,642 --> 00:56:45,002
'And the low-riding Lambo
started to struggle.'

1005
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,602
Oh, I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

1006
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,122
Supercar coming through!

1007
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:53,002
Yeah-heh-heh-heh!

1008
00:56:53,002 --> 00:56:55,082
Oh! It was going so good.

1009
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:01,522
'Pushing to open up a lead...'

1010
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:02,682
Whoa!

1011
00:57:02,682 --> 00:57:06,162
'..keeping the hammer down was
becoming more and more treacherous.'

1012
00:57:06,162 --> 00:57:08,602
This is a rally stage!

1013
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:09,682
Whoa!

1014
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:15,162
'Now, since Chris had already bent the rules,

1015
00:57:15,162 --> 00:57:18,042
'it seemed only fair to break
out my secret weapon.'

1016
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,882
All right, back in the game.

1017
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:26,202
At least I have a fighting chance.

1018
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:30,122
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1019
00:57:30,122 --> 00:57:33,962
'And, with the snow chains on, I
soon had the Porsche in my sights.'

1020
00:57:35,402 --> 00:57:36,602
Woohoo!

1021
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:39,922
You ain't getting away now, Harris.
I got your number!

1022
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:44,602
There he is! Come on, Porsche!

1023
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:46,842
'At the final stage, we were neck-and-neck.

1024
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:48,282
'But with no way past...'

1025
00:57:48,282 --> 00:57:49,642
Here we go, here we go.

1026
00:57:49,642 --> 00:57:51,762
'..to stand any chance of winning,

1027
00:57:51,762 --> 00:57:54,402
'I decided to take a different
line through the forest

1028
00:57:54,402 --> 00:57:56,682
'in a sprint to the finish.'

1029
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,322
Harris wants this one bad.

1030
00:57:58,322 --> 00:58:00,362
That 43 seconds?

1031
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:02,682
That's driving him crazy, I can tell.

1032
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:07,162
Where is he?! Come on, Porsche!

1033
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:09,962
'Two truly incredible supercars.

1034
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:13,602
'But only one winner.'

1035
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,122
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1036
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,562
Yeah!

1037
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:20,762
I've won!

1038
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:26,122
Oh! There's Harris!

1039
00:58:32,682 --> 00:58:34,882
Oh, you got me.

1040
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:36,242
You got me.

1041
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:37,682
Congratulations.

1042
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:40,362
- How fun was that?!
- Amazing! - Huh?

1043
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:45,402
We just all the way up a
mountain in two supercars!

1044
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,762
Two sup...

1045
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:50,482
Well, in one supercar and one SUPER car.

1046
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:52,722
I mean, super competent.

1047
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:55,602
- It's a supercar!
- It's a great car. - Come on.

1048
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:57,802
We can go round and round on
this, I'm not going to stop.

1049
00:58:57,802 --> 00:59:01,722
Cos you know it's not. It is a SUPER
car, but it's not a supercar.

1050
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:06,762
Now, was that great? How great was that?

1051
00:59:06,762 --> 00:59:08,362
That was mega.

1052
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:10,922
So jealous. So jealous.

1053
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,642
You drove up a ski slope.

1054
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:14,442
Yeah. Yeah.

1055
00:59:14,442 --> 00:59:16,642
It's ridiculous that these
cars managed to do that.

1056
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:19,002
I knew they were good, I didn't
know they were that good.

1057
00:59:19,002 --> 00:59:20,922
Yeah, neither did I. That was so much fun.

1058
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:23,882
That might be the most fun
I have ever had in a car.

1059
00:59:23,882 --> 00:59:25,322
And you know how Lamborghini's

1060
00:59:25,322 --> 00:59:28,042
- building that new four-wheel-drive thing?
- Yeah, the Urus.

1061
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:30,162
Yeah, well, they don't need
to build an off-roader,

1062
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:31,762
cos they have a great one right here.

1063
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:33,842
All right, Chris, we know
if you had to pick one,

1064
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:35,282
you'd take the Porsche, right?

1065
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:38,082
- It's motoring perfection. It does EVERYTHING.
- OK.

1066
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:40,842
Matt, hand on heart time,
between the three of us -

1067
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:43,282
if you had to go for the
Porsche or the Huracan,

1068
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:44,482
what's it going to be?

1069
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:45,722
Oh, well, the Huracan,

1070
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:50,882
it's so theatrical and it has a
spectacular motor. It is just...

1071
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:53,162
the Porsche for me too, I think. LAUGHTER

1072
00:59:53,162 --> 00:59:55,722
Yeah, I would say. It does everything.

1073
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:58,202
And you can... It has back
seats, I can put the kids in it.

1074
00:59:58,202 --> 00:59:59,882
You can do whatever you want with it.

1075
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:02,122
- It IS an all-season supercar.
- Yes!

1076
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:04,802
- OK? Supercar.
- Yes! - Happy? - Yes.

1077
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:09,002
All right, on next week's
show, the Aston Martin DB11.

1078
01:00:09,002 --> 01:00:11,482
And motorsport, Caribbean style.

1079
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,842
No, no, no, that's Caribbean-STYLEY.

1080
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:18,362
- See - you then. Good night!
- Good night!
