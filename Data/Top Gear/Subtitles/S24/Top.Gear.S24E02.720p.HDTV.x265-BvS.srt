00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,440
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,120
Tonight, we've got Porsche vs Lamborghini.

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,239
And Chris Harris vs a large wall.

4
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,640
But we begin with Alfa Romeo.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,199
Back in the '60s, Alfa created cars like this, the GTA,

6
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:45,000
that were genuine world-beaters - fast, cutting edge and brilliant.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,120
The trouble is since those heady times,

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,479
the Alfa story has been one of disappointment,

9
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,879
false dawn and disappointment.

10
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,199
But now there's a new Alfa that finally promises

11
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,279
to bring back the good old days.

12
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:09,239
This is the Alfa Romeo Giulia and, like any good Alfa, it's a looker.

13
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,280
But, like no Alfa four-door in a very long time,

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,000
the Giulia is rear-wheel drive and under the bonnet

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,879
of this ã59,000 Quadrifoglio version

16
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:25,200
is a twin turbo V6, making over 500hp.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,640
Exciting headlines, but, come on, this is Alfa.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,279
It can't possibly live up to the promise...can it?

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,040
Oh, yes, it can!

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,800
This thing is mighty...

21
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,040
..in just about every area.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,440
But I've got to start with that engine.

23
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:04,840
It's effectively a Ferrari V8 with two cylinders lopped off the front.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,439
So, what you have is an Alfa Romeo saloon powered by a Ferrari engine.

25
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,160
How cool is that?

26
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,600
And then there's the way it works.

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,679
It does an incredible impression of a normally aspirated engine.

28
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:26,679
At the top where most turbo engines kind of run out of puff,

29
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,920
this one keeps going.

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,559
That V6 is a fraud in the most perfect way.

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
It's so fast!

32
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,999
But there's no point having all that power

33
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,839
and torque if the chassis can't cope.

34
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,959
And that's the genius of this car - the chassis can cope.

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
There's so much grip on these roads,

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,679
you can just fire it into turns at unbelievable speed.

37
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,640
And the whole thing just feels so composed.

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,239
That's the word - composed.

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,279
They've even done serious things, like weight saving.

40
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:26,040
Large areas of the bodywork are made from carbon fibre.

41
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,200
Most of the interior is covered in the stuff.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,679
And what isn't carbon fibre is aluminium. It's all very convincing.

43
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:38,679
And then there's where you sit.

44
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,600
Italy has spent decades perfecting the art

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,160
of the awful driving position.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,640
It's a matter of national pride, but somehow they've managed

47
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,760
to forget it all with this car because these seats are perfect.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
This steering wheel is in just the right place.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,119
I can only assume that, at some point in the early '70s,

50
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:06,559
all the Alfa engineers that knew about making a car fun to drive

51
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,119
got accidentally locked in a store cupboard

52
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:14,320
and that at some point last year, Alfa found the key.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,400
All those years spent reworking flabby front-wheel drive Fiats,

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,800
all those disappointments we've endured -

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,999
at last, this Giulia is the real deal.

56
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,079
I can't believe this is happening.

57
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,280
This is one of the best moments of my year so far. Ha-ha!

58
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,640
And I know this is the bit where I'm supposed to reveal the big "but" -

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,319
to conclude that, yes, the Giulia is interesting,

60
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,999
but still basically rubbish.

61
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,160
But it isn't.

62
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,679
It isn't rubbish at all. It's magnificent!

63
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:12,439
And that, ironically, is the problem.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Now Alfa's finally created a car capable of mixing it

65
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,280
with the best in the world, it's going to have to...

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,040
Well, you can see where this is going.

67
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,400
That is the BMW M3.

68
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:39,439
The sort of car unlikely to be amused

69
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,800
by some pretty-faced Italian muscling in on its patch.

70
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,840
Oh, no, you don't, Wolfgang!

71
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:03,360
The M3 really is the defining super saloon of our era.

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,679
It's a spectacular car and I adore it, I really do.

73
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,199
This thing really can live with it.

74
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,400
I've got more power, I've got more torque, I've got less weight.

75
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,920
What's not to love?

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,480
This Alfa is all over this BMW, whether he likes it or not!

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
Ooh-ah! Thug!

78
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,800
He may have a bit more lowdown punch

79
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,679
and his interior plastics may be a bit better.

80
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,600
Look, this arm rest, that could come off at any point,

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,800
but I know which car I'd rather be in right now and it's not the M3.

82
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,400
I can't believe I'm saying that, but it's not the M3.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,199
I'm going sideways in a 500hp Alfa Romeo!

84
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,679
And that's a beautiful thing!

85
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,400
You can slide this car anywhere you want.

86
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,319
Wow!

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,280
And just look what happens when you get it onto the straight.

88
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,679
0-100mph in 8.2 seconds

89
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,879
and 190mph flat out.

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,360
God, this thing is fast!

91
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,199
So, and I almost can't believe I'm finally saying this,

92
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,920
Alfa's done it - built a super saloon to beat the very best.

93
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
It's like England finally winning the World Cup -

94
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,999
a day many had hoped for, but, in their heart of hearts,

95
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,920
never believed could really happen.

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,079
- Rory, what are you doing?
- Well, I couldn't help but hear you saying...

97
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,879
Stop there! That you could slide this car anywhere you want.

98
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,679
Well, I thought you might want to prove it.

99
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,239
So, you want me to skid sideways through that?

100
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,199
Exactly.

101
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,119
- What's it made of?
- It's a frangible material.

102
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,800
- What, so it's made of almonds?
- No, it's frangible.

103
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,480
What does that mean?

104
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,720
I don't actually know.

105
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,239
Right, my comprehensive review being a little high-brow for some,

106
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,520
my childish colleague would now have me put the Alfa sideways

107
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,199
through a hole in a wall.

108
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,800
OK, come on, Giulia.

109
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,319
We've made a boast.

110
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,160
I know you weren't involved, but I've made a boast to Mr Reid.

111
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,120
You've got to help me out now. Don't let me down.

112
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
And frangible, it turns out, has nothing to do with almonds.

113
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,079
It means fragile.

114
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:45,120
Apparently.

115
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
This feels very, very wrong.

116
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,400
Rory, why are you in an umpire's chair

117
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,599
Please don't question the umpire, Chris.

118
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,719
- You're so childish.
- Bring on the wall!

119
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,520
There is no way on earth he's going to do this.

120
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:19,240
Everything in my brain is saying, "Don't drive at the big grey wall."

121
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,520
That wasn't good. Big damage to the car, big damage to the car.

122
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,280
So, not that frangible.

123
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,120
I thought you said you could drift this anywhere.

124
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
You seen the windscreen?

125
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,800
That went really well!

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,160
(God!)

127
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
What do you think went wrong, mate?

128
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,880
What a mess!

129
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,000
Disaster!

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,520
- I want to do it again.
- You want to do it again?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,479
Set it up. I'm not giving up.

132
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,679
'Honestly, I was feeling about as wounded as the poor Giulia.'

133
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,800
I've got to get this right. I can do this. We can do this!

134
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,439
'So, with the wall rebuilt, Chris lined up for another attempt.'

135
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,319
Come on! Come on, Giulia!

136
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,199
Bring on the wall!

137
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,280
Already, stop saying that.

138
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
This is going to go so horribly wrong.

139
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,079
'And this time, he would try a slightly different line.'

140
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,359
No, that's not worked, either.

141
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:50,359
Yeah.

142
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,839
Mate, you went through the wall,

143
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,000
just not quite in the shape of the Giulia.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
- Do you understand the concept we're working towards here?
- Set it up.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,959
- I'm not giving up.
- I think the car can do it.

146
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,520
'OK, Harris was running out of time,

147
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,439
'but somehow still confident he could do it before the day was out.'

148
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,160
- Bring on the wall!
- Shut up, Rory!

149
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,040
'My tenacious colleague set off to make it third time lucky.'

150
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,240
Drift the car through the wall.

151
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
'Then again...'

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,280
I accept, as Chris Harris, that my statement

153
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,439
that I could drift it through anything was, on reflection, unwise.

154
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,520
I want to do one more.

155
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,359
As much as I want to see him fail,

156
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,160
there's a small part of me that wants him to succeed.

157
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,839
'And so day became night and with supplies of frangible wall

158
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,359
'now critically low, Chris settled himself for one final attempt.'

159
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:07,280
I just want to get this done. I want to succeed.

160
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,319
'Oh, just one more thing.'

161
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,160
Bring on the wall!

162
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
Here we go, then.

163
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,040
Come on, Chris.

164
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,559
Come on!

165
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,079
Is this really going to work? I can't even see what I'm doing here.

166
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,599
I think you can do this. Come on, mate.

167
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,280
- Whoa-hoa-hoa!
- YES!

168
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,319
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa! YEAH!

169
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,280
Yes, baby!

170
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,160
Oh, my God! I can't believe we did it!

171
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,000
I always knew you could do it. I always knew you could do it.

172
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,400
Oh, yes! Celebratory doughnuts!

173
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,439
- Nailed it! Shame about the windscreen, though.
- Yeah, I know.

174
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,640
Look, no-one felt worse about damaging the Alfa than me.

175
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,880
- But, look, I fixed it.
- You did, yeah, I see that.

176
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,839
I also see that you moved the steering wheel

177
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,120
to the other side of the car.

178
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,280
Oh, yeah, you noticed that. I'm sorry.

179
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,559
And, Rory, didn't you just steal that wall idea

180
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,800
from that BMW ad a few years ago?

181
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,040
You know that that was all CGI in that ad, right?

182
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,319
No.

183
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,520
You could have killed Chris!

184
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,679
You can't just jump to the front of the queue like that.

185
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,199
- Oi!
- Hey, I'm kidding.

186
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,240
Now it's time to put the Giulia around our test track...

187
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,920
and you know what that means.

188
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,920
It's The Stig!

189
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,359
Here we go, then, off the line, a bit of launch control.

190
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:05,400
This is so powerful, this car - over 500hp, carbon fibre bodywork.

191
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,319
Stig getting very lively into the first turn, there.

192
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,120
The little straight down to Chicago really is...

193
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,839
Look, he's managing the throttle there, oversteer everywhere,

194
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,839
using the systems. They'd have been on in race mode here now.

195
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,800
Through Chicago, bit of understeer.

196
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,599
Gets on the gas, neutralises it.

197
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,719
Look at the back end now.

198
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,599
Well controlled by our white-suited friend.

199
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Into the braking zone, into Hammerhead.

200
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,599
Again, look at those brake rotors glowing red hot, carbon ceramics.

201
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,400
Round Hammerhead again.

202
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,199
He starts with understeer then he neutralises it with the gas.

203
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,839
It starts to suggest oversteer.

204
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,719
Now, the long straight back down towards the Follow Through.

205
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:46,400
That's quick through there. Follow Through... Oh, that was fast.

206
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,079
All the way down, now, to Second-to-Last.

207
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,199
Look at the front brake rotor glowing.

208
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,000
There it is. Look at that, red hot, even on a nice sunny day.

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,880
Now through Second-to-Last... Oh, oversteer, that's just showboating.

210
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,640
And Gambon...and over the line.

211
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,079
CHEERING

212
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,719
So, the fastest four-door ever to lap our track I believe

213
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:11,559
was the Mitsubishi Evo VIII, at 1:24.8.

214
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,479
- So...
- We have a new fastest saloon car.

215
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,640
- Ooh.
- Cos the Alfa did it in...

216
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,599
1:21.4.

217
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,479
- Ooh.
- Nice, very nice.

218
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,479
Not only that, same day, same conditions,

219
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:31,000
we lapped the new M3...

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
and it was slower, two tenths slower.

221
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,240
So the Alfa is officially faster than an M3!

222
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,280
- That's great news for them.
- That is...

223
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,280
- Well done, Alfa.
- That's the benchmark, right?

224
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,920
Wow. There you have it.

225
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,800
Great stuff.

226
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,000
The European exotica doesn't end there, because we are now

227
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,280
a week closer to me driving the new Renault Twingo!

228
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,839
Yeah.

229
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,000
Can't wait for that(!)

230
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,839
But now, it's time to welcome this week's guest.

231
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,000
He stars in Broadchurch

232
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,439
and was once voted the planet's greenest celebrity -

233
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,839
this should be interesting. LAUGHTER

234
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,760
Please welcome - David Tennant!

235
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,880
- Hello!
- Hey!

236
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,559
- Welcome, welcome.
- Nice to be here.
- Have a seat.

237
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
All right. David, thanks for joining us.

238
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,679
- Pleasure, nice place you got here.
- Thanks. Thank you.

239
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,400
Now, how did you become the planet's greenest celebrity?

240
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,559
Tell us about that.

241
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,040
I have absolutely no idea.

242
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:48,240
The only reason I can fathom is that I drive a Prius.

243
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,599
That seems to be it.

244
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,160
But now, because I have too many children,

245
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,319
we had to get, like, a big, old van as well.

246
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,640
So I now have a Mercedes Viano to get everyone in the back,

247
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,040
and that's a big diesel-guzzling monster,

248
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,959
so I think I've lost any prizes that I ever won.

249
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
But you got rid of the Prius?

250
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,839
- We've still got the Prius as well.
- MATT SIGHS

251
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,159
What's wrong with a Prius?!

252
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,559
Look, I'm on David's side.

253
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,960
Everybody is always saying the Prius is this horrible car,

254
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,680
it's disgusting to drive, but I think it deserves

255
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,280
a little bit of respect, OK?

256
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Because it represents the biggest evolutionary step in the history

257
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,319
of the automotive industry, OK?

258
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,319
- What?!
- Without the Prius we wouldn't have the LaFerrari,

259
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,960
- the P1...
- Oh, come on.
- ..or the Porsche 918.

260
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,639
It's time to show the Prius respect. Who likes the Prius?

261
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,480
- Thank you(!) OK, great...
- The silence is deafening.

262
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,919
The single greatest step in automotive technology?

263
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,079
The disc brake? The seat belt?

264
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,399
Enough of that.

265
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,480
And in honour of the world's greenest celebrity...

266
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
- Thanks!
- FORMER greenest celebrity.
- Yeah.

267
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,760
..we've filled the studio with a selection of sustainable stuff.

268
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,200
Take a look at this.

269
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
It's the Jaguar I-Pace. Look at this.

270
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,960
It's an SUV, but it's Jaguar's answer to the Tesla Model X.

271
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,280
It wasn't so long ago that the Jag brand image

272
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,800
was a little bit Prescott, shall we say,

273
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,960
but this thing is more Silicon Valley.

274
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,280
Forget the Prius, David,

275
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,639
this is the electric family car that you want.

276
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,079
Are you going to give me one? Is that my prize?

277
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,119
There's one problem, though, Rory, isn't there?

278
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,800
- It's not real.
- Of course it's real.

279
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,680
OK, it's not real YET, but it will be ready for production

280
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,599
by the end of the year and it will probably cost about 60 grand.

281
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,839
Guaranteed hit.

282
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,040
Why are you so resistant to the idea of electric cars?

283
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,440
Well, I'm not resistant.

284
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
"Because it's all about putting a nozzle in a hole

285
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
"and filling it up!"

286
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,200
Matt, I've got something amazing for you.

287
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,319
It comes from Mercedes, it's called the Maybach G650 Landaulet.

288
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,440
And here it is, check this thing out.

289
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,760
- Ooh.
- Nice, huh?
- That is revolting.

290
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,559
It's not revolting, it's decadent! According to Mercedes...

291
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,480
Decadent? For Lego.

292
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,559
They say it demonstrates...

293
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,359
"That the definition of unique luxury can be taken to a new level."

294
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,919
Yeah, they're not wrong, Rory(!)

295
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,159
It's got a massive V12 engine, massive ground clearance,

296
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,159
two thrones in the back.

297
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,399
It's an off-roader that's also a limo that's also a convertible -

298
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,520
what box is that not ticking?

299
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,800
The one that reads "The buyer is of sound mind".

300
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:32,399
It looks like a Suzuki Vitara slammed into...

301
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,720
Mr T's jewellery box.

302
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
You're saying that like it's a bad thing.

303
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,760
- Now, you've been around our track before back in the days...
- Yes.

304
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,319
- ..of the humble Lacetti.
- Yes.

305
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,680
But this time you're taking on

306
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,079
- the fearsome, fire-breathing Toyota GT 86.
- Yeah.

307
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,559
You had some fun training with Chris Harris, what was he like?

308
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,960
- I mean, to be fair...

309
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,200
I think driving lessons do bring out

310
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,319
the worst in people. It's a strangely stress-making time.

311
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,240
- Didn't you once play a driving instructor?
- I did, yes.

312
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,800
I assume you researched the part.

313
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,480
What did you learn about your average driving instructor?

314
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,559
I think it's quite a miserable life.

315
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,960
They do a very difficult job for relatively low remuneration.

316
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,440
- So they're miserable?
- Yeah.

317
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,480
That's like our guy, here!

318
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,359
- All right, let's see how you did.
- Yeah.
- Let's take a look.

319
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,919
As a Doctor Who fan, I'm looking for a bit more

320
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,119
Tom Baker than Peter Davison here, OK?

321
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,559
Don't diss the Davison.

322
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,559
First gear, please.

323
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,800
- OK.
- Go.

324
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,040
- Third gear, third gear!
- Third gear!
- Brake, brake!

325
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,639
- Woohoo!
- Left, we're going to make it!

326
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,599
Waaa!

327
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,839
Flat out, flat out, come on!

328
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,480
It's flat out, what do you want?

329
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,680
- Second gear.
- Second gear? Oh, now you tell me.

330
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,760
Put your hands on the wheel, what are you doing?

331
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,000
- Through here. I don't like this at all.
- It's nippy!

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,280
That was nearly death.

333
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,760
Having fun yet?

334
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,399
Over there... No. Over here.

335
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,720
Now, we've got to find our route between the grass

336
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,040
and the white thing. I'm just going to close my eyes.

337
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,159
Woo-hoo-hoo!

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,480
OK, up to the right-hand side.

339
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,879
Good, good, good.

340
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,079
Brake at the hundred, brake at the hundred.

341
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,240
- Brake hard, brake hard!
- Braking, braking.

342
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,639
- Braking, sir, braking.
- Brake, brake, brake - or we're off!

343
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,559
Brake or we're off.

344
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,000
- Beautiful.
- SO nearly.
- Come on, that was wonderful, wasn't it?

345
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,319
- Second gear, second gear.
- Oh,
- BLEEP.

346
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,200
You nearly-killing-me horrible person, you.

347
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
Hoo-hoo!

348
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,800
God, stop, stop.

349
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,319
Did you enjoy that?

350
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,879
I had a great time.

351
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,240
- How was it?
- Loved it.

352
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,680
I think you have got to start being nicer to the guests.

353
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,319
I'll try, as long as they don't scare me so much.

354
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,040
- You've got to chill out a bit, I had a great time.
- I'm sure you did.

355
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,919
- He didn't look scared.
- No.
- He looked fine.

356
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,079
Why were you so scared?

357
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,559
Because it felt like he was trying to hurt me and the car.

358
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,000
OK, I would like to tell you about a new performance hybrid from Japan.

359
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,800
- The NSX?
- No, way better than the Honda NSX.

360
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,079
It's this.

361
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:38,919
The Komatsu HB365LC-3.

362
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,879
Yeah, Matt, that's a digger.

363
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,760
No, no, no, that is not a digger, OK?

364
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:52,280
That's a tracked excavator. Diggers do this, yeah?

365
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,480
Excavators do this.

366
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,559
And dozers do this.

367
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,919
Anyway, look, this thing is awesome.

368
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,599
36 tonnes, 340 horsepower, it's got a diesel electric hybrid

369
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,599
for a power plant and it is just...

370
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,559
You really, genuinely care about this stuff, don't you?

371
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,800
Of course I do, don't you?

372
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,720
David, back me up, you look like a tracked excavator fan?

373
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,000
- I'm not entirely sure...
- LAUGHTER

374
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,879
..what this is telling us... about your fascinations, Matt.

375
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:29,680
I can be a little grabby.

376
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,040
Another treat for the world's greenest celebrity.

377
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,520
A new all-electric supercar. Comes from Croatia, the Rimac.

378
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,399
It's in our studio. It looks brilliant, and it's fast. 221 mph.

379
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:47,879
There's a motor in each of the wheels so it's four-wheel drive.

380
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,760
It will do 200 miles per charge AND

381
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,159
beat a Bugatti Veyron in a drag race.

382
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,119
- How cool is that?
- What is this big fascination with electric cars?

383
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,240
Did you lick batteries as a kid?

384
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,000
- Did you?
- The little nine volt ones, yeah.

385
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
- Yeah, a little tingle.
- Get a little tingle.

386
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,000
- You're not supposed to do that.
- No?
- No!

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,720
- That explains a lot.
- It does!

388
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,680
Have you noticed, Rory, every week

389
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,919
there's a new electric super hyper car,

390
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,079
and one that promises it will beat a Bugatti Veyron

391
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,919
- in a straight line?
- That's because they CAN beat Veyrons.

392
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,720
That's the whole point of electric cars.

393
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,680
- What did you say it was called again?
- Rimac.
- Rimac?

394
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,359
Sounds like something you use to remove hair.

395
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,359
From where?

396
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,440
From your...rim. I don't know.

397
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,280
I think it's time to move on at that point.

398
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,919
Fair enough. Come on, Chris.

399
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,200
Your classic convertible supercar -

400
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,480
theatrical, flamboyant,

401
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,800
and according to our producers, pointless.

402
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,520
Great for the two days of the summer when it's warm and dry,

403
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,599
utterly useless for the rest of the icy, wet, cold year.

404
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,639
We said, "Get with the times."

405
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,200
Yes, roofless supercars were once like that,

406
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,520
but the modern breed, you can really use them all year round.

407
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,680
So the producers said, "Prove it."

408
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,119
Matt and I were each told to pick a four-wheel drive

409
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,240
convertible supercar and to report bright and early Monday morning

410
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,040
for a series of tests in...

411
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,119
Las Vegas.

412
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,559
All right, all right, I'm coming.

413
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,359
That's... That wasn't me.

414
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,240
Hey. Ooh, breakfast, nice.

415
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,839
Oh, not breakfast.

416
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,440
Can I...order breakfast? No?

417
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,960
"Welcome to the Four Seasons Supercar Challenge.

418
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,599
"You will now drive from Las Vegas to the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains

419
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,800
"encountering spring, summer, autumn and winter on your way.

420
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,359
"PS - you're late, get a move on." Ooh.

421
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,359
Yo, Harris, get up, we've got to go!

422
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:31,919
Our four season cars were waiting downstairs, and my ace card?

423
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,240
The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder - 5.2 litre V10, 610 horsepower,

424
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,319
all lurking under a body of pure Italian flamboyance.

425
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,960
I put my chips on the Porsche 911 Turbo S.

426
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,000
It might only have a 3.8 litre flat-6,

427
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,200
but trust me, in the real world, this is the fastest car you can buy.

428
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:00,040
Ooh. Whoa, hang on.

429
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,599
This is the supercar challenge, did you not hear the rules?

430
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,240
Bring a supercar.

431
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,520
0-60 in under three seconds, top speed over 200mph -

432
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,359
what's not super about that?

433
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,280
Yeah, but it's a 911.

434
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,319
It's got rear seats, it's a sports car.

435
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't get me wrong, I love 911s, it's a super car...

436
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
but it's not a SUPERCAR.

437
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,200
Coming from the man that's chosen the lifestyle Lamborghini?

438
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,839
What'd you mean? "Lifestyle", what does that mean?

439
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,760
In other words, that's the car for the driver

440
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,119
that doesn't like driving, it's all about image.

441
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,359
No. No, no, no, no, no.

442
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,800
Look at it.

443
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,639
They said don't bring a blue car and don't wear a blue shirt.

444
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:41,720
So let's go drive them.

445
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,040
Cheater.

446
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,879
What do you mean, "cheater"? It's a supercar.

447
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,040
It's not a supercar, Chris.

448
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,079
Well, this wasn't going to be settled in the car park.

449
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,159
Time to hit the road.

450
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,839
Yeah.

451
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,800
I chose this car because this is a proper supercar.

452
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,399
It's low, it's pointy, it's noisy, it's impractical.

453
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,599
But that's what you want in a supercar,

454
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,480
you want that over-the-top styling,

455
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,879
you want that larger-than-life superhero feel.

456
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,119
Inside that Lamborghini, Matthew will be giving a detailed,

457
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,639
impassioned explanation as to why he's driving a supercar.

458
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,680
I don't need to bother with that.

459
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,040
I can just tell you the following.

460
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,359
This is faster to 60, it uses less fuel,

461
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,119
it's bigger, more practical,

462
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,760
it costs less money, it's all-round better.

463
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,159
AND, best of all, I don't look like a part-time pornographer

464
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:56,399
when I drive it.

465
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,680
ENGINE ROARS

466
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,839
Out of the city limits, we began our epic journey.

467
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,639
From the intense heat

468
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,159
of California's vast desert plains

469
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,359
to the brutal sub-zero snow and ice

470
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,480
of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

471
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,119
Four seasons, 400 miles.

472
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,960
And for this challenge, the Lamborghini really is

473
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,359
in a class of its own.

474
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,919
The Huracan is the last of the naturally aspirated supercars.

475
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,839
The McLaren 650S - turbo-charged.

476
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,319
Ferrari 488 - turbo-charged.

477
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,879
The 911 Turbo, um...turbo-charged.

478
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,319
This is a dying breed.

479
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,079
And that's because, these days, Turbo is the way to go.

480
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,839
The 911 has a higher top speed than the Lambo.

481
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,720
And according to Porsche, it's 2.8 second 0-60 is

482
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,280
half a second quicker, too.

483
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,159
But the best bit...

484
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,520
Every time you actually do it - it's faster.

485
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,599
I've done it in 2.6 in this car. It's outrageous!

486
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,480
Sounds so nice.

487
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,839
ENGINE GROWLS

488
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,639
Supercars are about presence.

489
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:21,440
They're about that image.

490
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,079
That feeling, you know?

491
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,480
They're about posters on a bedroom wall.

492
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,680
The 911 just doesn't give you that.

493
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,599
The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder,

494
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,680
like walking into a room and shouting,

495
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,399
"HELLO, I'M HERE!"

496
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,200
We were told to report to a local race track

497
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,800
for our first four seasons challenge,

498
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,879
but before we got going, we went out for a few

499
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:51,520
sighting laps, to really get to know our cars.

500
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,760
Huh, it would have been rude not to.

501
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,040
It cheats physics, this thing.

502
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,639
It shouldn't be able to do what it does.

503
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,639
Cos the engine is in the wrong place,

504
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,919
so it should understeer horribly, but it doesn't.

505
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
It has got mega-traction. The engine is an animal,

506
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,159
it just pulls and pulls and pulls from no revs whatsoever.

507
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,879
It's just a fantastic motor vehicle.

508
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,760
Harris calls this "The lifestyle Lambo".

509
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,399
It's not a bad lifestyle, if you ask me!

510
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,720
It does understeer a little bit.

511
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,760
But that's OK. Let's you find the limit without crashing...

512
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,280
and this car is all about the drive train.

513
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,559
The double-clutch gearbox is super-fast.

514
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,240
The motor is just fantastic!

515
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,440
It's a bit faster in a straight line than I expected, Matthew.

516
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,200
Soon though, we were told to pull over.

517
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,040
It was time for our challenge.

518
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,040
"Welcome to Spring Mountain Raceway." See what they did there?

519
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,639
- I do, yes.
- Four seasons.
- Very clever! Clever!

520
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,919
- "Spring is a season of unpredictable weather..."
- Yeah.

521
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,159
I can tell,

522
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,200
- it looks like it's going to rain any minute.
- Mm.

523
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,559
"..When a fast-action roof is essential. Time for a one-lap race.

524
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,399
"You must start with your roof down

525
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,839
"and finish with your roof up.

526
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,639
"First to cross the line wins."

527
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:30,159
OK.

528
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,200
Two supercars.

529
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,599
Well, one supercar. One lap of the track.

530
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,520
First one past the chequered flag with their roof up - wins.

531
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,520
OK! Thrust mode possible. I'm ready.

532
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Are you ready? I'm ready!

533
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,680
This car is violent off the line.

534
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,839
Going to get my roof down towards the end of the race.

535
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,240
I bet that's what he'll do. OK, here we go!

536
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,079
Three, two, one... Go!

537
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,200
- There he goes!
- Oh!

538
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,680
She comes out of the hole good!

539
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
An impressive start, but I had a different plan.

540
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Launch control... Go!

541
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,119
That's outrageous! I'm done.

542
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,480
I don't have to worry about this any more.

543
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,079
OK...he's got a different strategy. He's putting

544
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,200
his top up there.

545
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,440
The Lamborghini roof goes up in 17 seconds.

546
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,280
Annoyingly, Harris's Porsche does it in just 13.

547
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,639
I've got to get a little bit of an advantage here, because

548
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,839
he's got a four-second-quicker roof mechanism.

549
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,079
But just as I was building my lead...

550
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,240
..spring sprung!

551
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,359
Oh, what is that?

552
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,520
I can see him.

553
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,760
Roof down, peacocking around!

554
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,560
Oh, there he is.

555
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,160
- Come on, Lambo!
- They've wet the track!

556
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,919
That's so slippery!

557
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,879
There he is! He's still got to put his roof up.

558
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
HE LAUGHS

559
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
And to do that, Matt had to slow down to

560
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,680
a steady 31.

561
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Come on, baby! Where is it? Where is it?

562
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,879
Not so super now!

563
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,839
Hello, sweetheart!

564
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,519
- Yes!
- He got me!

565
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,479
So, what do we think, then?

566
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,919
Does you being beaten make me a supercar?

567
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,640
Or am I not a supercar?

568
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,280
Well, this is a test of practicality.

569
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
So your sports car has a very practical four-seconds-quicker

570
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,680
roof mechanism.

571
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,999
A supercar, which this is, and that is not, is not supposed

572
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:11,560
to be practical at all. Which this isn't. At all!

573
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,160
This was going to be a long trip!

574
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,080
And as we moved on to the next challenge...

575
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,160
Fantastic out here. This is America, baby!

576
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,240
- Cowboy country!
- It is absolutely stunning!

577
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,439
Even the incredible scenery was bringing out

578
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,680
our competitive streak.

579
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,160
- Big.
- Big and vertiginous!

580
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,519
- Now, there's a word!
- Yes.

581
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,560
You are quite the sesquipedalian!

582
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,200
One hour later, we arrived at our

583
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,439
next challenge location and the signs didn't look good!

584
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,200
Death Valley is one of the hottest places on Earth.

585
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,240
And before we went any further,

586
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,319
Harris insisted on taking supplies.

587
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm taking no chances with this Death Valley thing.

588
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,160
I've got water, snacks, a shovel

589
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,039
- and spare radio batteries, should they run out.
- Ah-ha.

590
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,200
For me, to survive this potentially deadly crossing,

591
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,120
I'm teaming a cinnamon latte with a poppy seed blueberry muffin.

592
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,479
HE SNIFFS

593
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,039
Oh, smells so nice!

594
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,760
It's just embarrassing!

595
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,640
Are you sure you don't want a muffin?

596
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,919
I don't need a muffin. I need water and practicality.

597
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:38,319
What are you going to do with that shovel?

598
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:39,959
Hey!

599
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,959
Thank you!

600
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,919
Happy trails.

601
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:50,919
- I'll take that.
- That's a cowboy!

602
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,439
"Welcome to summer. The holiday season.

603
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:56,519
"Time to take a vacation from your car.

604
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:59,359
"You will now switch vehicles."

605
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,600
- Did you organise this?
- No.
- "Then drive across Death Valley."

606
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,760
- This is a stitch-up, isn't it?
- OK, yeah.

607
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,120
- I'll take the muffin.
- I'll keep the muffin.

608
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,039
Thanks for stocking my car up with goodies!

609
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,919
- Hey, Chris...
- Yes.

610
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,959
These chips that you bought,

611
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,200
they are delicious! Thank you.

612
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,319
Leave those alone!

613
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,519
Tasty snacks aside, though,

614
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,359
life in Harris's Porsche was definitely not as special.

615
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,519
Quite a bit different than the Lambo.

616
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,039
It feels, really, a lot taller.

617
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,359
It feels definitely more practical.

618
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,080
What's it like being in the peacock?

619
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,280
The engine is a masterpiece.

620
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,560
8,500 RPM with a lovely step at about 4.5.

621
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,439
Buffeting, not very good.

622
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:55,760
I'm a very, very short man, as my co-host is very keen to point out,

623
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,800
and I'm pretty much in the airflow here.

624
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,600
If you were the size of a normal human being,

625
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,760
this wouldn't work!

626
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,519
Now, come on! Tell me the truth...

627
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,200
- You like that car!
- I mean, the sense of theatre, if you

628
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,999
wanted to feel that you'd bought something special

629
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:19,479
with your money, I have to say, it's more special

630
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:22,359
than the Porsche. But it's just lacking

631
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:24,200
ANY kind of sense.

632
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,319
But that's the whole point.

633
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:30,080
It's not supposed to make sense! It's a supercar.

634
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,720
Here we go again!

635
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,919
Summer was getting us nowhere.

636
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:38,120
So, for the rest of the challenge,

637
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,039
we agreed to just enjoy the cars and the view.

638
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,999
Look at this! This is special.

639
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:48,200
That is some epic scenery right there.

640
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,240
And reaching the foot of the Sierra Nevada, it was time

641
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,039
to deliver our verdicts.

642
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,959
So, what do you think? Huh?

643
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,519
- Well, I think...
- This is your last bottle of water, by the way.

644
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,600
What? Look, if you are a dental hygienist from Florida,

645
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,479
or you keep a Chihuahua,

646
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:09,999
- or you take selfies, I think it is a great car. Great, Matt.
- OK.

647
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:13,959
What about my car? Come on, tell me about my car?

648
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:17,399
Well, that is a nice car. I mean, if you are in the market

649
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:20,600
for a supercar that is the most bland supercar

650
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,120
you can find - that is it.

651
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,800
I'm telling you, that is a bland supercar.

652
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,240
That's a meaningful 50-year marriage.

653
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,200
That's a one-night stand!

654
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,600
We called summer a no-score draw.

655
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,280
And after a long day, the producers had kindly laid on

656
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,999
accommodation in a quaint local village.

657
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,600
Wow, look at this place!

658
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,160
Ever had the feeling you were being watched?

659
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,160
To help us blend in...

660
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,359
..I had a plan!

661
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,839
OK, follow my lead!

662
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,319
Oh, yeah, that should do it,

663
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:25,240
erecting the roof will cover all bases in this situation.

664
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,720
Just put your roof up!

665
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,959
I just erected four seconds faster than you!

666
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,800
'Stop saying erect!'

667
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,280
This is the last place you want to get caught with an erection!

668
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,519
OK, now, what you need

669
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,800
to know about that film - is that when I got my Lambo

670
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,600
back from Harris, it was disgusting!

671
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:01,519
OK! Crumbs on the seats. Chocolate on the wheel.

672
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,160
I am pretty sure you got hummus on the rev needle.

673
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,760
I don't even know how you did that. OK,

674
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,879
- you, my friend, are a pig!
- I'd rather be fast than clean.

675
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:13,879
You know, you can be both, right? I think it says something about the

676
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:17,800
- kind of person you are.
- Work with me, are you a car slob, like me?

677
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,280
Personally, I am not. But I have four kids.

678
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,800
So, my car has a thin layer of raisins and snot at all times.

679
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,720
It's sort of impossible to...manage with anything else.

680
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,919
But you, yourself, are quite clean within the car?

681
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,600
I would like to be, but I have given up

682
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,720
until my children reach, you know, 46, I'm just going to accept

683
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,519
that that is how we're going to live.

684
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,720
I can be dirty, as well, in the car. But unlike you,

685
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,240
I keep the outside of the car pristine.

686
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,399
You have a different attitude towards that, I gather.

687
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:49,319
Well, I just... You know...

688
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,359
Especially driving around in London,

689
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,120
the odd scrape, the odd scratch -

690
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,600
anything that doesn't disable the vehicle...

691
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,080
..I don't think is worth worrying about.

692
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,800
What constitutes a scrape or a scrunch?

693
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,959
Well, there's certainly

694
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:06,039
a panel, that if you drive too fast,

695
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,959
flaps out the black.

696
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,800
But you can kick it back in

697
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,839
and it does for about a week each time.

698
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,319
Are you the kind of person, that when you parallel park

699
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,280
you kind of nudge the car in front a little?

700
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,080
I don't nudge... I am very beady about other

701
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,959
people's cars. But if you are in a multistorey and...

702
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:26,160
you rub against a wall to sneak into that little tight space,

703
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,399
- what's the harm?
- There's a voice inside him now...

704
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:32,120
- Just a bit of paint...
- ..that's crying and screaming about this, he simply can't...

705
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,479
- I can't take it.
- The thought of damaging something!

706
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:36,879
All right, moving on, now you are back on our screens

707
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,439
for a new series of Broadchurch.

708
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:39,919
The final. This is it.

709
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:43,120
I think we should do three and then leave them

710
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,479
wanting more. It's a small town, if there was revolving door

711
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:49,439
of horrendous crimes happening, it would start to get a bit preposterous, so...

712
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:51,879
The writers, I hear they are super, super secretive

713
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,600
about the storylines. Is that true?

714
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,240
Yeah. It's always been...the way.

715
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,600
Anything that is a thriller that has...

716
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,359
elements of plot that you want to hold back,

717
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,399
I think everyone gets it, particularly

718
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:04,839
in this modern era, the idea that someone

719
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:08,039
could misplace an e-mail, or that the Kremlin

720
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,039
could hack into your account.... You know...

721
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:15,680
It means being on the show gets really tiresome.

722
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,919
Because everything gets sent out with a password.

723
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:20,800
One script has one password, another has a different password.

724
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,720
And then the script amendments, that come through the night before

725
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,439
and they are not passwords you choose.

726
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:28,479
They give you a password and that is in a different e-mail, that has a

727
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:30,760
different password that you have to remember from

728
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,120
last week...when they sent out... I just can't keep up.

729
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,800
- It is just impossible.
- If you don't know your lines, you can

730
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,640
- just say, "I didn't get the e-mail..."
- Exactly.
- Beautiful!

731
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,080
I end up being a terrible grumpy old man about it -

732
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,160
and phoning up - "Just send me some paper.

733
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,800
"I can't deal with this!"

734
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,240
All right, are we ready? Because the time has come...

735
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,600
- Is this it?
- ..to see how you did around the track,

736
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,080
on your own, in the GT86

737
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,479
I'm very optimistic. I fear crashing disappointment.

738
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:58,879
- Before we do, there is something we need to discuss, I think.
- Yeah.

739
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:01,439
- After I left you at the end of our coaching session...
- Yeah.

740
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:04,479
..you agreed you'd then go off and do

741
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,280
your timed laps. But between those two events, I gather you went for

742
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,120
a little bit of extra training on your own.

743
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,399
- A bit of a sneaky extra training lap...?
- Well...!

744
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,439
What happened?

745
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:18,640
I... I just... I kind of think you've got to go for it.

746
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,080
You've got to learn what the car can take.

747
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,720
You've got to push your boundaries.

748
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,080
And sometimes you slightly overstep your boundaries.

749
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,359
Can we see the image, please?

750
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:30,560
Oh, no!

751
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,200
Anything that doesn't disable the vehicle...

752
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,839
..doesn't count as an accident!

753
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,919
We've only had that car two weeks.

754
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:43,680
And now it's got character!

755
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
What did you hit? There is NOTHING out there!

756
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,080
It was one of those sort of foam signs

757
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,839
- that tell you when to turn left.
- LAUGHTER

758
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,039
Oh, now I can talk to you about foam that damages cars.

759
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,479
- It really can. I can sympathise there.
- Yeah, you see? You see?

760
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:57,680
- I can sympathise.
- Yeah, yeah.

761
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,600
- OK, but you did manage to record a timed lap, yeah?
- Yeah.

762
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,640
- Oh, yeah, that was in training.
- OK.

763
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,160
- Well, let's take a look at that then.
- Let's have a look.

764
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,760
- Here we go, off the line.
- Oh, poor.
- Average at best.
- Ugh!

765
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,879
Look at the massive dent!

766
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:13,120
Come on! Come on! Oh, that was nasty.

767
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,839
Oh, you look very serious.

768
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,640
We're flying, we're flying.

769
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,560
A really good view of the damage caused to the panel again.

770
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,080
Lovely, isn't it? Looking good.

771
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,240
The line's not too bad.

772
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,879
We're on FIRE!

773
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:27,479
OK, braking hard into Chicago.

774
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:30,120
Braked a bit early, I think. What's it like through here?

775
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,280
Bit of understeer, and then a massive clog of throttle

776
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,999
- which triggered the ESP and slowed you down.
- Oh, shut up!

777
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,800
And the trick is to use the whole circuit, not half the circuit, OK?

778
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,120
Over to the right-hand side. Here are your braking boards.

779
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,919
- Oh, look, there's one you didn't hit!
- Yeah.

780
00:45:42,919 --> 00:45:44,999
Now we go left, right round Hammerhead.

781
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:46,879
Let's see your line through Hammerhead.

782
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,680
Not... Ooh, again, triggered the ESP.

783
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,800
Oh, yes!

784
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,399
Here we go.

785
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:53,640
COME ON! GO FASTER!

786
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,519
Nice! Nice!

787
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:02,999
And now flat-out through the Follow Through.

788
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:06,999
If you hadn't had ESP there, you would have died.

789
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:08,399
Well, I did - it's fine.

790
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,560
Braking hard, braking hard into second to last.

791
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,959
Very good line through there.

792
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:13,600
Ooh, we did it, we did it, we did it.

793
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,839
Second gear, come on.

794
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:15,879
Through Gambon...

795
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:18,999
..and over the line.

796
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:24,280
All right. That was pretty good. How do you feel? What do you think?

797
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,640
Yeah. You know.

798
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,760
- I think you did all right.
- Thank you.
- I do.

799
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,160
I was feeling quietly confident

800
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,039
- until I heard your barrage of criticism.
- Well, no... I was just...

801
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,800
- You set yourself high standards, I want to help you to get there.
- OK.

802
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,359
And I'm just glad that you didn't apply any more damage to our car.

803
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:40,999
- One little dent.
- What do you think? How do you think he did?

804
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,560
I think that was quite quick. I think it was daring in places.

805
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,240
He scrubbed off some speed. But I'm-I'm confident.

806
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,919
- I think he's done me proud.
- OK!

807
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:52,280
Well, the best time on our board is still Max Whitlock,

808
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,160
the Olympic gold medallist, with 1:39.5.

809
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,200
You ever see his flic-flacs? LAUGHTER

810
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,080
- So graceful, the extension that guy... Anyway.
- You haven't seen...

811
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,680
- You haven't seen my flic-flacs.
- I have your time right here.

812
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,680
- Yeah?
- David Tennant, you did it...

813
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,399
- Yeah?
- ..in one minute...

814
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:10,160
Forty...

815
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,039
four, flat.

816
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,760
- Yes!
- Come on!

817
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,919
Huh?

818
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,359
Well done. Really well done.

819
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,600
Second place, I'll take that. I'll take that. Yeah.

820
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,640
- Second quickest.
- Yeah, that's OK.

821
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:30,160
So I think that's congratulations to both of you.

822
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,359
You had a little help from him.

823
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,280
I couldn't have done it without my teacher.

824
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,080
I think you'd have been first without Chris.

825
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,200
- No, I'm kidding.
- I-I... Yeah, I'll take second place. That's all right.

826
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,439
- That's good, that's good.
- I think that's really good.

827
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:44,680
- Ladies and gentlemen, David Tennant!
- Thank you!

828
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,439
Nice to see you again.

829
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:48,839
Thanks for coming.

830
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:50,839
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

831
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:55,160
Now, earlier on, Matt and I had finished the first day

832
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,120
of our big convertible supercar trip in the charming town of Darwin.

833
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,120
And because what happens in Darwin stays in Darwin -

834
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,680
really, that's their motto -

835
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,160
we pick up the story the following morning.

836
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,839
'We got up early, as it was time to leave California's desert plains...'

837
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,080
Ooh, I think we might be about to

838
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,999
enter into a bit of twisty, windy road, Mr Harris.

839
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,919
'..and start our climb into the Sierra Nevada Mountains.'

840
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,800
There is no guard rail.

841
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,839
Look at that, that's a sheer face right there.

842
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,760
You go off there, that's bad.

843
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,680
'We wondered what our next challenge might be.'

844
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,839
Ooh, Smokey the Bear up ahead. Smokey the Bear up ahead.

845
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:47,160
'And with no idea what Matt was on about,

846
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,680
'we came across a policeman waiting with the answer.'

847
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,519
Hello, officer.

848
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:54,240
Oh.

849
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,439
Well, thank you.

850
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,280
"Welcome to fall, a season of tricky road conditions.

851
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,999
"You and your cars will now FALL down this slippery mountain road

852
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,399
"under the power of gravity alone -

853
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:07,999
"no touching the accelerator.

854
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:09,839
"Quickest to the bottom wins."

855
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,519
That sounds like a completely relevant real-world test.

856
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:15,319
This will be fun. I do this with my buddies on the motorcycles.

857
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,879
Neutral all the way down the mountain.

858
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:19,800
But I've got to say, it doesn't feel like fall.

859
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,479
Ah, there we go. It does now.

860
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:26,560
Very funny(!)

861
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,800
Anyway, it's not fall, it's autumn.

862
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,039
No, it's fall.

863
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,479
English car show - autumn.

864
00:49:33,479 --> 00:49:35,959
We're in America, so it's fall.

865
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:38,039
We invented the language. It's autumn.

866
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,120
It's fall.

867
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,039
We're not going to "autumn" down the hill.

868
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:42,319
That's just a bad pun.

869
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,200
Look, whoever wins the challenge gets to name the season. Deal?

870
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,160
Deal. That's fair enough. Yeah, deal.

871
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,319
Fall.

872
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,120

'With the quickest down the winner...

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,399
'it was time to let the blue bull run free.'

876
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,760
Three, two, one!

877
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,680
OK.

878
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,919
Here we go. Come on.

879
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:16,240
7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

880
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,479
12, 13, 14, 15...

881
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:21,120
OK, stay off the brake.

882
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,640
Stay off the brake.

883
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,680
Piece of cake.

884
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,720
Let it run, let it run.

885
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,240
'But as this 1Â½-ton, 200 grand rock gathered momentum...'

886
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,800
Oh, this is weird.

887
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,479
Such a weird feeling.

888
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:39,399
'..this was becoming a test of not only skill...

889
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:41,839
Oh, this is a tight one, here's a tight one.

890
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,120
'..but bravery.'

891
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,519
Oh, I got to brake, I got to brake. BRAKES SCREECH

892
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:48,519
Ah, scrubbed too much speed right there!

893
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,919
Come one, don't be a chicken. Stay off the brake.

894
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:53,439
'Although the further I went...'

895
00:50:53,439 --> 00:50:54,479
Come on.

896
00:50:54,479 --> 00:50:55,919
'..the easier it became.'

897
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,479
Be brave, the brave.

898
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,999
All right, here comes the hairpin.

899
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:02,600
Set up way out here.

900
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,879
Brake.

901
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:06,640
Do not go off the cliff.

902
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

903
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,999
Jesus.

904
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,560
Right. Whoo.

905
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,919
'And with the little blue bull really starting to run...'

906
00:51:17,919 --> 00:51:19,240
Whoo!

907
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:23,919
'..nearing the bottom, we were flying.'

908
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:27,600
76, 78, 79, 80, 81,

909
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,519
82, 83, 84, 85, 86!

910
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,839
Across the line.

911
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,080
Whoo.

912
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,399
'Felt fast,

913
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:39,999
'but Harris's Porsche was heavier and potentially quicker.'

914
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:42,200
Three, two, one.

915
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,800
Come on!

916
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,760
'OK, it's fair to say...'

917
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,959
Eight, nine, ten.

918
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:54,399
'..this isn't the sort of challenge I'm used to.'

919
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:56,919
Oh, this is bloody awful.

920
00:51:56,919 --> 00:51:59,999
Now, if you're speeding with the car in neutral,

921
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:02,600
is it still speeding on the road? Can you get a ticket for that?

922
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,080
- Yeah, it's still speeding.
- Just curious. OK.

923
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,519
'And I admit, I did find the whole "lack of engine" thing a bit...

924
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,080
'tricky.'

925
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,760
Oh, I shouldn't have braked!

926
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,319
Oh, I've really wiped a load speed off there.

927
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,160
Come on, here we go. Here we go.

928
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,560
Oh, I don't know what's round the corner. I keep wanting to brake!

929
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,919
Oh! Now I'm nervous!

930
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,319
74, 75...

931
00:52:36,439 --> 00:52:39,800
Yeah-heh-heh-heh-heh!

932
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
Could I have gone quicker? Yes.

933
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,439
Would I want to? No.

934
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,760
- OK, so you did it...
- Yeah?

935
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,160
..in two minutes and 46 seconds.

936
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,399
- Sounds reasonable.
- That's pretty good.

937
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:54,080
- And I did it...
- Yeah?

938
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,160
..in two minutes and three seconds.

939
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,519
- That's a typo.
- I don't...

940
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,080
- How can you be 43 seconds quicker?!
- That is, er...

941
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,319
- You're a third quicker, basically, than me.
- Yeah, I...

942
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:08,399
One third?!

943
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,479
- Yeah, I...
- Sorry, I'm just looking...

944
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,399
- Is there a parachute behind my...?
- I don't know. Let me see that.

945
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,680
Cos the way this is written,

946
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,080
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

947
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:22,439
'Stupid challenge anyway.'

948
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:24,399
'Now, as the winner of FALL...'

949
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:25,879
43 seconds?!

950
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:29,640
'..I had made it one apiece, with just one challenge remaining.

951
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,519
'And as we climbed higher into the mountains...'

952
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:36,319
Everything's getting whiter.

953
00:53:37,439 --> 00:53:39,560
And this is slightly concerning.

954
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,399
'..winter was definitely coming.

955
00:53:44,399 --> 00:53:47,800
'And, arriving at Mammoth Mountain, our Four Seasons decider

956
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,760
'looked like it would be the toughest challenge of them all.'

957
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,359
Wow!

958
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,160
So this is winter.

959
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,319
Er...

960
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:59,560
When does heavy snowfall become a blizzard?

961
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,359
I don't know, but this feels pretty blizzardy.

962
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:04,200
Ooh!

963
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,160
- Oh, look. There's something in there. What is that?
- Hm.

964
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:14,720
"Time for your final challenge - winter, a season of ice and snow.

965
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,600
"You claimed your supercars could handle any weather.

966
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,959
"You will now prove it by racing across Mammoth Mountain."

967
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:24,800
We have to race across Mammoth Mountain?! That's a big mountain!

968
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,839
Now, look here.

969
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,640
After the last challenge, I fully intend to win this one.

970
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,479
- OK.
- OK?
- Well, good luck to you.

971
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,839
Mammoth Mountain sits at the heart of the Sierra Nevada range.

972
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,680
To cross it, our challenge would start over 9,000 feet up,

973
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,879
at the top of an icy ski slope.

974
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:45,240
Plunging to the bottom, a two-mile drive through deep-drift snow

975
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,720
would bring us to the final stage - a climb through dense forest,

976
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,959
and a race to the finish on the other side of the mountain.

977
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,039
It's 1-1. This is the decider. Winner takes all.

978
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:02,160
All-wheel drive, 600 horsepower, ã200,000 car.

979
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,039
What could possibly go wrong?

980
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,999
Three! Two! One!

981
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:10,200
- Go!
- ENGINES ROAR

982
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,519
Yes, baby!

983
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,720
Oh, he got the jump on me.

984
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:19,280
- I can't see
- BLEEP.

985
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:25,640
Ugh. I'm doing about 80 in a snowdrift!

986
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,640
So I've got to get to the other side of the mountain,

987
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,560
where apparently it's not snowy.

988
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,800
You know, when manufacturers talk about 0-60 times,

989
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,240
they assume you're going to be on a road. But if you're on, say...

990
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,879
Oh, I don't know, a ski slope, those times may vary slightly.

991
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:44,640
Consumer advice right there.

992
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:49,640
'Harris's all-weather Porsche had started well.

993
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,680
'But then...'

994
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,160
Whoa!

995
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,839
Oh, I'm stuck.

996
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,200
There's the pass. There's the pass.

997
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,959
That is immature.

998
00:56:04,479 --> 00:56:05,839
Is this a blue run?

999
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,800
It is now.

1000
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,479
'To stay in the race, Harris had been forced to call in some backup.'

1001
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,879
'And, on the other side of the mountain, the weather had cleared...

1002
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,039
'..and I was ploughing ahead.'

1003
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:26,200
Yeah, Lambo! Come on, baby! Come on!

1004
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:31,039
'But I was now out of the deep stuff and gaining fast.'

1005
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,280
'Going into the second stage, it was uphill all the way.'

1006
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,919
Flat pinned in third gear, going up a ski slope!

1007
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:45,240
'And the low-riding Lambo started to struggle.'

1008
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,839
Oh, I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

1009
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,359
Supercar coming through!

1010
00:56:51,439 --> 00:56:53,240
Yeah-heh-heh-heh!

1011
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,319
Oh! It was going so good.

1012
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,760
'Pushing to open up a lead...'

1013
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,919
Whoa!

1014
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,399
'..keeping the hammer down was becoming more and more treacherous.'

1015
00:57:06,399 --> 00:57:08,839
This is a rally stage!

1016
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:09,919
Whoa!

1017
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,399
'Now, since Chris had already bent the rules,

1018
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,280
'it seemed only fair to break out my secret weapon.'

1019
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,120
All right, back in the game.

1020
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:26,439
At least I have a fighting chance.

1021
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,359
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1022
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:34,200
'And, with the snow chains on, I soon had the Porsche in my sights.'

1023
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,839
Woohoo!

1024
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:40,160
You ain't getting away now, Harris. I got your number!

1025
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:44,839
There he is! Come on, Porsche!

1026
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:47,080
'At the final stage, we were neck-and-neck.

1027
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,519
'But with no way past...'

1028
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:49,879
Here we go, here we go.

1029
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:51,999
'..to stand any chance of winning,

1030
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:54,640
'I decided to take a different line through the forest

1031
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,919
'in a sprint to the finish.'

1032
00:57:56,919 --> 00:57:58,560
Harris wants this one bad.

1033
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,600
That 43 seconds?

1034
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,919
That's driving him crazy, I can tell.

1035
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,399
Where is he?! Come on, Porsche!

1036
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:10,200
'Two truly incredible supercars.

1037
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,839
'But only one winner.'

1038
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:17,359
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1039
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,800
Yeah!

1040
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,999
I've won!

1041
00:58:24,439 --> 00:58:26,359
Oh! There's Harris!

1042
00:58:32,919 --> 00:58:35,120
Oh, you got me.

1043
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,479
You got me.

1044
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,919
Congratulations.

1045
00:58:37,919 --> 00:58:40,600
- How fun was that?!
- Amazing!
- Huh?

1046
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,640
We just all the way up a mountain in two supercars!

1047
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,999
Two sup...

1048
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:50,720
Well, in one supercar and one SUPER car.

1049
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,959
I mean, super competent.

1050
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:55,839
- It's a supercar!
- It's a great car.
- Come on.

1051
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,039
We can go round and round on this, I'm not going to stop.

1052
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,959
Cos you know it's not. It is a SUPER car, but it's not a supercar.

1053
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,999
Now, was that great? How great was that?

1054
00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:08,600
That was mega.

1055
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,160
So jealous. So jealous.

1056
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,879
You drove up a ski slope.

1057
00:59:12,879 --> 00:59:14,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1058
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,879
It's ridiculous that these cars managed to do that.

1059
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:19,240
I knew they were good, I didn't know they were that good.

1060
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,160
Yeah, neither did I. That was so much fun.

1061
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,120
That might be the most fun I have ever had in a car.

1062
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,560
And you know how Lamborghini's

1063
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,280
- building that new four-wheel-drive thing?
- Yeah, the Urus.

1064
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,399
Yeah, well, they don't need to build an off-roader,

1065
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:31,999
cos they have a great one right here.

1066
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:34,080
All right, Chris, we know if you had to pick one,

1067
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,519
you'd take the Porsche, right?

1068
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,319
- It's motoring perfection. It does EVERYTHING.
- OK.

1069
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,080
Matt, hand on heart time, between the three of us -

1070
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,519
if you had to go for the Porsche or the Huracan,

1071
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:44,720
what's it going to be?

1072
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,959
Oh, well, the Huracan,

1073
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:51,120
it's so theatrical and it has a spectacular motor. It is just...

1074
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,399
the Porsche for me too, I think. LAUGHTER

1075
00:59:53,399 --> 00:59:55,959
Yeah, I would say. It does everything.

1076
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,439
And you can... It has back seats, I can put the kids in it.

1077
00:59:58,439 --> 01:00:00,120
You can do whatever you want with it.

1078
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,359
- It IS an all-season supercar.
- Yes!

1079
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:05,039
- OK? Supercar.
- Yes!
- Happy?
- Yes.

1080
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,240
All right, on next week's show, the Aston Martin DB11.

1081
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,720
And motorsport, Caribbean style.

1082
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,080
No, no, no, that's Caribbean-STYLEY.

1083
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,600
- See
- you then. Good night!
- Good night!
