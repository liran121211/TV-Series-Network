00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,800
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,200
Hello!

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
And welcome to Top Gear.

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,120
Tonight, we've got
Chris Harris and Sabine Schmitz

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,080
in a motorsports fight to the death.

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,680
And we've got Eddie Jordan,
in a surprisingly-tight race suit.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,000
Something for everyone.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,960
But first, I want to talk
about American stereotypes,

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,480
because some people will tell you
that America doesn't do supercars.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,520
And I have to say
that is completely and totally...

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,840
true, actually.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
Over the years, America's
made a lot of fast cars -

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,080
Corvettes, Mustangs, Vipers -

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,200
but we've always tended to leave
the mid-engined supercar thing

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,040
to the Europeans.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,080
Well, watch out, Europe,

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,360
because America's coming to git ya!

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the new Ford GT.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Yes, it's American.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,760
Yes, it's a car.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,800
And, yes, it is super.

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,320
And for starters, it looks great!

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,560
In fact,

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,360
I think it's the best-looking
American car this century.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,120
Hell, it might just be
the best-looking car this century.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Not only does it look
like a proper supercar,

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,840
the GT is made out
of proper supercar parts.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,800
This isn't some lump of iron
forged by a blacksmith.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,560
No, no. This is the real deal.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,160
It's got sophisticated
pushrod hydraulic suspension,

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,880
a whipcrack double-clutch gearbox.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,520
Practically the whole thing is made
out of carbon fibre and aluminum.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,680
That's right, ALUMINUM.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,240
It's an American car
and we're in America,

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
so it's aluminum.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,240
And all those cutting-edge
components are needed

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,680
to manage 647 horsepower.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
That is Major League.

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,960
Major League enough
to do 0-60 in three seconds flat.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,360
That's as quick as the Ferrari 488.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,600
That's as quick
as the McLaren 675 LT.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,320
That's as quick as...

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
Well, that's quick.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
So it's got supercar acceleration,

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,640
but those cars
both top out at 205mph,

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,840
which is REALLY fast.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,560
The Ford GT, however...

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,200
..216mph.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,800
It's the fastest Ford ever.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,680
REVVING

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,640
Now, that kind of firepower
demands closer inspection.

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,280
And that means no more
Pacific Coast Highway.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,240
RADIO:

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,080
What's that? I can't hear you.
I'm going through a tunnel!

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
HE CHUCKLES

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,840
No, the Ford GT needs a racetrack.

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,160
Specifically,
my favourite racetrack...

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,600
Laguna Seca.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,000
All right.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,280
Let's see what it can do.
So we put it in track mode.

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,440
Hoh!

62
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
That's nice.
Drops down with authority.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,920
All right. Ready? Here we go.

64
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,120
Oh, the acceleration
is...enormous! Whoo!

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,440
Ford have done some clever stuff
with software and fuel injection,

66
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,480
which they say eliminates turbo lag.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,320
They keep the turbo spooled up, even
when my foot is off the throttle.

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,720
So there's always power.

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
ALWAYS!

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,560
And there's plenty of grip, too.

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
It's got an active wing out the back

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,760
that keeps the back
stuck to the track.

73
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,880
And it's got active flaps
under the nose

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,640
to keep the nose stuck to the track.

75
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,080
You stick all that together
and this thing is...

76
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
..sticky.

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,320
OK, here we come
into the Corkscrew at...

78
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,360
- Ooh, - BLEEP! - That's quick.

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,880
If you were to do that
through the Corkscrew at that speed

80
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,080
in any other Ford - ever! -

81
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,640
you would be out there in the weeds.

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
And that's the thing
about this new GT.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,920
It's not like any other Ford, ever.

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,920
See, here's what happens
when a big company like Ford

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,600
tries to do a supercar.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,200
The designers come up
with a gorgeous, sleek concept,

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
the engineers try to figure out

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,280
a way to make it go
really, really fast

89
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,600
and, then,
the departments get involved.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,360
There's the guy from
the Cup-Holders Department,

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,960
who wants to make sure there's room
for his 30-ounce Big Slurp.

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,520
Then there's the guy

93
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
from the Sports And Leisure
Luggage Department,

94
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,520
who wants to make sure
there's room for his golf sticks.

95
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,480
And then there's the guy from the
Making Sure Fat Guys Fit Department,

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,040
who wants to make sure
there's room for his...

97
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
..fat guy.

98
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,160
Now, after all their demands
have been met,

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
you don't have a supercar any more.

100
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
No, no, no. What you have...

101
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
is an SUV.

102
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,920
But the GT feels like
it's been crafted by specialists,

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,280
who knew exactly what they wanted...

104
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,480
and got it.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,760
Now, this is hydraulic steering.
No fancy electric. It's old school.

106
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,680
It's got a great feel.
Turns in really sharp.

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
TYRES SQUEAL

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
Ferrari give you a lot of software
to help you do neater skids,

109
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
but there's none of that here.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
In this one, you're on your own.

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,960
TYRES SCREECH

112
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,160
All on your own!

113
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,160
Oh, my God, the balance is epic!

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
LAUGHING: Wow!

115
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,080
America can't do supercars?!

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,600
Not from where I'm sitting.

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,640
So, come on, what's not to like?

118
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,680
Well, there is that motor.

119
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Yeah, it's big on power,

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,560
but, by supercar standards,
it's kind of short on cylinders.

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,760
This is a V6 -

122
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,080
a 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6,
to be exact.

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,840
And that could be a problem.

124
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
Because this car
is inspired by the GT40,

125
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,320
the greatest American
race car of all time,

126
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,600
- powered by one
of the most iconic - V8s - ever.

127
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,280
Created in the 1960s, its aim
was to end Ferrari's domination

128
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,320
at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

129
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,160
Up against Ferrari's
highly-strung V12s,

130
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,520
Ford used the reliable brawn
of a seven-litre V8.

131
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,640
It worked.

132
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,200
The GT40 didn't just become
the first American car

133
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
to win at Le Mans -

134
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,040
it went one, two, three
and locked out the podium.

135
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Ferrari were humiliated.

136
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,360
They'd never win Le Mans again.

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Now, listen to the internet
and the internet will tell you

138
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,880
that Ford ditching the V8
in the new GT isn't just misguided,

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,640
it's unpatriotic.

140
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,000
But the original GT40 didn't
have a V8 because it was American -

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,880
it had a V8 because it was
the right tool for the job.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
And so is this new V6.

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
Yeah, sure,
Ford could have stuck a V8 in here,

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,560
but that would have made the car
heavier, bigger,

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,480
less aerodynamic, less agile.

146
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,360
It's just got such a balanced feel.
So well sorted. It's just...

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,560
RADIO:

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,000
I still have half a tank of fuel!

149
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,840
Bunch of...

150
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,800
As I was saying, the new GT doesn't
honour its history by being retro -

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,640
it honours its history
by being quick.

152
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,800
Last year, exactly half a century
after the original GT40

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,640
spanked Ferrari at Le Mans,
this new GT won its class

154
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,280
in a 24-hour race
and beat Ferrari again.

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,280
What are you going to do?

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
This car is SO special.

157
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,880
Maybe it's the history,
maybe it's the pedigree.

158
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,960
You know what? I'm just
going to shut up now.

159
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm just...

160
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,400
Yeah.

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

162
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
Pretty special.

163
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,920
- OK. - Pretty special, right?

164
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,400
This car looks absolutely
stunning in that film,

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,160
but I can't believe
I am saying this,

166
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,360
it looks even better
in the studio, in the flesh.

167
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,280
- The way you see
those scalloped sides. - Yeah, yeah.

168
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,240
When we did the film, I had seen
photos, but when I saw it in person

169
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,480
the first time, I just walked
around and around and around it.

170
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,800
It is so good looking.

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,400
It's a great piece of styling
and you were the first person,

172
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,360
- outside the factory,
to drive it. - Er, right, yeah.

173
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, apart from the guy
who backed it off the truck

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,120
on the Pacific Coast Highway.
He was technically the first,

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,120
but then it was...
then it was little ol' me.

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm profoundly jealous.
I love driving cars first, Matthew.

177
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,160
- You've taken over my role.
I'm gutted. - Whoa, whoa, hold on.

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
You get to drive everything.
You drove the Ferrari FXX-K,

179
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,280
you drove the Bugatti Chiron,
you drove the Volvo Estate

180
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,280
in Kazakhstan. Come on, now.
You need to learn to share.

181
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,680
You can't have them all.

182
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
In this instance,
I can say that's fine.

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,480
But one thing.
You didn't mention the price.

184
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,960
Ah. No, I didn't,
because it is very expensive!

185
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,760
It's about 400,000. About
£300,000. That's a lot of money.

186
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,520
That's more than a 675LT,
more than a Ferrari 488.

187
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
Enough to support

188
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,000
this rather ordinary badge here?

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Yeah. I mean,
it's a better supercar.

190
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,240
So because it is more expensive,
it's better?

191
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,120
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Yeah. Look, for too long now,
America has been making cars

193
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,760
that are good value for the money.

194
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,880
They give you a lot of bang
for your buck.

195
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,080
But that's
where we've been going wrong.

196
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,800
Supercars aren't about
bang for your buck.

197
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
You make it stupid expensive

198
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
and people just
can't get enough of it.

199
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
There's some logic in that.

200
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,800
Can I ask one thing?
When you did the lowering...

201
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,920
When you put it in track mode
and it... WHOOMPH!

202
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
Please can I, um...? Come on.

203
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
All right. Go on, have a go.
Here you go.

204
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,880
- Watch this. This is great.
- You would, wouldn't you!

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,920
ALL: Yes!

206
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,560
You would. Watch this.

207
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,960
This is the coolest thing.

208
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,520
ENGINE EMITS LOW ROAR

209
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,120
Oh!

210
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,800
CHRIS CACKLES

211
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,320
That is just awesome!

212
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,760
And wait for it.

213
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,120
Watch it go back up.

214
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,880
Nice. That's fantastic.

215
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,880
How do you get out?

216
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,560
LAUGHTER

217
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
Right. Well, while he figures
that out - Rory!

218
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,960
And, really, it doesn't actually
matter how much the Ford GT costs,

219
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,200
because they're only planning
to make 1,000 of them

220
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,000
and they're sold out ten times over.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Unlucky. That's right, unlucky.

222
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,560
All right. Now, it's time
to welcome this week's guest.

223
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,320
That's right.
He's won six Olympic gold medals.

224
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,200
He's one of the fastest men
ever on two wheels

225
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,040
and his legs make more torque
than a Ferrari F12.

226
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
Please welcome Sir Chris Hoy.

227
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

228
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,240
How you doing, mate?
Hi, Matt, How's it going?

229
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
- Welcome. - Thank you.
Hi, Rory. Thank you.

230
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
Wow!

231
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,920
This is exciting, isn't it?

232
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,040
- That is a nice... That is
a nice welcome, yeah. - Fantastic.

233
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,240
- So... - Great to be here.

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,200
..over 500 pound-feet
of torque in those legs?

235
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,880
- 700 newton metres, whatever that
is in the old... - That's a lot.

236
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,040
It's quite a lot.
Less now. I'm retired now.

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,440
- Less? - It's like a vintage car,
loses power over the years. - Got you.

238
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,440
So maybe human figures
by this point, you think?

239
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,080
Yeah, it's been a while since
I've tested them, but who knows?

240
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,640
And you love your cars. What did
you drive down here in today?

241
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,520
I drove down in an RS6 Estate.
Nice family car. Quite sensible.

242
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,160
I hear it's been breathed on
just a little?

243
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,920
A little bit.
It's got a loud exhaust

244
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,880
and maybe a few little
extra horses in there.

245
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
- But it's...
- It has 730 horsepower, dude.

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,840
Yeah, well, you need them,
don't you? You need them.

247
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
LAUGHTER

248
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,880
Now, last year, you did something
I've always wanted to do -

249
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,480
you raced at
the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

250
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,400
Oh, it was unbelievable. Just
incredible. An amazing experience.

251
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,080
It exceeded everything,
on every level,

252
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,720
that I was looking forward to,
getting into it.

253
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
Yeah, a huge amount of fun.

254
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
Now, a couple of years ago,
you drove a Nissan GTR

255
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,560
at the Goodwood Festival of Speed,
didn't you?

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,520
How did that go?
You know what? We have a clip.

257
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,880
- I knew you would bring this up!
- Let's look at this tape here.

258
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,160
Nice. There we go.

259
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,480
SCREECHING

260
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,080
Oh!

261
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

262
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,360
Thanks for reminding me
about that one(!)

263
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
I love the bow at the end!

264
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, you know, I sat in the car
afterwards and I just thought,

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
"I wonder,
if I wait here long enough,

266
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,640
"they might all just go home."

267
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
Oh, horrendous.

268
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,800
There's a corner called Molecomb,
it's a left-hander,

269
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
and they all told me,
before I got there,

270
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,520
"If you can see the corner,
or if you wait to brake

271
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,240
"before you see the corner,
it's too late."

272
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,040
I remember going
over the crest of the hill,

273
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,320
seeing the corner, still flat,
and I thought, "Uh-oh."

274
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,520
- You were committed, certainly.
- It was full commitment.

275
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,800
At least I was...
I wasn't holding back.

276
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,560
The worst thing was...
Not the worst thing,

277
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,000
but one of the bad things
was it was the CEO,

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,560
Andy Palmer's personal car, one of
only two NISMO GT-Rs in the country,

279
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,360
brand-new,
he hadn't even driven it yet.

280
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
And...

281
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
- Nor would he ever! - Well, exactly.

282
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I saw him after
I got out of the car,

283
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
and he was very good about it,
he said,

284
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
"We can replace cars,
we can't replace people."

285
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,840
He was quite happy,
because it showed

286
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
how great the airbags
and the safety was.

287
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,040
I went through four rows of
hay bales and came out unscathed.

288
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,440
So you've raced at Le Mans.
What's next?

289
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm aiming to be the first person
to cycle across Antarctica.

290
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,840
And also cycle to the South Pole
on the way to doing that.

291
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,920
It's something
I never thought I'd do,

292
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,200
it's completely out there,
quite a strange challenge,

293
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
but it's a huge challenge,

294
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
and to be the first person
to do that would be pretty cool.

295
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,240
Hmm.

296
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,960
That killed the conversation,
didn't it?

297
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,080
LAUGHTER
No, no, I'm just...

298
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,920
No, I think that's...

299
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,160
Why would you do that?

300
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,080
Why would I do it? Well...

301
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,920
You know, it's not one of these
places you go to on holiday.

302
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,960
No, you don't.

303
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,600
You're not going to end up
at the South Pole by accident.

304
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,440
I just, I like to do things
that challenge me, that push me.

305
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
And to go somewhere
that I never thought

306
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,080
I would ever get the chance to do,
or to go to,

307
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,160
and to challenge myself in a way
I've never been challenged before.

308
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,240
But, yeah, it's just...
Why not? I suppose is the answer.

309
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,760
Is that something
you're going to do by yourself?

310
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
No, we're trying to find somebody

311
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
- that's stupid enough
to do it with me. - Good luck!

312
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,040
We're chatting to
a few people just now.

313
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a big undertaking,
it will be a lot of training,

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,560
a lot of preparation.

315
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,320
We're going to Iceland soon
to test a new bike,

316
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,000
we will actually design and build
a new bike for this project.

317
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,120
Going to have to be able
to deal with

318
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,280
minus whatever the temperatures
will be out there.

319
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,880
- Yeah. - Apparently it's 25 degrees
cooler at the South Pole

320
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
- than it is in Iceland,
which is pretty cold already. - Whoa.

321
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,560
Maybe put a cab around it
and a motor, call it a truck!

322
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,920
LAUGHTER

323
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,840
I'd go with you, but I've got a
thing I've got to do, I couldn't...

324
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,280
What do you say we take a look at
your training lap with Chris Harris?

325
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,680
How did that go out there?

326
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,640
It was... I'm going to get
my excuses in early, I think.

327
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,800
It was greasy, wet.

328
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,600
Chris was very good, though,

329
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,200
he wasn't shouting at me,
he wasn't grumpy.

330
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,720
You're a lot bigger than him.
LAUGHTER

331
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,360
I assume what you're aiming for
is to knock Max Whitlock

332
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,000
off the top of the leaderboard,
right? Gold versus gold?

333
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,960
For the pride of my sport
versus gymnastics,

334
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
it'd be great to be up there.

335
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah, yeah. You're a sport
that has wheels.

336
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
Yeah. I've got some advantage.
He'll be...

337
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,560
Well, he's smaller, he's lighter,

338
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,760
he takes good instruction
from his coaches,

339
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,960
- he can learn routines,
so he should be good. - OK.

340
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,800
- It was a good lap he set. - Very
modest. Is that how you really feel?

341
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,880
Let's take a look.

342
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,400
- Forget everything else, there are
two words that matter today. - OK.

343
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,120
"Max" and "Whitlock".

344
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,360
You have to beat him.

345
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah, but he did it in the dry.

346
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,920
Oh, God, you're like a real
racing driver - all the excuses.

347
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,160
Let's go! First gear.

348
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,880
- Over to the right-hand side.
- Get in, you bugger!

349
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,600
There's several others in there.

350
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,400
He's showboating now!
Over to the right.

351
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Braking hard at the hundred.

352
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,960
- Oh, hundred? - Third gear.
- What the hell is that? - Third gear.

353
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,680
A bit of pommel-horse work there.

354
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,400
ONE PERSON APPLAUDING

355
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
That is just...

356
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
TEARFULLY: That is just beautiful.

357
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,040
Oh, that...

358
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,520
Oh!

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
- Third gear. - Get it in third.
- There we go. That's fifth gear.

360
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
- Max didn't do that.
- Come on! Come on! - Fourth gear.

361
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,880
Trail it all the way in
and get the thing tippy-toed.

362
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320
- Carry it more... - Yeah, yeah.

363
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,640
Good car control, that man!

364
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,120
Over the line! We're in.
Star pupil.

365
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,040
- That was a bit better, that one.
- Star pupil!

366
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,680
So you've taught me everything
you know? All the local knowledge?

367
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,560
- Of course I have, I've told you
all my tricks. - Brilliant.

368
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,800
HE MOUTHS

369
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,640
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

370
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Well done, man.

371
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
That looked really good, though.

372
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,400
In those conditions,
with no distractions whatsoever...

373
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,880
I just about locked up on the brakes
and went straight into him.

374
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,760
- He was lucky I didn't hit him. - Yeah!
- Could have been messy.

375
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,960
Yeah, could have been.
Chris, what do you think?

376
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
Very, very high hopes.

377
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,600
I think he's the star pupil,
as I said in the car.

378
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
He's got all the car control.

379
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,440
If the conditions are there, I'm
expecting great things. No pressure.

380
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,600
Thanks, mate.

381
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,120
We'll get to your timed lap
a little bit later in the show.

382
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,200
OK, now, moving on.
For the last few months,

383
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
there's been an argument
brewing in the office -

384
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,240
who is Top Gear's quickest driver?

385
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,600
Well, obviously, that's The Stig,
but who's second quickest?

386
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,840
According to racing driver
Sabine Schmitz, it's...

387
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,960
Sabine Schmitz,

388
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,040
and according to racing driver
Chris Harris, it's Chris Harris.

389
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,160
So we decided to settle
the argument, once and for all.

390
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,680
Sabine versus Chris.

391
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
All we needed was a place to race.

392
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
The Mojave Desert.

393
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,840
Once a year, this Californian
wilderness is transformed

394
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,160
into a sprawling city
of die-hard race fans.

395
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,840
Whoo! This is what I call
a proper playground!

396
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Look at the size of it!

397
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,680
To decide which of us is quickest,
apart from The Stig,

398
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,320
we'd been sent to
The King Of The Hammers -

399
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,280
one of the most-extreme
off-road events on the planet.

400
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,160
Competing here
requires specialist skill.

401
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,520
High-speed, low-grip racing
across desert flats

402
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,360
meets complex technical rock crawls

403
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,040
over near-vertical
boulder-strewn faces...

404
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,320
..where one mistake
can mean disaster.

405
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,960
Well, all I can say is...

406
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,120
what a perfect place
for you to lose!

407
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,040
What?! I'm not going to lose.

408
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,080
Come on.

409
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Welcome to Hammer Town.

410
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,920
35,000 fans all gathered
to watch the motorsport equivalent

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
of cage fighting.

412
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,920
And as if that wasn't
intimidating enough,

413
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,280
the next morning we'd been entered
into something called

414
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,800
the Legends Class.

415
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,800
And we'd be driving these.

416
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
That is an Ultra 4 buggy.

417
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
Holy moly.

418
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,560
Over 100,000
of custom-made 500 horsepower

419
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,960
V8 off-roader with four-wheel drive,

420
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,120
long travel shocks
and 40-inch tyres.

421
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,720
One slight issue here, Sabine.

422
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,240
- This is your vehicle. - Yeah.

423
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,000
There are big dents in
the roll cage, and if I just, um...

424
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,880
Yeah, this vehicle's been
on its roof several times, Sabine.

425
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
But that's standard, isn't it?

426
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,760
- I'm not afraid.
- For you maybe, not for me.

427
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,440
I've never rolled a racing car
in my life.

428
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,600
I've rolled a couple.

429
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,880
Are you not worried by this?

430
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
I can't wait, actually.

431
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,480
Don't cry, Harris, please.

432
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,400
This is so cool!

433
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,600
Huh?

434
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,400
Not convinced,
I went to find some reassurance

435
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,120
from the event organiser.

436
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,680
- So, Dave, you are literally King
of the Hammers. - Evidently, yeah.

437
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
- This is your event.
- This is my event, yeah.

438
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,200
The million-dollar question
for me is the inversion thing.

439
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,000
- Yeah, I heard you haven't
rolled before. - No.

440
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Today's your day.
THEY LAUGH

441
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,680
This is going into something knowing
that you're going to get hurt.

442
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm not sure about this at all.
This is absolutely insane.

443
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,840
Neither one of these guys here
finished this race last year

444
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,920
because they both broke their backs
during the race

445
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,080
and had to be flown out.

446
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,560
Just drive as slow as you can.

447
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,640
Then you're safe.

448
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,360
Are you listening
to what he's saying?

449
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,640
He said they broke their backs!

450
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,120
- Given what you know about
our driving background... - Yes.

451
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,040
..give an honest assessment
of our chances in these things.

452
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,960
She's going to kill it,
you're not going to make it.

453
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,040
Anybody that can drive a van
around the Nurburgring

454
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,480
is willing to try different things.

455
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,280
Plus I heard she's
already been upside-down,

456
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,440
and you're worried about it.

457
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,520
So you'll drive scared
and be upside-down anyway,

458
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,800
she's going to kill it.

459
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,640
Hmm.

460
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,040
With Dave having been
no help whatsoever,

461
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,200
we were given the afternoon
and a veteran driver each

462
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,080
to familiarise ourselves
with the cars and the terrain.

463
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,360
I had been paired with former
X Games gold medallist

464
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
and legendary motivational speaker
Chris Ridgeway.

465
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
You're pretty much going to be OK.

466
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,000
While Dave had kindly offered Sabine
the help of his son, Bailey.

467
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,720
Ready for this crazy adventure?

468
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
SABINE LAUGHS

469
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,520
I'm in a little bit better shape
than Chris.

470
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,280
So first up were the desert flats.

471
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,240
Sounds straightforward.

472
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,840
Bloody hell! Whoa!

473
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,160
That's insane!

474
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,080
And I'm supposed
to do this myself, am I?

475
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,600
'In my defence,
I've never been a good passenger.

476
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,560
'But, annoyingly,
Sabine was having a blast.'

477
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,600
Whooooo!

478
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,400
SHE LAUGHS AND SHRIEKS

479
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,640
Whooo!

480
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,080
- Having a good time? - Yes!

481
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,320
SHE LAUGHS

482
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,000
Soon, though, it was our turn
to take the wheel.

483
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,880
Ah, now we're talking!

484
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,720
This isn't like a street car
that you're used to driving.

485
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,800
- You've got to hammer the thing.
- Yeah.

486
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,440
You're hard on the brakes,
hard on the throttle.

487
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,840
Full throttle, give it some gas.

488
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,480
OK, honey! Give it a little gas.

489
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,800
ENGINE ROARS
There you go!

490
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,080
Whoohoo!

491
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,680
The suspension is incredible.

492
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,520
But there is this lurking feeling
it could roll any time.

493
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,800
That's correct.

494
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,360
Just as I was starting to
get the hang of it, though,

495
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
I asked a stupid question.

496
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,320
Now, how many injuries have you had?

497
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,120
I've had a few.

498
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,880
I start with the easy stuff,
like the broken arms and legs.

499
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,120
But, er...

500
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,400
A rebuilt wrist,
and knees and ankles.

501
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
There was that one time
I got my leg cut off.

502
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,800
- What?! - Yeah.

503
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,840
Yeah, that was a bad day
at the office.

504
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,680
Oh, my Godfather.

505
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,240
And with that,
we made our way back to Hammer Town.

506
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,840
Where my confidence took
another blow.

507
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,480
I'm kind of up for anything
to do with going fast in cars,

508
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
but I'm not so sure about this.

509
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,120
I've just been ragdolled around
by some lunatic,

510
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,800
and now I'm told that this happened
yesterday to some poor soul -

511
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,840
electrical fire.

512
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
He used the phrase,
"We barely got out."

513
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,400
I thought that was plastic.

514
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,840
That's aluminium, melted.

515
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720
Um...

516
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,280
I think I've bitten off
more than I can chew here.

517
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,080
'It was clear
we needed more practice.

518
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,840
'But before we could head back out,

519
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,680
'we were told
we'd each be getting some help

520
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,240
'from a team manager.'

521
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,360
- I can't have Eddie. - I don't want
Eddie! - I don't want Eddie.

522
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,520
- I don't... - I - don't want Eddie.

523
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,600
- Hello! - Hi! - Welcome to the desert.
- Hi, Eddie!

524
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
What a lovely surprise. Gentlemen.

525
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,080
- Edward. - Sabine, how are you?
Hello! Nice to see you.

526
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,640
- OK, so... - So I must be with...

527
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,760
- We've had a coin toss. You... - Yeah?

528
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,040
..are with Eddie.

529
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,480
Whoohoo! And I am with Sabine.

530
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,760
Come on, give me a hug.

531
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,240
Give me a hug.
Are we going to win?

532
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,560
Yes, we're going to win.

533
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,360
- He's nervous, isn't he?
- Guys. Here we go.

534
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,680
- Along here, this is our line.
- That's it. That's fine, that's fine.

535
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,920
This is the line in the sand
right there.

536
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,640
- OK. Toes on the line.
- They are the enemy.

537
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,440
- OK, I've got you, Edward.
I've got you. - You sure? - Yeah.

538
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,760
- So it's on? - It's on, it's on.
- It's on.

539
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,640
So, heading back out
to our desert training area,

540
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,240
it was time to tackle rock crawling.

541
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,240
And with our team managers on board,
they got straight down to business.

542
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,120
You know what I have
a good feeling about?

543
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
I am going to blank Matt LeBlanc.

544
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,120
Ha-ha! I'm not going to speak
to him.

545
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,040
I'm just going to eyeball him, and
I'm just going to stare into him.

546
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,520
Stare into me?

547
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,280
That's...creepy.

548
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Anyway, I had plans of my own.

549
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,120
We need to try to get in
Chris Harris' head a little bit.

550
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,280
Ja? We need to try to ask him,
"Are you sure you will be OK?

551
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,120
"You sure you're going to be
all right?"

552
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,360
Because his confidence
is easy to shatter. OK. OK?

553
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,920
Actually, it wasn't my confidence
they needed to worry about.

554
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
SABINE SHRIEKS

555
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
We got bloody stuck!
SHE CHUCKLES

556
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,520
What on earth
have they got themselves into?

557
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,360
They are properly stuck.

558
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,600
Stuck?

559
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,760
No, no, no. This is Sabine Schmitz
we're talking about.

560
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,960
Both sides!

561
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
THEY CHEER

562
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,560
- Ha-ha! - Well, well, well.
How was that?

563
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,760
Did you enjoy your time
in the mountains, then?

564
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,120
- A little bit.
- Was there a problem with the car?

565
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,480
Well, we went the difficult way,
you went the easy way.

566
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,000
- We traced exactly the same route
as yours. - I don't think you did.

567
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,920
- And it's not "ROUT", it's "ROOT".
- Tell them they went a different way.

568
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,320
Surely...
They are the king of the practice,

569
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,880
we are the kings of the race.

570
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,320
Let's have a beer,
I am bloody thirsty.

571
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,360
- Nice job.
- Hanging around in the rocks.

572
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Way to go,
right around that hard section.

573
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Drive slowly and safe.

574
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,280
I'm feeling good now.

575
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,480
- I'm done with them...
- We've done enough today.

576
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,760
I thought you were going
to ignore him and not talk to him.

577
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,040
- You said... - Oh.

578
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,640
You've just spent ten minutes
talking to him.

579
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,080
With our day's practice
drawing to a close,

580
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,880
we headed back to Hammer Town

581
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,040
and joined the thousands of fans
settling down for the night.

582
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,080
And with the next day's race
looming even larger,

583
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,240
Chris was a little preoccupied.

584
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,040
There are actually at least eight
other locals in our race tomorrow

585
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,520
and I'm looking at the runners
and riders here,

586
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
they're a bit good.

587
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,040
I think we're fighting over
penultimate and last.

588
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,680
I feel like your confidence
is a bit shattered.

589
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,040
You know they airlifted
four guys out of here today?

590
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
- Was it four or five?
- I know what you're trying to do.

591
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,960
What am I trying to do?

592
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,160
I care about you, I want you to know
what you're getting into.

593
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,680
What do you mean they airlifted
people out from here?

594
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,520
Big wrecks. I mean, full-on...
HE WHISTLES

595
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,280
Cartwheel wrecks, bad stuff.

596
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,520
SABINE LAUGHS

597
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,040
When you were managing F1 teams,

598
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,800
was there any, like, motivational
speeches before the race,

599
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,480
the night before,
anything you told them to do?

600
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,600
The drivers would be sent to bed,
at the latest, ten o'clock.

601
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,560
But prior to that,
they'd all have a massage.

602
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,720
- Massage? Massage? - A massage.

603
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,080
What type of...?

604
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,040
Well, I don't know -
that's between Eddie and Chris.

605
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,960
THEY LAUGH

606
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,600
If that's what he needs
to do for his driver,

607
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,520
that's what he does for his driver,
it's got nothing to do with us.

608
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

609
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,880
All right. Now, we'll see
the second half of that film

610
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,520
a little later on in the show.

611
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,840
Chris, have you done
any off-road driving?

612
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,080
Nothing like that.

613
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,800
I did drive a Dakar rally car
a few years ago in Morocco.

614
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,640
That was pretty cool.

615
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
But I drove Colin McRae's

616
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,040
1995 replica
World Championship-winning car

617
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,600
about three or four years ago,

618
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,880
on the final stage, where he won his
world title in Wales in the GB Rally

619
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,520
and that was amazing.

620
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,200
He's a massive, massive hero
of mine,

621
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,880
so that was a privilege to do that.

622
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,480
All right, guys,
have a look at this.

623
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,080
In the studio,
we've got a brand-new car

624
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,400
that's going to compete
in a brand-new race series

625
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,440
that's going to make F1 look
like the Stone Age.

626
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,720
700 horsepower, all carbon fibre,
and the best thing of all,

627
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,400
it was designed by the same guy
who did the Tron Light Cycles.

628
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,040
- Wow! That's really cool-looking.
- Yeah.

629
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,800
Just one tiny...tiny question -

630
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,320
where does the driver sit?

631
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,000
There is no driver.
This is a Robocar.

632
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,920
It's a self-racing racer.

633
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,440
Basically, in a couple of years,

634
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,840
20 of these things will be hooning
around the track,

635
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,640
competing against each other.

636
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,760
Robot versus robot.
How cool is that?

637
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,480
I genuinely don't understand it,
Rory.

638
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,160
So we're supposed to get excited
about one robot

639
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,080
racing another robot?

640
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,640
It's robots having a race.

641
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,960
What do you not
understand about that?

642
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,440
There's something fundamental
missing, dude - the driver!

643
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,120
AUDIENCE MURMURS IN AGREEMENT

644
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,320
We go to watch motor racing

645
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,480
to see gladiators
controlling machines,

646
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,000
going wheel to wheel.

647
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,760
Not to watch one processor having
a go at another bloke called Intel.

648
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
It just doesn't...
It's utterly meaningless.

649
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,760
It's a great-looking thing
and I'm sure it's fast.

650
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,920
What do you reckon?

651
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,200
- Yeah, I have to agree - sorry, Rory.
- All right.

652
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,240
I love innovation, new technology,
but it's about the human element.

653
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,840
You have to care about the person
that's driving it.

654
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,520
You know what you could do?

655
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,240
You could put some jockeys on it.

656
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,040
You know what I mean?

657
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,560
LAUGHING: Now you're talking!

658
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,640
Could put maybe some foot pegs
back here,

659
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,040
couple of clip-ons here,
get on the thing like this...

660
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,800
LAUGHTER

661
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,360
And off they go.

662
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
APPLAUSE

663
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,520
And then the last one
on the car wins.

664
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,480
You could be the first one
to try it.

665
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
You know what? I'm good, I'm good.

666
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,040
So, over the last few weeks,

667
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,160
I've been serving up a whole bunch
of amazing electric cars

668
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,720
and Matt and Chris
keep batting them down

669
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,600
because, well, they fear progress.

670
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,800
But there's a new Nissan that
I think could change their minds

671
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
and, earlier today,
I went out to meet it on our track.

672
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,560
This is the Nissan Blade Glider
and it's an electric concept car.

673
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,960
But here's the difference -
this one actually drives, fast.

674
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,360
And it's got three seats,
so it's the perfect way

675
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,200
to convert a couple of
electric car sceptics.

676
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,040
What is, er... What is this?

677
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,880
Gentlemen, behold the future.
What do you think?

678
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,120
What is it?

679
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,560
Well, it's the Blade Glider.

680
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,280
It actually drifts -
it's got a built-in drift mode.

681
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,600
It's made for skidding!

682
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,880
- Really? - That's very exciting,
but looks like you'd get

683
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,320
a grant on the NHS for it,
but other than that...

684
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,520
- So you say it drifts?
- Want to have a go?

685
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,280
Yes, I think we should drive it.
At least we might be drier inside.

686
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,240
- Oh, there's no roof.
- LAUGHING: No, there's no roof.

687
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,360
- Now I've got your interest.
- You have.

688
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,160
If it drifts, of course,
I'm driving, Rory, not you.

689
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,240
- Sorry about that.
- Get in. Here we go.

690
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
How the hell do you shut the door?

691
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,160
Is there a button?

692
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,680
THEY LAUGH

693
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,280
There you go. Oh, yeah. I mean...

694
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,040
- What's the horsepower? - 260-odd?

695
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,680
264 horses, gentlemen.

696
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,240
Top speed of at least 115mph.

697
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,680
That's impressive.

698
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,040
For a garbage truck.

699
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,280
For a sports car, maybe not so much.

700
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,120
Where's the accelerator?
There we go.

701
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,520
Well, it feels pretty frisky
from the driver's seat, guys.

702
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
It just feels like it's ready
to drift, doesn't it?

703
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Rory, you might be persuading me

704
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,280
about the validity
of electric cars here.

705
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,560
TYRES SCREECH

706
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,120
Yes!

707
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,040
THEY LAUGH

708
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
He loves it! He loves it.

709
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,760
I think he's having a good time!

710
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,520
TYRES SCREECH

711
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,000
Whoa!

712
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,160
LAUGHTER

713
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
That's not bad.

714
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,960
For me, it's a philosophical point.

715
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,600
It's fun - I don't care about
all the cleverness.

716
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,640
Someone's just gone,
"Let's make it fun."

717
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
There you go, there you go.

718
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
It is fun.

719
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,360
All right, chuck it in here, fast.

720
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,120
Yes! Nice one!

721
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,480
Woohoo!

722
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,720
What do you call
an electric doughnut?

723
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,280
That's the name of my new band.

724
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,160
THEY LAUGH

725
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,720
So what do we think?

726
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,960
A winner?

727
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,640
Yeah, I think so. Chris?

728
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,000
- Thumbs up from me, definitely.
- Yeah. I like it.

729
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,840
All right -
one more lap before we go?

730
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,760
- Definitely. - Can I drive?

731
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,640
- No. - No. Where does it say,
"Traction control off"?

732
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,280
Good, right, let's go.

733
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

734
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
- Pretty fun. - There you go.

735
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
- I didn't think it was going
to be fun. - Oh, come on.

736
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,640
I know I convinced you guys
in the end,

737
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,760
but, Chris, what's your feeling
on electric cars?

738
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Well, electric cars in general,

739
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,240
I thought the whole point
is it's about being eco-friendly,

740
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,680
about being green and sensible.

741
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
- I mean, that looked like
a lot of fun. - Yeah.

742
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,480
- You could convert me, potentially.
- All right.

743
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,840
I was so convinced, honestly.

744
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't really buy into
so much of it,

745
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,720
but the fun message -
that thing reeked of fun.

746
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,880
It was wonderful.

747
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,080
- We were smiling, all three of us.
- Yeah, it was great.

748
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,600
The looks,
I think the jury's still out

749
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,960
on the looks of the thing, but...

750
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,320
And the doors. And the doors.

751
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,240
- And the roof. - Yeah.

752
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,680
The door you can't reach to close
once you get in is difficult.

753
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,720
All right - now, I think it's time
to see how you did

754
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,480
in your timed lap around the track.

755
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,880
But before we do, after you finished
your time in the car with Chris,

756
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,720
you went out and had one more go
on your own, didn't you?

757
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,360
- I did, yes. - What happened?

758
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,560
Well, I just like to think
that I was pushing,

759
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,520
trying to find the limits
of the car,

760
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,640
the track, the grip,

761
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,800
finding how far I could push it

762
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,680
and I essentially just touched the
outside kerb on the follow-through,

763
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,240
just enough so it started
to lose it.

764
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,160
Thought I'd caught it,
but...yeah, didn't.

765
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,840
We have it on tape.
You want to see it?

766
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,880
- Have you? I thought you might!
- Let's take a look at that.

767
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,040
TYRES SCREECH

768
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,240
Oh!

769
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
AUDIENCE OOHS

770
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,640
Couple of points here.

771
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,680
LAUGHTER

772
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,800
First of all,
well done for not dying.

773
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,160
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

774
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,040
- Next, the way I see this... - Yeah.

775
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,000
..Michael Schumacher's race weekends

776
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,360
always started off with him
pushing too far, didn't it?

777
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,040
Always go too far, find the limits

778
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,960
- before you actually get into
the competitive aspect. - There we go.

779
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,600
- That's what you were doing.
- That's it.

780
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,000
You were getting rid of
all of those negative urges,

781
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,640
getting all the bad stuff
out the way,

782
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,840
ready for a perfect performance.

783
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,120
It's like auto mechanics.

784
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,920
You tighten the bolt till it snaps,
then you back off a quarter-turn.

785
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,200
LAUGHTER

786
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,960
But you did manage to eventually
complete a lap, yeah?

787
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,480
I got a lap in, but...

788
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,760
Yeah, well, it wasn't a perfect lap.

789
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,560
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Let's do it.

790
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,320
OK - who wants to see his lap?

791
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,720
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

792
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
Here we go.

793
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,280
OK, off the line.

794
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,760
Bit of clutch riding,
but I think that was a good start.

795
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,520
This is the one, this is the one.

796
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,560
Bit of self-encouragement as well.

797
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,840
Oh, yes - getting the car rotated
under brakes. That was fast.

798
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,240
- Third gear through there? - Yeah.

799
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Using all the track, and a little
bit more, too - that's good.

800
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,840
Messy, messy.

801
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,520
A little bit of tail-wagging,
but that's fast.

802
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,000
Over-stopping the car.

803
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Second through Chicago.

804
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,880
I love the way you put the wipers on
to make us think it's raining...

805
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,320
- LAUGHTER
- ..when it wasn't raining.

806
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,320
That was good gamesmanship,
I like that.

807
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,680
Now, flat-out down
the back straight,

808
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,680
braking between 150,
probably closer to the 50.

809
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,800
Triggering those
hazard warning lights.

810
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
This line looks good to me.

811
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,760
Did you let the car roll out?

812
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
You didn't open the steering
as much as I thought.

813
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,960
Too much oversteer.

814
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,920
- You found grip on the inside,
didn't you? - Yeah.

815
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,960
So you'd been thinking there,
that was clever.

816
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,200
Down the back straight.

817
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,800
There's a cameraman,
try not to hit him.

818
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,840
Good idea(!)

819
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,440
So now, this turn point...

820
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,160
- AUDIENCE OOHS
- That is rapid.

821
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,960
Woo-hoo-hoo!

822
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,400
Now, back through the tyre wall.

823
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,120
You're not lacking in the,
um...trouser department there.

824
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,440
OK, last two corners.

825
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,760
Be brave!

826
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,560
That's mega.
You're triggering those lights,

827
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,280
which shows maximum braking.

828
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,520
But now, over the line
and a bit of grass...

829
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,600
And a yump.

830
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,960
- Oh...!
- APPLAUSE

831
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,840
- That...was...dead impressive.
- Thank you.

832
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,920
Oh, thanks, mate.

833
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,240
That looked quick.

834
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,400
That's the most committed
I've seen around here.

835
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Absolutely, by far, yeah.

836
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,960
And the conditions weren't perfect.

837
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,760
- They were drier than your windscreen
wiper action suggested. - Come on!

838
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,360
I suppose, looking at it there,
I'm wondering...

839
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,040
Where could you have gone quicker?

840
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,240
It looked like you were
maxed out everywhere.

841
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,080
I was pushing it,
but I made mistakes on,

842
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,440
I think, the first left-hander.

843
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,320
- Could have been a bit tighter there.
- Yeah.

844
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,080
And I could have used more width
of the track

845
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,160
going to that right-hander,
the follow-through.

846
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,640
- Yeah. - Possibly.
But if you go too far,

847
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,880
you touch the painted kerb
and you see what happened.

848
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,040
- Yes. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,440
I think it's a really,
really impressive effort.

850
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,760
Hopes are high.

851
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,880
- This is a big moment, I'm excited.
- Me too.

852
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
Top of our leaderboard
is still Max Whitlock,

853
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,800
the super gymnast, with the 1:39.5.

854
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,320
His double lay-in,
half-in, half-out,

855
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,800
has this almost...mournful quality
to it, it's just...

856
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,840
LAUGHTER

857
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,040
Anyway, that's besides the point.

858
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
He has two gold medals.

859
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,920
You have six gold medals.

860
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,520
So, on paper,

861
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,840
you should be three times
faster than him.

862
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,800
LAUGHTER
Is that correct?

863
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,520
- I'm twice his weight, though.
- That doesn't matter.

864
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,520
- All right. Are we ready?
- Let's do it.

865
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,120
Sir Chris Hoy, you did it...

866
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,520
That's my favourite part.

867
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,160
- ..in one minute...
- Yes...

868
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,880
- 30...
- Yes...

869
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,920
- ..5.4. - Oh! - No!

870
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,320
- Really? Wow, thank you!
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

871
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,960
Thank you, man.
Thank you very much, cheers.

872
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,680
- That is mega. - Thanks, man. Cheers.

873
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,640
Thank you. Thank you, mate.

874
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,040
Mate, you were amazing, really good.

875
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,800
Right to the top, man.
That is good! Way to go.

876
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,360
I didn't think that at all.

877
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,800
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Chris Hoy.

878
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

879
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,960
- That will not be beaten
for some time. - No.

880
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,360
That will not be beaten
for some time.

881
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,200
That was driving the wheels off it,
as they say.

882
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,520
OK, now it's time to head back
to King of the Hammers.

883
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,240
Earlier, we saw Sabine and Chris

884
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,720
training for their big
off-road showdown,

885
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,920
aided by my words of encouragement
and Eddie's deep tissue massage.

886
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,480
But things were about
to get serious.

887
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,680
Really serious.

888
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,400
Race Day at King of the Hammers.

889
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,600
Sabine and Chris would soon be
competing in an off-road race

890
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,560
to claim the coveted title

891
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,520
of Top Gear's Fastest Driver
Apart From The Stig.

892
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,640
But after some overenthusiastic
practice the day before...

893
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,280
Left, left!

894
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,640
- Come on.
- CLANKING

895
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,600
- I don't think it liked that.
- CLANKING

896
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,280
..Team Jordan had issues.

897
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,040
- What have you done here?
- What have I done?

898
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
The vehicle has let itself down.

899
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,720
Are you joking me?

900
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,720
This was brand-new,
running perfectly.

901
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,400
You don't turn left
when I tell you to turn left,

902
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,360
you break the machine.

903
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,720
You're a car wrecker.

904
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,960
How did anyone ever drive for you?

905
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,160
Very easy - they didn't do
silly things like this.

906
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,360
Years ago,
I would have said to the driver,

907
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
"You are a complete dick."

908
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm supposed to have a positive
mental vibe from you,

909
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,400
you're beating me up.

910
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,280
Course I'm beating you up,
because I don't want the same again.

911
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,760
I need you to believe.
Find that commitment...

912
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,600
I like Eddie. He's so cool.

913
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,680
You're going to win.

914
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,120
Just feel the vibes.
Feel the good vibes inside you.

915
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,760
Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me.

916
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,200
I am not talking to him.

917
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,120
- He's not a nice man...
- You look concerned.

918
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,400
You look a little concerned.

919
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,680
At the moment, I don't have
a vehicle to go in the race, do I?

920
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,760
Yes, we have this. Look. It's magic.

921
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,240
This is the car. Look at this.

922
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
Ooh, it's got a Texas flag on it.

923
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,720
Get out of here.

924
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,920
I love it when you act like
you don't like me, it's great.

925
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,760
- I hate you. - You don't hate me...

926
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,720
- I like Sabine. - I am not
a proper lady. - You are a scumbag.

927
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,120
- A scumbag? - You're trying
to damage my man's head.

928
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,440
- Scumbag! Hold on.
- It's damaged already.

929
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,200
- You're a scumbag. - Scumbag?

930
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,720
'Old people are funny.

931
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,600
'But with the atmosphere heavy
with prerace tension,

932
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,360
'it was soon time for our drivers
to make their way to the track -

933
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,720
'if you could call it that.'

934
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,280
The race would start
on the choppy desert floor

935
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,560
with Eddie and I keeping watch
from a high vantage point.

936
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,360
Here, our drivers would
battle the dust

937
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,840
to reach the unforgiving
rock face beyond.

938
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,840
After a brutal uphill scramble,
a perilous ledge,

939
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,920
ending in a do-or-die descent

940
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,880
and a chance to get the hammer down
back on the flats.

941
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,560
Negotiating another
short boulder pass,

942
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,680
a fast sequence of banked turns
and flat-out jumps

943
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,960
completes the lap.

944
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,240
And they'll be doing all of that
eight times.

945
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,320
So before the race
was due to begin,

946
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,600
we headed out with our drivers
to offer some encouragement

947
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,720
at the toughest stage of all,
the Rock Wall...

948
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,360
..towering over 200 feet above us.

949
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,720
Oh, my Jesus...

950
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,480
- I mean, what the - BLEEP?
EDDIE CHUCKLES

951
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,240
So the part that's tricky here
is if you're right behind someone,

952
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,120
you've just got
to single-file up it.

953
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,200
- I guess you could maybe try
that side on the right... - Oh, God.

954
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,040
..to pass someone, but what do
you do when you get to this?

955
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,000
You've just got to check up
and go single file, right?

956
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,680
Yeah. So just do it.

957
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,720
Unlike the previous day's
boulder crawl,

958
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,560
during the race,
these loose rock scrambles

959
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,760
would have to be attacked at speed.

960
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,480
Whoa...whoa...

961
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,080
And on near-vertical faces,

962
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,920
rolling the car
was a very real danger.

963
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,920
But at least Sabine
was in full control.

964
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,520
SHE SCREAMS

965
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,800
The steering wheel came off.

966
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,240
- BLEEP - hell!

967
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,480
- BLEEP - hell!

968
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,680
Oh, man.

969
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,800
- BLEEP - hell!

970
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,240
I don't want to have
the steering wheel come off.

971
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,200
What have we got ourselves into,
here?

972
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,680
Top man.

973
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,120
Nice and easy. You're OK.

974
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,680
'Having reached the top
of the rock wall, though,

975
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,920
'there was still the small matter
of getting back down...'

976
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,480
This is mental.

977
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,360
Oh!
CLANKING

978
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,600
THUDDING
Oh!

979
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,120
'..quickly learning that
this was a race about bravery

980
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,280
'as much as speed.'

981
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,400
Can we go back now?

982
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,240
CHRIS LAUGHS

983
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,280
We decided we had offered
our drivers enough encouragement

984
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,520
and headed back to the pits.

985
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,960
I'm glad I'm not in the car with you
for the race.

986
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,760
Oh...this is crazy.

987
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,600
'And after some final tweaks
to the cars,

988
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,920
'we said our last goodbyes
to Sabine and Chris.

989
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,760
'Well, not our last goodbyes, but...
You know what I mean.'

990
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,760
It was time for them
to take their places

991
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,200
out of the way
at the back of the grid.

992
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,480
Because in this Legends Class race,

993
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,720
they were pitted against some of
the best talent in Hammer history -

994
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,440
all hardened veterans in an event

995
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,960
where simply finishing
is an achievement.

996
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,440
From the sport's fastest female,

997
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,400
to mavericks

998
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,520
and seasoned warriors.

999
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,920
So really, this was a race
within a race.

1000
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,120
Schmitz versus Harris.

1001
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,360
Oof!

1002
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,520
Serious business.

1003
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,600
- It's crazy.
- You can't believe this, can you?

1004
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,240
OK, we're getting close.

1005
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,560
You stay focused
and you stay out of the roost, OK?

1006
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,080
Strategy.

1007
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,360
Usual thing,
just jump the start, if you can.

1008
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,920
Make sure you put the guy
beside you into the wall.

1009
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,880
The rest follows on from there.

1010
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,600
OK, Harris.

1011
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,160
I am on a mission
and I just want to beat you.

1012
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,200
All I can ever think
about on the grid

1013
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,880
is the fact that I wish
I'd had another wee.

1014
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
The desert would wait no longer.

1015
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,240
Eight laps of off-road endurance.

1016
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,880
Let the battle commence.

1017
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,880
ANNOUNCER: Three, two, one...go!

1018
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,720
Damn it!

1019
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,280
Oh, what a start.

1020
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,720
- So much - BLEEP - in my face.

1021
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,840
Good one, my man. Go on, Chris.

1022
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,240
I don't see anything.

1023
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,320
You're OK, Sabine.

1024
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,360
Keep going, keep going.
I know the dust is bad.

1025
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,720
Just think about it as
the Nurburgring in the Stone Ages.

1026
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,240
SHE LAUGHS

1027
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,600
'Despite the dust, we were both off
to a promising start,

1028
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,600
'but that Rock Wall was looming.'

1029
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,720
Oh, God.

1030
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,200
Rocks being thrown in my face.

1031
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,200
I can't see where I'm going.

1032
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,720
This is horrendous.

1033
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,880
'But, somehow, we weren't just
in a two-car race at the back.'

1034
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,560
There's Chris in fourth place.

1035
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,760
Go on, Chris. Go on, my son!

1036
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
'No, we were right in the mix.'

1037
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,280
Whoo!

1038
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,280
- CRASH!
- Oh! I hit them.

1039
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,520
- Where's Sabine? - Woo-hoo-hoo!

1040
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,400
Oh, look at that!

1041
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,440
Come on, Chris.

1042
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,880
At the top of the wall,
they were up with the pros,

1043
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,680
which should have given them
some real confidence.

1044
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,200
Oh, my God,
what am I doing this for?

1045
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,160
This is crazy.

1046
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,440
Oh, my God - just let it go,
let it go, man.

1047
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,840
Let it go!

1048
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,640
'Back down on the desert floor...

1049
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,520
'..Sabine was on my tail.

1050
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,800
'And as we tore through the rest
of the course...'

1051
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,440
Whoo...

1052
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,760
hoo!

1053
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,120
'..we saw what Hammer racing
was really all about.'

1054
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,800
Come on!

1055
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,720
'Off-road open warfare.'

1056
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,680
Let's see where my man is.

1057
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,200
- He's in third. - Third?!

1058
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,360
Go on, Chris.

1059
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,400
'Survival of the fittest.'

1060
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Oh, my heavens. That was close.

1061
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,880
'But as the laps piled on...'

1062
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,080
Come on, Sabine. Push, push, push!

1063
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,600
'..they weren't just battling
the other racers.'

1064
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,360
No, you're not coming past me,
you American...!

1065
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,600
These rocks are really crazy.

1066
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,160
I need to turn right.

1067
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,880
'The course was fighting back, too.'

1068
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,160
- Uh-oh. - Hang on a second.
- She's stuck.

1069
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,400
Reverse, just a little bit.
Not much, maybe five feet.

1070
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,880
'Snared by the rocks
on the worst part of the course,

1071
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,840
'Sabine was losing precious time...'

1072
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,360
Turn the wheels all the way
to the right and go forward.

1073
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,280
'..and the rest of the pack
were getting away.'

1074
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,720
All right, try to go slow,
backwards.

1075
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,360
Straight back, slow.

1076
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,000
Back little a bit more,
a little bit more.

1077
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,240
You might have to come off
that ledge.

1078
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,000
'One wrong instruction from me
and she could roll.'

1079
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,400
All right, stop right there.

1080
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,680
Turn the wheels the other way
and go forward. To the right.

1081
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,680
There you go.

1082
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,200
Atta girl. Yeah! Good girl.

1083
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,360
You're a star, you're a star.
All right.

1084
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,600
That's OK.

1085
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,760
"That's OK"?

1086
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Oh, she lost a lot of time there.

1087
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,960
'Back up and running,
to hunt down Chris,

1088
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,360
'Sabine would need wring out
all 500 horsepower

1089
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,440
'from her 6.4-litre V8.'

1090
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,920
Keep your pace, keep your pace.

1091
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,280
Holy crow...

1092
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,040
THUDDING
Oh, BLEEP!

1093
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,560
As she tried to reel him back in,

1094
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,600
Chris, already on his second car
of the event,

1095
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,200
was now in trouble again.

1096
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,640
I've got a gearbox issue, I think.

1097
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,760
I can't get into second.

1098
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,680
Never mind the second gear,
you're doing brilliant, keep going.

1099
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,320
I've got a transmission issue, now.

1100
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,160
'Despite Eddie's encouragement,

1101
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,920
'losing gears at this stage
was a serious issue.'

1102
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,640
Beautiful, beautiful.
Power, power, power, power.

1103
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,360
'And, entering the final stages
of the race,

1104
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,240
'Sabine was pushing hard
to hunt down Chris.'

1105
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,320
Come on, Chris,
keep that power going.

1106
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,720
This is so strong, just make sure
you look after the car.

1107
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,120
'But with Chris's car still
just about holding together,

1108
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,640
'Hammer racing claimed
another victim.'

1109
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,880
Oh, no. The car's smoking, we've
got smoke coming out of the back.

1110
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,960
- The car's on fire.
- Holy BLEEP!

1111
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,680
That looked like some bad smoke
coming out of Sabine's car.

1112
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,960
'So near the finish,
Sabine was determined to keep going.

1113
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,360
'But with the smoke
only getting worse,

1114
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,680
'as team manager, I had no choice.'

1115
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,680
All right, Sabine,
pull off, pull off.

1116
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,480
Pull off to the left.

1117
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,440
Stop, stop, stop!

1118
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,760
Way off the circuit.

1119
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,560
Get out of the car.

1120
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,240
You're in a safe spot to get out,
just get out.

1121
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,680
Just get out.

1122
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,720
Whaa!

1123
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,080
Is she all right?

1124
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,600
Yeah, she's out. She's OK.

1125
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,240
HE WHISTLES

1126
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,880
With Sabine safe,
but out of the race...

1127
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,000
The big trick is now to finish.

1128
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,520
..to claim the title
of fastest driver,

1129
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,200
I had just half a lap to go.

1130
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,760
All I could do was hold on and hope.

1131
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,080
Oh, my Lord.

1132
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,000
My legs are knackered,
my arms are knackered.

1133
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,760
I've got a mouth full of rocks
and I've got one gear.

1134
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,160
Oh! That nearly went over.

1135
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,680
Come on, more power, more power.

1136
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,840
'This had been one of
the toughest races of my life.

1137
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,200
'Bashed up.'

1138
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,280
Oh!

1139
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,520
'Bruised.'

1140
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,200
Oh, blimey.

1141
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,480
'Battered.'

1142
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,680
Oh...!

1143
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,200
Last corner.

1144
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,840
'And finally...'

1145
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,200
You beauty! You beauty!

1146
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,560
'..over.'

1147
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,040
I can safely say...

1148
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,760
..I'm not sure
if I could do that again.

1149
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1150
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,400
- Yes. - Congratulations to Chris.

1151
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,120
He finished fourth overall.
Amazing performance.

1152
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,200
And with that, I am delighted
to award you the prize

1153
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,720
for Top Gear's Fastest Driver
Apart From The Stig.

1154
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,080
Congratulations.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1155
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,400
Um, I'm not sure I can...

1156
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,280
I'm not sure I can accept that,
Rory.

1157
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,400
Of course you can accept it.
You earned it, you won!

1158
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,080
- You're a winner.
- I'll take the award,

1159
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,640
but the trophy is absolutely horrid.

1160
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,120
It's of a pigeon.

1161
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,160
Eddie, how did that event compare
to what you've seen in F1?

1162
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
Terrifying, absolutely.

1163
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,600
I had no idea
what I was letting myself in for.

1164
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,400
It was horrific.

1165
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,040
Formula 1, poles apart,
don't even compare the two.

1166
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,480
SABINE: I think so.
Quite different,

1167
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,840
but between the dust
and the boulders

1168
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,080
and the transmission problems
and, er...

1169
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,280
well, the fire,

1170
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,880
I'm not sure that's the best way
to determine who was fastest.

1171
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,120
- I'm really glad that we decided
to do best two out of three. - Right.

1172
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,280
I'm sorry?

1173
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,720
LAUGHTER

1174
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,640
We decided it was the best of three?
When?

1175
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,520
Yes, I did. Yeah.

1176
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Yeah, I mean, you're up for
another challenge, right, Sabine?

1177
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,240
Yeah.
Different cars, different course?

1178
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,880
Yeah, bring it on.

1179
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,440
I need a car that's well prepared,
which doesn't break down

1180
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,360
and I'll take that little trophy

1181
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,320
from that little racing driver
over there.

1182
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1183
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,440
- Chris Harris, do you accept
that challenge? - Sabine...

1184
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,840
It will be a pleasure to beat you
on another continent.

1185
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,200
Maybe this continent
is named Nurburgring?

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,760
- AUDIENCE OOHS
- Let's...let's see...

1187
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,480
Oh, that's worrying.
Let's see what happens.

1188
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,680
Sounds like it's on.
OK, on next week's show,

1189
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,440
a very green, very noisy Mercedes.

1190
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,480
- And a revolutionary road trip
across Cuba. - See you then.

1191
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,240
- Good night. - Good night. - Good night.

1192
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
