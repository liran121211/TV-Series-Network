Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

- We're back!

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,759

Whoo!

The way this is written,

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,639
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

All righty.

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,079
Wow, that's a lot for the eyes.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,239
Looks OK to me.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,719
OK... let's kick it off with this.

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,919
The LaFerrari.

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,679
Costs £1 million, and only
500 will ever be built.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,359
Interesting, isn't it,
that adding "La" to a name

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,479
makes it sound more exotic,

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,519
whereas "Le" - not so much, really.

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,839
LAUGHTER

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,319
I get it. I see what you did there.
You got... You got me.

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,119
We don't need to go into your last name.
All right.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,319
Anyhow, the LaFerrari.

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,279
You hear that, you think,
"Ferrari's VIP area," right?

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,279
The fastest, the most
advanced, the most exclusive.

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,359
Well, nearly. Because,
in the world of Ferrari,

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
turns out there's a V-VIP area -

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,239
- somewhere off-limits to us mere commoners.
- Mm-hm.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,960
Somewhere home to a truly
extraordinary machine.

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,239
Here it is, the Ferrari FXXK.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,360
And, no, that name is NOT accidental.

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,159
- Oh, my
- BLEEP
- days.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,239
It's based on the bones of
the LaFerrari hypercar,

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,120
but it's been intensified
in every department.

58
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,679
Only 40 will ever exist,

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,320
and it costs over £2 million.

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,039
Or at least it would, if you could buy it.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,639
Which you can't. Even if
you're a zillionaire,

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,639
you don't just phone up Ferrari
with your credit card details.

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,159
Oh, no.

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,319
First, you must have been
judged, in Ferrari's words,

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,559
to "have the right mind-set."

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You must be invited.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,799
In fact, the FXXK is so unattainable,

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm the first outsider ever
permitted to drive one.

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,919
ENGINE PURRS

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,479
So, just for today,

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,879
you can keep your LaFerraris,

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,639
your everyday hypercars.

more lightness,

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,439
more grip.

78
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,080
So much MORE.

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh! Oh!

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
The speed is preposterous!

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,999
If you believe it,

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,440
it has 1,050 horsepower.

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,720
That's 87 more than the LaFerrari road car.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,599
It's SO physical.

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
It gets inside your body.

87
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
Sensational, addictive,
mighty, corrupting power!

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,599
0 to 60 takes just over two seconds,

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,319
but this car lives way beyond that.

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,159
Just keeps going...

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,920
until your brain implodes...

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
..like a collapsing star!

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,839
Like the LaFerrari, the
FXXK has a KERS system

94
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,679
harvesting energy wasted underbraking.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,119
If I brake hard now,

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,519
I can feel a kind of pressure behind
my eyeballs, forcing them forward.

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,479
But here the system is F1 spec,

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,039
and when it uses that energy
to boost the performance

99
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,280
of the 6.3-litre V12 engine...

100
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,399
..it just bungs you down the road.

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,239
It's not like a normal car
experience of acceleration.

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,199
Here we go. I accelerate in third and...

103

ENGINE ROARS

104
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,559

Good Lord.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,599
And then there's the traction control.

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,359
Because Ferrari doesn't want to
kill its wealthiest customers,

108
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
they're some of the most
sophisticated systems

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,799
I've ever encountered.

110
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,599
I can just bury the throttle
coming out of turns,

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,319
and it just manages it beautifully.

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,639
I suppose part of the
thrill of this car is...

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,039
building up the courage to switch them off.

114
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
Well, you only live once.

HE LAUGHS

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,680
Now, this is a good way to ruin
some very expensive tyres.

119
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,799
Fortunately, changing them is easy,

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,679
because your £2 million FXXK

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,160
also comes with its very
own Ferrari pit crew...

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,679
..just like a modern Formula One car.

123
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,439
But, unlike a modern Formula One car,

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,959
it doesn't need to comply
with a great big rule book.

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,000
In fact, it doesn't need to comply
with the rule book... well, at all.

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,239
Ferrari basically said to its engineers,

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,759
"Knock yourselves out, do
whatever the hell you want.

128
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,319
"Just make it fast.

129
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
"CRAZY fast!"

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
And this being Ferrari...

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
..crazy fast on the straights
is just the start.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
The true nature of this car
lies in the way it corners.

ENGINE ROARS

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,799
The faster you go, the harder it sticks.
It's like a giant magnet.

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,920
You can't see it but, boy, can you feel it.

136
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,480
It's lawless, savage.

137
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,640
It's motorsport unlimited.

138
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,999
Unbound by rules,

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,839
the FXXK can delve deep
into the dark art of aero.

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,399
From that enormous active
wing to the insane diffuser,

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,720
its hunger for downforce crushes
the tyres into the tarmac.

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,519
The aero through this left-hander.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Wow! Into the deck.

144
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Right now, it feels about the
fasted thing ever made, to me.

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,159
'The performance of the
FXXK is so extraordinary,

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,679
'it recalibrates your understanding of...

147
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
'what a car is capable of.

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,159
'It's wonderful, intoxicating.

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,119
'It's so cutting-edge, it's...'

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
I got quite a high water temperature
now, so I need to just cool it down.

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,560
'..well, it's high maintenance.

152
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,039
'And that means your pit crew
will spend a lot of time

153
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,799
'fiddling about with stuff
you don't understand.'

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,999
Needs a reset on the, er...

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,239
Er...

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,679
And this ultimate Ferrari
thoroughbred is so extreme,

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,039
you can't drive it on the road,

158
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,079
and it doesn't qualify for
any existing race series.

ENGINES ECHO

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,519
So, as a car, the FXXK
doesn't really make sense.

161
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,239
But it's not meant to.

162
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,960
It's not really a car.

163
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,199
What it is is a ticket...

164
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
to the most exclusive private
members club on the planet.

165
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,120
And this club has one final
members-only benefit.

166
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,199
You see, up to now, the car
has been holding back,

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,920
saving power to make sure its
batteries never run flat.

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,279
But the FXXK has something
called Qualify Mode,

169
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,599
and that gives you all the petrol power

170
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,800
and all the electric power
in one massive hit.

171
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,079
Maximum attack for one lap only.
And, well...

172
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,319
since I've only got one lap left, well...

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
you can't take it with you.

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,879
1,050 horsepower!

175
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
What a car! What a day!

176
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Drink it up. Drink it
up, it's the last lap.

177
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,199
Unbelievable. I'll never
get to do that again.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm staggered I've had a chance
to do it in the first place.

179
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,200
When the world's electric...

180
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,600
..I think I'll remember this
day more than every other.

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

182
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,199
- Ooh. - Well, I didn't crash. - No, you
didn't. No, what an incredible car.

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,999
And I've got to be honest,
you drove the ass off it.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
One tiny point though, and
I don't mean to be picky,

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,999
- but you know this whole exclusive club thing?
- Mm-hm.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,479
OK, so what you're saying is,

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,919
if you're a very, very
special friend of Ferrari,

188
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,279
you might just be lucky enough
to receive an invitation

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,599
- to give them £2 million.
- Correct.

190
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,679
And in return, you get a car that, yeah,

191
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,759
is very fast and very pretty, but
it's essentially useless, right?

192
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,679
I mean, you can't drive it on the road,

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,559
you can't enter it in any race series,

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,119
you need a team of mechanics
to keep it running...

195
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,359
Also correct.

196
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,159
That's good business.

197
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,599
LAUGHTER

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,199
It is if you're Ferrari.

199
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,519
Now, this is the point we usually
hand the car over to Stig

200
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,199
to thrash around our test
track, but today, we can't.

201
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,759
It's just too cold out there.

202
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,559
The FXXK is on racing slicks and it
just won't get hot enough to work.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,599
We're sorry.

204
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,879
But we'll try to coax it back again
for a lap later in the series

205
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,999
- when the weather warms up a bit.
- Yes, we will. Rory.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,519
What a car.

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,959
And the high horsepower
thrills don't end there,

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,119
because later this series, and I
can't believe I got to do this,

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,559
but I drive the new Renault Twingo.

210
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,039
- Oh, yes.
- Wahey!
- Oh, yes.
- Ho, ho! APPLAUSE

211
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,600
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

212
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,279
OK. Now it is time to introduce
this week's studio guest.

213
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,479
He's the star of Atonement,
X-Men and Split.

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,879
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome James McAvoy.

215
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,080
WHISTLING

217
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,320
Welcome, welcome.

218
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,559
Now, James, I know you didn't get a
chauffeur to drop you down today.

219
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,119
- You drove yourself, right?
- I did, yes.
- OK, what did you drive?

220
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,959
- I drove my RS3.
- Nice, little pocket rocket.
- Little ninja, yeah.

221
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,719
- 300 plus horsepower there.
- Uh, if you say so.

222
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,359
Yeah, I just know it goes fast, man.
It goes fast.

223
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,919
So you have a driver's licence now,

224
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,519
but didn't you drive for years without one?

225
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,399
This is the weird thing. I
played a car thief in Shameless

226
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,199
and I had to drive many beautiful cars

227
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,759
and nobody ever asked me if
I had a driver's licence,

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,279
so I didn't, I didn't offer it up.

229
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,519
- I didn't get a driver's licence until six years later.
- Hang on.

230
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,639
You're painting quite a picture for us.

231
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,879
Any other bad behaviour you
want to come clean with?

232
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,759
I do actually have a clean driver's
licence, but I did have a...

233
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,639
I had a provisional driver's licence
just for riding a 125 scooter

234
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,199
before I grew up and got
a big bike, and, erm...

235
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,359
I got 11 points on my provisional licence.

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,919
- LAUGHTER
- Yeah.

237
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,719
The guy, the policeman that took me aside

238
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,239
was like, "I'm probably going
to let you off with it",

239
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,359
and his partner was like shouting
from the car going, "No way!

240
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,959
"He's going down! This is unbelievable!"

241
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,759
So, yeah, they put me
in the back of the car

242
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,319
and made me feel like a drug dealer.

243
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,399
All right, now, you didn't just come
down here to enjoy our company,

244
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,719
because, frankly, who would do that?
No, no.

245
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,519
- You came here to drive fast around our track.
- Yes.

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,519
And the first thing that everyone
here should know is that

247
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,479
the original Top Gear track is back!

248
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

249
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,199
And here's the other thing you
need to know, we've got a new car.

250
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,439
And after all those Lianas
and Lacettis and Cee'ds...

251
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,879
- I'm still a big fan of the Cee'd.
- That's cos you were quick in it.

252
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,039
We decided it was high time for
something a bit more exciting,

253
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,759
something rear-wheel drive, something fast.

254
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,239
That's right, but not too fast,

255
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,279
cos we're talking about celebrities here,

256
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,519
not responsible adults.

257
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,839
Which meant there was
only one car for the job,

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,639
and I mean literally only one car.

259
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,839
Introducing our new reasonably fast car,

260
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,959
it's the Toyota GT86.

261
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

262
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,039
Drive it well and it's so much fun,
but get it wrong and you will spin.

263
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,679
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, so do I. From experience I can guarantee it.

264
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,399
Right, so, obviously we're not
going to send you out there

265
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,759
without a little bit of instruction, so...

266
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,639
Do you remember at school that one teacher

267
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,519
who really inspired you,
nurtured you, believed in you?

268
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,239
Well, our instructor is
exactly the opposite of that.

269
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,799
He's mad, he's tiny, his head is
very shiny, it's Chris Harris.

270
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

271
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,759
Welcome to the Toyota GT86.

272
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,559
Your performance reflects on me.

273
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,440
- All right, mate.
- So you've got to listen.
- What?
- OK?

274
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,399
Aim for the 50 metre board.

275
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,759
Don't try and be funny. Fourth gear.

276
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,319
When I say "brake", brake. Brake!

277
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,080
CAR SCREECHES

278
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,439
- Listen! Listen, James.
- I am.

279
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,559
Over that way. Do what you're told.

280
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,239
My hand's over there. Look, third gear.
Third gear.

281
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,079
- Third gear, that's second, you...
- BLEEP

282
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,520
- Third! Third!
- CAR SCREECHES

283
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,599
Argh!

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,759
Aw!

285
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
- OK.
- Whoo!

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,439
You have to listen to the next bit,

287
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,599
otherwise we both end up being
looked for through dental records.

288
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,119
Fourth gear. Fourth gear.

289
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,400
CAR SCREECHES

290
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
JAMES LAUGHS

291
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,039
Yes!

292
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,719
I wish they'd given me someone
talented for this first episode,

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,480
cos it would look so good
for my coaching skills.

294
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,799
Oh, my lord.

295
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,479
And over the line.

296
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
And stop.

297
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,279
And never...

298
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,319
- BLEEP
- ..do that to me again.

299
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,799
- You loved it.
- Jesus Christ.
- You loved it.

300
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,000
APPLAUSE

301
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,920
MATT LAUGHS

302
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,999
Well, very nice, very nice.

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,239
I'm beginning to see why that
career as a hostage negotiator

304
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,639
never worked out for you.

305
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,399
OK, seriously, Harris, that is
no way to speak to our guest.

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,999
Absolutely not.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,399
Do you know what? I kind of liked it.

308
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,919
I like to be treated rough sometimes.

309
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,079
- That's just...
- LAUGHTER

310
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,919
Well, anyway, we are looking
forward to seeing your timed lap

311
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,719
a little bit later. But
first, here's a question...

312
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,839
£150,000, something fun for
the summer, what do you buy?

313
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,479
- Er, GT3 RS.
- OK, Rory?

314
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,759
- McLaren 570?
- Mm-hm.

315
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,879
Yellow Ford Capri with black stripes on it.

316
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,479
LAUGHTER OK.

317
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,839
- OK, all good.
- Thanks.
- All good. All wrong.

318
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,079
Because the most fun you can have
for £150,000 is one of these.

319
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,039
GENTLE LAUGHTER

320
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,039
- That's a Hobbit caravan.
- No. No, that's a pressure washer.

321
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,359
So it's a pressure washer
for £150,000 Sterling.

322
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,759
What are you going to wash with that?

323
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,479
I'm going to wash a melon, a shed
and a Volvo. Check this out.

324
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,919
This is the Karcher Ecomaster mark three.

325
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,759
It runs at about 2,800 bar of pressure.

326
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,079
That's... about 40,611 PSI.

327
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,799
Roughly. Exactly.

328
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,879
This cleans stuff really well.

329
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Watch this.

330
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,879
There you have it!

331
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,439
Clean!

332
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Clean as a whistle!

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,119
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

334
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,160
Am I right? That's good.
That thing's great.

335
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,799
- Your handwriting is appalling.
- LAUGHTER

336
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,359
Don't pretend you're not jealous.

337
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,479
Right, I need to vent about something.

338
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,679
The other night I was watching Ronin, OK?

339
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,479
- Ronin, that film that came out, what? 20 years ago?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,119
- Always up-to-date.
- Stop that. Look,

341
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,039
one of the best on-screen car
chases of all time. Agreed?

342
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,679
- FROM AUDIENCE:
- Yes.
- OK.

343
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,039
But I've spotted something
that's troubling me, vexing me.

344
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,080
Have a look at this.

345
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,959
- GUNSHOT
- Wait there! There!

346
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,599
- How annoying is that? Did you see that?
- What?
- See what?

347
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,839
- You saw that.
- What?!
- There.

348
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,919
BMW E34 M5 1990, turbine design wheel,

349
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,359
cool for brake distance,
that kind of thing.

350
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,399
Cut to... That's not an M5 wheel.

351
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,439
- LAUGHTER
- That's the...

352
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,399
That's from a 535i. It's
a continuity nightmare.

353
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,639
How long are you planning
on being a virgin?

354
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,879
LAUGHTER

355
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,240
APPLAUSE

356
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,999
I could help you out.

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,799
Look, you work in film, you
saw that, that's a nightmare.

358
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,639
- Yeah, right? - This has been bothering
me... Can I do one more? - Go ahead.

359
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,039
..bothering me since 1987. Withnail And I.
Great film?

360
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,199
- A wonderful film.
- You must know it line by line.
- Yeah... Go on, then.

361
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,439
Continuity nightmare.

362
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Watch this.

363
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,239
Withnail, car.

364
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,599
There!

365
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,919
- Where? What?
- You saw it.

366
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,519
- Saw what?
- You saw it!

367
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,359
Withnail is set in 1969, OK?

368
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,839
It's the end of the '60s, it's apocalyptic.

369
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,599
Right in the background is a
Volvo 340 DL, launched in...

370
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,839
1976! Even worse, the red smudge behind it,

371
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,599
Nissan Sunny, 1981.

372
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,599
- LAUGHTER
- It's terrible.

373
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,519
Imagine, OK, Gladiator,
Russell Crowe struts in,

374
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,359
"I'm the father of someone... got murdered,

375
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,079
"I'm generally fed up with
life," toga, look down below.

376
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,119
- Air Jordans.
- LAUGHTER

377
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,319
You're not going to suffer that.
It's not good.

378
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,999
It is literally,

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,079
literally... nothing like that. OK?

380
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,039
In fairness, though, I
do hate film mistakes.

381
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,719
- You know Mad Max Fury Road?
- Yeah.

382
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,679
OK, if you look really close,
really, really closely,

383
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,359
don't blink, you'll miss it,

384
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,239
you'll see that they cast
Tom Hardy instead of me.

385
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,879
LAUGHTER

386
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,359
Look real close. You can see it.

387
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,279
Anyway, moving on, a couple
of months back the producers

388
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,079
told us to tackle a serious
consumer question.

389
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,759
Specifically this one...

390
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,439
What is the most reliable
new car on sale today?

391
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,439
And we said, "Well,
that's a stupid question.

392
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,279
"New cars can't be reliable. They're new.

393
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,719
"You have to earn reliability
over lots and lots of miles."

394
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,559
If a car's driven to, say, the moon
and back, and it's still going,

395
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,039
now that's proof of reliability.

396
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,999
That's right, so our producer
said, "All right, you're on."

397
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,639
They told us each to go buy a car

398
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,759
that HAD driven to the moon and back.

399
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,679
Well, the Earth equivalent.

400
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,559
480,000 miles on the clock. So we did.

401
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,519
And they shipped them off for a
series of reliability challenges

402
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,279
in the middle of nowhere.

403
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,800
A little place called Kazakhstan.

404
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,999
So...

405
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,879
Kazakhstan.

406
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Shall we go and find our cars?

407
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,559
- Three containers, gentlemen.
- Who wants to go first?

408
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,080
- Can I go first?
- Go for it.

409
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
You're going to love it.

410
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,559
What do you think he's got?

411
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,359
Some kind of mental issue.

412
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,039
RORY LAUGHS

413
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,999
- It's definitely a sports car, no?
- Yeah, it's got to be.

414
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,519
- A high mileage Ferrari, perhaps?
- Maserati.

415
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,399
- High mileage Maserati?
- Yeah.

416
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,839
Which is, you know, a horrible idea.

417
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,319
- 'But Chris surprised us both.' Oh!
- That's not Italian.

418
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,959
That's not Italian at all. RORY LAUGHS

419
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,759
A Volvo?

420
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,999
The Volvo V70.

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,239
You want reliability, you go to
Sweden, gentlemen. You know that.

422
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,959
She's a minter.

423
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,199
I don't want to patronise you, but
you know that in the Arctic Circle

424
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,199
a reliable car is the difference
between life and death.

425
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,759
But you're not playing a housewife
in this film. That's the thing.

426
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,479
Look, I know, it's not going
to set any pulses racing,

427
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,159
but V70s in this generation
are very, very strong.

428
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,759
Manual gearbox for a bit of fun,
and there's a button in there

429
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,239
that's for heated seats,

430
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,879
and I wonder whether either of
you two have that function.

431
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,440
- Shall we see your car, Matt?
- THEY LAUGH

432
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
That's really sad, mate.

433
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,639
Forget Sweden.

434
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,359
You want reliability?

435
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,559
- CHRIS LAUGHS
- He's got it!

436
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,799
THEY LAUGH

437
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,879
- Right, here we go.
- He's got a Merc.

438
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,479
Now, he thinks he's just
bought into the ultimate brand

439
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,920
- of reliability, but little does he know.
- Come on now.

440
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,239
- Huh?
- Explain yourself.

441
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,239
Mercedes, the symbol,

442
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,599
the quintessential symbol
of quality, right?

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,119
You go anywhere in the world,

444
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,719
you see these E-Classes
just rattling along,

445
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,039
clicking off the miles, reliability,
reliability, reliability.

446
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,639
Do you understand the
significance of the colour?

447
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,479
It's like a beige, kind of like
a granny's living room colour.

448
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,999
- You know why it's that colour?
- I don't know.

449
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,079
That was a taxi cab, that
was a German taxi cab,

450
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,239
- probably from the Berlin area.
- What?

451
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,199
So that's had the hardest life imaginable.

452
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,319
While Matt came to terms
with his new taxi...

453
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,159
- But it's still an E-Class.
- ..I went to fetch... mine.

454
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,959
MUSIC: London Calling by the Clash

455
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,599
Oh, my God.

456
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,279
MATT LAUGHS

457
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,959
What were you thinking?

458
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't know what to say.

459
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,359
CHRIS WHEEZES AND LAUGHS

460
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,799
Look, you want to talk reliability?

461
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,799
This has got to be in the conversation, OK?

462
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,479
London taxi, utterly bombproof.

463
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,839
Come the apocalypse, there will only
be cockroaches and London cabs.

464
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,719
I don't know where to begin, Rory.

465
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,039
Look, first of all,

466
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,519
these vehicles are designed to
cover very short distances.

467
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,919
Maybe 40, 50 miles at a stretch.

468
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,079
Beyond that, they are purgatory.

469
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,119
Well, that's neither here nor there.

470
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,279
Also, people visit London to come
and see the London black cab.

471
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,559
No, they don't.

472
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,159
They get in that piece of crap
to go see something else.

473
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,519
Tell me the best thing about this car.

474
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,959
The best thing about this car,
turning circle, 7.62 metres.

475
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,399
I can run rings around your cars.

476
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,999
Right.

477
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,959
But before he could get in and show
us, a man appeared in an old Lada.

478
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,680
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

479
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
Wheel bearing's gone.

480
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,759
"You and your high-milers
will now undertake

481
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,039
"a series of reliability
challenges as you cross Kazakhstan

482
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,239
"to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

483
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,359
"which is home to the Soviet
Union's space programme.

484
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,079
"There's a rocket launch in two days.
Be there."

485
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,799
- We're going to a rocket launch?
- No, no, no.

486
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,519
Those of us that have a car that's
going to make it to a rocket launch

487
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,959
are going to a rocket launch.

488
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,359
You two are going to die on the Steppe.

489
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Why do you have to be like that?

490
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,839
Yes, ahead of us lay the Steppe,

491
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,839
a vast desert of unforgiving
terrain and extreme temperatures,

492
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,359
certain to test our
high-miler's reliability.

493
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,679
The journey would lead us
to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

494
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,040
the world's largest, oldest
space launch facility.

495
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,239
And the home of the
Russian space programme.

496
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,639
Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin,

497
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,879
even the first piece of the
International Space Station,

498
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,399
all were launched from
this 3,000 square mile

499
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,120
Russian-controlled facility...

500
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,119
..but with only two days to get there,

501
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,840
we had a lot of ground to cover.

502
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,519
I was just thinking, you see a
car with 100,000 miles on it,

503
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,359
you think, right, time to get a new
one, that's pretty much worn out.

504
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,479
That's not what we've
done, we've gone for cars

505
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,039
that have 500,000 miles on
them, and mine runs fine.

506
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,799
- How does yours run?
- My cab hasn't aged a bit.

507
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,039
- What did you say? It was a piece of
- BLEEP?

RORY LAUGHS

509
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,679
This taxi is a bit of a shed.

510
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,479
I've just discovered that
my heating doesn't work -

511
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,439
and that's a bad thing,
because in Kazakhstan

512
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,000
it's currently minus 12 degrees outside.

513
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,079
First impressions, very impressive.

514
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,559
Doesn't really rattle or
shake, it's remarkable.

515
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,799
Let's face it, Volvos are so reliable.

516
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,319
If this thing does break down,

517
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,120
there'd probably be a national
day of mourning in Sweden.

518
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,079
Guys, I don't have any heating
whatsoever in my cab.

519
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,599
The sun's out, Rory. Think
positive, think warm.

520
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,639
I'm going to die of pneumonia, man!

521
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080

made a start for Baikonur

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,879

528

we find another road?

- Thanks, Chris.

- What do you mean, what happened?

586
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,599
- You weren't moving.
- I lost drive.

587
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,839
Coming up the hill, the
transmission kind of let go.

588

I'll tell you what happened.

589
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,079
- I just won the race in the black cab!
- Honestly, I'm disappointed.

590
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,239
I was coming past you,
and you were stationary.

591
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,759
- You weren't coming past me.
- I was. I was pushing you up the hill.

592
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,439
No, I was putting the moves
on you, I was blocking you.

593
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,519
So you reckon you were not
being pushed up the hill?

594
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,239
I was defensive driving
the hell out of you.

595
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,519
- You weren't aware you were being pushed up the hill?
- Yeah,

596
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,479
- but that was enough to stay ahead!

over the finish line!

598
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
I'm feeling slightly guilty.

599
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,199
This car has lived for 13
years and 570,000 miles.

600
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,679
And I've had it 42 miles.

601
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,439
42 miles!

602
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,959
The last one was probably the most special.

603
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,759
- Meanwhile...
- Yeah.
- ..pristine, good as new.

604
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,359
I can change that quite quickly for you.

605
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,080

Your Volvo looks like the Terminator

609
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,999
I removed a quarter of the front of the car

610
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,399
and the warning system simply tells
me, "Bulb failure, dipped beam".

611
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,920
That's how tough this car is.
That's Nordic strength.

612
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,999
And also, the airbox has
been a bit squashed

613
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,959
which means it now sounds like
a full-house Audi Quattro.

614
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,039

Is it really?

628
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,519
On a smaller scale, this country
was the origin of the apple tree,

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,039
'the little blue Lada
had a taste for blood.'

682
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,080
I'm going to hit the brake
and let him fly past me!

683
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,519
He's missed! The blue Lada has missed!

684
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,799
'But then, it wasn't the blue
Lada I needed to worry about.'

685
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,439
Oh, Harris is behind me.

686
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,720
No, no, no, no!

687
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,639
- Give you a little tap, Rory.
- THUD

688
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,360
Oh, Harris has got me!

689
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,479
A slight bonnet issue now,
a slight bonnet issue.

RORY GUFFAWS

691
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,719
'With one increasingly battered
Volvo left in the running,

692
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,879
'it should have been easy pickings
for the two remaining Ladas,

693
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,439
'but Harris doesn't give up easily.'

694
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm on the blue Lada now.

695
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,159
Come on, Harris, get him, get
him, get him, get him, get him!

696
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm going to tap him, I'm going to tap him.

CHEERING

698
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,160
A bit harsh, but there we go.
He needed to know I was there!

699
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,400
Right, come on. This is the endgame.

700
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,160
He's chasing down the last Lada right now.
I think he might do it.

701
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,999
I can't actually see anything. Where is he?

702
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,919
Ooh, there he is. Nudge.

703
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,519
He's got him!

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,679
Victory.

707
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,440
Finally, the Volvo gets something.

708
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,439
Way to go, Harris, all right!

709
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,559
Why is he always finishing
races with his bonnet up?

710
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,439
Oh, I... It's an aero device, gives
me a bit of extra front downforce.

711

RORY LAUGHS

712
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,919
A couple more screws in the
bonnet this time, I think.

713
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,399
Yeah, I think so. We'll get there.
We'll get the old girl to Baikonur.

714
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,639
I want to see a rocket go off.

715
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,120
To Baikonur!

716
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,040
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

717
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,759
You know, honestly, before that trip,

718
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,359
I had no idea that Kazakhstan was real.

719
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,479
I thought it was one of
those made-up places

720
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,439
like Timbuktu or Guernsey.

721
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,799
GENTLE LAUGHTER

722
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
Those are both real places.

723
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,879
I know. GENTLE LAUGHTER

724
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,119
OK, James, to recap what happened there

725
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,119
for everyone's benefit and yours is that

726
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,319
the taxi won the race around the quarry.
All right!

727
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,439
CHEERING

728
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,279
- Yeah, yeah?
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance!

729
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,359
I won the race around the
goat sacrifice temple.

730
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,119
Yeah, and Matt's Mercedes...

731
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,319
No, no, no, don't, don't do it.
Don't bad-mouth the Mercedes.

732
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,159
Don't do it, because we're in the presence

733
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,799
of another lover of classic Merc, right?

734
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,679
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Am I right? Now, is it true

735
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,079
that you once owned Idi Amin's Mercedes SL?

736
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,039
- JAMES LAUGHS
- Erm...

737
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,119
I was in a movie called The
Last King Of Scotland,

738
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,279
and at the end of that movie, they
gave me this car that I drove in,

739
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,879
which I didn't know at the time

740
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,759
but it had belonged to somebody

741
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,159
and Idi Amin had given it to that person.

742
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,119
So they said at the end of
the movie I could have it.

743
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,239
But, again, I didn't
have a driver's licence

744
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,359
and I didn't really fancy
driving it back from Uganda.

745
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,439
So I left it. I just left it there.

746
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,959
I think they gave it to my driver,
he was a nice guy called Fred.

747
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,359
Nice. Way to go, Fred.

748
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,159
Right, now, it's time to find out
how you went around the track

749
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,799
in our new reasonably fast car. Come on.
How did it go out there?

750
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,439
Well, I don't think it went that well.
But it was a tonne of fun.

751
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,319
- Well, what do you think? Let's see how you did.
- OK.

752
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,959
'So, here we go, then.
Soaking wet track for James.

753
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,079
'Off the line. Traction control on.'

754
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,999
Big balls. Big, big balls,
that's all you need.

755
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,879
'I don't disagree with you. Coming
up towards the first corner.'

756
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,439
Wetter than a waterfall in a monsoon.

757
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,439
'This braking's going to be tough.

758
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,799
'There's a direction change
and also a surface change.

759
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,879
'The grip levels there are terrible.

760
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,959
'Best to stay on the track, I find, there!'

761
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,559
Shut it!

762
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,159
'Blending left, turning right into Chicago.

763
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,199
'The inside line is off the
frame at the moment so,

764
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,119
'actually, there's grip
around the outside.'

765
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,400
Come on!

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,119
'Now, this is the long
drag toward Hammerhead.

the warning lights,

'you were braking so
hard, that must be good.

769
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,559
'The car's going to oversteer a bit, is it?
Yeah, there it goes.'

770
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,599
Whoo!

771
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,679
'I'd like to say you caught that. It
wasn't, the electronics caught it.

mid-gear change slide.

'You think you're saving that, you're not.

- APPLAUSE
- Thank you.
- Good effort.

787
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,759
Honestly...

788
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,039
Can I just say, before we go anywhere,

789
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,079
it was so slippery out there today.

790
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,679
- It really was treacherous.
- Yes.

791
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,319
- But it was a lot of fun because it was.
- It was a good run.

792
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,799
OK, new car means a new lap board.

793
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,919
We've already had a test day
where we sent a bunch of celebs

794
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,039
out in the GT 86 to lay down some markers.

795
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,879
You can watch how they
did over on Extra Gear.

796
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,639
But the fastest time so
far is one minute 39.5

797
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,559
from Olympic double gold-winning
gymnast Max Whitlock.

798
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,439
Oh, I loved his pommel routine,
did you ever see that?

799
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,119
GENTLE LAUGHTER Elegant...
Anyway, all right.

800
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,919
James, and Chris, because,
frankly, this is your fault

801
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,439
if he doesn't go straight to the
top, you were his instructor. Right.

802
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,519
- Feeling confident?
- Mm, not really. A little bit...

803
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,119
- Come on!
- Go on, show me.

804
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,839
All right. You did it in the
wet, so it's a wet time.

805
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:33,199
- One minute... 47.1.
- Yes... yes..

806
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,079
- Oh! That's not bad. That's not bad.
- APPLAUSE

807
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,439
That's not bad.

808
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,959
- Thank you. That's not bad.
- That's awesome. Not bad at all.

809
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,119
Right underneath Ore Oduba there.

810
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,119
- A fine effort.
- Congratulations.
- I'm the only one in the wet.

811
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,839
That's good. That is good.

812
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,079
Only one in the wet.

813
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,079
I think you guys will have
a lot of fun this season

814
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,479
with the celebrities in that car

815
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,839
because you just can't control it

816
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,639
like you could that Cee'd
that we both drove.

817
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,919
- When you say "fun", do you mean death?
- Yeah!

818
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,959
LAUGHTER

819
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,879
All right, James, thank you so much
for coming down and playing with us.

820
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,159
Ladies and gentlemen, James McAvoy!

821
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,600
- APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING
- Thank you!

822
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,199
Now, time to return to
our high-mile challenge.

823
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,759
Earlier on, the three of
us each had bought a car

824
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,879
that had driven to the moon and back.

825
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,439
And we were crossing Kazakhstan

826
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,520
for an appointment with the big rocket.

827
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,719
We awoke to the chill of
another morning in Kazakhstan.

828
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,039
And Chris noticed that
overnight I had been busy.

829
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,719
Matt, what's going on with
the back of your car?

830
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,039
Was it abducted last night by a
band of amateur scaffolding people?

831
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,159
You know that the little thing you gave me

832
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,840
that lifted the ascent of
the car up about four feet?

833
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
Well, that's me being cautious

834
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,839
and just trying to preserve the
rear end of this Mercedes.

835
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,519
Despite the previous day's trials,
all three of our high-milers

836
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,479
were still in the hunt for Baikonur.

837
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,679
But since we had the place to ourselves,

838
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,759
Rory had an idea to see whose
car was holding together best.

839
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,519
How about a top speed challenge?

840
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,599
But here's the twist - this
is all about reliability.

841
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,959
So I think we should find
out whose car gets closest

842
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,879
to their manufacturer's claimed top speed.

843
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,519
- That sounds good.
- Chris, you're up first.

844
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,959
And the Volvo's top speed?

845
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,439
125mph.

846
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,879
Three, two, one, go for it!

847
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,279
WHEELS SPIN

848
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,959
ENGINE ROARS

849
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,600
- It's pretty aggressive.
- Yeah.

850
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,279
That's the half a million mile
clutch he's working with.

851
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,599
THEY CHUCKLE

852
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,479
Come on, Volvo!

853
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,039
Fourth, come on.

854
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,519
That's 90.

855
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,680
If Volvos are as reliable as he says
they are, this should be no problem.

856
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,239
I'm not even 100.

857
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,280
Not even 100, come on!

858
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,000
- How are the kids?
- Good. Yours?
- Yeah, not too bad.

859
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,959
- All right.
- Right.

860
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,519
- How did we do?
- I blame you for what just happened there.

861
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,479
I've got terrible aero and no
power cos my airbox has moved

862
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,279
because you stopped your vehicle on
the first challenge, and I hit you.

863
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,799
- That's my fault?
- Yeah, that's your fault.

864
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,239
- Who hit who?
- Who stopped?
- Who hit who?
- Who stopped?

865
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,999
- Who hit who?
- I couldn't have hit the thing if it hadn't stopped.

866
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,079
If there's a policeman standing
there, you'd be in trouble.

867
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,119
Do they have policeman at race circuits?

868
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,199
It wasn't a race circuit, we
were in a hole in the ground.

869
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,999
THEY ALL LAUGH

870
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,479
Look, the news is, 104mph,

871
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,719
which is not good enough cos
this thing should do 124, 125.

872
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,839
So I'm 20mph back. So go and do
your worst, I'm going to lose.

873
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,319
Next up, my European E-Class,

874
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,839
with its 180 kilometres per hour top speed.

875
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,160
Go!

876
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,600
There's 100.

877
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,680
There's 120.

878
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,600
- Did they really invent apples in Kazakhstan?
- Yeah, apparently.

879
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,879
I just think, if they invented the apple,

880
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,479
then we should try an
actual Kazakhstani apple.

881
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,839
I'd love to have an apple.

882
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,319
155.

883
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,039
Russet's that sort of thick-skinned,
amber-coloured apple,

884
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
delicious things. The juice from
them makes a very good drink.

885
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,239
- Come on, then, what's the number?
- Take a guess.

886
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,879
160.

887
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,079
- Wow, on the money.
- 160?
- 160, that's about 100 miles an hour.

888
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,239
So, by getting within about 12mph
of my top speed, I had edged Chris.

889
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,879
But I'd left the door open
for Rory's 81mph taxi.

890
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,599
Go!

891
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,519
- Come on, black can.
- Takes off like a shot.

892
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,039
40.

893
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,199
45.

894
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,119
He was hardly the figure of
humility when he won last time,

895
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,959
what's he going to be like this time?

896
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,999
81mph.

897
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,039
Ahhh! Yeah!

898
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,079
Unbearable.

899
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,359
RORY LAUGHS

900
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,559
It just gets better with time.

901
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,519
Like a fine wine.

902
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,559
Right, gentlemen.

903
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,839
Give me the good news or the bad news.

904
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,319
Well, I'm afraid it's bad news
for you, but good news for me.

905
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,080
I managed 84mph.

906
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,319
3mph more than the
manufacturer's quoted top speed.

907
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,279
- What?
- 84mph.
- Really?

908
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,799
- Hey, come on, you got to give it up for the taxi, right?
- Yeah.

909
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,960
- I guess so, yeah.
- Jump back in your cars, see if you can keep up.

910
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,519
Nice one...

911
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,880
(A-hole.)

912
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,239
I didn't expect the taxi
to go faster than it did

913
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,319
when it left the factory.

914
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,759
That's amazing.

915
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,399
With begrudging respect for
the black cab, we headed on.

916
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,359
And before long, I made a discovery.

917
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,559
Hey, there's a David Hasselhoff
cassette in the stereo.

918
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,919
Check it out.

919
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,119
♪ I've been looking for freedom

920
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,320

921
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,360
He's been looking for freedom,
but it can't be found.

922
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,720
But as the hours dragged on...

923
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm finding the flatness
quite imposing now.

924
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,080
You wouldn't want to break
down out here, would you?

925
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,879
..we were told to head to
our last overnight stop...

926
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,039
So that's it, that's quite
literally the end of the road.

927
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,799
..located somewhere
within the vast emptiness

928
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,560
that surrounded the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

929
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,719
That's a dried up salt bed.

930
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,199
Wow!

931
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,760
That's like Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

932
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,119
Driving on into the dark, inky gloom,

933
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,039
eventually we arrived at our overnight stop

934
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,840
where our final challenge awaited.

935
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,959
- Oh, hello.
- What does it say?

936
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,199
It says, "Tomorrow you drive to Baikonur.

937
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,239
"You must reach the border gate by 2pm.

938
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,039
"At 9am tomorrow, your
mileage trips will be reset.

939
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,919
"The winner is the high-miler
that racks up the most miles

940
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,239
"over the subsequent five hours.

941
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,559
"Only the winning car
will attend the launch.

942
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,759
"The two losing cars will be
sentenced to hard labour."

943
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,159
All right, OK.

944
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,199
♪ I'm looking for freedom... ♪

945
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,439
You know what I'm going
to do when I get home?

946
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,519
I'm going to dig out my Hoff collection.

947
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,960
You should go to a doctor.

948
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,400
With the rest of the night to
consider our strategies...

949
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,080
..the next morning, we awoke
to a tantalising sight.

950
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,759
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, yeah, look at that!

951
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,440
Yes, the Baikonur Cosmodrome
was almost within reach.

952
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,439
But with our trip meters covered and reset,

953
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,399
first there was a challenge to win.

954
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,199
And Chris was late.

955
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,519
LAUGHTER

956
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,039
What have you done?

957
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,280
Mind your own business, Matthew.

958
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,439
All right, all right. Most miles
when we get to Baikonur wins.

959
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,719
Three... two...

960
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
one, let's rock.

961
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,279
If he's going to roar it,
why's he not moving?

962
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,520
I don't know, and maybe the
taxi finally packed it in.

963
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,079
So, clearly I'm not going to beat
those guys in a head-to-head race.

964
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,519
I need to be smart about this challenge,

965
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,760
and approach things with
a bit more cunning.

966
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,159
A cagey start from the others,

967
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,039
but my plan was simple -

968
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,239
more speed means more miles.

969
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,479
The easy way to make your car
quicker is to lose weight.

970
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,959
Seats are gone,

971
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,680
door panels gone.

972
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,519
And I figured the best place to
take my new superlight racer

973
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,999
was back to Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

974
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,159
Even if that did mean...

975
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,840
another lengthy, off-road
drive to reach it.

976
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,759
Meanwhile, in Harris's Volvo...

977
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,879
Ha-ha, a road!

978
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,159
..Chris was heading for a nearby town

979
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,719
with his own harebrained strategy.

980
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,519
Speed is in the mind, so
to change my mind-set,

981
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,240
I've invoked Volvo's racing history here.

982
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,559
You remember?

983
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,679
The year was 1994 and
British touring car legend

984
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,000
Rickard Rydell debuted
the Volvo 850 Estate.

985
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,480
Surely the coolest estate car ever.

986
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,919
Add to that a... perfectly
safe range-extending fuel tank

987
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,599
and you have the ultimate
high-mileage maker.

988
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,319
I just needed somewhere to use it.

989
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,199
So, I did a bit of research last night.

990
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,959
There is an airfield near here,
I don't quite know where,

991
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,679
but I know it's nearby.

992
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,439
The second thing I did last night
was to learn a Russian phrase.

993
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,119
"Where's the airfield?"

994
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,079
Here we are, I'll ask this woman here.

996
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,719
No, she didn't want to know.

997
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,719
She didn't want to...

998
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,839
'Now, while the others wasted valuable time

999
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,479

00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,799

00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,200
'..I opted for a short cut.'

1003
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,079
Right, this is it.

1004
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,560
Let the high mileage begin.

1005
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,200

say, "Is that Rickard Rydell?"

Woohoo!

1013
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,439
Now, this is what I call easy miles.

1014
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,439

not too hard on the car.

What the hell was that?

1017
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,119
Something's come wildly loose,

1018
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,919
I don't know if it's that
bar on the back or what.

1019
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,199
In fact, it was worse.

1020
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,999
And with no time to lose,

1021
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
the Mercedes needed the delicate
touch of a professional.

1022
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,920
Saved a little more weight.

1023
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,840
After a slow start over in the Volvo...

1024
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,840
..Rickard Rydell had finally
found his airfield.

1025
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,960
100 miles an hour.

1026
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,600
What a place!

1027
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,239
High banking at Daytona.

1028
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,879
I really like this car.

1029
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,519
She may be old, she may be almost worn out,

1030
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,039
but she's got heart, she really does.

1031
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,199
'After three hours of flat-out,
lightweight racing though...'

1032
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,359
A fuel light just came on.

1033
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,559
'..it was time to start
the long drive back.'

1034
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,560
OK, Baikonur!

1035
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,760
Now, Rory was also running low on
fuel, but he had thought ahead.

1036
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,520
- Ouch!
- BLEEP!

1037
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,680
No!

1038
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,360
Oh, that is dead.

1039
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,680
That's dead, isn't it?
That's definitely dead.

1040
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,879
Oh, man!

1041
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,160
Back in my range-extended Volvo,
things were looking tasty.

1042
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,479
I'm averaging a lot of miles an hour here.

1043
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,280
A lot of miles an hour.

1044
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,439
And while I was piling
on the miles, Matt...

1045
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,839
wasn't.

1046
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,439
All right, finally a
little bit of smooth road.

1047
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,919
CLUNKING

1048
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,319
Oh, spoke too soon.

1049
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,000
But then, somehow...

1050
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,320
..the cab was back.

1051
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,800
How is this car still running?
Unbelievable!

1052
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,920
I love this car.

1053
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,439
We're a team.

1054
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,720
Whatever happens, we're a team.

1055
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,079
'And at last...'

1056
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,959
This is it, this is it.

1057
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,959
'..this team reached the
entrance to the Cosmodrome.'

1058
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,359
I'm the first one here,

1059
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,799
so I may as well do a few of my
legendary tiny turning circles.

1060
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,120
Every mile counts. Every mile counts.

1061
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,359
And with just a few minutes left...

1062
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,679
Hey, there you are!

1063
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,479
..it was a desperate fight to add distance.

1064
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,160
I can add some miles too, man,
two can play at that game.

1065
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,560
Where's Harris?

1066
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,240
- Oh,
- BLEEP!

1067
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,880
Rory, Rory, that's it. Two o'clock.
Two o'clock, the party is over.

1068
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,479
How's your head? Dizzy?

1069
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,520
Dizzy.

1070
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,279
That is becoming his signature look.

1071
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,480
Maybe he can't see where he's going.

1072
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,999
- Gentlemen.
- How did you do?

1073
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,639
- Well, quietly confident, but let's see what happens.
- Who's this?

1074
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,120
He must be checking the mileage.

1075
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,440
He's got a lovely wrist
action on that ratchet.

1076
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,680
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- OK, Matt.

1077
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,319
OK, I have here the results.

1078
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,719
In third place, with 211 miles...

1079
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,359
Mr Chris Harris.

1080
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,600
- Oh!
- Congratulations.

1081
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,000
In second place, with 284 miles...

1082
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,799
- ..Mr Matt LeBlanc.
- Come on!

1083
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,679
- That's right.
- Say it, say it.

1084
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,400
In first place, with 329 miles,
Mr Rory Reid in the black taxi.

1085
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,840
Way to go, man.

1086
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,520
Hang on, hang on, look at this.

1087
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,520
Oh, really? Is that what's happening?

1088
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,280
The losers lose their cars.

1089
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,079
'So we had our winner.

1090
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,519
'And as the others set off
toward their new life of service

1091
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,319
'on the Kazakh Steppe...'

1092
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,919
I'd become rather fond of my Volvo, Matt.

1093
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,559
Yeah, I'm going to miss that old car.

1094
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,039
'The truth is, all our high-milers
had proven their worth.

1095
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,599
'And now, all that remained
were the last few miles

1096
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,879
'into the heart of the
Cosmodrome and the launch site.

1097
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,719
'This would be the black
cab's victory lap.'

1098
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,560
- Where you headed?
- Rocket launch?
- Jump in.

1099
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,199
And it gave us a chance
to consider something.

1100
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,800
You see, to most people, cars
are just a tool, a runaround.

1101
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,479
You might run one for 60, 70,

1102
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,599
even 100,000 miles and
think it's had its day.

1103
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,119
But the truth is, it
could do so much more.'

1104
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,839
Back in the '50s, the US and
Soviet Union's fierce battle

1105
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,320
for global engineering dominance
propelled mankind into space.

1106
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,639
The Cold War thawed just for a moment

1107
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:43,079
as the world stood in collective
wonder at what we could achieve.

1108
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,519
It was an event that marked one
of the most intense periods

1109
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,519
of technological development
in human history -

1110
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,199
and it brought us to
today, where right now,

1111
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,079
sat on your driveway, you could have a car,

1112
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,279
a car, that's been so well engineered,

1113
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,040
it'll go the distance to the
moon and back, and beyond.

1114
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,080
Wow!

1115
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,759
I still can't get that
Hasselhoff song out of my head.

1116
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,919
THEY LAUGH

1117
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,159
APPLAUSE

1118
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,119
Amazing cars, indestructible.
Indestructible.

1119
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,199
OK, so, Rory, we know why
our cars aren't here,

1120
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,359
they're doing hard labour in Kazakhstan.

1121
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,159
But where's your little black cab,

1122
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,999
did you not want to drive it back
the 3,000 miles from Baikonur?

1123
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,159
I'd have loved to have driven my taxi home,

1124
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,319
but it had a higher calling, a public duty.

1125
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,879
Check this out.

1126
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,079
See that?

1127
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,320
APPLAUSE

1128
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,479
That's been immortalised, OK?
It's a symbol of hope.

1129
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,279
Yeah, you know, that was really nice.

1130
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,639
The good men and women of Baikonur,

1131
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,159
they can look up at your humble taxi,

1132
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,239
symbol of Britain, of London,

1133
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,959
and think, thank God I don't
have to drive one of those.

1134
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,599
Don't hate a winner, Matt.

1135
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,079
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance.
- No dancing.

1136
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,319
OK, next week, convertible
supercars in the USA,

1137
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,919
the Alfa Romeo Giulia and
one very broken windscreen.

1138
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,519
- Thanks for watching.
- Yeah, we'll see you all next week.

1139
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,720
- ALL:
- Goodnight.
