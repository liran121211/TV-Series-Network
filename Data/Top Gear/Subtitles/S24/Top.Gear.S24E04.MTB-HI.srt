00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,800
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,280
On tonight's show,

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,720
we've got a world exclusive
on four wheels and on two wheels.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,320
That's right, we're doing a bike.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,960
But first, if you like
huge horsepower hypercars,

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,880
and if you're watching this
it's safe to assume that you do,

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,760
now is a great time to be alive.

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,640
There's not a week that goes by
without another 1,000 horsepower,

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,320
million-pound monster
appearing on the scene,

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,720
but where did it all begin?

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,480
Well, here's Chris Harris,
with a quick history lesson.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,080
Once upon a time, there was
a car called the Bugatti Veyron.

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Volkswagen's passion project,

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,440
it launched in 2005
and promptly rewrote the rule book.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,320
Not only was it the world's fastest,
most powerful production car,

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,680
it cost an unprecedented
one million euros.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,560
This was hypercar 1.0 and,
without it, we might never

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,200
have seen the likes
of the McLaren P1, the LaFerrari

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,760
or the Porsche 918 Spyder.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,480
But now it's gone -
and been replaced by this.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,280
The new £2 million Bugatti Chiron.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,800
Like the Veyron,

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,640
it has an eight-litre, 16-cylinder
engine, with four turbochargers.

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,800
And because this is the car
to replace the Veyron,

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,280
you would expect it to pack some
sort of extra futuristic shove.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,400
But you'd be wrong, because this
is basically a very modified Veyron.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,760
The same huge petrol engine,
four-wheel-drive system, gearbox -

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,640
it's all been tinkered and improved,
but this is the old formula.

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,520
So, if the Veyron was revolutionary,
the Chiron, I'm afraid, isn't.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,560
But it does have...

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,160
..1,500 horsepower.

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,760
And that...
Well, that's a really long runway.

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,880
ENGINE ROARS

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm quite nervous.

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,280
ENGINE PURRS

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,920
I don't really know how you
prepare yourself for this,

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,960
so I think you just go, don't you?

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,760
Oh, my God!

39
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,120
60. That's 100.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
That's 125, that took six seconds.

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,880
That's 190. That's 200.

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,360
215. I'm trying to read
the speed and look ahead.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
225. 228.

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,080
231. 233.

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,080
236 and that's the limit to there.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,960
That is absolutely mind-bending.

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm sorry, but that...

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,360
..needs another go.

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
This is looking insane.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,320
You can almost hear it
gulping down the fuel.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,720
The Veyron could empty its
100-litre fuel tank in 12 minutes.

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,880
This thing can do it in nine!

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,280
And the force
on those tyres - 3,800Gs!

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,480
Which means at this speed,
the 12mg valve caps weigh 13.5kg.

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
This is the edge of physics!

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
At this speed,

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,480
this Chiron is gulping
1,000 litres of air a second.

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,560
Drink in, Mr Chiron!
Get it down you!

59
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,160
That's a drug. That's a drug.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,960
I know it's just going fast
in a straight line, but...

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,720
just the motive force required
to smash you through the air!

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,520
Now, if you're thinking, hang on,
the Veyron goes quicker than 236,

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
well, you'd be right,
but so does the Chiron.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,160
You see, the Chiron
is a two-key vehicle.

65
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,840
The first key nestles in the
dashboard here and that gives

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,040
you 236mph, but down here, there's
another one, if I can find it.

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,920
There you go. Look at that.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,600
Put that and turn it down there
and you're allowed 261mph.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,640
And because Bugatti
is still testing the tyres,

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,360
even that speed is still limited.
How fast will it go?

71
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,520
270? Maybe 280?

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,880
I think we can speculate that,
at some point during its life,

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,920
the Chiron might well do 300mph.

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
300mph.

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,000
It goes like
a £2 million car should, then.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,520
But what about the way it looks?

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,400
When I first saw pictures of the
Chiron, I was totally underwhelmed.

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,160
It looked too much like a Veyron,
but now I'm here with it in the raw,

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,400
I can get a sense of proportion and
the details, and it really works.

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,520
This lovely C that houses the air
intakes, then round the back here,

81
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,520
to this floating light bar,
massive diffuser and huge wing.

82
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,440
It's a stunning-looking thing.

83
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,080
The only problem is this
rather nasty 3 door handle,

84
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,960
but otherwise, well, it looks
every inch the £2 million car.

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,280
As does the interior.

86
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,560
It isn't complicated by
huge screens or rows of unfathomable

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,640
buttons and switches.

88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,200
Bugatti intends the Chiron
to be timeless...elegant.

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,320
Then again, no-one ever criticised
the old Veyron for feeling cheap.

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,560
But they did criticise it
for being a bit, well, dull.

91
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,320
You see, it was admired,
but never really adored.

92
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,680
It was so competent, so stable,
it all felt a bit joyless.

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,960
With the Chiron though, Bugatti
has started to have some fun.

94
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,280
To start with, it's got
adaptive dampers all round,

95
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,400
so they can slacken off
and make the car comfortable

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,800
when it needs to be, and firm
and responsive when it needs to be.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,400
And the steering is
a different world to the Veyron.

98
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,720
It's now electromechanical,
it's into the wrists.

99
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,680
The car now feels so much more
agile, but easier to place as well.

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,200
It's got a front end
you can lean on.

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,320
And with the four-wheel-drive
system revised, as well,

102
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,760
there's even mention of the D word.

103
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes,
Bugatti says this thing will drift,

104
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,080
so I suppose we'd better
find out, hadn't we?

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,280
This is my
"BLEEP don't crash it" face.

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
It's like wrestling a shark.

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,320
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,680
The traction is mega.

109
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,480
All the power goes to the back
wheels, then it goes all

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,720
to the front and you have
to just grab armfuls of lock.

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
Rail breaker bit, get the rear
to rotate, then follow the gas on.

112
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,920
HE CHUCKLES

113
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Yeah. You can drift the Chiron.

114
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520
Now, of course, I'm not saying
Bugatti has gone and built

115
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,640
some P1 918 LaFerrari
baiting trap weapon.

116
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,520
The truth is, the more time
you spend with the Chiron, the more

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,640
you get the impression those
three upstarts don't even feature

118
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,880
on its radar.

119
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,560
What Bugatti has built here is
a car with a different purpose.

120
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,160
Above all else, the Chiron
is about straightforward speed.

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,320
And when it comes to speed,
it has no equals.

122
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,600
You can talk about
which one of the McLaren,

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,440
the Ferrari and the Porsche
you would buy, but you don't

124
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
with the Chiron.

125
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,400
You either buy a Chiron or no
Chiron. There is no competition.

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,880
A class apart, then.
Well, the Chiron isn't the Veyron.

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,320
It doesn't rewrite any rule
books or change the way we look

128
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
at the automobile,

129
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,480
but there's something
oddly appealing about that.

130
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,000
This is no longer the Volkswagen
group trying to demonstrate

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,440
its technological superiority.

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,280
It just wanted
to go really, really fast.

133
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,360
It wants to win at car
Top Trumps and that's

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
a pleasingly,
pig-headed aim in my book.

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,160
And talking
of going very, very fast...

136
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Come on. If you were me,
you would, wouldn't you?

137
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,680
I'll never tire of this!

138
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
Amazing.

139
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,720
Amazing!

140
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm a very, very lucky boy.

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,800
That's the fastest
I've ever been in a car.

142
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,600
- OK, now, you hit the limiter
at 236mph, right? - Yeah.

143
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,840
OK, so I've got to ask you,
you had the second key,

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,280
why didn't you use the second key
and hit the limiter at 261?

145
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,920
- I knew you'd ask that. - Of course
I'm going to ask you that.

146
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,280
Look, this car
isn't quite finished yet.

147
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,000
Bugatti's still working on it.
That's the reason it can't go

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
- around our lap, by the way.
It's not quite finished. - OK.

149
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,080
It's so complicated,
it's a leap into the unknown.

150
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,880
They're still developing it
and I was, sort of, part of that

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,920
- development process, actually.
- You are so selfless.

152
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,240
LAUGHTER

153
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,800
Risking your life for
the millionaires of the world.

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
- I mean, it's amazing.
- It's not a millionaire's game,

155
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,240
- this is a billionaire's game.
- Yeah! - Let me give you some stats.

156
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,480
- Bugatti tells us the average
Chiron owner has 42 cars. - OK.

157
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,520
- Two yachts and 1.6 helicopters.
- LAUGHTER

158
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,040
OK, which 0.6 of that second
helicopter do they have, though?

159
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,520
- The expensive bit. - OK.

160
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,720
Anyhow, of all
the mind-bending stats,

161
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,440
I think the tyres might be the
most mind-bending part of this car,

162
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,760
because when Bugatti
developed this machine,

163
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,080
it had to go faster than anything
else had gone before, so it

164
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,520
went to Michelin and said,

165
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,040
"We need a new tyre,"
and Michelin said, "OK."

166
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,240
But they'd never tested
a tyre to 300mph before,

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,920
so they had to test it on their
aircraft rig to get the tech right

168
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,400
and that's how you have
to think of this car.

169
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,400
- It's not so much a car, it's like
a land-based jet. - Yeah. All right,

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,920
let's think of it that way.
And we're not done with the Chiron,

171
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,440
because later in the show,
this car is taking part in a very,

172
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,520
very special race. Trust me,
you don't want to miss that one.

173
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,160
- Rory! - That's right.
This has the most horsepower

174
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,280
of any Top Gear film ever
and that's not all, because,

175
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,240
and I don't think I'm giving away
too much when I say that tonight's

176
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,080
show also features an exclusive
appearance from the Smart Fortwo.

177
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,360
- LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Yeah. - That's right.

178
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,280
Now it's time to welcome
this week's guest. I love this guy.

179
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,040
This is great. OK.

180
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,360
He is the platinum-selling,
Brit Award-winning, chart-topping

181
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,520
megastar who loves to go low.

182
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,680
Ladies and gentlemen, Tinie Tempah!

183
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
MUSIC: Girls Like
by Tinie Tempah

184
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,240
You all right? Yeah.

185
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,840
- How's it going? - Pretty good.
- Where do you want me, here?

186
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Yeah, right there is good. So glad
to have you here, right? Come on.

187
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,240
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
- Finally! Finally!

188
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,920
- Yeah, yeah. This isn't your first
time here. - No, it isn't, actually.

189
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,480
So, basically, I was supposed
to shoot the video for the song

190
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
Girls Like in Dunsfold,
I was supposed to shoot it here.

191
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,600
And as soon as I got here,
it was rainy, rainy as hell.

192
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,640
The light went by, like, 3pm or
4pm, so we couldn't do anything

193
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,600
and then, by 6pm,
the director said it was a wrap.

194
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,720
I watched the video back
and it was absolutely BLEEP.

195
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,240
It's the worst video
I've ever seen.

196
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,440
The worst video I've ever seen
in my life, so then we had to rush

197
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,200
over to South Africa, to do
Top Gear, where we met. Yeah. Right.

198
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,080
And then,
after we finished doing that,

199
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,920
then I got to reshoot the video
in South Africa, so actually,

200
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,960
Top Gear and Girls Like have a lot
of synergy, there's just a lot

201
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,000
- there. - Speaking of Girls Like,

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,320
- that kind of became an unofficial
Top Gear anthem. - Oh, yes.

203
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
On shoots, everywhere we go,

204
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,320
you can always guarantee
this man is playing Girls Like.

205
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,360
- You are in his head 24/7.
- I think he just likes to...

206
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm not sure he even likes the song,

207
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,040
he just likes, "Go low,
go low. Everybody get low."

208
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
That's what he likes. I love it.

209
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,080
- You're a bigger part of the show
than you think. - I appreciate that.

210
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,480
- That's on the new album?
- Yeah, it's on the new album, Youth,

211
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,120
coming out pretty soon
and I'm excited.

212
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,160
I've been working
on it for two years.

213
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm like a Londoner,
it's an artist from the UK,

214
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,560
born and bred in London
and I wanted to be

215
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,240
a rapper when I was growing up
and everybody said it was naff.

216
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,680
You could never be a rapper.

217
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,240
A rapper would never get on the
radio or get on a show like this

218
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,520
and times have changed. Youth
is basically a celebration of that,

219
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,880
you know, just doing
something that wasn't really

220
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,080
a thing before and it's a thing now.

221
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,800
Speaking of growing up,
what was your first car?

222
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,080
- Oh, OK, so my first car
was a Vauxhall Corsa. - Yes. - 1.1.

223
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,800
- Humble beginnings. - Yes.

224
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,440
Y Reg, I remember
that very vividly and I used to...

225
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,560
Outside my mum and dad's house there
was a driveway and I'd, literally,

226
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,040
because I wanted to listen
to my music loud and stuff,

227
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,720
I'd just keep
the car in the driveway,

228
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,640
invite all my friends, technically,
to my house, but to the car,

229
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,160
so they'd get, "No, no,
don't go in there. Come in here."

230
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,640
And it was, literally, like,

231
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,720
my little, kind of,
like, domain for a while.

232
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,120
- What do you drive now? - At the moment
I'm driving the Lamborghini Huracan.

233
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,000
- Nice. - We talked about this.

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,760
I thought
you were going to get a Porsche?

235
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,920
Yeah, I kind of...

236
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,520
I don't know, we spent a week
together and I realised that you was

237
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,640
talking a lot, bro, and I was
listening to everything

238
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,680
you was saying.

239
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,640
You know you're with, like, Matt
LeBlanc, it's like, he's a legend.

240
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,640
I'm just like, "Yes, Matt.
Of course, Matt. I will, Matt."

241
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,200
And I got home and I was like,
"No, I don't want the Porsche."

242
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,520
- "Screw what he said."
- Yeah, "Screw his advice."

243
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,120
- And how do you like it?
- It's good, yeah. It's a good car.

244
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,920
I'm quite glad he wasn't the guest
two weeks ago, when I was...

245
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,000
less than kind
about the Lamborghini Huracan.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,320
What did you say about it, bruv?

247
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,200
I said it was a wonderful car
for wonderful people.

248
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,240
LAUGHTER

249
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
And I went
and got it matted as well,

250
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,840
so I got MATT black colour.

251
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, thank you.

252
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,280
OK, what do you think?

253
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,360
Let's see how you did
in your training lap with Chris,

254
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,880
who just finished his Tamsin
Greig school of social etiquette.

255
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,680
- How did it go out there
with him? Good? - It was good, man.

256
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,840
I've heard a lot
of bad things about you, bro.

257
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,600
I've heard a lot
of bad things about Chris,

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
so I wasn't looking forward to it.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,080
It was raining. It was raining,

260
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,520
then we started getting a bit
of sunlight, but too much,

261
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,360
so there was glare in the
windshield and I was thinking,

262
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,520
"This is probably all
because of Chris, somehow."

263
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,840
Like, he's just got...
There's just something about him.

264
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,520
He brings misery to the role.

265
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,360
Yeah, he brings misery,
but then I started to get upset

266
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,400
and then, after that, I started
to realise that he has got a soft...

267
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,240
quite a soft, sentimental side.

268
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,680
Because as I started
to get quite worked up,

269
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,000
he was immediately there,
to be like, "Don't worry, T..."

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,520
- Who has a soft, sentimental side?
- Chris. This guy over here, yeah.

271
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm very giving.
Just watch the film.

272
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,720
Whatever! OK, let's take a look.

273
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,200
- Right, first gear, please. - Right.
- First gear, please, Tinie. - Cool.

274
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,240
- Handbrake off, please.
- Nice and positive.

275
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,760
- See, you like that? - I love it.
- Now just get on with it, come on.

276
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,120
- It's really slippery. - Yeah.

277
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,920
And we both want to go home
with all of our limbs, don't we?

278
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, nice and safe.

279
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,200
- Feel that understeer, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

280
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,120
- Now feel that oversteer
on the exit. - Yeah.

281
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,000
- Whoa! - Got it, got it, got it.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,280
Now you're alive. Got to
go left here at the blue line.

283
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,240
To the left of the tyres.
Brake, brake, brake.

284
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,800
- Remember, look for the red line
now on your right-hand side. - Yes.

285
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,560
- It's there. It's there,
it's there. - Oh, spinning out.

286
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,720
- Understeer, understeer, understeer.
- There we go. Am I within the line?

287
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
- Is that cool? - That's good,
that's brilliant. Up here.

288
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,920
- Let's go.
- Admittedly, begrudgingly...

289
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,280
Come on! Come on!

290
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,680
It's time for some tunes, man.

291
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,640
RAP MUSIC PLAYS

292
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,040
Brake, brake, brake, brake,
or we're off. Brake or we're off.

293
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,640
You know, Toyota make an offroader,
as well. It's called a Land Cruiser.

294
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
- Is it? - It's not
this one, though. - Oh, OK.

295
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,680
I'll bear
that in mind for next time.

296
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,560
- Good Lord! - I've got it.

297
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,480
- And over the line.
- Over the line! - Yes!

298
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,840
- You nearly braked before the line!
- The pressure's too much, man.

299
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,040
I don't know
if I can deal with this.

300
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm going to get
high blood pressure. Come on.

301
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,840
♪ I'm a boss... ♪

302
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,960
How did you do it?
Teach me the dance move.

303
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,080
Look at this one. Do this one.
Just a slow one. Just a slow one.

304
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
This is about my Lamborghini.

305
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
♪ My Lamborghini... ♪

306
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,800
Yeah, just have
to dance like a grandad now.

307
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,640
- That's all you have to do. - Your
Lamborghini looks like a shark?

308
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,720
Yeah,
my Lamborghini looks like Jaws.

309
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
CHEERING

310
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,080
What was that dance
you were doing in the car?

311
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,720
I don't really understand.

312
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,680
I was taking some lessons
from Tinie about how I should dance

313
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,600
and he said, very reassuringly,

314
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,320
"Dance as you want to. Be a
grandpa." So I thought, OK, I would.

315
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,440
I mean, obviously,
when my children see that,

316
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
that's just going to be appalling,
but I tried my hardest.

317
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,920
Look, he dealt very well with the
conditions, because it was so wet

318
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,720
it was flooded. The tyre
wouldn't deal with the water,

319
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
so we were aquaplaning,

320
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,200
and then, the sun came out, so
he couldn't see where the line was.

321
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,360
- It was just like a glass surface,
wasn't it? - It wasn't easy, bro.

322
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,760
- It was tough. - Yeah, that was wet.

323
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,640
We'll see how you did
in your timed lap.

324
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,440
- We'll check
that out later on. - Cool.

325
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,400
Now, usually these two get to
hoon about in Ferraris and Lambos

326
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
and such,
but a couple of months ago,

327
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,560
the producers told me
there was a new rear engine,

328
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,080
rear-wheel drive sports car
that I should take a look at.

329
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,120
Maybe a rival for the Porsche 911.
So, I went to check it out.

330
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,480
And this is that rear-engined,
rear-wheel drive sports car. Yeah.

331
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,000
I've been stitched
up here, haven't I?

332
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,920
It's called the Renault Twingo GT.

333
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,040
And, yeah, like the Porsche 911,

334
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,160
it does have
the engine in the back.

335
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,080
And, like the Porsche 911,

336
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,280
that engine
does drive the rear wheel.

337
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,400
But I'm calling foul on the
whole sports car thing, I'm sorry.

338
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
What sport?

339
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,040
What is sporty about this?

340
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,560
Well, right now, not a lot.

341
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,440
Even on a dry day, 0-60 takes
over 9.5 seconds and it's got

342
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,720
a top speed of just 113mph.

343
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,240
Those are not numbers
to worry Porsche.

344
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,040
They're not numbers to worry anyone.

345
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,120
But according to Renault,
this really is a sports car.

346
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,200
Compared to the standard Twingo,
the one driven by your nan,

347
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,160
the GT has bigger alloys,

348
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,240
firmer suspension
and twin tailpipes.

349
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,400
And, on the left-hand side only,
a small intake, which feeds

350
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,880
cool air into the three-cylinder,
turbo-charged engine,

351
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,800
which makes 20% more power.

352
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,280
All right, that still
only gives it 108 horsepower.

353
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,280
But that doesn't actually matter,

354
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,840
because this Twingo is
a different kind of sports car.

355
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,280
It doesn't need power. It weighs
less than a ton. It's light.

356
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,640
And the GT costs
under £14,000, so it's cheap.

357
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,000
This is a baby hot hatch.

358
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,280
And that is a very good thing.

359
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
Because unlike a big hot hatch...

360
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,240
..you're not paying
for anything you can't use.

361
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,520
Ha-ha!

362
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,080
Your Ford Focus RSes
and your Golf Rs and the like,

363
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,560
great cars,
but they're so damn fast.

364
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
In Britain at least,

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,400
you can only use a fraction of their
firepower a fraction of the time.

366
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,560
Not in the Twingo, though.

367
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,840
You can keep your foot
buried for 20, 30 seconds,

368
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,400
safe in the knowledge
that it's not going to kill you.

369
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
It's one of those cars
that encourages you to drive

370
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,040
like an absolute hooligan

371
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,560
and, yet, you always stay
on the right side of the law.

372
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,960
HE LAUGHS

373
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,600
It's just a really
rewarding car to drive.

374
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,720
OK, it's not a Porsche,
but it is good.

375
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,480
So, yes, if your name's
Chris Harris and you commute to work

376
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,680
sideways over empty,
sweeping moorland B-roads,

377
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,080
the Twingo IS going
to leave you a bit cold.

378
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,600
But because you're not Chris Harris,
and, thank God, neither am I,

379
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,560
we don't commute to work over
empty, sweeping moorland B-roads.

380
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,520
We spend most of our time...

381
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,840
..in the city.

382
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,120
And that is what
the Twingo is all about.

383
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,080
Because there's no oily,
petrolly, motory stuff jammed in

384
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,400
by the front wheels, I can
get an insane amount of lock on.

385
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,600
That means it's a cinch to park.
It also means I'm agile, I'm nippy.

386
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm like a big,
orange hummingbird on wheels.

387
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,760
What I'm saying is,
you don't need loads of horsepower

388
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,440
to have a good time.

389
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,320
Remember the Peugeot 205 GTi
from the '80s?

390
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,760
One of the best
hot hatches of all time.

391
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,040
And yet, the Twingo GT
has almost exactly the same power

392
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,320
and performance.

393
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,600
This car is retro.

394
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
And I do love a bit of retro.

395
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,600
The thing is, if you're
after a playful little city car

396
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,520
with that old school appeal,
the Twingo does have its rivals.

397
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,040
And helping find
the right car for you

398
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,920
is something we take very seriously.

399
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,080
Oh, yes.

400
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,400
Welcome to what, for legal reasons,
I'm obliged to refer to as

401
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,000
the Top Gear arcade-based
maze re-creation challenge.

402
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,520
Yes, like all classic arcade games,
here, the rules are simple.

403
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,000
There's a big maze covered in dots
and me and the Twingo

404
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,280
have three lives to drive
around eating said dots

405
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,840
without getting got by the ghosts.

406
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,200
And by ghosts, I do mean
similarly-priced city car rivals.

407
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Ghost number one
is the Brabus ForTwo.

408
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,440
It has the same engine
and performance as the Twingo

409
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,600
but only has
two doors, two seats and,

410
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,800
for tonight at least,
is being driven by a speedy German.

411
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,360
I see you, man pack.

412
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,440
No, it's not man pack,
it's... Never mind.

413
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,640
Ghost number two
is the new Volkswagen Up!

414
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,360
Yes, it might be five years old,
but the king of modern city cars

415
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,000
now comes with a turbocharger,
to give it more zip -

416
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,800
especially in the hands
of Mr Happy here.

417
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,040
Rory, do you know what
corrugated steel tastes like?

418
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm sorry, did they have arcade
games when you were growing up?

419
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,840
Or were you part of
the stick and hoop generation?

420
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,760
Less talky, more smashy.

421
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,160
'Right, three lives
to eat up all the dots

422
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,600
'and one handy sat nav map,
to help me find them.'

423
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,000
Get ready
for an arcade masterclass.

424
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
See you later, suckers!

425
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,200
He's going left! Follow, Harris!

426
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,960
Catch me if you can, losers!

427
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,920
Give me them dots,
give me them tasty dots.

428
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,040
Yummy, yummy, yummy, come on.

429
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,080
This is good fun!

430
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,520
One thing I've got on my side
is that this is the most

431
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,800
manoeuvrable car of the bunch.

432
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,080
A little car.
Such a tiny little thing.

433
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,680
And for this job, just perfect.

434
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,400
Now, officially,
the Up! is the cheapest car here,

435
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
but it has the highest top speed.

436
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,000
'Which is of no use
in an arcade maze.'

437
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,200
Handbrake!

438
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
Yes! Whoo!

439
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,040
- That was - BLEEP - great.

440
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,400
Oh, yes.

441
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,960
This is the best
city car, bar none.

442
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,560
Oh, no, no, no! Come on!

443
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,840
- Come on!
- SHE CACKLES

444
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm dead. Already!

445
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,760
OK, two lives left, and with nearly
a third of the maze cleared,

446
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,040
lots of dots still to eat.

447
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,520
Rory,
be a bit less rubbish this time.

448
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,360
HE LAUGHS

449
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
We're off. Here we go, here we go.

450
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,800
Don't let them beat you, man.
Don't let them beat you!

451
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,840
I'm right behind you.
Right behind you!

452
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,720
Oh, Harris is quick!

453
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,840
- He's quick! - Go, Harris!

454
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,440
'Immediately, the ghosts
were closing in again.'

455
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,080
Go, go, go!

456
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,040
'But no retro arcade game would
be complete without the odd...'

457
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,680
Here we go! '..power up.'

458
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,880
- Ha-ha! - Whoo!

459
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,120
- You hit me! - What are you doing?
What's the red light thing?

460
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,320
The red light means stop, Grandad.

461
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,960
'And that gave me
ten whole seconds...

462
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
'Of ghost-free dot-munching.'

463
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,760
I am on a dot spree now, baby.

464
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,600
I think you'll find
they're called biscuits.

465
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,480
Literally,
nobody calls them biscuits.

466
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,040
Well, except old people.

467
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,080
- Oh, we can go again.
- Let's go! - Now we're blocked in.

468
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
Whoa!

469
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Oh, the turning circle!
The turning circle!

470
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,720
I haven't quite got the turning
circle of a Twingo, have I?

471
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,040
Oh, delicious dots.
Delicious dots! Mine!

472
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,160
'And with Harris still halfway
through his million-point turn...'

473
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm not going to catch
anyone at this rate, am I?

474
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,040
'..I tried a new tactic. Stealth.'

475
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,520
Stay under the radar.

476
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,280
- Off the grid.
- Ah, we're away. Right, come on.

477
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,000
Where is he?

478
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,480
Think stealth. Think ninja.

479
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Rory! Where are you?

480
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,400
He's hiding. We'll find him.

481
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,880
I'm right behind him.

482
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm right behind him.
He doesn't even know.

483
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,440
'Yep, my awesome ninja
stealth skills let me sneak in

484
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
'a few more dots before...'

485
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,240
I got him, I got him!

486
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,480
HE LAUGHS

487
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,800
Yeah, I can see him.

488
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,840
Run away! Run away!

489
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,320
'The city car ghosts
were back in the hunt.'

490
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm going to catch you, Reid.

491
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,920
Which way? Which way?
Which way? Which way? Which way?

492
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,240
- Got him! - No, no, no!

493
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,760
Oh!

494
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,800
Mate!

495
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,680
HE CHUCKLES

496
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,280
Dude, it's a brand-new Twingo!

497
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,400
'You're better than this, Reid.

498
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,720
'Right, still a load of dots left.

499
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,680
'Last life, no continues.'

500
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,480
Rory, just give up.
You're not going to win.

501
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,680
Come on, Twingo, help me
out here. Please, please, please.

502
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,680
You can do this, you can do this!

503
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,440
'Game time.
Hunting out the last of the dots.'

504
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,320
You're not supposed
to wreck all the lights, Reid.

505
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,160
'The Twingo and I were using
every trick in the arcade manual...'

506
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,120
Dots, dots, I need dots. Come on.

507
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,680
'..which isn't even a thing..

508
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,840
Oops.

509
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
All right, we've got to stop him
getting these last biscuits.

510
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
I have an idea.

511
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,960
Come on, Twingo!
Come on! Yes, yes!

512
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,400
The last dots! Come on!

513
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,760
'We were nearly there, but with the
last dots almost within reach...'

514
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,320
That's them.
The last dots. Let's go.

515
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,800
Argh!

516
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,520
'..Sabine had set up a dot block.'

517
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
Sneaky German ghost!

518
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,520
SHE SQUEALS

519
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh, no, you don't,
Mr French shopping trolley.

520
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
Ha-ha! Ken Block who?

521
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,880
Good skills.

522
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,840
Ah, yes!

523
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,480
- Oh, no! - Here we go, here we go!

524
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,080
Yes! Nearly there, Twingo!

525
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,880
That's them - the last dots!

526
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,480
Yes! Yes!

527
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,840
Go!

528
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,680
Yes! Yes!

529
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,160
We did it! We did it!

530
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,680
Oh, look,
he's doing a victory doughnut.

531
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,360
HE LAUGHS

532
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,240
In your face!

533
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,840
It's not really a doughnut, is it?

534
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,560
More of a kind of crap teacake.

535
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,440
RORY LAUGHS

536
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
In your face!

537
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,720
- Victory for the Twingo!
- Victory for the Twingo.

538
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,560
That was... That was great.

539
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,920
That was great.

540
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,960
You know, not a day goes
by where I don't find myself

541
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,480
trapped in a maze of shipping
containers and wonder,

542
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
"What would be the best car
to help me escape?"

543
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,040
- Yeah, exactly. - Now I know.
- Exactly, exactly.

544
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,160
You know what I like
about the Twingo, right?

545
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,760
It's the fact that all city cars
were, kind of, all becoming the

546
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,560
same, they were becoming clones,
but the Twingo is a different way

547
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,080
of answering the question.

548
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,040
It's not the front-wheel drive,
it's not, kind of, boxy.

549
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,520
All right, it's not perfect
but it's got character.

550
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,920
And when you want to go somewhere,
you just pop it in the boot

551
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,800
of your real car and off you go.

552
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,960
OK, now it's time to find
out which of these teeny, tiny cars

553
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,760
is fastest around our track,

554
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,680
and that means handing
them over for testing.

555
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,440
Not by The Stig,
but by The Stig's teenage cousins.

556
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,640
So, there they all are,
standing around Snapchatting,

557
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,880
photo bombing, looking for
Pokemon Go...

558
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,760
And off the line, the Twingo,
rear-engine traction,

559
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,720
has got a little bit
of a march there.

560
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,760
There's no room up the inside for
that particular adolescent lunatic.

561
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,120
Oh, my God. Imagine what's inside
that helmet - all the acne.

562
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,320
AUDIENCE LAUGHTER

563
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,320
Right, turning in, there's not
enough room for you there.

564
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,840
Oh, dangerous - headphones on.

565
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,920
What are they listening to?
Tinie Tempah, maybe.

566
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,480
Some cool tunes.
OK, this is worrying now because

567
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,800
there's not room for two of them
going in here.

568
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,640
The Up looking a bit sneaky
at the back there.

569
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,800
A tighter line... This is clever.

570
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,920
..and he's going
to get the march on the Smart

571
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
coming down the back straight.

572
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,640
They don't look very fast, do
they? No, not in a straight line.

573
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,760
What's he doing there?

574
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,120
I don't know, talking to his
pals on Face Chat thing...

575
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,240
OK, breaking hard
down into the Hammerhead.

576
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,560
What's going to happen here?

577
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,960
Well, the Up has got
a massive advantage because...

578
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,480
I think because it's front-engined,
it looked better.

579
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,640
But look at that sneaky
git on the inside there.

580
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,760
Three abreast.
I don't how this is going to end.

581
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,520
This looks like a massive insurance
claim in waiting, doesn't it?

582
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,960
So let's go through
the Follow-Through...

583
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh, that's rude! That's rude!

584
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,600
He's cut him right
off at the nose there.

585
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,720
And that Smart just looks
unstable to me... It looks so short.

586
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
So short. OK...

587
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,800
Oh, that's a
buttock-clenching moment there.

588
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,040
But the Smart's
got the run on the Twingo

589
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,160
heading down towards second-to-last.

590
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,480
Really unstable under breaks -

591
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,280
I don't know what
they're playing at here.

592
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,000
I think the
Twingo's got this wrapped up.

593
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,200
Second-to-last, Twingo runs wide.
Carry... That's just rude!

594
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
OK, that's rude! So effectively,
a moral victory to the Renault

595
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
because he had
to get out of the way,

596
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,560
otherwise he'd
have crashed into that Stig.

597
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,040
All right, now, because
that got a bit out of hand,

598
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,400
we also got The Stig himself
to lap all three cars.

599
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Now, only the fastest one of the
three earns a place

600
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,160
on the leaderboard, and that
was the Smart in 1.49.1.

601
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,840
Which is...

602
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,640
a way down there. OK...

603
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,680
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

604
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,320
- I told you. - All right, now...

605
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Hold on, hold on. I want to
talk about the internet

606
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,960
- for a second... - Yes.

607
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,160
..because I hear that you
and Chris Harris have the same

608
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,560
favourite website, which I've got
to say, I find hard to believe

609
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,960
because I know Chris
and he's disgusting!

610
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,560
Oh, we definitely do, then.
No, I'm joking!

611
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,680
No, my favourite website
is actually Auto Trader, bro.

612
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,080
- I love it. Do you love Auto Trader?
- Yeah, I'm addicted.

613
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,160
I love it.
Ever since I've been a kid...

614
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,040
For me, I grew up in, like,
a council estate, south-east London,

615
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,880
didn't have much, so being able to
go online and look at all these cars

616
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,080
at all these ridiculous prices...

617
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,200
I used to type in
"£200,000, £1 million,

618
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,720
"let's see what cars come up."

619
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,880
And you'd see all these rare
cars, and I just...

620
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,520
I was obsessed with it. So, yeah,
it's my favourite website.

621
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,600
- OK. And that's your favourite
website, too? - It is, yes.

622
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,480
To avoid any confusion,
that is my favourite website.

623
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,080
What's you second...?
No, never mind! Let's not do that.

624
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,480
Tinie, I heard you enjoy an
Aston Martin.

625
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah, bro. I... Oh, God!

626
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,720
So I... Luckily, when
they launched the One-77

627
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,840
they invited me down
to be factory.

628
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,360
So they said to me, "Do you want
to borrow one for a week?"

629
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,440
So I borrowed the
Aston Martin Virage

630
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,920
and I remember rolling around like
just the coolest kid in the world.

631
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,440
I was like 23 years old at the time

632
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,200
and I was dating this girl
at the time,

633
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,880
and so when she saw the car,
and she was in the car,

634
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,360
she got really, really giddy
and excited.

635
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,560
And she said, "We should celebrate.
We should..."

636
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,360
LAUGHTER

637
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,760
- Should what? - Yeah. - Should what?
- What? What? What?

638
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Don't make this harder
than it already is, please.

639
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
- But, yeah...
- Is that what you said to her?

640
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,920
Choose your words more carefully.

641
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,280
That Aston Martin badge, I told you.

642
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,800
Yeah, I felt like James Bond for,
like, 20 seconds, which was great.

643
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
20 seconds?

644
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,440
The good thing is, they don't make
the Virage any more

645
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,880
because I don't want to borrow one.

646
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,120
Yeah, don't ever buy... Like,
if you see used one floating around,

647
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,840
don't get that one.
What do you think?

648
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,400
I think it's time to take a look
at Tinie's lap around the track.

649
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
- Who wants to see that?
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

650
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,360
Let's do it. Yeah? How do you think
it went? How did you think you did?

651
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,000
I think it was cool. I mean,
I don't really know how I did.

652
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,240
And it was a swamp out there.

653
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,280
Yeah, the conditions were horrible,
but I'm not going to be a moaner.

654
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,720
I'm not going to make excuses.
All right, let's take a look.

655
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Off the line.

656
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
It's time to make the family proud.

657
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,680
It's a freezing day in England,
but I'm actually sweating.

658
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,640
It's nerves, I've got gas today.

659
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,120
LAUGHTER

660
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,440
OK, well, you're using most
of the circuit, that's good.

661
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,840
Third gear...
Look, at the flooding there!

662
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,120
- Wetter than...
What was going on there? - Whoa!

663
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,320
That was properly lairy. A bit of
understeer here. Get on the gas.

664
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,480
- A bit of oversteer
on the exit. - Come on, son!

665
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,400
You're letting it just dance
around, aren't you?

666
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,120
- Braking hard now into Hammerhead.
- It's started to rain again.

667
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,960
You're really not...

668
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,000
Really trying to rain
on my parade.

669
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,760
SCREECHING

670
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,480
Oi, oi! It's all about
the smoothness, T.

671
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,800
It's all about the smoothness.

672
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Smoother than a baby's bottom.
Come on.

673
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,680
OK, coming down now
to the Follow-Through.

674
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,600
This is going to be tough.

675
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,640
I think I've just
farted out of nervousness.

676
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't know what to say about that.

677
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,920
That is a massive moment!

678
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,360
Do you know what that face is?
That the new underwear face.

679
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,520
So we're going to roll
into Second-to-last.

680
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,200
It's slippery here.
You got that one right that time.

681
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Breaking hard, keeping it tight.
Do you know what?

682
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,280
I think that was the toughest
conditions so far

683
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,360
for any of our drivers
over the line.

684
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

685
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,880
- That face! - Are you happy with that?
What do you think?

686
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,960
It's weird because it feels a lot
faster than it looked on the screen.

687
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,600
- Yeah, always. - So while I was
driving, it felt way faster

688
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,400
and there it didn't really look
that fast, but, I don't know.

689
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,840
Who knows, bro? I don't know.

690
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,280
Yeah, the same thing happens
to me in performances.

691
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,320
It always looks a lot
better when I'm doing it

692
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,240
then what it actually looks like.

693
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,440
You watch it back and you're like...

694
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,400
All right, now, the top of our
leaderboard is still Max Whitlock,

695
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,120
the iconic gymnast.
You give that guy a foam horse

696
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,560
covered in suede and he just gives
you poetry. Is it not nice...?

697
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,760
Incredible. But, because it was
so wet, you have a wet time,

698
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,800
so you have to beat
James McAvoy's time of 1.47.1.

699
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,320
Don't say it like,
"You only have to beat..."

700
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,840
Don't say that.

701
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,800
OK, Tinie Tempah,
you went around the track...

702
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,280
in one minute...

703
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,080
- 50... - Oh!

704
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,240
- Point four. - Good effort.

705
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,680
That's a good effort.

706
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
Considerably wetter.

707
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,680
Considerably...
Considerably wetter.

708
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,760
..three seconds slower out
there for you. Yes, it was.

709
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

710
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Yeah, that's solid.
That's solid for those conditions.

711
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,360
Ladies and gentlemen, Tinie Tempah!

712
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

713
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,320
What a hero.

714
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,120
OK, now, earlier on you
remember Chris was driving

715
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,960
the 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron.

716
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,640
Which, so long as you have more
money than Mark Zuckerberg,

717
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,960
- is pretty much as fast as you
can go in a car. - Yes, that's true.

718
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,080
But, of course, if you have more
money than Mark Zuckerberg,

719
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,520
you're not limited to just cars.

720
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,480
So, since we had
a day to kill with the Chiron,

721
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,440
we decided to have a little race.

722
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,320
It's the age-old question
we've all pondered -

723
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,680
you're a billionaire oil mogul
based in downtown Dubai,

724
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,280
you knock off work at lunch
on a Friday,

725
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,000
or a Thursday as they do here,
so what's the fastest way

726
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,520
to reach your luxury weekend
retreat in the Omani mountains?

727
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,920
Car or not car?

728
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,440
- Hello. - Well, I'm what they call
suitably equipped, Matthew. - Yeah.

729
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,800
I can't help noticing
you have no transport.

730
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,080
Are you planning
on walking to Oman?

731
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,120
No, no, no. Don't worry.
Off you go.

732
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,480
I'll be the guy at the hotel bar
with all the empty drinks

733
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,240
- in front of him.
- No, you're going to lose.

734
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,040
It's not possible to get anywhere
faster than in this car.

735
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,760
Yeah, and what a car!

736
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,240
HE WHISTLES

737
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,360
Does come in men's?

738
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,520
You're better than that,
you know you are.

739
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,360
- And, also, what's in that rucksack?
Why's it so big? - This?

740
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,920
My lunch.

741
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,200
Three, two, one, go.

742
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,680
- Oh, hang... - You're going to lose.
- Wait, wait, wait!

743
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

744
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,920
- You're going to lose.
- I'm already in front of you!

745
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,400
Now, the winner of this
billionaire's commute-off

746
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,400
would be the first to get
from the heart of Dubai

747
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
to a luxury five-star retreat,

748
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,480
perched high in the mountains
of neighbouring Oman.

749
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,960
And with Chris driving the Chiron,

750
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,400
I would have
to travel by other means.

751
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,080
No driving.

752
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,560
I won't be driving.

753
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,080
Not one bit of driving.

754
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,600
I have a plan.

755
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,600
I think I can safely say
I'm the only Chiron driving around

756
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,720
on the public highway
in the world at the moment.

757
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
One of us is currently winning...

758
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,600
and it's not Joey!

759
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,520
Anyone can take a car.

760
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,320
A billionaire doesn't take a car.

761
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,040
So you are actually
walking to Oman.

762
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,760
- Very luxurious. - You're wasting
time you don't have, keep going.

763
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,880
An angry small man in Dubai,

764
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,520
rocks up in his Chiron,
says, "Hi," What a...

765
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
BEEPING

766
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,400
Unfortunately, I quickly encountered
a problem unfamiliar to most

767
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
billionaires, rush hour.

768
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,840
There's about 19 lanes and yet
everyone's stuck stationary.

769
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,160
- BEEPING
- Oh, come on!

770
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,000
Don't drive into me.
This is worth 2 million quid.

771
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,560
'Silly Harris, you see,
traffic was not something

772
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,880
'I needed to worry about.'

773
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,760
That's right, it's a boat.

774
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,800
'And this was just stage one
of my four stage master plan.'

775
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,080
This is the
frustrating part of the race

776
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,320
because we have to adhere
to this five-knot speed limit.

777
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,880
Once we get out on the
open water, we can pin it.

778
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,520
The Riva Rivarma is 44 feet long,
costs £1 million -

779
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,560
half the price of Harris's car,
which is only a third the length

780
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,200
of this boat, and he doesn't
even have an onboard ice-maker.

781
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,240
Or a toilet.

782
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,240
He's in trouble.

783
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,400
Well, not quite...

784
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,040
Because when you're
a billionaire for the day,

785
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,360
you can call in the odd favour.

786
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,280
SIRENS

787
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,200
Yes, yes, yes!
Now, this is what I call a plan.

788
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,640
I'm being escorted out of Dubai
at speed

789
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,800
behind a Dubai police i8.

790
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,360
There's a McLaren 570 ahead,

791
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,760
behind me, a Nissan-GTR -
and to my left

792
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,760
is an Audi R8 V10 Plus.
It has 610 horsepower.

793
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,600
That's 900 less than
the one I'm in. 900 less!

794
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,240
This is cool!

795
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,680
'Whatever.
See, I was now clear of the marina.

796
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,840
'Fast as you like.'

797
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,720
Oh, yeah, baby!
That's the stuff right there.

798
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,680
PHONE RINGS

799
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,480
- Hello! - Have you located
some proper transport yet?

800
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,520
I can't really hear you too good.

801
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,960
It's a little windy
out here on the sea.

802
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,600
- What are you on, a boat? - Yeah.

803
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,720
Just having a
good old time racing you.

804
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,120
I've got through the Dubai traffic
by using a police escort

805
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,840
and I'm now heading
towards the border.

806
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,120
I can't possibly see how
you can win.

807
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,640
Yes, an hour in and with Admiral
LeBlanc bobbing around in his boat,

808
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,720
I was well on my way to Oman.

809
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,240
Frankly, this wasn't
much of a race after all.

810
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,840
Maybe I could just spend the next
hour conjugating the verb "to win."

811
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,880
I win, you win,
he, she or it wins...

812
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,840
we win, you win, they win...

813
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,720
Or you're Matt LeBlanc,
and you lose.

814
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,520
What has Matthew got planned?

815
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,120
Well, since he asked, it was time
for the second stage of my commute.

816
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,160
OK, here she is!

817
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,800
Now, that is the
Bentley Mulsanne EWB.

818
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,120
Extended wheelbase.

819
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,520
Now, of course, I'm not driving.

820
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,200
'No, no. Like any good billionaire,
I have a chauffeur -

821
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,960
'The Stig's Emirati cousin.'

822
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,960
OK, vamos!

823
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,840
Andiamo!

824
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,960
Allez?

825
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,320
Go!

826
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,880
Meanwhile, basking
in my comfortable lead,

827
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,320
I had time to consider
some of the Chiron's utter madness.

828
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,840
Remember when you were a kid
and you'd get into cars

829
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,960
and always look how fast
the speedometer read to?

830
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,240
And you'd assume that
if a speedometer said 140,

831
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,800
the car could do 140?

832
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,000
Ha-ha!
In the Chiron, the game is over.

833
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,720
This reads
to 500 kilometres per hour.

834
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,440
That's 300 miles an hour.

835
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,760
How do you out-Chiron a Chiron?
What do you do?

836
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,040
Come on.

837
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,400
Now, I had hit some traffic,
but to be honest,

838
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,840
in the Mulsanne,
it was hard to care.

839
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,400
Oh... Oh, yeah.

840
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,920
Yeah, it gives you a massage...

841
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,960
Oh... That is maybe the nicest
car seat that was ever made.

842
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,960
Let's give him a call,
see how old Chris is doing.

843
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,200
Hello?

844
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,240
Well, well, well, how are you?

845
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,000
Pretend you're not going
to hear this...

846
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,800
- Super, please. - Super? - Super.

847
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,680
MATT LAUGHS

848
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,960
How many fuel stops have you made so
far? Is this your second or third?

849
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,240
It's my first, don't be stupid.

850
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,360
'Where are you?'

851
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,880
I, my friend,
am sitting in the back of

852
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,480
a beautiful Bentley Mulsanne EWB.

853
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,480
So, you've taken a boat
to get in the back of a Bentley

854
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,760
that you know is slower
than my car, and now you're

855
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,160
just going to drive
all the way to Oman?

856
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,960
'I had you down as a clever man.'

857
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,680
I didn't say anything about driving
all the way to Oman.

858
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,000
OK.

859
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,080
Oh, do you want some money?
Do you want money?

860
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,960
'Yeah, you have to pay
for that fuel.'

861
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,040
Hey, listen...

862
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,720
- PHONE BEEPS
- Oh, he's gone.

863
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,440
HE CHUCKLES

864
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,960
A small, angry man in Dubai

865
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,160
Rocks up in his Chiron,
says, "Hi..."

866
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,200
With his mad little grin
Cos he thinks he'll win...

867
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,960
BLEEP!

868
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,360
OK, my plan to avoid all of Dubai's
traffic with the speedboat

869
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,200
had backfired,
and after two hours of racing,

870
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,360
I was still stuck downtown,

871
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,360
while Chris was approaching Oman,
100 miles ahead of me.

872
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,080
Ah. The border.

873
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:31,280
Which looks strangely similar
to the Mound Stand at Lord's.

874
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,840
What's going to happen here?
Don't we just go through?

875
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,840
He's got a gun.

876
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,760
He's got a gun as well, actually,
I didn't notice him.

877
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,880
What's going on here?
Come on, let me through...

878
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes! I'm liking the look of this!

879
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,080
You see...?

880
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,920
The Bugatti Chiron improves
international relations -

881
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,120
just smile and look as if you are
comfortable with what you're doing.

882
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,920
What's he doing?
He wants me to wait here?

883
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,480
Or what? Wait here?

884
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,160
Good, OK, OK.

885
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,720
MEN CHATTER

886
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,760
So...

887
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,760
They're all tweeting
and taking photos of the car.

888
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,240
- Hashtag - can I please get on
with it? - How are you, sir?

889
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,720
- Hello, how are you? - Welcome back.
- Thank you. Hello.

890
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,880
- Sir, I've got to change
this number. - What?

891
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,320
So they're re-registering the car
cos we've entered Oman.

892
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,440
This is a disaster,
I've been here 30 minutes now.

893
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,240
Matt LeSmuggins is going to be...

894
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,760
I don't know where he is.

895
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,040
Well, I had finally reached
stage three of my plan...

896
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,200
TYRES SCREECH

897
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,400
Thanks, Stig!

898
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,680
'..and really had
some catching up to do.'

899
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,120
How are you?

900
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,200
Nice to see you. Hello.

901
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,160
OK. Did not plan on
that much traffic.

902
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,200
Worse still, Chris had crossed
the border into Oman.

903
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,240
'Luckily, stage three...
was a good one.'

904
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,720
Ho-ho! There it is.

905
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,600
The Honda Jet,
as in a jet made by Honda.

906
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,920
Howdy, boys. Let's go!

907
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,800
This thing's quick!

908
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,400
Oh, that's a steep climb.

909
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,120
Yeah, baby.

910
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,240
That's what I'm talking about.

911
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,280
Hey, how fast are we going?

912
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,680
About 480mph. Maxed out, boom!

913
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,480
It's like we're rolling up here.

914
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,760
You know, somewhere down there
there's a very small man

915
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,040
in a very fast car,
and though that very small man

916
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,920
is still talking a very big game...

917
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,840
..deep down, deep, deep down,

918
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,520
that very small man knows very well
that he is going to lose.

919
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,360
It's very sad.

920
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:20,680
That border check situation...
That lost me a lot of time.

921
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:26,240
Come on, Mr Bugatti... We might just
have to deploy a bit of your speed.

922
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,200
Meanwhile...at 15,000 feet...

923
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,360
The Honda Jet, £3.6 million,
20 years in the making.

924
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,840
Its ground-breaking
overwing engine design

925
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,520
maximises performance
and efficiency.

926
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,680
It comes with snacks too.

927
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,640
But what it all really adds up to
is a great way to overtake a Chiron.

928
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,520
You're what...? You're in a Honda?

929
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,840
No, it's not a Civic.

930
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,920
No, it's not an Accord.

931
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,680
It's not the NSX either.

932
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,920
It's the Honda Jet.

933
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,240
Git! Utter git!

934
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,920
I can't even boast that I've got

935
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,560
the fastest, most expensive
toy now, can I?

936
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,720
'The Honda had definitely
put me back in the game.'

937
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,880
Making time, making time...

938
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,880
'But my one-hour flight would
touch me down in Muscat,

939
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,120
'which was still a good 100 miles

940
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,640
'from the mountaintop finish line.

941
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,480
'So, Chris was technically
still in the lead...'

942
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,480
Speed's dropping again.

943
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,800
'..for now.'

944
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,640
We're coming into another town...

945
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,920
It's becoming a pain, this.

946
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,080
You know when your brain tells you
you just have to keep moving

947
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,920
when the traffic stops, so you
dive off and take another route

948
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,360
and think that keeping moving
is the thing...?

949
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,120
But it turns out to be rubbish?

950
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,760
Yeah, that's where I am now.

951
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,440
Matt's going to be quivering

952
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,640
when he finds out how fast
I'm driving through here.

953
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,040
HE WHEEZES

954
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,960
This is ridiculous.

955
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,560
- SENSOR BLEEPS
- No, no, no, no, no...

956
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,840
This thing is two metres wide!

957
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,120
YELLS: I hate this!

958
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,000
A-a-a-a-nd...touchdown.

959
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,680
Thanks a lot, take care.

960
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,160
'Stage four, it was time to open up
the backpack.'

961
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Excuse me one second,
I'll be right back.

962
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,280
I've got to take care of something.

963
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,680
So, the rules said no driving...

964
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,720
HE CHUCKLES MISCHIEVOUSLY

965
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,960
Nobody said anything about riding.

966
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,160
This is the new
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

967
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,640
Hey, Chris, I don't know where
you are or what you're doing,

968
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,280
but I'm pretty confident
I'm going to win.

969
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,160
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and, no,

970
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,480
your average billionaire

971
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,000
probably wouldn't finish
their commute on a bike,

972
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,360
but that's probably because
they haven't tried THIS bike.

973
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,400
The Superleggera will do 0-60
in about two and a half seconds,

974
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,080
which is the same as the Chiron.

975
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,760
The only difference is I don't need
1,500 horsepower to do it,

976
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,240
just a bit of bravery.

977
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,600
The top speed is
190-something miles an hour.

978
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,240
Now, some people will look at that
and say,

979
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,200
"Well, that's just stupid,

980
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,080
"that's more speed than anyone
would ever need."

981
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,320
To which I say, "Exactly."

982
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,360
The small, angry man in Dubai
Rocked up in his Chiron, said, "Hi"

983
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,640
With a mad little grin
He thought he could win

984
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,000
But at the bar in the mountains
he'll cry.

985
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,320
That's it, that's the rhyme.

986
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,560
But as I made short work of
my 100-mile ride from Muscat,

987
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,320
Chris had found his way
back onto the open road.

988
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,840
Are you off the plane?

989
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,680
- Yeah, I'm on a bike.
- What do you mean, you're on a bike?

990
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,840
What bike?

991
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,680
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

992
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,240
- You what?!
- Yeah, you better stand on it, buddy.

993
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,640
That bike is basically
a personal teleportation device.

994
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,160
Thankfully, so is the Chiron.

995
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,480
Let's get a move on.

996
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,720
Now we're talking.
A little bit of open road here.

997
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,800
Come on, push, push!

998
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,880
Come on! Come on! Come on!

999
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Foot down.

1000
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,600
- This thing's - BLEEP - fast!

1001
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,960
Approaching the mountains
from opposite sides,

1002
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,200
we were entering the final stage
of the race.

1003
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,160
With no way of telling
who was in front,

1004
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,840
there was just one road up
to the finish line...

1005
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,280
Oh, look at that.

1006
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,040
..and it was a good one.

1007
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,560
This is about to get fun.

1008
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,040
Wow!

1009
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,880
Now this is a proper road!

1010
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,400
Look at it, fantastic!

1011
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,680
Now we're talking.

1012
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,080
This is nice!

1013
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,760
God, it goes left to right so good.
It just holds the line perfect.

1014
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,680
And I know this is a car show...

1015
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,320
so you probably want the Chiron
to win, but if it doesn't...

1016
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,120
I mean, when...
When it doesn't...

1017
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,400
..don't blame the car...
blame Harris.

1018
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,840
I don't know if I'm hunting him down
and catching him

1019
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,520
or maybe he's catching me.

1020
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,240
I don't see that big gold Bugatti
in my mirror.

1021
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,440
Got to be in front. He's got to be.

1022
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,640
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Please let me be ahead of him!

1023
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,920
Please let me be ahead of him!

1024
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,160
Come on, push, push!

1025
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Push, LeBlanc!

1026
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,040
Come on, Mr Chiron!
We have to win this!

1027
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,800
This is it, this is it.

1028
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,440
OK, thanks, buddy.

1029
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,360
Where is he?

1030
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,080
That's it, that's the spot.

1031
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,880
He's small, but he's not that small,
I don't see him.

1032
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,120
I think we have a winner!

1033
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,120
Oh, yes, that's what I'm
talking about, look at that view!

1034
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,360
Harris is going to be so mad.

1035
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,960
I can't wait to see the look
on his little...

1036
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,120
..bald face.

1037
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,880
There you go...
Have a Chiron. And no-one there.

1038
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,320
I think we've got this, boys.
I think we've got...

1039
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,840
Oh, come on, no.

1040
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,000
Welcome to Oman!
HE LAUGHS

1041
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,200
- No! - How are you, my friend?

1042
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,840
Why so slow...bro?

1043
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,200
I haven't even thought of my line!

1044
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,080
- MATT CHUCKLES
- Oh...

1045
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,720
What was your line?

1046
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,040
It's like you're always stuck
in second gear,

1047
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,520
which looking at it now
wasn't very funny, was it?

1048
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,080
- I was stuck in top gear, my friend.
- Yes, well done. Well done.

1049
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,920
- MATT LAUGHS
- Oh! - Oh, yeah.

1050
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,040
I can't believe I lost.

1051
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,600
You didn't lose.

1052
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,480
If you say I just came second,
I'll throw you off that balcony.

1053
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,800
- No, no, no. - OK.

1054
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,600
No, you lost.
CHRIS LAUGHS

1055
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,400
No! Just get me off of here!

1056
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,520
Cheers.

1057
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,800
That's a good beer.

1058
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,240
It never tastes as good as
a winning beer, though, does it?

1059
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,360
- You want to try that one? - Yeah.

1060
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,600
Thank you.

1061
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh, yeah, that's better.

1062
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,960
MATT SPITS
Oh!

1063
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,280
You just missed the sunset,
it was beautiful.

1064
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,520
We could have held hands
and everything.

1065
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,880

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1067
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,760
So close. So, so close.

1068
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,960
That was so close.

1069
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,360
You know, I think if it wasn't
for that border crossing,

1070
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,560
you would have had me.

1071
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,640
Well, the border crossing and
the fact that I had my own jet.

1072
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,200
- Look, I'm gutted, but I made the
Chiron look good value. - What?!

1073
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,800
Well, add up the cost of the boat,

1074
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,240
the limo and then the plane
and the bike... How much is that?

1075
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,160
- About £5 million. - OK.

1076
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,560
Double the price of the Chiron and
I only lost by a couple of minutes.

1077
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,520
- You still lost. - Mm. - Or, or...

1078
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,360
I maximised my time in the most
extraordinary car of the millennium.

1079
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,800
Ah! No, you lost.

1080
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,880
On next week's show,

1081
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,120
a motorsport battle
as we find out who's quickest...

1082
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,080
Chris Harris or Sabine Schmitz?

1083
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,000
And an American man drives
an American car in America.

1084
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,640
Yes, he does, the Ford GT.

1085
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,520
AUDIENCE: Whoo!
That's right.

1086
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,640
- We will see you then. Good night.
- Night.
