CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,319
Thank you so much. Hello!

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,039
Hello and welcome.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,719
Now, even though this programme
has taken a terrible battering

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,319
in the newspapers
in recent weeks,

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,040
we have made every
effort we possibly can

8
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,759
to make sure this
series is unaffected.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,566
SCATTERED APPLAUSE
Thank you. Thank you, really.

10
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:44,050
Thanks very much.

11
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:47,799
So, coming up now is a montage
of what you can expect

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
over the next seven weeks.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,159
57 miles to the gallon!

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,959
So, spacious... and economical.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,079
Going through the first corner...

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,640
And THAT is how a camshaft works.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,520
Mate!

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,319
No-o-o!
There's been a bit of a mistake.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,660
THAT is the tape we
sent to the newspapers

20
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,999
in the hope they'd be
fooled into thinking

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,399
that's what we'll be doing.
What we're actually doing is THIS!

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,989
Oh, no! That's not what I wanted to see
in the mirror! Heading to the side...

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,375
ENGINE ROARS

24
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,869
There he is! There he is!

25
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,470
Turning left into Acacia Avenue.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Over there. Over there.
Go over there!

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,719
Buffeting! Buffeting!

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
He's The Stig's Chinese cousin.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,039
Hold onto your spine.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,880
GROANING
Johnson makes a good start.

31
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,568
Come on, you little bugger!

32
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,390
Man alive!
Are we getting some shots here?!

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,670
Thank you. Just browsing.

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,339
Stretch it, stretch it, stretch it!
Come on!

35
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,040
HE CHUCKLES
Ow!

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,620
How's that possible?

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,170
Oh... That was beautiful.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,233
All of that is to come,
but we kick off tonight with this.

39
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,419
Yes, because this is important.

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,358
Let's say you want a mid-engine
supercar but, for some reason,

41
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,330
you don't want a Ferrari 458.

42
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,519
What is best for you?

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,759
Now, naturally, of course, us three
could not agree on a solution on this,

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,820
so the producer said
we had to settle our

45
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,880
differences with a road
trip across Italy.

46
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,579
'The meeting point was the beautiful
town of Lecce, in the heel of Italy,

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,680
'and I was the first to arrive.'

48
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:24,963
This is the McLaren MP4-12C.

49
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:31,679
It's a car made with an almost
psychotic attention to detail.

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,399
It's very technical. It's why, I think,
it probably suits me quite well.

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,240
ENGINE ROARS Then Jeremy arrived in
a car that suits HIM quite well.

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,839
Morning, shrinking violet.
JEREMY LAUGHS

53
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:48,807
This...

54
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,341
HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS

55
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,869
is a Lamborghini Aventador.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,480
What I love most of all
about this is that

57
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,479
Audi did all the boring
engine and wiring bits

58
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,039
and then let Lamborghini
go mad with the styling.

59
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,799
It looks better than yours and,
therefore, it IS better.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,799
I agree. As a poster, as Lamborghinis
always have been, it is superb.

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,239
It looks great.

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,720
But it's a bit of a dinosaur,
to be honest. It is. It is.

63
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:22,199
It's too big, it's too wide.
I'm sorry?! This, you just know...

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,399
All they ever talked about was G.
They were sitting going,

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,079
"How can we make it go round
a corner a little bit faster?"

66
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,239
It's a supercar. "So give it guns!
Let's give it guns! Space rockets!"

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,760
This...
they will have had seven years of

68
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,279
meetings to get to
that windscreen wiper.

69
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,100
So it works properly.
What's wrong with that?

70
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,919
Lamborghini would've said,
"Why don't we use a laser?

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,359
"Why don't we have lasers shooting
heat onto the windscreen to...?"

72
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,140
That's why I love Lambos.
They're mental.

73
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,919
Have you had a lot of pop today?

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,319
'At that moment, Hammond arrived,
in a Noble M600.' Oh, yeah.

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,039
So, Hammond... Morning.
Let's just get this straight.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,359
You think there are people
in the world who are going to say,

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,919
"No, I don't want something Italian
and exotic. Don't want a Ferrari.

78
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,620
"I want something built
on a light industrial

79
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:14,319
unit in Leicestershire"?
No, because...

80
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,940
No, wait a minute. Sorry.
You buy this, I think,

81
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,559
because it's got the
engine from a Volvo XC90.

82
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,039
No! Yes, the engine may be from
a Volvo, but it's made by Yamaha.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,540
It's twin-engine, it's
absolutely magnificent,

84
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,039
and this car, above
everything else, is light.

85
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,959
Comparing these...
it's like comparing me with you.

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,119
The power-to-weight ratio is insane.
541 brake horsepower per tonne in there.

87
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,719
That's Bugatti Veyron territory,
and you know it!

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,679
This is going to crush you guys like
beetles under its feet.

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,000
Soon, our cars started to draw
a bit of a crowd...

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,340
so the producer said we
should leave the town

91
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:58,120
and go for a little
drive in the country.

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
Bloody hellfire!

93
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,520
HE CHUCKLES

94
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,278
Quite good.

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,260
You are probably sitting
there, thinking, "Hold on!

96
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,319
Why would I spend ã228,000

97
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,479
"on a car with no airbags or
anti-lock brakes, made in Leicester?"

98
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,999
But that's missing the point.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,999
If I were to ask those two what the
best supercar ever made is,

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,879
I know what they'd answer.

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,319
Ferrari F40.

102
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,799
There's something
of the Ferrari F40 about this.

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,359
Something to do with the way it rides
on the road, the way it feels.

104
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
The simplicity of it.

105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,239
I buy the argument for
a flamboyant supercar. I get it.

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
But maybe there is another
way of doing it.

107
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,840
There's a sort of joy
in things that simply

108
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:55,359
work really well,
like this gearbox.

109
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,999
It's sort of like a two-stage
trigger on a sniping rifle...

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,160
you can preload it with half
a ball... and then change.

111
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
It's very satisfying.

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,359
Maybe really anal attention to detail
will have a charm of its own. Let's see.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,620
James and Richard can
make as many arguments

114
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,879
as they want, but
the fact is this.

115
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,799
They're driving about
in Virgin Cola.

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,039
It's not the real thing.
This is the real thing.

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,719
Lamborghini invented
the supercar with the Miura,

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,119
the world's first mid-engine
speed and dream machine.

119
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,959
I mean, yes,
this is the most expensive car here.

120
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,159
A quarter of a million pounds.
But who cares? It's a dream car.

121
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,580
You don't dream about going
to Filey or Bridlington.

122
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,000
You dream about going to Tahiti.

123
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,239
Actually, Tahiti's terrible.
I went there once.

124
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,600
It was full of Americans
looking at dolphins.

125
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,399
'Half an hour later, we were told to
brim the tanks in our cars

126
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,959
'and pay careful attention to the
challenge we were about to receive.'

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,640
Hang on a minute.
"You will now see which of

128
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:08,319
your cars can achieve
the highest speed."

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,039
That'll be mine.
It's as simple as that.

130
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,719
It's the fastest.

131
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,799
"How fast your car can go is
not relevant." It sort of is.

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
"It's how fast you dare drive it."

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,519
'The location for this challenge was
the Nardo test track,

134
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,840
'a banked 8-mile circle of tarmac so
vast it can be seen clearly from space.

135
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,399
'No car can achieve its true top speed
here because it's one endless corner.

136
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,720
'But it is one of only
two or three places

they can get close.

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,359
'Lamborghini and McLaren had both sent

'But as for Richard
and his car from Leicester... '

142
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,599
Do Noble not have a workshop here?
Not a workshop, no.

143
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,359
I suppose if we were doing this at
Mallory Park, they'd send Geoff over(!)

144
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,879
I've done it. It's all right.
All four tyres are the same makes.

145
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,039
That there's air in 'em.

146
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,919
'James and I were feeling fairly
confident...

147
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,599
'until we started chatting to a man
called Max Venturi,

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,239
'who is one of Lambo's
test drivers.'

149
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,359
We do a lot of testing here but
we don't do too much the top speed,

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,959
because it is very bumpy.

151
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,839
You... you could jump from one lane
to the other lane,

152
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,519
so is... That sounds bad.

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,679
And also, today, it is windy,

154
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,360
so you need to take care
about the wind, as well.

155
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:46,040
What, do we need to tack(?)

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,279
'Because speedometers are never
absolutely accurate,

of our cars with hi-tech telemetry

'so they could see how fast
we were really going.

'And then we were sent on to
the track for a sighting lap.'

160
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,239
I have the most to lose here.

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,559
My car is the fastest...
top speed 225mph.

162
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,759
Jeremy's Lambo... 217,
James's McLaren 205mph,

163
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,919
or to put it another way,
a walking race.

164
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,679
Now, I have 691 brake horsepower
at my disposal.

165

That's almost 100 more
than James has.

166
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,679
And it's proper horsepower.

167
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,519
Blue-blooded, real horsepower.

168
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,319
Thanks to emission regulations,

169
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,679
this is probably the last V12 engine
that will ever be made.

170
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,839
From now on, they'll have to be
smaller and turbo charged,

171
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,999
like they are in the Noble
and the McLaren.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,999
Yes, my engine is the smallest.
It's a 3.8-litre V8,

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,919
but it has the highest specific output,
that is, of all the engines here,

174
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,959
it produces the most BHP per litre,

175
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,119
because it's been intelligently
designed by engineers in Woking,

176
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,760
not just put together
to impress yahoos.

177
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,599
Those two keep banging on about, "This
has got the engine out of a Volvo XC90."

178
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,399
Yes, well, OK,
but let's not forget, Yamaha make it,

179
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,439
and they produce some pretty amazing
motorcycle engines,

180
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,199
and Noble have then strapped two turbos
to it, so it makes 650 brake horsepower.

181
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,120
I say that,
but I can change that.

182
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:35,279
With this button down here, I can
have 450 for road, 550 for track,

183
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,239
or 650 for race. I'm going to
have the full 650, I think, today.

184
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,239
I do have quite a lot of respect for
the Midget doing this, because...

185
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,039
Well, the last time he tried to go fast
on a test track, it didn't go well.

186
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,519
With the sighting lap over,

187
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,520
we were told to put some distance
between ourselves and go for it.

188
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm moving up into the outside lane.

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,280
It's 250kph.

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,799
Now we're in 6th speed...

191
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,400
Moving up a little bit...

192
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,840
It does feel a bit wobbly.
I don't like it.

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,160
270...

194
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,399
My God, this surface is shocking!

195
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,519
There's the wind!
There's the wobble!

196
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,519
There's the jump!

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,279
Ooh, God!

198
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,039
See, that is 280, and it's
really starting to weave now. 290...

199
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,879
'Max from Lamborghini had warned
all of us

200
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,479
'that it would be too dangerous
to exceed 300km per hour.

201
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,160
'And all of us chose to ignore him.'

202
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
My foot is hard down now.

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,239
300 and... Oh, crikey! Moses.

204
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,560
I'd a lift there. Bit of a panic.

205
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,399
300km per hour indicated.
I can feel the car jumping.

206
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,439
Buffeting! Buffeting!

207
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,199
There's a scare? Whoa-ho-ho!

208
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,279
340... 360...

209
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,880
And every fibre of by being
wants me to lift off!

210
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,959
Oh, God Almighty!

211
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,440
God knows what those
tyres are going through.

212
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,679
God, it's hypnotic.

213
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,120
Don't look at the line,
don't look at the line.

214
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,559
Come on!

215
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
Please, just another ten!

216
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,599
326 indicated!

217
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
327 indicated.

218
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,599
329 indicated!
Come on... 330!

219
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,959
331.

220
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,759
Come on, give me
a bit more than 330!

221
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,279
Just give me a bit more!

222
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,679
A bit more!

223
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
This is BLEEP quick!

224
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
HIGH-PITCHED WHINE DROWNS OUT SPEECH

225
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,520
WHINE STOPS
I'm backing out of this.

226
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,319
That is...

227
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,680
Ahh!

228
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,880
Pretty bloody alarming.

229
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,359
'With the test over, it was now time
to find out which one of us

230
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,159
'had the biggest testes.'

231
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,119
The top speed of your car is 225mph.
Yes.

232
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,879
You achieved 204.8.

233
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,559
Ow!

234
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,639
Who have you got?
I've got James's. James's? Yes.

235
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,839
In the slowest car, in the slowest
car. 200... Oh!

236
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,920
And 1.6.

237
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,759
217mph IS the top speed
of the Lamborghini.

238
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,359
You did it at

239
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,239
204.3. Oh, God.

240
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,879
No! Yes!
RICHARD LAUGHS

241
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,200
No!

242
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
Ahh.

243
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,359
Ohh!

244
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,759
Right, we will, of course be picking
that up again later on.

245
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,100
Can I just say, half
a mile an hour?

246
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,439
That's all there was in it
between you and me. Yeah.

247
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,839
If I'd just kept my foot down...
Yeah. But you lost!

248
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,680
Hold on a minute. Hold on.
I think you'll find

249
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,519
you both lost.
How did you work that out?

250
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,239
Because I got closest to
the theoretical top speed of my car,

251
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,599
and therefore
I have the biggest testes. No!

252
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,039
The challenge was to see who could
drive the fastest, and I did.

253
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,220
Then we refilled the cars,
we brimmed them, to

254
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:50,399
see which had used the
least fuel doing it,

255
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,599
and guess what?!
Well, the Lambo did 7mpg,

256
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,439
the McLaren did 8mpg
and the Noble did 9!

257
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,039
So the Noble wins AGAIN! I know!

258
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,759
Just stop it! Let's just...
No, no, no. OK.

259
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,439
Let's just... just to work out where we
are, so that's two challenges so far,

260
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,039
two wins for the Noble,
and for the Lambo...

261
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,559
Now, let's see. Let's not see.
Let's do the news. All right.

262
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,719
Actually, before that, those of you
who saw our Christmas special

263
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,239
will remember we left our three cars
on plinths high in the Himalayas

264
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,319
on a road between China and India,

265
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,879
so that people passing between these
two great economic superpowers

266
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,879
would forevermore be
reminded of Great Britain.

267
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,519
Well, unfortunately,

268
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,999
it turns out that the plinths
were built on

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,039
an ancient burial ground

270
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,119
with deep religious significance,

271
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,479
so a man came and told us
to take them down immediately.

272
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,879
Yeah. So we did.
Where are the cars now?

273
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,599
They're not in the Himalayas.
But where are they?

274
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,639
Hampshire. Really? Yes. That's where
it is. Anyway, the news.

275
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,320
There was a man in the
papers this week who

276
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,999
has failed his driving
theory test 92 times.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,079
92?! I don't want to be rude,
but he must be an idiot...

278
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,220
I mean, 92...
Interestingly, you say that.

279
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:19,359
Have you seen the theory test?
I didn't have to do one.

280
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,719
Has anyone here seen the theory
test? Anybody? Yeah. You have?

281
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,039
Because most people of our age
haven't,

282
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,060
and none of the questions
have anything to do...

283
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,079
as far as I can work out...
with driving.

284
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,799
Can I give you some examples?
You can answer this.

285
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,399
"An elderly person...

286
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,440
"An elderly person's
ability could be

287
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:41,479
affected because they
may be unable to...?"

288
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,639
Eat toffees. No.

289
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,879
Get an erection.

290
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,399
LAUGHTER

291
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,479
Wear jeans!

292
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,199
Funny(!) "Where's the safest place
to park your vehicle at night?"

293
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,279
In a police station.

294
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,359
Right, we've got a picture here.
Bring up this picture. Right.

295
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,399
This is a real question, OK?

296
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,319
"You must not stop
on these road markings

297
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,880
"because you may obstruct... what?"

298
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,119
Landing aircraft(!) I mean,
seriously, that is a question.

299
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,560
He's managed to fail
92 times on that one.

300
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,999
Those are not questions
to pass your driving...

301
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,959
Do any of them say, for instance,
can you drive a car(?) No, no.

302
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,760
I'm in the book now.
This is what you buy your

303
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,559
teenage child when they're
learning to drive.

304
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,999
"At an incident,
a small child is not breathing.

305
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,300
"To restore normal
breathing, you should

306
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:36,599
breathe into their mouth,
A sharply, B gently,

307
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,959
"C heavily, D tenderly?"

308
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,679
It doesn't say "tenderly"!

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,920
I made "tenderly" up.
Nothing to do with driving!

310
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,159
That's enough driving
test rubbish.

311
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,719
We'll have to move it on,
or we'll be here all day.

312
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,839
Let's talk about cars again,
because the mighty Alfa Romeo,

313
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,399
they are reduced now,
to a full range of cars,

314
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,439
they make two. Two cars.
Really? What, the Mito and...

315
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,760
The Giulietta and the Mito.
They don't make the 159 any more?

316
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,079
No, two Alfa Romeos
on the market,

317
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,479
but that's about to change as they
have just announced this, the 4C.

318
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,159
I know. It's tiny, it's a small,
lightweight sports car.

319
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,159
Very lightweight. Carbon fibre,
all sorts of clever technical stuff.

320
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,479
Mid...engined... it's only a 1750CC
engine, but it's turbo charged,

321
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,079
so it will be quick, because it's
so light. It looks fantastic!

322
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,079
It's wrong, is what it is.
What Alfa Romeo should make

323
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,479
is a small convertible two-seater,

324
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,119
engine at the front,
rear-wheel drive.

325
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,599
They could call it, I don't know, the...
Spider? Spider's a great name.

326
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,439
And maybe they could get Dustin
Hoffman to appear in a film with it,

327
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,500
to etch it into the
world's consciousness.

328
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,559
They could, they could
live in the past.

329
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,879
Or they could make something modern and
forward-looking, like that. No, rubbish!

330
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,860
What if you two had
been at Alfa Romeo when

331
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:46,839
they came up with the
original Spider?

332
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,479
"That's no good!
Where's the horse in front of it?

333
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,319
"It's not wood. That'll never work."
It's not modern. It won't work.

334
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,759
Make it go away. I've got something
more important to talk about.

335
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,999
A new Maserati. Really(?) OK.
This is the new Maserati 4x4, OK?

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,039
I think it looks fantastic but there
are some odd things about it.

337
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,199
Maserati say that, unlike any other
big 4x4, it has a luxury atmosphere.

338
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,319
Cos every time I get in a Range
Rover, I always think, "Oh, no!

339
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,999
"I've accidentally
got into a cowshed."

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,759
And then they say,

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,319
"There are no off-roaders
that give a sporty feel."

342
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,919
What about the Porsche Cayenne?
Or the Mercedes ML63? BMW X5?

343
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,919
All of those?

344
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,360
I think Maserati...
they're the sort of company

345
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,799
that go, "We've invented
a new type of watch.

346
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,919
"What makes it really good is,
you can wear it on your wrist!"

347
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,460
This is quite awkward,
because somebody'll have

348
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,999
to tell them, "Hey,
Maserati, it's been done!"

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,940
What I love about
this, though, is it's

350
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,879
called the Kubang, which,
being a Maserati,

351
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,519
is the noise it'll make
the day the warranty runs out!

352
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,560
We received a press release
from someone who wanted to

353
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,599
get their name on the
television, I've always said.

354
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Now, they say that the
standard of your driving

355
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:05,599
gets worse if you're
suffering from a cold.

356
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,759
The thing is, they go on to say that
it's no good taking a cold remedy,

357
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,100
because the police say
that's the same as driving

358
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:18,439
while under the influence of cocaine.
Is it?!

359
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,879
Sorry, I mean... It's cheaper,
though. It isn't, is it?

360
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,039
I mean, cocaine and Day Nurse
are different products entirely.

361
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,359
They're in a different price bracket.
Entirely different.

362
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,600
I bring all this up, OK,
because when did it

363
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,839
happen that somebody
decided that driving

364
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,359
was so unbelievably hard, you can't
do it while doing something else?

365
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,759
Like listening to Ken Bruce's pop
master, or talking on the phone.

366
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,759
Honestly, I can't think of anything
that I couldn't do while driving...

367
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,199
apart from reading
a broadsheet newspaper.

368
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,799
I wouldn't be able to do that.
Sawing a piece of wood.

369
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,439
I could do that. You'd... No, no,
you put it between your legs.

370
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,700
You can still operate the pedals.
You could saw.

371
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,959
It's like sewing on a button.
You need both hands...

372
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,959
I could do that.
You could not! I could!

373
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,919
You know you can't sew on a button
with a hammer? I know how to sew.

374
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,439
While we're on the subject, did you
see that case recently...

375
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,100
a woman who was stopped
by the police after they

376
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:16,759
caught her driving down
a motorway while...

377
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,080
causing herself to have pleasure.

378
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,279
I bet you can't drive
in a sleeping bag.

379
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,599
Actually, I'm not sure.

380
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,920
I'm going to take that back. I think
you could drive in a sleeping bag.

381
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,759
You couldn't drive in a sleeping bag.
I bet I could. Can't!

382
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,479
I bet I could drive in a
sleeping bag. Right, you're on!

383
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,759
Some time this week, before next week's
show, I'll take you on round the track.

384
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,460
You drive in a proper cocoon
sleeping bag... Yeah...

385
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:49,159
and race me, and I'll sew
a button on my shirt.

386
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,039
Let me guess... I've got to drive
whilst performing an act on myself.

387
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,320
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

388
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,879
No. It'd be a short race!
We'll leave you out of it.

389
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,519
Can we make it a 50-yard sprint?!

390
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,039
Right, that is the end of the news,
so let's get back to the action.

391
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,159
Tonight, for those of you with
very short memories,

392
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,879
we are trying to answer
an important question...

393
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,079
which is the best mid-engined supercar
if you don't want a Ferrari 458?

394
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,559
James says it's the McLaren MP4-12C.

395
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,599
I say it's
the Lamborghini Aventador,

396
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,719
and Richard says
it's the Noble M600.

397
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,399
Yes, and so far,
I'm being proved right.

398
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,719
It achieved the highest top speed
and is the most economical.

399
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,159
But having tested those
sort of things,

400
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,159
we were then told to leave the test
track and drive north to Rome.

401
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,959
So, three supercars,
lovely weather, drive across Italy,

402
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,440
what could possibly go wrong(?)

403
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,999
'Certainly, as the day began, the
rather smug Hammond was very happy,

404
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,879
'making up his own little games.'

405
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,719
I'm going to make some more
turbo noise. It is addictive.

406
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,880
Put the foot down
and then lift off. Ooh!

407
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,559
Turbo noises are sort of
for children. You do know that?

408
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,180
Right, I'm going to
come alongside and give

409
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,799
you a turbo noise.
Drop your window. God...

410
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,280
Three, two, one.
ENGINE ROARS

411
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,560
This is like indulging a six-year-old
child who's learned a simple card trick.

412
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,799
GEARS CRUNCH

413
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,400
Oh, BLEEP!

414
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,399
CLATTERING AND CRUNCHING

415
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,159
I hate to say this, but I believe
I have clutch or gearbox issues.

416
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, dear.

417
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,100
I can't understand it
myself, cos you know

418
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:50,359
when you see the legend
"made in Leicester"...

419
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,919
It's a byword for reliability
and quality. Absolutely.

420
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,839
So what are the other things that
are made in Leicester?

421
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,200
Leicestershire cheese?
They make pork pies nearby, don't they?

422
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:03,559
Yeah. Pork pies are
always reliable(!)

423
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,000
Have you tried pumping the
clutch, to see if...?

424
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:08,439
Well, no, because the
linkage is to cock as well.

425
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,759
'Clearly,
the Noble wasn't going anywhere.'

426
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,119
Let me just think a minute. Sorry.

427
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,839
When something goes wrong
with my car,

428
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,359
Richard Hammond always... helps you.

429
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,919
No, the opposite of that. No, he
just gets in his car and drives off.

430
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,280
You're right. Yes. Let's do that.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

431
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,839
'We were leaving Hammond
200 miles away from Rome,

432
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,159
'and that made us
feel quite sorry for him.'

433
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,239
HE GUFFAWS

434
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,519
For two months, he's been looking
forward to driving his Noble

435
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,400
right across Italy,
and he's only gone 30 miles!

436
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
'As our cars ate up the miles,
we got to know them better.'

437
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,079
Bloody hell, it's good, this.
It really is good.

438
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,279
It's very clever.
It's active, this car.

439
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,519
It doesn't have big metal anti-roll
bars, or anything like that.

440
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,759
Everything is controlled by its brain.
It works out what each wheel is doing.

441
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,639
It can even brake an individual
wheel as you corner.

442
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,399
In the olden days, supercars were
very, very hard to drive,

443
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,679
and the hardest of them all
were the big Lambos.

444
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,559
Changing gear in a Countach
or a Diablo, you needed two hands.

445
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,399
This, though, it feels like a Golf.
I mean, I'm doing, what,

446
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,999
80mph now,
and it's almost completely silent.

447
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,959
I can see where I'm going.
I can see roughly where I've been.

448
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,319
I think it's important to
stress at this point,

449
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,119
every single thing about this car
is new.

450
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,000
Body, interior, engine, suspension.
Everything.

451
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,680
It's brand new, and it feels it.

452
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,999
'Meanwhile,
after a two-and-a-half-hour wait,

453
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
'my knight in shining armour
finally arrived.'

454
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,479

Please talk to me.

Please just say hello,

Ah, now,
there's a big tunnel coming up here.

462
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,680
The irresponsible thing
to do would be to

463
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,799
turn the power train
into the track mode

464
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,319
and change down unnecessarily.

Oh, God.

474
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,279
The thing coming off the bottom
of his phone is actually a wire...

driving across Italy in a supercar,

'Still, could be worse... '

493
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,160
SIREN BLARES

494
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,280
Oh, dear.

495
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,639
Prepare to look at shoes.

496
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,040
This is my special face,
reserved for continental policemen.

497
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
OK? OK! Yeah.

498
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,599
Still, it is under four hours
to Rome. Just.

499
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,000
TRANSLATION:

500
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,599
POLICEMAN SPEAKS IN ITALIAN

501
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,719
The only problem for them is
because today is holiday in Italy.

502
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,180
Interestingly, their
only real concern is

503
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:53,639
that we appear to be
working on a Sunday.

504
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,719
We need a permit for that.

505
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,240
That's why Italy's nearly bankrupt.

506
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,599
'Eventually, they told us
we had to stop working,

507
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,840
'so we went into Rome
for a lovely dinner.'

508
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,840
Somebody's farted.

509
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,919
'The next day, in a workshop
in the outskirts of Rome,

510
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,399
'I found out just what had gone wrong
with my Noble.'

511
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,479
This is the clutch assembly... and
this is the plate and, yeah,

512
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,359
that's pretty clearly
the component that failed.

513
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,559
Once that broke, that came away,
which is not supposed to happen.

514
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,359
The thing is, this is easily
replaceable. Noble don't make these.

515
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,279
They're bought in... it's a clutch...
but the problem now is,

516
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,399
because that was
whizzing around inside here,

517
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,820
that's damaged bearings and
shafts and all sorts of things.

518
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,240
What's it done to the gearbox?

519
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,239
'James and I decided the best way we
could help Hammond was to go for lunch,

520
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,359
'and since it was a Monday and we
were allowed to do a bit of work,

521
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,780
'we thought we'd find out
which of our cars was

522
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:08,199
best in traffic by racing
to the restaurant.

523
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,399
'Last one there would pay the bill!'

524
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,080
Right, let the race begin.

525
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:21,239
'Immediately, it was advantage Lambo,
because the Aventador has satnav... '

526
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,479
'Your route is being calculated.'
Thank you.

527
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,280
'..Whereas, on the McLaren, it's an
option... that hadn't been fitted.'

528
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,719
Argh!

529
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,759
Bollocks!

530
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,199
I'll come back to that.

531
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,359
'However, I did have some issues.'

532
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,279
HORNS BEEP
The first problem is width.

533
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,679
It's five centimetres wider
than a Range Rover.

534
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,279
It's very nearly as wide,
in fact, as a London bus,

535
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,999
but the biggest problem of them all
is the gearbox.

536
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,559
Flappy paddle boxes were OK
on a track,

537
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,439
they work OK on the open road,
but in town,

538
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,159
all of them are useless.

539
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,959
It's uh-uh-uh-uh-uh,
jerking along, and then,

540
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,599
when you want to exploit a gap,
it's dim-witted and slow.

541
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,639
'This was especially bad in a city where
there are 117 road accidents every DAY.'

542
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,919
Haven't actually seen one car yet
that isn't dented.

543
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,759
Look at that one there.

544
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,439
A red light, but that actually
doesn't mean stop. Not in Italy.

545
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,119
It means, "We're trying a red light.
In a minute, we'll try a green one."

546
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,120
It's not relevant to
the actual traffic flow.

547
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,519
What happened to that?! Oh, dear.

548
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,639
What we're now going to do,
and this is quite cool, really,

549
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,959
is turn onto the Via Appia,
the ancient Roman road,

550
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,980
and the suspension, with
its no anti-roll bars and

551
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:54,999
its intelligent computer,
is doing quite well.

552
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,919
Excellently, in fact.

553
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Why is nobody using that middle bit?
Yes! That's the ticket!

554
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,800
Ah, now, you see, I didn't actually
think it would get quite THAT Roman.

555
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,399
CRUNCH!
Erm...

556
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm going to by
overtaken by a Smart car!

557
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,759
'By this stage, I'd worked out why
no-one was using the middle bit. '

558
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,079
TRAM BELL RINGS

559
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,440
I've got myself on a railway line.

560
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,079
Now what am I going to do?

561
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,119
Sorry. Yeah, now I'm basically
going down a... Yes.

562
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,999
I'm now driving down
a railway embankment...

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,799
HE LAUGHS

564
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,600
Ristorante Nino, Via Appia...

565
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,400
Yeah, the ground clearance
is very poor. OK.

566
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,679
'Soon, though, after a short drive
through a bit of history... '

567
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,119
No! God Al-bloody-mighty!

568
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,399
'..We were both near
our destination.'

569
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,799
I'm so close.

570
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,360
BLEEP!

571
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,559
Now, the restaurant is coming up
in 30 metres. There it is.

572
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,599
'All I had to do now was park.'

573
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,020
That's Veneto. It's too wide.
You see, if I

574
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,439
park there, I just block
the whole street.

575
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,840
Oh, God. No, you're joking.

576
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,199
No-o-o!

577
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,359
How do you park a Lamborghini here?

578
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,639
CRUNCH!
Ohh-hh!

579
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,759
Is that the piazza? I think it is.
I'm right on top of it.

580
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,719
Via Vittorio. It's correct!

581
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,840
Right, parking space.

582
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,519
CRUNCH! Hell's... BLEEP ..
bum... BLEEP ..arseholes.

583
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,679
Parking, parking, parking, parking.

584
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,719
It's the easiest thing in the world,
reversing a Lambo.

585
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,760
You just get out of the car
to do it.

586
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,399
Can I go there? Why can't
I go there? There's no lines.

587
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
James May, get ready to lose.

588
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,040
Prego? Prego. Have you seen a very
long-haired man? An idiot? Here.

589
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:26,194
'After lunch, which I didn't bother
with, because I was paying,

590
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:29,999
'we decided to help Richard
some more by going shopping.

591
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,799
'And then, we got a bit
of a surprise.' That's Hammond.

592
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,119
No, but it's not...

593
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,200
ENGINE REVS

594
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:44,511
That's a different car.
No, no. This is still wet.

595
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:46,495
Don't lean on it. I painted it.

596
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,870
Maybe you thought, "I'll put
the steering wheel on this side"(?)

597
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:52,404
It's always been on that side.
You were looking at

598
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:55,319
me in your rear-view mirror.
You have changed cars.

599
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,880
Hammond? What?

600
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,519
Oh, you're joking! Oh, come on!

601
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,519
This isn't my car. Mine's red.

602
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:06,651
You haven't caused a stir.
Buongiorno.

603
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:08,735
I think people have come to see...

604
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,639
Did that first delivery driver...

605
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,039
Did that first repair man
not say anything? No.

606
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,839
I don't think he could see me.
"Hello! I'm here." No, nothing.

607
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,439
Anyway, can we just ask... how did
a tiny little company like Noble

608
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,500
get another car out there so quickly?
I'm being serious.

609
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:31,175
Be serious.
Seriously, they drove it.

610
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,753
A bloke drove it from the factory,
overnight,

611
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:36,575
all the way from Leicester
to Rome in one hit.

612
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,320
That's what I call service.
"Certainly, sir.

613
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,359
We'll send you another car."

614
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,378
But it is Noble... you mean, "We'll
send you THE other car"? Yeah.

615
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,987
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on.
Now, though, it

616
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,503
is time to put a star in
our reasonably priced car.

617
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,347
Let me list some songs. I'm Not In
Love, Wichita Lineman, Lady In Red.

618
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:59,815
My guest tonight hasn't
recorded any of those.

619
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:04,814
That's because he's from an organisation
called the Black Eyed Peas.

620
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Will.I.Am.

621
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:11,920
CHEERING AND WHISTLING

622
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:18,635
How are you? Good to see you.
Good to see you.

623
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,240
Wow!

624
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,758
Your e-mail address must be
a nightmare!

625
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:38,112
will.i.am.@.a.o.l.

626
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:39,429
.uk.

627
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:41,120
LAUGHTER

628
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,315
I have never met anybody
in my entire life

629
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,534
who is apparently
as busy as you are,

630
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,839
because you're a fashion designer,

631
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,039
you've worked for Obama, starred
in X-Men Origins and Madagascar,

632
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,359
you run a scholarship fund for
disadvantaged youngsters,

633
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,759
you're a creative director at Intel,
you developed smartphones,

634
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,253
produce everyone in the
world, make your own music,

635
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:10,014
♪

636
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:13,736
and you've started a car company.
Yeah. What is it?

637
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,001
Tell us about it.

638
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:19,728
So, um, when I was working at Intel,
I found out that a lot of the phones

639
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,189
and the things that you have

640
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,709
aren't really made by the name
that's on the phone,

641
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,290
so there's all these companies
in Southeast Asia that

642
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:31,345
make all the equipment.
You mean the components?

643
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,056
Yeah. Then you put them together, like a
sandwich, and then you got your product.

644
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:37,720
Then I got into my car...

645
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,814
I want to know how much it cost to
make this Bentley that I'm driving.

646
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:44,949
A Bentley? Yeah. About 38 pence!

647
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:50,269
Right. Cos it's just a Volkswagen
with some wood on the dashboard.

648
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,210
So, for the past two years,
we've been tooling...

649
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:54,149
I design things on my computer.

650
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,589
The first thing
I did was a Thundervet,

651
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,830
where you take a
Thunderbird and a vet...

652
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:01,069
We've got a photograph of it.

653
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,949
Yeah, that's a Thundervet.
Cos that looks like a '50s vet.

654
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,090
The white slash is
'50s vet, but there's

655
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:09,229
some Thunderbird in there, as well?
Yeah.

656
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,876
So, the groove and stuff. And those
wheels aren't white-wall tyres.

657
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:17,790
That's a white-wall rim,
with the five-spoke inside of it.

658
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,709
Oh, that's the actual rim?

659
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,389
Yeah. That's fantastic.
So, what engine has it got?

660
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,269
That has a super-sized
Corvette engine in it.

661
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,103
And have you designed your own
car now, with its own body?

662
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,337
Yes.
So, that was just, you know,

663
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:33,469
let's test what we can do with this.

664
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,789
From there, we go on to something
that we built from scratch.

665
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,309
I think we've got a picture of it,
as well. IAMAUTO 88. That is...

666
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,909
It's a bit like an old Maserati
Quattroporte, except it's two-door.

667
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,690
And that's made in California?
That's made down

668
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,665
in the ghetto that I'm from.
Why...? Really?

669
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:55,486
Yeah. My whole thing was, "I'm going to
make music so I can take care of my mom,

670
00:40:55,658 --> 00:40:58,030
"and move my family out the ghetto."

671
00:40:58,031 --> 00:41:01,572
So, if that's what I want to do,
then it's going to keep me going,

672
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:03,556
so there's no "no" for an answer.

673
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,212
So, now that I've done that, and
every single person in my family...

674
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:10,440
cousins, uncles, nieces
and nephews... are out the ghetto,

675
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:15,589
I want to go back to my ghetto
and build a car company.

676
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,029
We all complain about underdeveloped
communities,

677
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,149
but who are the developers
in the first place?

678
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,220
So, I was like, "I'm tired of
complaining and pointing fingers.

679
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:29,439
"Why don't I aim that finger
to me and say,

680
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:32,509
" 'Hey, what are you doing to change
the ghetto you're from?'"

681
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:35,476
Do you know, you're one
of the most inspiring

682
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:37,618
people we've ever had
sitting in that sofa.

683
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:39,429
He is, though, isn't he?

684
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,909
APPLAUSE

685
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,269
If everybody thought like that,
we'd have 1.65% growth as well!

686
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,670
Um, can we just go
into your car history?

687
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,069
Where did it begin?
What was your first car?

688
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,978
So, I got a record deal when I was
17 and I bought myself...

689
00:41:56,095 --> 00:42:01,220
cos I always wanted a Ferrari
or a DeLorean.

690
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:04,939
Those were my favourite cars.
I couldn't afford those,

691
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,993
so I got the poor man's Ferrari,
which is a Fiero.

692
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:13,462
Yeah, that's really poor.
That's even the poor man's MR2.

693
00:42:13,603 --> 00:42:14,927
I had a yellow one.

694
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,353
Mid-engine,
so it was kind of like a Ferrari

695
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,029
if you were standing five miles away
and squinting!

696
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:26,909
And then my next-door neighbour
Pearleen snitched.

697
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,389
She told my mom, "Ooh, Debra, Willy
got himself a new car."

698
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:35,650
And then my mom calls me
in the house.

699
00:42:35,706 --> 00:42:37,533
"Boy, sit your butt down
on this couch."

700
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:40,947
"What, Momma?
" "You got no business buying

701
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,829
yourself no G-damn car.
" "Yeah, but..."

702
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,229
"No but nothing.
Gimme them damn keys."

703
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,389
So she confiscated my car.

704
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,989
So then I couldn't drive
until I was 20.

705
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:59,548
So it just sat there?
A 2,000...Car. For three years?

706
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:01,236
For three years it sat there.

707
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:03,883
I couldn't wait till I was
20, then I could drive it.

708
00:43:03,907 --> 00:43:07,861
Black Eyed Peas... how many records
have you sold? Millions.

709
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,728
To date, 40 something million
records. 40 million?

710
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,109
It is massive. And you've got...

711
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,150
APPLAUSE
Yeah! 40 million.

712
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,095
And you've now got a solo album out.

713
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:28,017
And it's called Squiggle Squiggle
#willpower.

714
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:32,181
No, it's just #willpower.
#willpower.

715
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:34,915
There are squiggles.
Oh, it's a hash!

716
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,269
I just thought it
was like a misprint. No, no.

717
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:45,470
Have you ever been interviewed by
somebody more old than me? Um... no...

718
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,069
Now, you came down here,
obviously... well,

719
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:55,749
looking at your gloves, to play
golf, but, um, it isn't a Golf.

720
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,229
No, no. The reason I have
fingerless gloves is

721
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,389
because I got touchscreen technology
devices,

722
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,309
so last thing you want is, in the cold,
I have to go, "My phone is ringing..."

723
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,550
No, cos you can buy
gloves that have got

724
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:10,789
fingerprint things, so wearing...
I've got a pair.

725
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,749
They're not fashion.

726
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:17,069
There you go! They're the ugliest
gloves in the world.

727
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:20,096
They look pretty poor, I admit.

728
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,932
You insisted, I believe,
in driving the

729
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:26,439
automatic car, rather
than the stick-shift.

730
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:29,149
Yeah. So, how did it go out there?

731
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,189
I think I did pretty good,
if you judge me on spinning.

732
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:38,389
Well, now, who would like to see
some of Will's spins?

733
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,869
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

734
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,149
We have a selection.
Let's have a look.

735
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,079
Yes, there we go.
Second-to-last corner.

736
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:49,096
Bold as brass. He's held it...
No, he hasn't! Ooh!

737
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:53,337
That's a tank-slapper, that one was.
Yeah. Here we go again.

738
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,869
Now... Spinny!

739
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,389
APPLAUSE

740
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,909
Why are we applauding?
Those were mistakes.

741
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,789
You probably want to have
a different spin award... Yeah.

742
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,189
Who would like to see
the finished lap?

743
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,829
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
Let's play the tape. Here we go.

744
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,309
TYRES SPIN

745
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,949
Needs to spin with an automatic box.
Like to see it!

746
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:23,268
Right, here we go.

747
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:28,561
Here's the first corner.
Wide line, like a Formula 1 driver.

748
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,132
Tyre squeal... even in the wet!

749
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:34,229
Oh, that's nicely done.
That was nicely done.

750
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,349
Brake...

751
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,789
A man of few words.

752
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:41,866
That's nice and smooth
through there.

753
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,210
Good wide lines, so you
can get the power down.

754
00:45:44,322 --> 00:45:45,897
And up to the Hammerhead.

755
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:48,116
♪ Da-da-da-boom-boom-boom

756
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,789
♪ Brake hard, brake here... ♪

757
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,749
Were you singing?
To keep myself focused and stuff.

758
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,709
I was getting kinda nervous.

759
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:01,311
♪ The line and the lines... ♪
It's good.

760
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:04,589
C apostrophe D now.
Listen to that engine.

761
00:46:04,606 --> 00:46:07,741
Wow! That's a sporty noise.

762
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:10,508
Go! Stupid car!

763
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,909
Looking good through there...

764
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,669
Oh, there's a bit of dirt
from an earlier spin coming out.

765
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,749
Through the tyres.

766
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,709
Are we going to get through the
second-to-last without a problem?

767
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,269
That was cut perfectly.
And Gambon...

768
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,469
Keep it in tight...
All right, don't.

769
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,149
And there we are!
And across the line!

770
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,270
Wey-hey-hey!

771
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:46,772
So... Now, you're driving the automatic,
so that's slower, obviously,

772
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:50,780
and it's raining, so we're not looking
for a particularly fast time.

773
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:53,671
Um... but...
I'm trying to think, actually.

774
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,476
Automatic drivers... we've only had
two so far in this car.

775
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:59,780
They are John Prescott.

776
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:03,249
LAUGHTER
You don't know John Prescott? Hmm.

777
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,989
He's a fashion designer.

778
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,669
LAUGHTER

779
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,069
And Alice Cooper. OK?

780
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,989
Those are the only automatics, and
they're both 1.56. And they're wet.

781
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,960
Oh, yeah. Both had wet days,
both driving automatics.

782
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:18,390
Both in the 1.56.3 region.

783
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:24,510
will.i.am., you did it in 1...

784
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:28,029
40...

785
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,069
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

786
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,349
9.4.

787
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,829
So, you get wet and auto,

788
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,389
and that's the fastest we've ever had
in that car in those conditions! Yay!

789
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,870
You are... there.

790
00:47:46,142 --> 00:47:50,208
So, above Peta, 23, from Essex...
Below Jonathan Ross.

791
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,549
Stig did a good thing, then.
Oh, yeah.

792
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,989
That was impressive,
and you were trying.

793
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,109
It has been genuinely inspirational
having you here,

794
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,771
and an enormous pleasure.

795
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:02,244
Ladies and gentlemen, will.i.am!
Thank you!

796
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,790
Thank you very, very much.
Was that OK?

797
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:20,060
Right, now, we must get back
to our big supercar test.

798
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,509
So far, we've established that my Noble
is the fastest and the most economical.

799
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,590
The most unreliable.
Yes, funny. We've also

800
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,669
established that the McLaren
is the best around town,

801
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,570
and that Jeremy's big,
idiotic Lamborghini

802
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,919
hasn't actually won anything.
Nothing! Zero.

803
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,474
Hmm. Nil. Zilch. Rien. Nowt.

804
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,749
The square root of Jack.
Nothing... we've established that!

805
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,109
Let's move on,
because it's time now for part three,

806
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,510
in which we three must face the most
dangerous thing we've ever done.

807
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,349
'As we headed north to our date with
destiny,

808
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,029
'we started to think about how
our cars compare to the daddy.'

809
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,349
Three days ago, if you'd said to me,

810
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,349
"Which would you rather have,
an Aventador or Ferrari 458?"

811
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,469
I would have said, "The Ferrari."
I mean, it's the obvious choice.

812
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,829
But now... No, I'd have this.

813
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:25,509
I know a Ferrari 458 is just a technical
masterpiece and it looks wonderful,

814
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,530
but this has got something
the Ferrari doesn't have.

815
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:31,550
It has... It has a character.

816
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,509
It's like a big, daft orange dog!

817
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,710
Everybody wants a big,
daft orange dog!

818
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,309
It's won me over. Completely.
It's not just the best car here.

819
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,589
It's better than the Ferrari 458.

820
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,549
For me, it's one of the best cars in
the world now. I absolutely love it.

821
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:57,309
It feels like a race car but without
the impracticality and discomfort.

822
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,509
But, yes, they're a small make in the
UK that nobody has ever heard of.

823
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:07,430
Well, at one time,
so was Mr Pagani, making his Zonda.

824
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,029
So, that's two votes against the
Ferrari. But what about James?

825
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:16,309
This is brilliant. I'm really,
really growing to like it,

826
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:22,909
and let's not forget it's ã35,000
or so cheaper than the Ferrari 458.

827
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,109
And that is a huge amount of money.

828
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,229
But there's still... I don't know.

829
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,669
The Ferrari, I think the gear change
feels a bit crisper,

830
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,829
and everything feels a little
better defined, somehow.

831
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,069
It's the fizz, I'm afraid.
I can't explain it. I just...

832
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,990
The Ferrari still gives me
more fizz.

833
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:47,029
'You have reached your destination.'

834
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,949
'The destination turned out to
be a racetrack...

835
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,350
'called Imola...

836
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,549
'..where, after a quick change,

837
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:01,469
'we were told to report
to the pits for a challenge.'

838
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:04,790
"You will now lap the
circuit, attempting

839
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:08,109
to beat the time set
by a Ferrari 458."

840
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,749
Who's driving a 458?
It says here he's not The Stig.

841
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,990
But he is The Stig's Italian cousin!

842
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,069
It's "Bunga-Bunga" Stig.

843
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,509
What's he been doing?!

844
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,830
Cards.

845
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,949
'Whatever it was he'd been doing,

846
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:41,069
'he plainly still had
plenty of energy left for driving.

847
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:47,029
'And posted a daunting time
of 1.56.6.

848
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,389
'Before trying to beat that,
we thought it best to spend

849
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:55,670
'a little time learning how our cars
behaved on a proper racetrack.'

850
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,550
That gear change in track mode
is absolutely savage.

851
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,390
Ride that kerb!

852
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,549
Four-wheel drive system is
breathtaking.

853
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,469
The power is constantly
moving around... front, back,

854
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:21,390
side to side... so you've always
got the grip you need.

855
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,869
The good thing is, I have carbon
brakes which will not fade.

856
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,390
Poor old Hammond has got
steel brakes, which will.

857
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,029
Focus. Smoothness.

858
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,690
A car like this, with no
driver aids, no computers

859
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:39,349
messing about, it's
just you and the car.

860
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,949
The only chance I stand here is to
get it out of the corners

861
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,070
in such a shape
that I can use that power.

862
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,829
Of course, the McLaren does have a
lot of driver aids,

863
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,269
but Captain Sense Of Direction had
more important things on this mind.

864
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,469
What's this one? I can't remember.

865
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,109
This is the bit where
I don't have to brake...

866
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,910
If I can remember this bit...

867
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,949
At the end of the day, we knew
the circuit and we knew our cars.

868
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,949
But still, we were not feeling even
remotely confident,

869
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,950
because this is Imola...

870
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,829
one of the most dangerous
tracks on Earth.

871
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:27,670
It's narrow, fast and ringed with
unforgiving walls and trees.

872
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,669
Gilles Villeneuve,

873
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,589
Gerhard Berger,

874
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,229
Nelson Piquet, Riccardo Patrese,
Rubens Barrichello...

875
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:46,109
at some point in history, every corner
here has claimed the ego of a big name.

876
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,350
And some corners have claimed
even more than that.

877
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,229
After Senna's death in 1994,

878
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:00,589
changes were made to the track
to slow the cars down,

879
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,869
but even so, if we were going
to beat that Ferrari,

880
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:09,190
we would still be going through the
first bend at nearly 200mph.

881
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:15,330
So, that night, each
of us spent a little

882
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:18,630
time alone with the
cars we'd be using.

883
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,549
YOU are Juventus.

884
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:29,709
And tomorrow, you're taking on
Woking Town and Leicester City.

885
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,029
And everybody in England

886
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:36,669
is going to want them to win,
because they're the underdogs.

887
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,549
But don't you worry.

888
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:43,869
We haven't won a single
challenge yet,

889
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,990
but tomorrow... that will change.

890
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:54,109
You're not going into battle armed with
a sophisticated computer and wizardry,

891
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,509
clever suspension, four-wheel drive.
You're just going in with an engine.

892
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,869
Doing it the old-fashioned way.

893
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,430
Underdog or not,
I know you've got it in you now.

894
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,839
I'd love us to win.

895
00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:13,775
Just remember, as
we're going round and

896
00:55:14,142 --> 00:55:16,741
you're despairing of my
terrible gear changes

897
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:18,726
and my bad apexes, and things,

898
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:22,374
you're made by McLaren.
You've got the best race pedigree.

899
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:24,296
You've got clever suspension,

900
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:26,789
you've got no roll bars,
you've got a computer,

901
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,309
you can brake the wheel for me,
you can virtually do it by yourself.

902
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:36,429
All you have to do is humour me a bit,
and remember that I'm Captain Slow.

903
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,830
Or Mr Slowly,
as the Italians call me.

904
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:43,744
'The next morning,

905
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:50,590
'we ventured onto this terrifying track
to try and beat The Stig's 1.56.6.'

906
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,550
God, this is quick!

907
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,309
Oh, my giddy aunt!

908
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,349
I'm off the road!

909
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,390
I'm on it again!

910
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,910
My God, I'm faster here.

911
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,039
This is outrageous. Oh, BLEEP.

912
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,230
Now, faster than you think.
Don't be a wimp.

913
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,380
Agh! A bit of wee may be coming out!

914
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,470
Don't brake too early.
Don't brake too early. Now!

915
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,549
Better.

916
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,830
'Unusually, we were all taking this
challenge very seriously... '

917
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:48,080
A 5.4 to a 4.9. Oh, no.
I'm still on 2.07.

918
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:52,473
'..But we knew we'd
have to try even harder

919
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,569
if we were going to
beat that Ferrari.'

920
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:59,266
Right, come on, May,
you blithering idiot. Avanti.

921
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,149
Good!

922
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,429
In... Braking down.

923
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:09,069
BLEEP!

924
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,270
Get cocky!

925
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,230
The track WILL be there. Keep it in!

926
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,349
Yes!

927
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,310
I'm going a bit mental here, now.

928
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,950
Brake... Ooh, that's messy.

929
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,910
I'm going to go for 5th.
I'm going to take

930
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,709
as much through here
as I bloody dare. Oh!

931
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,629
Oh, BLEEP! BLEEP!

932
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,069
TYRES SQUEAL

933
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,389
BLEEP!

934
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,590
GRAVEL CRUNCHES

935
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,109
Come on!

936
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,670
290...

937
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:57,910
OK, brakes have gone. Whoa.
Failure from the brakes.

938
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:04,509
After my brakes had cooled, and Hammond
had emptied his car of gravel,

939
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:10,709
we went back out for
one final attempt to beat the 458.

940
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,150
And the Lambo is only...
Here we go! Come on!

941
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,749
OK, this is it.
I'm doing this one for Leicester!

942
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,790
Right, beans!

943
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,070
That's it!

944
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,910
Blah-blah-blah-blah!

945
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,190
And now brake!

946
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,069
I've done the difficult bit!

947
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,789
It will go round, it WILL.

948
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,190
Come on!

949
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,949
And brake...

950
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,750
And back on the power as soon
as you can. Now. NOW! NOW! Power!

951
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,230
Stay right, stay right, stay right!
Stay right, now!

952
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:18,269
Stretch it, stretch it! Come on!
Come on!

953
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,990
Come on! Come on!

954
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,230
You can do it! Come on!

955
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:39,469
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

956
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,989
That looked as scary as it was.
Yes, it was scary.

957
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,269
It's that palpable sense of,
"Oh, my God!"

958
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:50,109
Because I have to say, as you go past
the pits, the track is not straight,

959
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:53,709
it's a curve, and you daren't
lift off, because the crews,

960
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:58,349
they can hear the engine note change, so
you have to keep your foot hard down.

961
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:02,549
It was terrifying.
It is 200 and...? Over 200.

962
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:05,430
All three of us doing over
200, and that's faster

963
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:08,309
than a Formula 1 car, was
going through there.

964
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,389
They could only do about 180.

965
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,350
I don't know, because
I had my eyes shut.

966
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:14,309
It was terrifying.

967
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:19,109
Anyway, it is time now to reveal who
was the fastest of the three of us.

968
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,469
Richard Hammond? I did it
in 2 minutes and 3.3 seconds.

969
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,229
That's the best I could do.

970
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,589
Mr Slowly?

971
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,909
2 minutes 6.4.

972
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:32,549
Yes! And you?

973
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:37,709
It's so difficult not to look
smug at this point. Oh, God!

974
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:43,109
It's not working.
1... Ooh! ..59.1.

975
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,710
Well done.

976
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,230
You're not pulling it off.

977
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,469
It's not working. It isn't.
No, I'll forget it.

978
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,709
Let me just straighten this out,
OK? Well done.

979
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,494
We gave it everything, each of us,
and we didn't beat the Ferrari. No.

980
01:01:02,565 --> 01:01:05,124
Hang on.
That's not strictly relevant,

981
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:06,930
because the point of this
was to see which car

982
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:09,109
you should have IF you
didn't want a Ferrari.

983
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,749
Yes, it's the Lambo. No.
It isn't. It IS the Lambo.

984
01:01:11,816 --> 01:01:13,816
I admit, it's not
a brilliant track car.

985
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:27,727
It IS a big, daft orange dog, AND
blue stuff comes out of the exhaust.

986
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:33,377
No. Look, that Noble taught me more
about driving in that one day

987
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,689
than any other car has
ever taught me.

988
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,249
It's about the real
undiluted experience. Silence.

989
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:43,409
The McLaren is the closest thing
to the 458, which is the best,

990
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,157
therefore the McLaren
is the best car here.

991
01:01:45,197 --> 01:01:48,476
It's that simple. Does blue stuff
come out of the exhaust? No.

992
01:01:48,523 --> 01:01:51,722
Exactly. Well, there you are.
The thing is, we can't agree.

993
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,129
And actually, we never will. No.

994
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,729
And on that bombshell, it is time to
end. Thanks very much for watching.

995
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,330
See you next week. Good night!

996
