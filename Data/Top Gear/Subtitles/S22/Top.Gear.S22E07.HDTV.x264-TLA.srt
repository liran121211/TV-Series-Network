1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,440
Tonight, I try a classic
Jaguar on our track.

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,320
Hammond has a blast
in Mazda's new MX5.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,510
And James says, "Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,360
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,870
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,590
Thank you, everybody, thank
you so much, thank you!

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,630
Hello, good evening.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,150
Thanks, everyone.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,910
Now, a couple of years ago Jaguar
gave us the F-Type convertible

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,070
and now there's the F-Type coupe.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,870
You can have it with a
choice of two V6 engines

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,350
or, for £85,000, a thumping great V8.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,940
So guess which one I've been driving?

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,910
Beautiful, isn't it?

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,360
Beautiful enough to cause dribbling.

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,270
And aggressive as well.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,390
Snarly.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,000
Angry.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,310
And unlike the soft-top F-Type,

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,320
it comes with a boot, into
which you can put many things.

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,910
All you could get in the boot of
a convertible is a peaked cap.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,510
But in here, there's room for
every conceivable type of hat,

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,830
all at the same time.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,750
A boater, a fez, a
pith helmet, a trilby,

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,270
one of James's special hats.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,950
And there's still room
leftover for a busby.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
There you go.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,710
And the good news keeps on coming.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,550
Because Jaguar has fiddled around
with the supercharged V8

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,400
so it now produces 542 horsepower.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,510
That is 54 more than you
get in the convertible,

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,310
which means this has a
top speed of a million.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,430
It is outrageously fast.

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,040
I mean, that is 160mph.

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,920
And I've got 17 hats in the boot.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,600
But even more impressive than the
speed is the way this car is made.

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,150
They haven't simply bolted on
a roof - the whole side is new.

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,350
And this is it.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,430
It's one piece of aluminium
and it only weighs...

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,230
three and a bit kilograms.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,910
And because it's one piece,
there's more strength,

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,560
more safety and less flex.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,920
And less flex means better handling.

44
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,870
I thought the convertible
was good, but this...

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
this is even better.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,550
It's actually got tougher
springs than the convertible

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,470
which doesn't do much
for the ride but...

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,190
God, it makes it fun
to drive out here.

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
It is like driving
around in some poetry.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Ted Hughes poetry, but
poetry nevertheless.

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,350
This actually has an electronic
differential, which can overheat

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,150
if you go too mad. But...

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,390
providing you stay
within the parameters

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,040
of reasonable common
sense, it's fabulous.

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I just don't know of another
car quite like this.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,030
And that's half throttle.

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,700
Yes, you're good!

58
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,270
So it's pretty and violent and fast

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,120
and more practical than
you might imagine.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,750
Inevitably, however,
there are a few niggles.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,390
Number one, at oblique junctions
it's really hard to see

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,270
if anything is coming.

63
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,840
So pull up here at the edge
of our runway and look.

64
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,390
The only way I can pull out safely
is by crossing my fingers

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,790
and hoping for the best.

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,880
~ CAR HONKS HORN
~ Ah!

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
Stupid idiot!

68
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,980
There are other issues too.

69
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,750
If you push the seat
all the way back,

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,710
and if you're tall, you'll want to,

71
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,670
the leather squeaks on the
bulkhead - can you hear that?

72
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,950
LEATHER SQUEAKS

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,740
Really irritating.

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,910
And then there's the control
system, which is touch screen.

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,910
Now that sounds fine

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,630
but it's so bumpy in here,
at low speeds particularly,

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,470
that it's very difficult
to get your finger

78
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,310
to go in the right place.

79
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,070
If you're not very careful when you
try to change the radio station,

80
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,470
you can end up altering the colour
of the interior lighting

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,120
or engaging Mad Mode on the
dynamic driving system.

82
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,520
Aah! I wanted Classic FM!

83
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,590
But the biggest problem with this
car is that it never stops shouting.

84
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,590
ENGINE ROARS

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,270
You can push this button here
to quieten the exhaust system

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,790
but every time you
go near the throttle,

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,790
it all bursts back into life again.

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,080
ENGINE ROARS

89
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,110
This car's a little bit like a
child that can play the violin.

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,670
For five minutes, it's fine.

91
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,190
But after a month, you might start
to suggest that if it doesn't stop,

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,750
you will shove the sound
box right up its...

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,520
CAR ACCELERATES

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,790
Peace and quiet?

95
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,720
That's not something
this car can ever do.

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,990
Happily, however, there's another
new Jaguar which is a bit less...

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,310
louty.

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,630
A few years ago, we tested
this, the Eagle Speedster.

99
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,120
And now the company that created
it has come up with something else.

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,790
It's called the Low Drag GT

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,710
and it's a re-creation of a one-off
racing E-Type prototype

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,400
that Jaguar made in 1960.

103
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,670
Except re-creation is the wrong word,

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,350
because what Eagle has actually
done is taken the basic design

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,990
and the spirit of the original
and then brought them up to date.

106
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,480
Think of it, then, as a
Georgian house with Wi-Fi.

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,400
And perhaps one of those Georgian
Clooney coffee machines.

108
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,710
Let's start with the engine.

109
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,710
Like the original, it's
a twin cam straight six.

110
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,510
But unlike the original, it has fuel
injection rather than carburettors.

111
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,100
So it works.

112
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,720
It's made from aluminium rather
than cast iron, so it's light.

113
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,520
It also has cooling so
it doesn't overheat.

114
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,550
And it's bigger than the original...

115
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,190
ENGINE REVS

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
.. which means it's more powerful.

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,430
The original car had 3.8 litres
and produced 265 horsepower.

118
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,430
This has 4.7 litres

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,430
and produces 345 horsepower!

120
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,710
So it's faster...

121
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
MUCH faster!

122
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,830
To give you an idea of what
a rocket ship this car is,

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,590
I'm going to have a drag race

124
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,470
with Toyota's idea of
a modern-day sports car.

125
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,760
The GT-86.

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,630
Right, so a child of the '60s
versus the 21st century.

127
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,030
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

128
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
CAR ENGINES REV

129
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
Three, two, one, go!

130
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,030
It's a smoking start.

131
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,430
And we are away.

132
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,590
That's incredible.

133
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,920
Janis Joplin is punching
Justin Bieber in the face.

134
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,110
And there's the finishing line.

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah, it's an easy victory.

136
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,510
I've always said things
were better in my day,

137
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,110
apart from the rickets.

138
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,870
And the diphtheria.
And this proves it.

139
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,520
It's even pretty good in the corners.

140
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm not going to say this feels
modern because it doesn't.

141
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,990
The F-Type would run rings around it.

142
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,710
But crucially...

143
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,510
.. it doesn't feel as old as me,

144
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,430
which is what it is.

145
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,510
But it's not the handling
or the power

146
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,230
or the 170-mile-an-hour top
speed that impresses most.

147
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,600
It's the attention to detail.

148
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,630
I mean, because this car
has a five-speed gearbox

149
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,150
rather than the four-speeder
you got in the original,

150
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,710
Eagle has even made a special
gear knob to reflect that

151
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,110
with a five on it.

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,830
I'd have just used Tipp-Ex.

153
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,070
And look at these sun visors.

154
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,110
They're fabulous and somebody
had to make them and the bracket

155
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,360
and the bolts that hold
it together and the hinge.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,790
That's, that's just...

157
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,960
It's all just too
incredible for words.

158
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,120
And there's more.

159
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,990
The wheels - they look like
they're made out of steel

160
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,990
and they came from a
motorist discount store,

161
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,990
but actually they were specially
made by hand out of magnesium.

162
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,950
And because the body
is Eagle's own design,

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,750
this windscreen had
to be specially made.

164
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,030
Now that meant going to a glassmaker

165
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,950
and saying can you
make ONE windscreen?

166
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,190
One!

167
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,390
It cost £15,000.

168
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,430
And the back window?

169
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,960
That was £15,000 as well.

170
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,990
As a result of all this,

171
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,590
the Low Drag GT is quite a lot
more expensive than the F-Type

172
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,990
and it's less nimble
and it's more slow.

173
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,440
But I know which I'd rather have.

174
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,400
CHEERING

175
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,080
Thing is, though...

176
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,270
The tragedy is that the
only people who know

177
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,510
how to make a windscreen like this,

178
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,550
a one-off, are all now
in their 70s and 80s

179
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,030
and when they retire, they will
take their skills with them.

180
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,910
Which means that in
the very near future

181
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,590
it just won't be possible
to make a car like this.

182
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,350
No, I know and that'll be a
real shame, it really will.

183
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,350
One thing I've been
trying to work out,

184
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,710
cos you didn't actually
say it in the film,

185
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,310
if that windscreen cost £15,000,

186
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,350
how much is it for the whole car?

187
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,150
~ A lot.
~ LAUGHTER

188
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,030
How much a lot?

189
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,670
£840,000.

190
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,710
Ooh, that is a lot.

191
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,070
~ No, but that does include VAT,
I should be clear on that.
~ Yeah.

192
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,110
Nevertheless, you'll have to
agree the F-Type does represent

193
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,310
better value for money.

194
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,870
It does - especially the V6,
which is the one I'd buy.

195
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,070
Because the V8, I mean
as I said in the film,

196
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,750
it just never shuts up
- it would drive you mad.

197
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,190
Yeah, it would, something
never shuts up,

198
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,990
shouting constantly all day long.

199
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,120
Rah, rah! With opinions and noise.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,750
Well, I'm just saying, I
mean it'll drive you mad.

201
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,390
I can be quiet.

202
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,830
Yeah, but only when you're asleep

203
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,150
and thankfully I'm not
there for that so...

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,630
Listen, I have just decided that I
don't want to talk to you any more.

205
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,390
But what I do want to do is
find out how fast that F-Type

206
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,630
goes round our track.

207
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,430
And that of course means handing
it over to our tame racing driver.

208
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,030
Some say that he wishes there
was someone he could talk to

209
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,200
about his mis-sold PPI.

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,000
And that he spent all week making
a stairlift for Madonna.

211
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,390
All we know is he's called The Stig!

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,510
CHEERING

213
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,390
And he's off, an un-smoky
start, which is a surprise,

214
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,830
but very shouty, which isn't.

215
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,790
Up to the first corner, lots of
squealing from the Pirelli tyres

216
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,580
but he's keeping it
all in check nicely.

217
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,430
That is neat.

222
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,590
Very together through Chicago.

Let's see if there are
any tail-happy antics

224
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,950

225
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Into the second part...
No, nothing so far.

226
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,990

through the Follow Through,
he's right on the edge there,

230
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,120
that won't raise the pulse of
either of The Stig's hearts.

APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

235
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,990
Right, then.

236
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,640
What did it do?

237
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,590
1.21.6 - which is as
fast as a Audi R8 V10

238
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,230
and a Cayman GTS and...
What are you doing?

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,150
~ I'm being quiet.
~ What?
~ I'm being quiet.

242
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,950
Oh!

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,350
Oh...

244
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,790
And now the news.

245
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,310
And a couple of weeks ago,
we reported that Ferrari were

246
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,830
warming to the idea of a test
to see which is the fastest -

247
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,510
the Ferrari "The Ferrari", the
McLaren P1 or the Porsche 918.

248
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,670
And the good news is...

249
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,310
Ferrari have warmed.

250
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,670
They have indeed. There
are a few stipulations -

251
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,990
they've said that the test
must happen on neutral ground,

252
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,350
which is fine, it's what
McLaren wanted as well.

253
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,830
They've also said it must
be a factory prepared car

254
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,710
which was a sticking
point with McLaren,

255
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,230
but McLaren are now saying,
"That's OK, that's fine."

256
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,470
And that means, ladies
and gentlemen, this...

257
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,110
I think the most important test this
century is now going to happen.

258
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,480
CHEERING

259
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,030
~ Oh, that is good.
~ I'm telling you honestly,

260
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,830
we should go and sort out Ukraine,

261
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,590
cos after this, it'd
be walk in the park.

262
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,390
So when are we going to do it?

263
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,470
~ What, sort out Ukraine?
~ No. The race.

264
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,910
Oh, the race, well, as soon
as Porsche can find us a car.

265
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,870
~ Find us a car?
~ Mm.

266
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,470
Well, they made 918.

267
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,590
~ I know, they've obviously lost them.
~ Have they?
~ Yes, they're now saying,

268
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,470
"We haven't actually
got one at the moment,

269
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,750
"but as soon as we do have
one, we'll let you have it."

270
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,790
Then we can go ahead and see which
of those three incredible cars

271
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,990
is the fastest. I cannot
wait, I really cannot wait.

272
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,070
That's excellent, looking
forward to that.

273
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,470
So that is good news. Er,
now, not such good news.

274
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,150
You may have heard in the
news last week that Top Gear

275
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,710
was attacked by Labour's transport
spokesman, a Mr Dugher.

276
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,310
He says that Top Gear
is not representative

277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,390
~ of the motoring public in Britain.
~ No!
~ I know!

278
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,870
~ We're not representative?
~ I know cos only this series, we have,

279
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,790
if you think about it, we've raced
a hovercraft across St Petersburg.

280
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,550
~ How representative is that?
~ Very.

281
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,630
We've turned a Porsche
into an ambulance,

282
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,790
~ we've driven a Bentley up the
side of an iron-ore mine...
~ Exactly.

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,550
~ .. in Australia.
~ Exactly. Did he not enjoy these features?

284
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,120
Difficult to say because he says
he doesn't watch Top Gear.

285
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,390
Well, hang on, how does he know
if we're representative or not

286
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,790
if he doesn't watch it?

287
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,750
~ It's a good question. He
may have special powers.
~ OK.

288
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,830
He could be a witch.

289
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,950
~ The Tories aren't much better, are they?
~ Nice balancing work.

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,430
~ Good work, thank you.
~ Thank you.

291
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,150
This is excellent - BBC
even playing field.

292
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,910
The Tory transport bloke, he said
that he didn't support the idea

293
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,510
of an 80mph speed limit
on the motorway

294
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,190
~ because of the road casualties
on one road in his constituency.
~ Mm.

295
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,670
~ Which is the Derbyshire dales...
~ Yeah.

296
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,390
Which doesn't have
any motorways in it.

297
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,070
That's cos he's not a witch,

298
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,070
~ he's an idiot.
~ All right, OK.
~ That's the difference.

299
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,750
The annoying thing is, though,
that actually if you look behind

300
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,310
the anti-Top Gear prejudice,

301
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,150
Dugher is actually talking
a deal of sense.

302
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,790
Because he says that when they're
deciding on transport policy,

303
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,630
every government, Labour and Tory,
they talk to anti-car lobby,

304
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,910
the... You know the cyclists
and the ramblers

305
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,550
~ and the bus drivers and so on and so forth.
~ Yeah, and he's right.

306
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,990
He is right which is ridiculous.

307
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,390
He also says that all the people
who make the decisions

308
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,230
are in central London and
have no idea what it's like

309
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,190
~ for people trying to
get around in the regions.
~ And he's right on that.

310
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,870
I know, and the tragedy is
we're telling him he's right

311
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,430
and he's not watching cos he's
tuned into the Midwife thing

312
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,070
~ on the other side.
~ Almost certainly, yeah.

313
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,960
Which, incidentally, is not
representative of midwifery.

314
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,900
~ Have you watched it?
~ No, never.

315
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,070
I'm a witch as well.
I know these things.

316
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,070
Ooh, now you may remember
a little while back

317
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,310
we made some ambulances,
OK? And James turned up

318
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,510
to make his ambulance out of
a Cosworth-powered hearse, yes?

319
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,030
~ Do you remember that?
~ CROWD: Yes.

320
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,030
Somebody else, it turns out, is also
using a Cosworth-powered hearse

321
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,280
as a hearse - got a picture.

322
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,310
The same thing happened to
you. It's a design fault.

323
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,310
~ I could have warned them.
~ Yes, exactly.

324
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,230
~ I have news!
~ What news?

325
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,950
~ Vauxhall has a new car!
~ No!
~ Wow.

326
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,350
Yes! And here it is...

327
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,470
Wow!

328
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,470
They have called it the Viva.

329
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,750
~ Viva?!
~ They've brought the name back, yeah, Viva.

330
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,710
~ Does anybody remember the original Viva?
~ Oh, yeah.

331
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,830
Anyone...? You're probably too
young. Let me remind you, OK?

332
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,630
~ There's a picture of
it here, the original one.
~ Oh, God.

333
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,190
~ Look at it!
~ Look at its silly little wheels.

334
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,910
~ A style-free car.
~ It is ridiculous.

335
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,790
Interesting, though - if they
were going to revive a name

336
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,630
from Vauxhall's heritage and all
that, why would they choose Viva?

337
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,350
I know, cos they had some great
names. They had Cresta,

338
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,510
~ they had Victor.
~ Viceroy.

339
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,790
They did a car called
the Prince Albert.

340
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,710
No.

341
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,630
~ No, it was the Prince Henry.
~ No, it's Prince Albert.

342
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,350
No, Prince Albert, that's... It's
a ring they put through your chap.

343
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,030
~ What, Vauxhall put it through your...?
~ No, no!

344
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,430
People who for, I don't know why,

345
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,030
but they do, it's a ring
they put through their chap.

346
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I thought it was a rod.

347
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,270
Look, whatever it was,
it's not a Vauxhall.

348
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,270
~ It wasn't a Vauxhall, they didn't...
~ Right, that's cleared that up,

349
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,710
there was no Vauxhall Prince Albert.

350
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,750
Oh, now it's the Geneva Motor
Show is currently on actually,

351
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,750
which is an opportunity
for all the carmakers

352
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,190
to demonstrate new concepts,

353
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,350
all of which have
ridiculously large wheels

354
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,990
that will never see the light
of day in production.

355
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,790
Got some of them here for you.

356
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,030
We have the Infinity Q60.
Look at the wheels on that,

357
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,030
~ that's never going to happen in real life.
~ No.

358
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,150
~ Nissan Sway. Again, no.
~ No.

359
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,870
~ Look at the Audi Prologue.
~ God.
~ No.

360
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,470
The idea is we look at that,
we go, "Wow, that's fantastic."

361
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,790
Then of course the accountants
step into the mix

362
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,350
and the accountants say
you can't have 46" rims.

363
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,480
And you end up with a car that
actually looks like this.

364
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,470
Supercar news from Geneva -
a couple I want to talk about.

365
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,470
There's this, it's called
the EXP10 Speed 6.

366
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,390
Oh, so EXP won against Speed.

367
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,590
Oh, it's like football
results, EXP - 10...

368
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,510
~ Speed - 6.
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah.

369
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,750
That's actually well spotted.
Two-seater sports coupe.

370
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,350
And they say, and I'm quoting
now, that "It is..."

371
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,390
Er, make sure I get the quote right.

372
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,190
".. unmistakably a Bentley."

373
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,270
But if you look at it from the side,

374
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,630
I think you'll agree that is
unmistakably an Aston Martin.

375
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,310
~ Er, it is. ~ Yes.
~ That's an Aston Martin. ~ Exactly.
~ Yes, it is.

376
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,870
Well, meanwhile, actually, the real
Aston Martin have come up with this,

377
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,310
which is an 800 horsepower,
it's a track day car

378
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,390
but they've called it the Vulcan.

379
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,910
~ The Vulcan?
~ The Vulcan.

380
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,550
So it only takes off
from RAF Waddington

381
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,830
and then it refuels in the Ascension
Islands and then carries on...

382
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,310
~ Um...
~ No, let's not go there.

383
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,230
I don't think... Leave that.

384
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,710
Have you seen this?

385
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,270
It's a Fiat 500, it's a limited
edition thing they're doing.

386
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,150
But what puzzles me is they've
chosen to put an image

387
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,030
of the original 500 on the side
of it, that's the original.

388
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,510
That's just idiotic cos that's like
saying "Look how fat I've become!"

389
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,990
Well, yeah. It's...

390
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,510
You don't see Eamonn Holmes
sunbathing with a diagram

391
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,390
on his belly of what he used to
look like as a teenager, do you?

392
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,510
"Look at me! I used to be only
this thin and now I'm enormous."

393
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,230
Which is what they've done.
I don't know what that's for.

394
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,350
Oh, now, big news.

395
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,030
There's a car called
the Suzuki Celery...

396
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,550
~ Er, isn't it the Celeriac?
~ Whatever, you don't want one.

397
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,910
We've got a picture of it here.
Now there's a British...

398
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,790
~ I don't want one.
~ No, it's hideous.

399
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,150
A British motoring magazine
were testing one of these

400
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,550
and it had total brake failure,

401
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,470
so Suzuki sent them
another one to test,

402
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,110
exactly the same thing happened.

403
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,710
~ The pedal went to the floor both times.
~ Nasty.
~ Very nasty.

404
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,030
So Suzuki took it away to
work out what was wrong.

405
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,470
And they discovered that there's
a safety system on that,

406
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,270
so that in the event of a crash,
the brake pedal is pulled away

407
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,990
from your foot so it doesn't
bounce up and damage your shin.

408
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,350
~ Oh, yeah.
~ But, if you were braking very hard,

409
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,510
it would assume you
were going to crash

410
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,750
and then pull the brake
pedal away from you.

411
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,630
In that yawning instant, I mean we've
all been there at some point,

412
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,910
~ when you think you're
going to have a crash...
~ Mm.

413
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,070
.. they take away the
only thing in the world

414
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,630
that actually is of any
consequence or importance...

415
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,870
~ The only thing you understand.
~ Yes, exactly.

416
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,550
Suzuki admit that was a mistake.

417
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,670
Well, it was, I mean
it was a mistake.

418
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,990
They do admit that was a mistake
and all credit to them,

419
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,550
very quickly, in just ten days,

420
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,950
they've got them all sorted out.

421
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,070
They did a recall, effectively.

422
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,270
And they've said... I love this,

423
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
They've said, "Sales
won't be affected."

424
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,790
What? Er, really?

425
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,360
No, they say, "Most of our target
audience is more mature.

426
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,150
"The public understand
that recalls happen

427
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,230
"and they'll see through
the stories."

428
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,430
Yeah, just to translate that,
what they're actually saying is

429
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,430
most of our target audience is
old and daft and won't notice.

430
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,830
Now, let's move on and it is time
now to talk about the Mazda MX5.

431
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,390
When this, the original model,
came out 25 years ago,

432
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,950
it immediately saved the small
roadster from extinction

433
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,910
and went on to become THE most
successful two-seater sports car

434
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,390
of all time.

435
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,080
But now there's a new MX5 and I
went to Humberside to drive it.

436
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,200
Before I do that, though, time for
a quick refresher with the original.

437
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,710
The reason this car was so
brilliant is that it's light,

438
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,160
it's small and it's simple.

439
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,910
Mazda were perfectly open about

440
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,430
cribbing all the best bits
from '60s MGs and Lotus Elans

441
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,470
and leaving out all the worst bits.

442
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,430
The recipe wasn't complicated
- small engine at the front,

443
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,110
rear wheel drive

444
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,030
and a perfect 50/50
weight distribution.

445
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,710
They were so obsessed
with that last point,

446
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,030
they even moved the
battery to the boot.

447
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,030
There isn't a lot on this
car but everything that is

448
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,910
is done well. The gear change - short
snappy throws from gear to gear

449
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,360
and a little click as it goes in.

450
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,390
25 years on

451
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,430
and this is still in the top five
all-time great gear changes...

452
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,920
if there is such a thing.

453
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,550
God, these things were good

454
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,310
which means that the brand-new
MX5 has got a lot to live up to,

455
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,960
a helluva lot.

456
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,870
Well, here it is.

457
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,470
And on paper, the signs are good.

458
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,750
It's still usefully small.

459
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,190
It's still got an engine at the
front and drive to the rear.

460
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,830
And since prices start
at around £19,000,

461
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,080
it's still more affordable
than most sports cars.

462
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,230
Another encouraging sign is that
they've resisted the temptation

463
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,830
to give it a bigger engine.

464
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,510
The biggest you can get is two litres

465
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,470
and the one I'm in is a 1.5.

466
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,150
That means nought to 60 in
just under nine seconds,

467
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,670
about the same as the original,

468
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,150
and a top speed of 125,

469
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,230
which is absolutely fine.

470
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,750
In fact, it's good news.

471
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,950
An MX5 shouldn't be a snorting
monster of a thing,

472
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,070
it's a car for driving
into the countryside

473
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,320
on a nice sunny day to
find a nice pub for lunch.

474
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,510
And it's great!

475
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,360
Squeezing every last drop out
of this little 1.5 litre engine.

476
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,300
Use all the engine's
got and... Come on!

477
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,030
Whip the pony a bit.

478
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,070
Then there's the handling.

479
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,630
The front suspension is
still double wishbones,

480
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,190
the weight distribution is
still balanced perfectly,

481
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
50/50 front to rear.

482
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,670
Immediately, you can just sense
everything is in the right place,

483
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,920
the relationship between where
it all sits in the car is correct.

484
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,510
This car isn't about wrestling
a monster through turns

485
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,100
and being relieved when you survive.

486
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,990
I'm not trying to win a fight,

487
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,040
it's human being and machine
working together.

488
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,280
That - the way it changes
direction there, turn in...

489
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,780
.. it feels so nimble.

490
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,990
The reason the new MX5
is so nimble is because

491
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,750
whilst most cars get fatter
with every new generation,

492
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,080
this one is almost 100 kilos lighter
than the car it replaces.

493
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,510
100kg, that's...

494
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,950
Well, it's nearly an
entire Jeremy Clarkson.

495
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,790
That's a significant weight saving.

496
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,870
Mazda has achieved this feat
by employing something called

497
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,240
the gram strategy.

498
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,430
Now this is not to be confused with
the business plan from Scarface.

499
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,670
What it means in Mazda-land is
shaving off a gram here and there.

500
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,870
For instance, in any car there's
bits of the glass that you can't see

501
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,790
hidden inside the body,
hidden inside the doors.

502
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,550
Glass is heavy.

503
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,950
So Mazda have made holes and
taken out pieces of that glass.

504
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,670
And if you just shave off
a gram here and there,

505
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,310
those grams add up
to become kilograms.

506
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,470
But despite the minimalism,

507
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,830
you don't feel like you're
sitting in a prison cell.

508
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,030
It's a nice place to be. I've
got, well, everything I need.

509
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,430
Touch screen, sat nav, it
interfaces with my telephone,

510
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,670
all of that stuff... It's a car.

511
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,550
So far, then, all is well.

512
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,870
But before I get too carried away,

513
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,120
there are a couple of not-so-good
things about this new MX5.

514
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,830
The first problem is not really
the car's fault at all

515
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,270
but I should mention it.
It's the image of the MX5.

516
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,430
Put it this way, if your business
is called A Cut Above,

517
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,030
Fringe Benefits or Hair Apparent,

518
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,590
this has long been the
choice of car for you.

519
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,390
But if you run a magazine called
Belt-Fed Machine Gun Enthusiast,

520
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,790
you'd probably want
to look elsewhere.

521
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,430
The second problem is the looks.

522
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,830
I can see what they've done -

523
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,190
they've given a cute
little car a frown,

524
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,270
it's the whole angry puppy thing -

525
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,720
but I'm just not quite sure, yet.

526
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,870
But, you know what?

527
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,760
These are tiny ripples in what is
otherwise an ocean of brilliance.

528
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,430
Oh, I love this thing
- it's brilliant.

529
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,950
It's pure fun.

530
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,920
It's made of fun.

531
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,070
ENGINE ROARS

532
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
Listen to that!

533
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,950
I know when I get back to the studio,
Jeremy's going to be standing there

534
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,830
pointing at an Alfa Romeo 4C

535
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,830
saying, "This is the
lightweight car to have."

536
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,750
But it's 50 grand!

537
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,950
And they make a fuss
about it being light.

538
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,280
This is just simple.

539
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,040
I love this. I'm just
made up with this.

540
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,510
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

541
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,670
See? There you are.

542
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,110
I, I knew it. I knew you'd do that.

543
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,150
I said so in the film.

544
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,350
But, look, the fact is
you could buy two MX5s -

545
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,390
no, two and a half - for
the price of one Alfa.

546
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,630
Yes, but the Alfa Romeo is lighter.

547
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,830
How do you know?

548
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,030
Every time we ask Alfa
how much it weighs,

549
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,590
they send us a different number.

550
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,270
They did, cos they're not troubled
with specific details like that.

551
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,830
If you build a car that's
as much fun as this

552
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,150
with a carbon fibre tub chassis,

553
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,150
you take it for a drive,
you don't weigh it.

554
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,630
When Leonardo da Vinci
painted the Mona Lisa,

555
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,070
he didn't say, "I wonder
how much that weighs..."

556
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,190
The whole point of the Alfa, we're
told, is its lack of weight,

557
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,150
that's why they tell us it feels
a bit flimsy and a bit brittle

558
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,670
and it hasn't got power steering
because it's so light.

559
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,070
But then they won't tell
us how light it actually is.

560
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,790
Because they're too busy having fun.

561
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,350
Mazda made that and then went,
"I wonder how many horsepower

562
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,950
"it produces? Let's put it on
a rolling road and weigh it."

563
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,750
Why don't they just
make the figures up?

564
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,350
That's what the Italians always do.

565
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,630
~ LAUGHTER
~ They do!

566
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,750
Right, once Alfa finally give us
the convertible version of this,

567
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,150
let's get it together with the Mazda
and we'll sort out which is best.

568
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,790
Good idea, but now we must put a
Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

569
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,110
Now, my guest tonight
came to fame as a boy,

570
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,550
and then he was a sort of blue monster,
and then he was a zombie -

571
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,230
all of which means I don't know
what he looks like in real life.

572
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,430
So, ladies and gentlemen, somewhere
over there is Nicholas Hoult!

573
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,310
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

574
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,960
You! It's you.

575
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,590
It is you.

576
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,150
How are you and your...?

577
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,070
Very well, very well.

578
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
~ That's actually you?
~ This is it.

579
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,790
Your ears, your nose
- excellent have a seat.

580
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,190
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.

581
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,070
No, cos you very rarely
see you as you.

582
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,430
Yeah, I have a habit of
wearing a lot of make-up.

583
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,990
~ LAUGHTER
~ In films, not in real life. Generally.

584
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,550
To remind you, this was you in About
A Boy, obviously, when you were...

585
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,350
~ AUDIENCE: Aww!
~ Yeah.

586
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,830
~ Sweet is the word I'm looking for.
~ Thank you.

587
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,110
~ And then you were blue.
~ Oh, yeah, yeah.

588
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,030
Again, hard to recognise
you now from...

589
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,750
Is this a good thing?
Does the anonymity...?

590
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,430
Well, I did sneak around.

591
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,630
I did get off on the streets
in that costume a little bit.

592
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,550
Um, I ran across a golf
course at one point.

593
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,790
I went hooning it. Three
people were playing,

594
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,630
and I went running across
this golf course,

595
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,350
and they turned and saw that coming

596
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,950
and they were like, "Oh,
Lord, it's happening."

597
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,190
LAUGHTER

598
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,790
And I pulled up and said, "Remember
to swing through the ball,

599
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,750
"keep your eye on the back
of it at all times,"

600
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,470
then I turned around
and ran off again.

601
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,190
And you could see them
just so confused.

602
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,790
Was that while you were actually
filming or is that something

603
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,070
you keep at home for fun?

604
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,390
~ Well, I've got the feet from that at home.
~ Have you?

605
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,150
Yeah. Well, actually, no, I haven't,

606
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,550
my mum kept them, cos she likes
to wear them as slippers.

607
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,110
LAUGHTER

608
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,350
Now, you've been, even from
when you were a boy-boy,

609
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,550
you've been a petrol head
since you were that age?

610
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,790
I have, yeah. I grew
up watching this show.

611
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,990
~ So, you were watching this as
a... When you were in About A Boy?
~ Yeah.

612
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,750
God, that makes me
feel about a thousand.

613
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,350
Cos it's weird, I haven't changed...

614
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,430
I mean, you've changed a lot,
but I'm exactly the same now

615
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,310
as I was when we first started.

616
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,150
So you must have been thrilled, then,

617
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,830
if you were a car enthusiast
from a young age,

618
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,510
to have been offered a part in
the new Mad Max movie, I presume,

619
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,150
which is - as we know
from the early ones -

620
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,870
~ a lot of cars.
~ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,550
That was supposed be an
Australian accent - rubbish.

622
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,630
Yeah, cos I loved the original films.

623
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,470
And then, it's the weirdest
thing, you'd be there on set,

624
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,990
and they'd have these armadas
of all these vehicles

625
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,030
that they'd specially
made for the shoot,

626
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,710
all these V8s, V12s, all roaring.

627
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,590
And you'd be sitting there in your
car, and flames of all these other

628
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,030
cars would go flying past you, guys
on bikes, and you just get chills.

629
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,030
But the only problem with it
is you can't hear anything

630
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,790
cos the engines are all so loud.

631
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,950
You'd sit there, and then
you'd see the camera

632
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,670
kind of come into your periphery,

633
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,630
and then you'd hear
a bang on the roof,

634
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,670
and that was maybe someone
saying their line.

635
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,150
So you're just kind of guessing
when to act, essentially.

636
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,630
Just hoping for the best, not knowing
exactly where you were in the film.

637
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,030
We've actually got a clip.

638
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,910
Let's have a look at
the new Mad Max movie.

639
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,560
My name is Max.

640
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!

641
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

642
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,030
That does look like my kind of film,
I think all our kinds of films.

643
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,430
We would... Yeah, I'll be
queuing up for that one.

644
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,430
But the car has survived, the
Mad Max...? It's a Ford Falcon.

645
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,150
That's still there. It gets adapted
a little bit in this one.

646
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,150
This was amazing, like, the attention
to detail in all of these.

647
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,710
My car, they had four versions
of it, because they had to flip

648
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,670
and roll and do all sorts of
stuff, but each one had, like,

649
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,150
my character's name, Nux,
engraved into the brake pad

650
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,470
and all these sorts of things.

651
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,310
When you got in there
everything worked

652
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,590
and had a reason to be there, they'd
had really thought about everything.

653
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,430
So there's no CGI in this, then?
It really is roll a car over?

654
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,270
Yeah, they were really
going for it, yeah.

655
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,550
Well, I mean, that just sounds
like my idea of heaven.

656
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,910
It was... Yeah, you think
it's your idea of heaven

657
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,110
until they're crashing trucks
into the back of you.

658
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,870
And you do the first
take and you're like,

659
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,590
"Yeah, I'm fine, don't worry about
it, do it faster, go for it."

660
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,950
And then the next time
you turn around mid-scene,

661
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,710
you look over your shoulder and
there's this truck flying at you,

662
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,950
and you're like, "Boof!", getting
thrown around inside, trying to act.

663
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,270
You are quite accident prone
on films, are you not?

664
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,950
Cos when you were on X-Men...
Cos you've got Fassbender on...?

665
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,030
Yeah, Fassbender.

666
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,230
Cos he told some amazing
stories of what you got...

667
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,790
Racing golf buggies when he was...

668
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,350
Oh, yeah, him and James crashed
a golf buggy and caused

669
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,030
quite a lot of damage to themselves
and one of the cars on set.

670
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,190
Yeah, he did mention that.

671
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,430
You didn't get involved
in the golf buggy racing?

672
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,550
Well, they took them away after that.

673
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,510
We'd do a little bit
of golf buggy racing.

674
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,950
So then, our next one,
on the last film

675
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,870
me and James went and bought BB
guns and we'd shoot each other.

676
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,750
So you'd be riding
to set in the morning,

677
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,550
you'd put your goggles
on, load your clip,

678
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,750
you'd get out of the car and
then, before you knew it,

679
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,350
there were three people, like,
chasing you to your trailer.

680
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,630
~ Shooting you?
~ Yeah, but then we had to stop that

681
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,350
cos people got shot in the face.

682
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,270
~ LAUGHTER
~ And you'd bleed.

683
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,190
I was going to say it would
leave an ugly mark.

684
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,830
Yeah, it would welt or bleed, so
we got told we weren't allowed

685
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,430
~ to do that any more, either, so...
~ Aw!

686
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,630
Don't know what we're going
to do on the next one.

687
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,590
Is that why you've
now taken up knitting?

688
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,790
Yeah!

689
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,150
Oh, the knitting, yeah.

690
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,830
On Mad Max, there was
a lot of hanging around,

691
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,070
so one of make-up artists
was knitting one day

692
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,510
and I was like, "That seems
like a good way to kill time."

693
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,310
So, I'd sit there,
sit there knitting,

694
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,070
and then getting really frustrated
with myself when I'd mess up,

695
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,990
like, storming around
the set being like,

696
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,110
"Argh! Can someone fix my...

697
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,270
"..knitting?"

698
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,590
~ LAUGHTER
~ "Please."

699
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,590
And then they'd fix it
up, I'd go, "Thank you,"

700
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,950
and I'd go back off to
my corner and sit there.

701
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,910
I started, like, taking
orders from other people.

702
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,350
LAUGHTER

703
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,750
~ And then...
~ Beast can knit.

704
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,590
Two of the girls on Mad
Max asked for hats,

705
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,710
and I was like, OK.

706
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,470
I had one day off and I was like,
I've got to make these hats.

707
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,430
So I knitted straight
for ten hours that day

708
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,910
without really stopping.

709
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,310
And then I quit, I haven't
knitted since, cos I was like,

710
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,070
this is too much, it's
not fun any more.

711
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,950
Have you heard of Call Of Duty?
That's brilliant for killing time.

712
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,510
I kill weeks with Call Of Duty.
Knitting? Well, there we are.

713
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,270
Now, it's time to
get on to your cars,

714
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,110
cos we've established you like
a car, and you've driven many.

715
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,030
You've driven a
Murcielago, haven't you?

716
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,870
Yeah, I got to drive
one in Singapore.

717
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,910
I was shooting a film
in Singapore last year.

718
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,910
That's a beast, it was
proper Lambo beast days.

719
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,110
Yeah, it shifted.

720
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,430
But your first car wasn't
any of those things.

721
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,710
It was similar.

722
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,310
It was a Fiat Grande Punto.

723
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,630
~ Punto?
~ In red, yeah.

724
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,910
It's a mean car.

725
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,990
1.4 litres of mayhem. It
was good, I enjoyed it.

726
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,070
~ 1.4?
~ Yeah.

727
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,470
Whoa, that's a beast.

728
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,310
And then, presumably,
in a Fiat Punto,

729
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,790
police interruptions
in your driving...?

730
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,910
Yeah, yeah, one.

731
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,110
I've never got a speeding
ticket on anything,

732
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,910
not on my bike, nothing,
apart from in the Punto.

733
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,510
LAUGHTER

734
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,830
And the max speed on
that thing is 103,

735
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,150
and I think I was doing under
that. I'm pretty sure.

736
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,910
And I suddenly saw the blue lights
and I was like, "Oh, no."

737
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,190
Pulled over, and he was like,

738
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,070
"I've been chasing
you for a while now,

739
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,790
"and I had to do 120, maybe
130 to catch up with you,

740
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,910
"so you were definitely
doing faster than that."

741
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,310
And I was like, "Well...

742
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,670
"the logic is off."

743
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,350
He said he was doing
120 to catch you up

744
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,270
so you must have been
doing more than that?

745
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,430
Yeah, and I was like, "This
doesn't make any sense.

746
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,190
"Of course you were going faster
than me, you were chasing me."

747
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,830
Did you say you had a bike?

748
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,960
Yeah. Yeah, a Ducati 899.

749
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,830
Not interested in bikes.
Anyone interested in bikes?

750
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

751
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,270
Oh, God! Um...

752
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,670
LAUGHTER

753
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,230
Erm... do you ride it?

754
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,820
Yeah, I ride it around, it's lovely.

755
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,550
Um...

756
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,270
Is it...? What colour is it?

757
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,790
It's white.

758
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,550
Yeah.

759
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,030
LAUGHTER

760
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,870
Can we stop talking about bikes now?
I want to talk about his laps.

761
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,550
~ Oh, no!
~ No, no. You know last week
we had Gillian Anderson here?

762
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,110
And she did set a new
record of 22 practice

763
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,190
or attempts at the fastest time.
Do you know how many you did?

764
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,590
Uh, no, I wasn't...

765
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,110
~ 24!
~ Did I?!

766
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,950
LAUGHTER

767
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,230
No, but, you know, I
had lots going on, so...

768
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,510
But it is... It's an awful
thing to say, I know,

769
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,550
but it was a beautiful day today.

770
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,030
Well, yeah, it looked beautiful -

771
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,070
strong headwinds throughout
the whole lap, so...

772
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,990
Not a breath of wind, just
a crisp, cool, sunny,

773
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,350
beautiful, perfect
day for a car to go...

774
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,510
Yeah, that's what everyone
kept on saying.

775
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,030
And I was sitting there in
the car and I was sweating,

776
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,470
and everyone's first thing out their
mouths was, "Perfect day for it."

777
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,430
~ Yeah.
~ And you're like, oh...

778
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,430
Anyway, who would like
to see Nicholas's lap?

779
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

780
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,270
~ Let us have a look.
~ HE GROANS

782
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,980
~ Loves it!
~ Vigorous.
~ Loves it!

783
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,670
Race mode engaged.

784
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,470
Idiot driving - perfect.

785
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,510
Well, we shall see.

786
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,030
Coming up to the first...

787
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,550
Oh, crikey!

788
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,030
Oh, God almighty, that is quick.

789
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,070
It looks quick but I don't
know if it actually is.

790
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,310
~ That does look quick through there.
~ It felt like I was going as fast as I could.

791
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,120
Up to third, hang it out, turn it in.

792
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,270
And, I have to say, sometimes we say

793
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,230
if you go slowly it
looks quick but...

794
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,950
I saw Ricciardo bouncing up and down.

795
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,540
I don't know if that helps the speed.

796
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,870
No, cos normally when a car
is apparently going slowly

797
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,870
it's sometimes quick, but this
looks faster than normal.

798
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,120
And that's very nicely done.

799
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,830
That was a gear change.

800
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,830
Strong winds.

801
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,820
Not visible on screen.

802
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,590
Flat through there, obviously.

803
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,670
Oh, that is right to the edge!

804
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,750
And that's cutting it fine nicely.

805
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,120
And now just two corners left.

806
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,910
Coming in on a shallow angle,

807
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,390
but no real problems with
the second to last, Gambon.

808
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,990
A lot of understeer there,
but across the line!

What do you think, then?

812
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,680
Where do you think you've
come on the board?

813
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,030
Huh.

814
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,950
I'd, I'd, I mean...

815
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,470
Obviously, for X-Men bragging
rights, I'd like to be somewhere

816
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,710
around Hugh Jackman, but
that's really high up.

817
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,270
Where's Hugh?

818
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,550
He's 1:46.1.

819
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,910
I'd like to be in the
late 1:40s somewhere.

820
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,790
Late 1:40s. Well, let's have a look.

821
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,710
I don't know.

822
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,670

~ Oh, that's good.

828
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,870
Told you it looked quick.

829
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,590

834
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,980
But there...

835
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,640
Come on. Come on.

836
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,710
That is a tenth...

837
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,630
Olly Murs is like...

838
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,030
But that is a very...

839
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I mean, it looked quick.

840
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,270
It looked quick.

841
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,110
It's really difficult to get a
lap where everything goes right.

842
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,870
No, that is... That's a time
to be proud of, 1:44.7.

843
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,710
~ Thank you so much for coming.
~ Thank you.

844
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,350
Absolute pleasure to have you here.

845
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,710
Ladies and gentlemen, Nicholas Hoult!

846
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,880
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

847
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,670
Now, a few series
ago, the three of us

848
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,230
tried our hand at amateur Rallycross,

849
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,590
and we decided that, pound for pound,

850
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,310
it is the most exciting
sport in the world.

851
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,910
And, because we enjoyed
the amateur event so much,

852
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,350
the logical next step
was for one of us

853
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,590
to take it to a professional level.

854
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,630
Clearly, there was only
one steely-eyed helmsman

855
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,020
to take on this challenging job.

856
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,870
Him.

857
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,360
LAUGHTER

858
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,670
When we did our amateur Rallycrossing,

859
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,190
we raced here, at
Lidden Hill in Kent,

860
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,830
and our cars were plucked from
the pages of the classifieds

861
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,750
for just a few quid.

862
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,310
Well, the venue is the same.

863
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,990
This is where the event will
be taking place tomorrow.

864
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,780
The car, though...

865
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,670
That's a bit of a step up.

866
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,110
It starts out as a VW Polo,

867
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,550
but then becomes this -

868
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,150
a 2-litre turbo-charged Tornado

869
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,200
with 600 horsepower and more
torque than a Ferrari 458.

870
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,830
And, to keep the drivers
on their toes,

871
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,910
helping hands such as
traction control, ABS

872
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,700
and electronic
differentials are banned.

873
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,070
Now, I know what you're thinking -

874
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,030
you're thinking that's
not a racing car,

875
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,590
it's merely a vehicle providing
Top Gear viewers with hilarious

876
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,870
Captain Slow cock-ups.

877
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,590
But no, I might actually
be OK at this.

878
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,430
For starters, the circuits
are small and easy to learn.

879
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,670
The cars do have four-wheel drive.

880
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,070
And then there's the
calibre of the drivers.

881
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,910
One of them is the son of the
bloke who owns this track,

882
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,110
and another is just a presenter
on American Top Gear.

883
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,790
And it's the Top Gear
chap - Tanner Foust -

884
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,040
who has kindly offered to
train me for this event.

885
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,030
Is it really 600 horsepower,
or is that bar talk?

886
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,990
It's a full-on six.

887
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,830
It's 300 horsepower per litre,

888
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,190
0-100 km in 1.9 seconds.

889
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,190
It's quicker than a Formula
One car off the line.

890
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,190
~ Wow.
~ Then the other things about it, you know,

891
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,470
you've got all-wheel drive,
it's amazingly stable,

892
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,110
you'll see a jump and it just
completely absorbs them,

893
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,630
it's like marshmallow.

894
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,950
It's mostly carbon fibre,
Kevlar underneath.

895
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,230
There's a lot of contact.

896
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,910
I think it's the only
sport in the FIA

897
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,590
where there's not a rule saying
you can't hit other cars.

898
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,190
~ So you can hit other cars?
~ It happens, yeah.

899
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,030
'Tanner then pointed out the most
important thing on the dashboard.'

900
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,590
This switch here, this is the
monster switch right here.

901
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,910
This is the one that is the
ALS, for the anti-lag system.

902
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,750
~ This is for the turbo chargers?
~ Yeah.
~ Yes.

903
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,270
Once you flip that switch,
all hell breaks loose.

904
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,030
Now every time you lift off the
throttle, it's shooting flame

905
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,310
through the turbo, keeping
it spinning over 200,000 rpm.

906
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,470
Mmm.

907
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,750
And it's a very violent thing,

908
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,550
and that's really what
makes this car work.

909
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,870
~ OK.
~ Once you cross the finish line,

910
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,390
you flip that off and then
it's a normal car again.

911
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,950
So that, remember that...

912
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,190
It's really weird talking to someone
who is a Top Gear presenter

913
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,750
but who is really helpful.

914
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,590
~ Usually it's sarcasm and stupidity...
~ We're team mates.

915
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,230
.. but you're being informative,
helpful, encouraging -

916
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,950
it's quite nice.

917
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,400
'Tanner then offered to take
me for a demonstration run.'

918
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,310
I did mean to tell you, actually,
I fell off a horse quite recently.

919
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,470
~ OK.
~ And my bones are still a bit sore,

920
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,230
so try not to, you know, snap me
in half or anything like that.

921
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,520
OK.

922
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,520
ENGINE STARTS

923
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,100
Hold the brakes, then
lets it all off...

924
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,500
~ Holy
~ BLEEP!

925
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,040
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

926
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,080
Aaaaaaaargh!

927
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,470
Ow, ow, ow!

928
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,310
'45 seconds later, my spin
in the Rallycross tumble dryer

929
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,430
'came to a merciful end.'

930
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,790
'And then it was my turn to drive.'

931
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,800
Full throttle, and release
the clutch a little...

932
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,510
Faster, faster, faster, faster.

933
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,950
'For the next few hours...'

934
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,270
Brake and full throttle.

935
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,310
'.. my new friend from
American Top Gear

936
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,760
'gave me some excellent tuition.'

937
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,470
Second gear, second gear, brake.

938
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,630
No, wrong way.

939
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,230
Brake, brake, brake, brake, brake.

940
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,680
That way, that way. Brake,
brake, brake, brake, brake.

941
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,510
Sorry about that, by the way.

942
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,500
Hey, no harm, no foul.

943
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,830
'He then took the time to explain

944
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,430
'the considerable
complexities of the racing.'

945
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,550
So, there's 12 cars, and
then there's five heats.

946
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,030
~ Right.
~ But there's four laps in each heat.

947
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,070
You won't just drive
once, you go twice.

948
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,030
Like, maybe two or three times.

949
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,910
So, it's 50 points for the
guy in first, 45 and then 40.

950
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,790
Then there's two semifinals...

951
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,590
'Tanner said that, no matter
how I did in the heat,

952
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,230
'I'd be in one of the semifinals.

953
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,630
'Then he explained the joker lap.'

954
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,950
But in every one of these
you do the joker lap once,

955
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,670
which is the long outside,

956
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,230
outside of turn one,

957
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,150
with a bit of a jump
on the way in there.

958
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,550
~ OK, so I have to take the
joker lap once per race?
~ Exactly.

959
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,590
Here's the thing with the jokers
- at least three seconds slower.

960
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,790
Ideally, you would take
the joker lap sometime

961
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,950
if you're behind somebody and
you need to get free track.

962
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,430
And what if you forget?

963
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,670
That's why the spotter is critical.

964
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,910
What's a spotter?

965
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,230
So, on top of this building there'll
be one spotter per car

966
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,790
that'll be on the radio,
in your headset,

967
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,270
and they'll be able to talk
to you while you're driving,

968
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,150
when to take the joker,
who's behind you,

969
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,270
what position you're in,

970
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,870
give you information that you
need while you're on the track.

971
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,230
It's quite a responsible
job, the spotter, then.

972
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,230
~ Yeah, they have to pay attention.
~ Yeah.

973
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,670
I think I've... Can you just
go through that again,

974
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,830
to make sure I've got it?

975
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,790
12 cars total, we're all here to
race five times, four laps each,

976
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,440
30-second penalty if you take
the joker more than once...

977
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,350
The next morning, as all the other
teams prepared for race day,

978
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,440
I was in Tanner's garage getting
to know a bit more about my car.

979
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,630
Look at the size of this.

980
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,230
That's not a standard
air filter, obviously.

981
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,360
~ None of that is standard,
this isn't standard...
~ May?

982
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,220
~ Morning.
~ Morning.

983
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,390
What are you doing here?

984
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,910
Well, we're told you need spotters,
apparently - we are your spotter.

985
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,150
No, no, no, no.

986
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,470
No. Spotting is a genuinely
important job.

987
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,950
You have to say who's in front
of you, who's behind you...

988
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,110
~ Well, nobody's behind you, obviously.
~ Funny(!)

989
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,310
When to do the joker lap -
do you know about the joker?

990
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,910
~ Is there a jump?
~ There's a jump.
~ And we tell you when to do that?

991
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,670
~ Yeah, so when do I do it?
~ Now!
~ I don't know.

992
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,310
~ Which lap do I do the joker lap on?
~ I don't know.
~ Well, exactly.

993
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,750
~ How many laps are there?
~ Four.

994
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,910
I mean, can I just...?

995
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,550
I got out of bed this morning
at 5:15 to be here.

996
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,310
He stayed in a Ramada Inn
last night with Lenny Henry.

997
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,470
And this is how ungrateful he is.

998
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,550
Seriously, I've done a minimal
amount of practice yesterday,

999
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,310
and I don't want two
Muppets helping me.

1000
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,830
I'm sorry to be rude, but no.

1001
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,990
James, James! Your door's
not shut properly.

1002
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,580
~ Good spot, good spot, Hammond.
~ Yeah.

1003
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,990
Since I seemed to be stuck
with Pinky and Perky,

1004
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,320
we went to watch some of the
other drivers in the first race.

1005
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,910
They don't half start off
close together, don't they?

1006
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,750
~ You could crash by there!
~ Yeah.

1007
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,400
This'll be you.

1008
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,870
'Yesterday with Tanner, I thought
maybe a podium was a possibility.

1009
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,790
'But, now I was watching
the real racing...

1010
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,320
'.. I decided to aim a bit lower.'

1011
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,310
I think maybe a better
personal ambition would be

1012
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,430
not to be lapped.

1013
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,350
~ Does that happen a lot in this?
~ I don't think it's ever happened.

1014
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,900
You can't be lapped in Rallycross,
it's only four laps.

1015
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,350
So, in four laps, if they're
doing a 50-second lap,

1016
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,750
if you're more than 12 seconds
a lap slower than them,

1017
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,230
you're in the Guinness Book
of Records as the first person

1018
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,620
EVER to be lapped in Rallycross.

1019
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,390
'On that sobering thought, James
lined up for his first heat,

1020
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,440
'which featured drivers of a higher
calibre than he'd been expecting.'

1021
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,310
Petter Solberg is an extremely good,

1022

~ and a world champion at this.
~ Yes.

00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,590
Timmy Hansen is 22.

1025

He was third in European
Rallycross last year.

Gosh, why did I agree to this?

1035

They've started, James!
They've started!

1040
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,790
Quite muddy there, James,
it is quite muddy.

1041
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,240
Shut up!!

1042
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,920
James? James, so that you know,
the car behind you is French.

1043
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,390
~ That was good spotting there, Jeremy.
~ Shut up, you two!!

spotted a seagull.

1054

Shut up!!

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,710

Yes! You haven't been lapped.

Ha, ha! I wasn't lapped!

I'd like to see those other
two Muppets do that!

1060

I hope we weren't distracting to him.

1061
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,230
No, I shouldn't think so, he knows
we're there, we're with him.

1062
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,870
~ It was reassuring noises.
~ It's like racing in the car with him,

1063
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,070
~ it's like we're all three in
the car, all with steering wheels.
~ Exactly.

Petter Solberg, celebrated,

~ Yeah.

Eight seconds a lap slower.

1068
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,670
Right. Should we give him a strong
team talk, or should we support him?

1069
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,550
He just needs to learn
to drive faster...

1070
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,270
~ Faster than the other people.
~ Yeah.

1071
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,860
Well, faster than himself would help.

1072
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,120
'I was determined to do
better in the next heat.'

useless than in the first one.'

What time have you got to go tonight?

1075
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,190
Uh, well, I just want
to beat the traffic.

1076
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,590
Which bit of the M4 do you go down?

1077
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,350
Uh, off, at junction 15.

1078
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,950
That is near the M5, isn't it?

1079
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,510
~ No, no, 17 is Chippenham.
~ It's Bristol.

Shut up, you two!!

1081
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,740
Now for the joker.

1082
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,870
It's definitely 17, is Chippenham.

1083
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,230
I can't believe you don't
know, you do that...

1084
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,630
Yeah, but I don't go to 17, I go
to 15, so that's Marlborough...

1085
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,670
Shut up!!

1086
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,350

~ Argh!!

1087
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,270
'No thanks to my colleagues,

1089
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,630
Ho-ho! Come on!

1090
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,080
Fantastic.

1091
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,550
'But then it was time
for the semifinal,

00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,340

a bigger problem.'

1093
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,870
~ The semifinal is six laps.
~ Oh-ho!

1094
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,150
So it's half as long again.

1095
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,550
And I've worked out, my good laps
- of which I've done maybe two -

1096
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,670
were sort of four seconds
off the pace.

1097
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,790
But quite a few of my
slightly cocked up ones

1098
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,990
were sort of eight
to nine seconds off.

1099
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,350
So, in a six-lap race...

1100
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,150
~ Six-lap race...
~ Yeah.

1101
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,110
.. eight seconds, that's 48 seconds,

1102
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,790
and it's a 50... it's
a 50-second lap.

1103
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,350
~ Oh, ho-ho! You're in danger!
~ It'll be very, very close.

1104
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,270
~ This will be quite close.
~ This is the test.

00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,030
Don't let us down.

'.. which, obviously, my
eagle-eyed spotters noticed.'

1113
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,190
James, you were 11 seconds slower
than the lead car on that lap.

1114

~ Studio, yeah.

~ Studio. Back to the studio.
~ Back to the studio,

~ Yeah.

APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

1146
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,710
So, he'll go here, first person
ever to be lapped in Rallycross.

~ Nice, though - name in print.
~ Yeah, exactly.

1148

Anyway, we have to say,
even with him in it,

1149
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,790
Rallycross is brilliant.

1150
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,990
It is fabulous to watch
because, basically,

1151
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,110
from the start line
to the finish line,

1152
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,390
all the drivers drive
as fast as they can.

1153
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,070
Yes, that's it. There's
no conserving their tyres,

1154
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,110
there's no looking after
the fuel consumption,

1155
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,110
there are no stewards
with moustaches going,

1158
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,070
I tell you what Formula One is -

1159
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,950
Formula One is like having some money

1160
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,390
and putting in an ISA so that
it matures in a tax-free way.

1161

Rallycross is like having some money
and going to the pub with it.

01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,310
~ Yeah, just blow it on one
big night out, all at once.
~ Exactly.

1163
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,390
Can I just say...?

1164
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,430
No, you'll make yourself
look more ridiculous.

1165
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,670
You will, he's right.

1166
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,630
And, on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

1167
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,160
Thank you so much for
watching - good night!
