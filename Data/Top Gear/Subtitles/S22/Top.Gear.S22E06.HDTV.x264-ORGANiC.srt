1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,530
Tonight, James experiences the sheer
grunt of a Chevrolet Silverado.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,890
I go airborne in a Ford Velociraptor.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,740
And Richard Hammond
carries some wood.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,370
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,170
Hello!

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,570
Hello, and good evening.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,220
Hello. Now...

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,330
Thank you very much. A while
back I heard that Lexus

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,290
was working on a car called the RCF.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,970
It would be a two-door coupe
with a five-litre V8 engine

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,210
and it would take on the smaller
AMG Mercs and M-powered BMWs.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,970
And I was very excited.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,490
I couldn't wait to give it
a spanking round our track.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,530
And now I have.

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,940
DRAMATIC MUSIC

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,260
I expected it to be
sharp... but violent.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,130
Raw, but civilised.

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,700
Powerful, but controlled.

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,060
I expected a bank of Tokyo hi tech...

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,940
.. with the exhaust
bark of a mad dog.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,020
But actually it turned
out to be fat and useless.

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,090
REALLY fat.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,780
With two people on board,
it weighs nearly two tonnes.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,890
So look what happens when you put
it in a drag race with a BMW M4.

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,370
ENGINES REVVING

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,530
Three... two... one...

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,740
go!

28
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,660
The BMW just walks away.

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,100
I have 40 more horsepower than
he does and I'm being humiliated!

30
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,700
The enormous weight means it's
no good in the corners, either.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,850
I have got many, many
different settings in here

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,650
and I've got G-SHIFT control,
whatever that is.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,090
And VDIM.

34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,450
I've got STANDARD, ECO, SPORT S,

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,090
SPORT S+, something called SLALOM.

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,850
Doesn't matter which one you select,

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,330
you just get yards and yards

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,530
of wearisome understeer

39
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,610
and then a lot of
electronic interference.

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,850
There is, however, another
setting in the RCF

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,170
which makes it even worse.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,650
If you put it in SPORT+ and
then push this button here...

43
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,130
Look! I'm now in EXPERT mode.

44
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,970
It says it there.

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,410
I have told the car
that I am an expert.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,060
I don't need the electronic
stuff, I can manage.

47
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,740
Oh, God!

48
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,220
Lurchy. That's the word I'm
looking for there. Lurchy.

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,170
It's really struggling
to deal with the weight.

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,620
Come on!

51
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,560
Why are you doing that?!

52
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,060
I'm an expert, look. Look how
I'm going round this corner.

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,380
That's an expert use of the
- Oh, I'm on the grass.

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,490
The simple truth of the matter
is you can put John Prescott

55
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,970
in a pair of running shoes...

56
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,560
but it won't make him an athlete.

57
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,490
I really don't like this car.

58
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,370
I don't like the way it looks,
I don't like the way it goes,

59
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,820
I don't like the way it feels.

60
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,410
But what really annoys me,

61
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,770
what really gets my goat

62
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,380
is that I know Lexus
can do so much better.

63
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,140
A few years ago, they
gave us the LFA.

64
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,460
A car which, I'll admit, has
many faults and irritations.

65
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,450
The seat belt, for example, is
incredibly difficult to do up. Um...

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,690
There are no cup holders, it's
impossible to plug your telephone

67
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,370
or whatever into the stereo system,

68
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,090
and the fuel tank is the size
of a disposable lighter,

69
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,570
which means you have to fill
up every five minutes,

70
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,530
and then you have to get out,

71
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,730
and then it takes you a week
to do your seat belt up again.

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,370
I still haven't done it!

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,290
It's like giving myself
a prostate exam.

74
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,770
But these little things
pale into insignificance

75
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,500
when you unleash its
astonishing V10 engine.

76
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,780
ENGINE REVVING

77
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,900
It produces 552 horsepower.

78
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,860
That means 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds.

79
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,570
It also means a top speed of 202,

80
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,210
and even more amazingly, it
revs from idle to the red line

81
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,660
in an almost unbelievable
0.6 of a second.

82
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,530
But the best thing is the noise.

83
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,970
ENGINE ROARS

84
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,330
It sounds baleful, it sounds
like a wild animal that's...

85
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,320
sad about something.

86
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,010
"Oh, nooooooooo!

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,250
"I've got my paw stuck!

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,010
"Ow!

89
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,330
"Ow!

90
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,130
"Ow!"

91
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,210
This is what I was looking
for in the new Lexus,

92
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,020
a sense that the engine is actually
alive, that it's a sentient being.

93
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,540
And there was more I
was looking for, too.

94
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,210
The LFA does not have
an EXPERT facility,

95
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,420
or a G-SHIFT thing, or VDIM.

96
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,780
It corners well because
it's well engineered.

97
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,780
And it's light - very light.

98
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,700
TYRES SCREECH

99
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,820
And I love the way that it
feels so violent and raw.

100
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,260
This car is simply out of this world.

101
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,930
And look at the
difference in styling.

102
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,170
See how one looks like that stupid
food that's drizzled in jus

103
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,010
and served on a bed of stupid beans

104
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,890
to idiots in over-priced restaurants.

105
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,740
And the other is as simple as
a freshly picked blackberry.

106
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,650
I know that this costs five or
six times more than the new RCF,

107
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,410
and I know it's full of carbon fibre
and all sorts of clever engineering

108
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,610
that you can't reasonably
expect to find

109
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,290
further down the fiscal food chain,

110
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,810
but surely they could have captured
the spirit of this car, the essence,

111
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,170
its soul, and transplanted
that into the RCF.

112
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,090
Surely they could.

113
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,490
Or maybe they couldn't.

114
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,370
Maybe the LFA is so good,

115
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,780
not even the people who made
it know how to make it again.

116
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,620
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

117
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,690
~ Um, you said you were going
to give it a spanking.
~ Yeah.

118
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,330
But you gave it a kicking.

119
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,130
Well, it's rubbish. It is absolutely
rubbish. In fact, it's so bad

120
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,530
I'm not even going to bother
getting the Stig to take it

121
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,170
round the track, it would just
be a complete waste of time.

122
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,570
Oh, now, we ought to bring you up to
speed with the latest in car news.

123
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,850
Okie-doke.

124
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,850
A new Skoda coming out,
it's called the Superb.

125
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,890
There it is, mainly for mini cabbers.

126
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,210
But what you really need
to know is underneath,

127
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,690
if you peel away the body,
it's basically a Golf, OK?

128
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,890
There's another new Skoda, the Octavia
vRS, that's a Golf as well.

129
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,410
New Audi, RS3 Sportback, here it is.

130
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,770
That's a Golf.

131
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,930
~ New Skoda Fabia.
~ Ah, is that a Golf?
~ No, that's a Polo.

132
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,810
~ Is it? Oh, it's confusing.
~ It's not confusing.
~ It is.

133
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,970
No, it's not, it's
really, really simple.

134
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,770
All cars are basically a
Golf underneath, or a Polo,

135
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,250
or a Fiat 500,

136
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,250
except for this, this
is the Citroen DS5,

137
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,250
that's basically a
Peugeot, underneath.

138
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,530
And the Fiat 500X, that.

139
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,170
~ Well, is that not a Fiat 500?
~ No, that's an Alfa Romeo.
~ Is it?

140
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,410
Anyway, that's cleared up this
week's motoring news for you.

141
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,090
Moving on, do you remember
that six-wheeled

142
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,730
Mercedes G Wagon that I drove?
The six-wheel drive thing.

143
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,130
~ Yes, in the desert, yes, yes.
~ Yeah, a massive thing.

144
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,650
Well, Mercedes have now
announced that they're making

145
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,410
a four-wheel version of it.

146
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,490
~ Oh, there it is.
~ There, look at that.

147
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,530
So they've made a four-wheeled
version of the six-wheeled version

148
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,930
~ of the four-wheel car they already had.
~ I think it looks great.

149
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,970
Massive wheels made possible by
portal axles so it's raised up,

150
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,570
it's got about 422 brake
horsepower, I think it is,

151
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,530
from its V8 twin turbo.

152
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,290
It is quite costly.

153
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,650
£200,000 for that.

154
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,770
I know, I know, but if you look closely
it's got side pipes! Oh, yes!

155
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,450
And all of a sudden, ladies
and gentlemen, Richard Hammond

156
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,690
has become uncomfortable
in his trousers.

157
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,210
Well, I love... I do love side pipes.

158
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,370
I can tell that from the
shape of your front pipe!

159
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,610
Oh, is it showing? Sorry.

160
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,250
Oh, now, there's a sort of
motor racing, it's called GT3,

161
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,250
~ anyone seen it?
~ AUDIENCE: Yeah.

162
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,410
There's a picture of a grid here.
Look at it, it's just amazing -

163
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,850
Astons, McLarens, Porches, BMWs,
Nissan GT-Rs, fabulous series.

164
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,570
Yeah, very exciting because
you can recognise the cars.

165
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,530
But now Bentley has announced that
they're going to build a car

166
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,250
that's inspired by that race series.

167
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,530
It's called the GT3-R, here it is.

168
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,210
And it's a sort of stripped-down,
pumped-up, road-going,

169
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,250
two-seater version of the race
car. 580 horsepower, from its V8.

170
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,730
I like the look of that.

171
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,690
And, well, you'll like the sound,
because it's got a titanium exhaust

172
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,370
that they say gives
it a baritone roar.

173
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,930
So it's got Tom Jones underneath it.

174
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,930
~ Basically, they've strapped Tom Jones...
~ Poor Tom, "Whoa!"

175
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,890
~ That's how it sounds.
~ Aston Martin have got a very similar

176
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,130
sort of thing, called
a Vantage V12 GT3.

177
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,250
AUDIENCE: Oooh!

178
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,290
~ Exactly, whoa, that is a V12, obviously.
~ Does look quite cool.

179
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,810
600 horsepower, so 20
more than the Bentley

180
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,610
and it's half a tonne lighter.

181
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,530
That is properly blowing
my frock up, that thing.

182
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,490
It really is. Philosophy news...

183
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,050
Everybody - no, don't groan, because
I know it sounds dreary but...

184
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,930
~ driverless cars are coming, as we know.
~ Yeah.

185
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,690
And somebody pointed out this week,

186
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,650
and I think it's rather a good point,

187
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,250
that they will have to make, from
time to time, ethical decisions.

188
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,290
What, like, should we
cancel Third World debt?

189
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,890
No, James, not that. You're
driving along, OK?

190
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,930
And you're heading towards an accident.
You're not driving, you're

191
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,650
sitting there. You're heading
towards an accident, it's going

192
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,330
to be fatal. The only solution
is to swerve onto the pavement,

193
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,610
but there are two pedestrians there.

194
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,930
What does the car do?

195
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,330
Wow, is this the Moral
Maze or something?

196
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,010
No, it's a genuine thing.

197
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,010
Cos basically you will have bought
a car that must be programmed,

198
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,650
in certain circumstances,
to kill you. It will go,

199
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,410
"Well, there's two there, there's
only one person in me,

200
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,370
"I'm going to kill him." And you'll
just have to sit there, as the lorry

201
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,290
~ comes and there's nothing you can do.
~ Well, maybe driverless cars

202
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,210
will have to come with,
like, an override button.

203
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,490
Just a big button with "ME" on
it. So, in a crash - save me!

204
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,170
~ Just hit that.
~ Or maybe it could have a sliding scale.

205
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,010
So you can say, look, if there's
a load of children on the pavement

206
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,540
obviously don't run them
down, but cyclists...

207
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,330
We are in dark territory
here, aren't we?

208
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,930
Well, the interesting thing
is, all of us are programmed,

209
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,530
because we're humans, cos
we're animals, basically,

210
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,290
to look after ourselves.
Self-preservation always kicks in

211
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,850
~ and you will swerve away from danger.
~ Not necessarily.

212
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,010
Oh, well, now you say that, but
recently scientists conducted

213
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,570
an absolutely awful, genuinely
awful experiment,

214
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,370
but with a very interesting result.

215
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,370
They got a load of monkeys with their
babies and put them in a box.

216
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,970
And then they heated the floor
up - this actually happened -

217
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,010
I, you know, I'm just reporting.

218
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,530
They heated the floor up till
it became really unbearable

219
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,770
and all of the monkeys picked
up their babies and held them.

220
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,090
But when the floor got hotter and
hotter until it was absolutely

221
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,610
unbearable, every one of them put
the babies down and stood on them.

222
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,690
GASPING AND GIGGLING

223
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,250
I'm... I'm surprised...

224
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,530
I'm surprised you didn't save this
for the Christmas show, mate.

225
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,890
LAUGHTER

226
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,050
What a lovely story,
what a nice tale(!)

227
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,370
I love a story!

228
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,450
I'm just saying, these driverless
cars, everybody goes,

229
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,610
"Aren't they clever? They
can stop at red lights."

230
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,890
They are going to have to
face all sorts of things,

231
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,210
like who do I kill now?

232
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,290
We are programmed to look after
ourselves and these driverless cars

233
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,610
are going to be programmed
to do the maths and say,

234
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,170
"A lot of people over there,
I'm going to kill you."

235
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,570
And whether to stand
on a baby monkey.

236
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,890
LAUGHTER

237
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,810
Now, Brooklands, world's first
purpose-built racetrack,

238
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,930
~ do you remember it?
~ Well, no. He will.

239
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,410
Oh, yeah, he will, obviously.

240
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,770
We've got some footage of
it here to remind everyone.

241
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,810
This was just outside
London, and look at it,

242
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,650
everybody walked fast and were
in black and white in those days.

243
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,570
And you went unbelievable - look
at this, 120mph on the banking.

244
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,850
And then there's James May,
look, in his pedal car.

245
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,130
And then it was just fantastic.

246
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,170
But the war started, they built an
aeroplane factory on the circuit

247
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,770
and that was the end of that.

248
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,930
Ever since, there's been a group
of enthusiasts who want Brooklands

249
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,130
to reopen, and last week, actually,
they were given a grant

250
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,210
by the lottery people
of £4.6 million.

251
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,570
And I just think that's going to be
brilliant. Get that back - Astons,

252
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,890
Bentleys belting around
at the weekend,

253
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,850
Fotherington Sorbet wheel-to-wheel
with the Duke of Wyndham.

254
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,450
It's a very good idea for an
appealing Sunday afternoon,

255
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,890
watching the toffs kill themselves.

256
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,210
You just pop down the A3
on a Sunday afternoon,

257
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,370
"Let's go and watch the Earl
of Bradford's head come off."

258
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,330
~ How much did you say they'd been given?
~ £4.6 million.

259
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,330
Well, that's not enough, is it? The
shopping centre next to our office

260
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,690
~ cost one and a half billion.
~ Yes, exactly, it isn't very much,

261
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,730
you're quite right,
well spotted, Hammond.

262
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,810
In fact, all they can afford
to do with that is rebuild

263
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,370
the start/finish straight.

264
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,490
Hang on, just the start/finish
straight of a race circuit

265
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,450
~ is not much use in itself.
~ No.

266
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,450
Unless they spend all 4.6
million on lottery tickets.

267
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,530
It's lottery money, they can take the
grant, spend it on lottery tickets

268
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,130
~ and win a lot more.
~ Good thinking from Richard Hammond there,

269
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,330
he's saved motor racing
for the nation.

270
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,330
Now, I know this is a car show,
but please bear with us,

271
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,970
because I want to talk about this.

272
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,490
It's one of those watches
that's worn by people

273
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,330
who play golf and do business.

274
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,250
And they're always banging on about
these pins that you can see here.

275
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,610
Yeah, they say that if they pull
those pins out, the watch will send

276
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,290
their precise position
to a team of professionals

277
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,450
who will come and rescue them.

278
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,890
So, if they're out climbing a mountain
or rowing across an ocean...

279
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,650
Which they aren't, cos they're
playing golf and doing business.

280
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,450
But if they were doing those things,
and something went wrong,

281
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,570
~ then thanks to their watch, they'd be OK.
~ Ah, but would they?

282
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,250
To find out, the producers decided
that one of us should be dumped

283
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,410
somewhere with minimal kit,
with virtually no food,

284
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,020
somewhere very, very remote
to see if the system works.

285
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,360
Well...

286
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,450
.. that's it.

287
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,650
I am now marooned here,

288
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,900
wherever the hell here is.

289
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,280
Bloody hell.

290
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,370
My only hope now is my watch.

291
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,100
So... it's time.

292
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,220
Undo this.

293
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,850
There.

294
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,240
And then pull that bit out...

295
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,380
And that's it done.

296
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,450
Pulling those pins activates a
distress signal that's picked up

297
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,370
by a LEOSAR - Low Earth
Polar Orbit Satellite -

298
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,130
which then forwards
my exact coordinates

299
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,410
to a central command centre.

300
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,690
The team here then scramble
the nearest highly-trained

301
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,060
search and rescue unit, who arrive
at my location within hours.

302
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,490
Sadly, however, today the scramble
command has not been sent

303
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,330
to a highly-trained search
and rescue unit.

304
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,620
HAMMOND PANTS

305
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,090
.. running on petrol.

306
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,250
It's a brilliant idea, and I'm
not sure the Ferrari does that.

307
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,050
I think it does, but I think they're
just being honest about it cos

308
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,010
they're recognising that it's a
means of improving the efficiency.

309
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,770
~ Is that your bag ringing?
~ BEEPING

310
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,050
Oh, I think this is the signal
from our esteemed colleague

311
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,290
~ Richard Hammond.
~ Is it? Where is he?

312
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,210
Wait a minute. He would appear
to be in... Africa, is it?

313
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,130
Let's have a look.

314
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,810
No, I think you'll find that is...

315
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,450
Canada.

316
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,090
Specifically the Rockies.

317
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,530
Crikey! Um... actually,
that is quite serious.

318
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,010
We really do need to get on
this, James, so, excuse me...

319
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,460
could we see the pudding menu?

320
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,980
Right...

321
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,540
.. that bit suspends off this bit.

322
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,140
That watch transmits for 24 hours.

323
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,850
And then that's it.

324
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,410
Right, so this is the
mountain, there's my tent.

325
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,610
Mountain, trees, hills.
This is all we are.

326
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,610
There's a cameraman,
a sound recordist

327
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,650
and a bloke from the office
and he's just a media luvvie.

328
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,490
I know you think there's
a five-star hotel

329
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,370
just down there, but there's not.

330
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,720
Nothing else. There's no
survival experts here.

331
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,010
Fact of the matter is I'm
completely stuck until

332
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,660
Yogi the boar and Boo-Boo get here.

333
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,770
Knowing we were his only hope,

334
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,530
we had some important
decisions to make.

335
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,690
Raunchy apple fritters sounds quite
interesting. Or pancake with cheese.

336
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,410
James, James, James.

337
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,850
You know in the colonies, Australia,
South Africa, America,

338
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,650
~ Canada and so on, everybody
loves pick-up trucks, yes?
~ Yes.

339
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,530
Well, why don't we get a pick-up
truck to go and rescue Hammond in?

340
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,010
Because pick-up trucks generally
only have two seats

341
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,650
and there would be three of
us when we've rescued him.

342
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,370
Why don't we get two pick-up
trucks, one for you, one for me?

343
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,130
It would A, increase our
chances of finding him,

344
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,970
~ and B, there'd be a seat to get him back in.
~ But...

345
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,850
In Thunderbirds, inevitably
1 and 2 kind of went first,

346
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,810
~ didn't they, always.
~ Yeah.

347
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,250
Alan and... No, not Alan - who
drove Thunderbird 1? Scott.

348
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,490
~ Virgil.
~ No, Virgil was 2.

349
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,810
~ Was he 2?
~ Scott was 1,

350
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,890
Virgil was 2, Alan was 3,

351
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,100
~ Gordon was 4.
~ Gordon!

352
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,810
In Canada, the temperature
was a bitter minus 10,

353
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,400
so I urgently needed some warmth.

354
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,540
What would have been wrong
with giving me a lighter?

355
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,210
Can't get my fire lit.

356
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,450
Cold beans.

357
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,100
They're a bit frozen in the middle.

358
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,250
'Having finished our lunch...'

359
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,570
I'm not sure about the red, you know.

360
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,920
'.. we went to book some
flights to Vancouver.'

361
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,250
~ OK, you've actually just missed
the last flight out today.
~ Have we?

362
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,170
~ Yeah.
~ Oh, what a rotten bit of luck.
Shall we go and get another drink?

363
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,570
There's a Delta One that leaves
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

364
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,290
Don't like Delta's seat upholstery.

365
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,570
Would you go from Manchester?

366
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,890
Manchester, no, you know, this
is the BBC, it think it would be

367
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,170
idiotic to go to Manchester, I
mean, that would be just stupid.

368
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,570
There's Lufthansa.

369
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,330
Stewardesses wear trousers.

370
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,490
~ There's one from Gatwick
which goes via Calgary if...
~ Gatwick?

371
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,330
~ He doesn't like Gatwick.
~ I hate Gatwick.

372
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,300
WOLF HOWLS

373
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
Out there somewhere...

374
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,610
.. there are...

375
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,930
bears.

376
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,060
As many as 180,000 black bears.

377
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,000
I can't remember what it
was, about 15,000 grizzlies.

378
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,570
ICE RATTLES

379
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,020
Freezing.

380
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,810
In the morning I was cold and
exhausted from lack of sleep,

381
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,500
but most of all, I was anxious.

382
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,410
Any minute now.

383
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,080
Any minute.

384
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,560
I mean, they've had 24 hours.

385
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,700
I mean... 24 hours.

386
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,780
You can get anywhere in the
world in 24 hours, surely.

387
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,980
Where the hell are they?

388
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,490
~ I can't remember...
~ James.

389
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,690
~ It's stopped beeping.
~ Well, yeah, it would.

390
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,730
~ Why would it?
~ Cos the watch thing only
transmits the distress signal

391
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,050
for 24 hours, then
the battery runs out.

392
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,170
~ Seriously?
~ Well, yeah, it's only...

393
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,930
Well, did you make a
note of where he was?

394
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,920
Well, no, I didn't.
You've got the thing.

395
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,450
Well, I... I remember he
was on something called...

396
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,530
I think it was Wolf Mountain,
and you go up Bear Pass.

397
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,010
Sounds grizzly.

398
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,850
~ HE LAUGHS
~ That was a good joke.

399
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,050
No, actually, do you know the
biggest problem is not bears

400
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,690
and wolves...

401
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,610
cougars. Loads of cougars.

402
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,450
~ Well, that's all right, then.
~ No, not that sort of cougar.

403
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,690
Actually, a "Grrrr!"
That sort of cougar.

404
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,840
~ Oh, you mean like a big cat thing?
~ HE SNARLS

405
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,210
As I couldn't move from the spot
where the watch had transmitted

406
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,650
the distress signal,

407
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,780
I was hard at work trying to make
my life here more comfortable.

408
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,290
I want somewhere to sit.

409
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,840
I can't sit on the snow
so I'm building a shelter.

410
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,820
HE STRIKES FLINT

411
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,650
Spark, you bastard.

412
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,820
There we go, we have fire.

413
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,820
'And with my supplies dwindling,
I also needed to think about food.'

414
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,450
"Animals for food.

415
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,050
"Guinea pigs.

416
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,490
"All animals can be a
source of nourishment.

417
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,740
"A few, including worms and insects,
can be collected with little skill."

418
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:04,130
I'm bored, I'm cold, I'm unhappy,
I'm hungry, I'm scared.

419
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,330
Ahh! Ahh!

420
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,610
And I don't want to be wearing a hat!

421
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Just for a minute. Oh.

422
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,210
'To alleviate the boredom,
and stave off the cold,

423
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,900
'I tried to make some
SAS-style pine needle tea.'

424
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,680
Ah!

425
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,250
Ow! Ow!

426
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,060
Ow! Where are they, just where?!

427
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,930
'Unfortunately, we were a little
bit delayed at Vancouver Airport...'

428
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,650
Yes, of course.

429
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,690
'But eventually we made
it to the car park,

430
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,300
'where our pick-up truck rescue
vehicles were waiting.'

431
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,890
~ James.
~ Yeah.

432
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,730
That's not a light - that's
a collapsed sun, isn't it?

433
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,530
Yeah, never mind that, look.

434
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,690
Mine is actually... comes
up to my nipples.

435
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,210
I didn't realise it was... And do
you know what the other thing is?

436
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,210
If I actually find Richard Hammond,
I'm not going to see him, am I?

437
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,690
I'll just run straight over him.

438
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,050
Have you noticed something
else about mine?

439
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,530
This entire vehicle is
a transportation device

440
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,490
for its own spare wheel, look.

441
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,450
~ That's all the back's for!
~ That's really stupid.

442
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,650
~ It's preposter...
~ Look at the size of it.
~ Look at it!

443
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,130
Anyway, listen, we've got
everything we need here.

444
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,730
I've got a big warm coat,
I've got a massive car,

445
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,810
a rough idea of where
Richard Hammond is.

446
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,650
Yeah, so let's go...

447
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,050
into Vancouver, get a hotel,
good night's rest,

448
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,240
get rid of this jet lag.

449
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,650
It's not funny. I don't know what...

450
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,240
They've got to get here tomorrow.

451
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,780
Morning. Early.

452
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,210
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

453
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,730
Um...

454
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,170
Hold on.

455
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,770
Hold on a minute.

456
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,290
Can I just make something clear?

457
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,650
That's the first time I've seen
this film and, um, I'm sorry,

458
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,650
you two went into Vancouver.

459
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,970
~ Well, yes.
~ To get rid of your jet lag.
~ Yes.

460
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,530
No, tiredness kills, Hammond.

461
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,170
~ Haven't you seen those
signs on the motorway?
~ Exactly.

462
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,050
What annoys me as well here is
that you chose to do it in big

463
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,570
~ American pick-up trucks.
~ Well, that's a good idea,

464
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,690
because we hardly ever do big American
pick-up trucks on Top Gear.

465
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,690
I know, I'm always
campaigning to do them.

466
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,130
I know, and in part two of the film,

467
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,610
we do them extensively on many
different types of terrain.

468
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,810
Yes! Without me! LAUGHTER

469
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,450
Oh, this is unbelievable! I've
never heard such ingratitude.

470
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,610
5,400 miles we travelled
to come and rescue you.

471
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,890
~ In slow motion.
~ Yeah, but we thought you liked tenting!

472
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,690
I do, in the Lake District
where there's a bit of drizzle

473
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,210
and you can go out for some cake,

474
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,450
not on top of a mountain at minus
ten, surrounded by bears!

475
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,570
Well, we'll find out later on
if Richard Hammond manages to be

476
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,490
grateful about any of this but, er,

477
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,570
now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

478
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,810
Now, funnily enough,

479
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,650
my guest tonight spent quite
a lot of time in Canada as well.

480
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,610
Is she an ungrateful,
angry little man?

481
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,250
No, no, she isn't, actually. She
is the star of both The X-Files

482
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,410
and The Fall - ladies and gentlemen,
it is Gillian Anderson!

483
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,380
CHEERING

484
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,820
~ I'll kiss you.
~ I hope so.

485
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,650
CLARKSON LAUGHS

486
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,570
Excellent. Thank you
so much for coming!

487
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,250
So you can remember my
name throughout the show?

488
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,930
No, it goes on there.
Eventually it goes on there.

489
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,450
But I did have to look
whether it was a J or a G.

490
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,570
Now, one of the things that
amazes me is you today joined

491
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,610
a very small band of people
who have been on this show.

492
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,610
~ Including...
~ By doing the worst time ever...

493
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,180
~ We'll get to that later.
~ OK!

494
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,480
How did you know? No, no, no!

495
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,850
~ Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon
Cowell, Michael Gambon and you.
~ What?

496
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,250
All... Everyone's offered a car
and driver to come down here

497
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,410
~ but you said no, no, I'll drive myself.
~ Yeah.

498
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,970
~ And you did drive yourself.
~ I did drive myself.
~ Very rare.

499
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,770
Have you got a problem with drivers
or you just like driving...?

500
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,130
~ I just like being in control, I think.
~ Really?

501
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,410
Ultimately, no, I do like
dri... I drive everywhere,

502
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,810
~ I drive everywhere.
~ You grew up in England, didn't you?

503
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,970
A lot of people have been
very surprised to hear you

504
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,970
~ talking with an English accent.
~ Yeah.

505
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,850
~ But you actually did grow
up, grew up... Was it London?
~ London.

506
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,730
~ You grew up in...
~ Crouch End and Haringey.

507
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,290
~ But then you learned to drive in America.
~ At 16.

508
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,890
At 16. And it was a Volkswagen
family that you'd come from?

509
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,010
Well, when we were living
in London we had a Beetle,

510
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,530
an old original body Beetle, the
skinny ones with the pointy tops.

511
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,850
And then when we moved
to Grand Rapids, Michigan,

512
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,490
we got what's called a Rabbit
which I think a Golf...

513
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,090
A Volkswagen Golf is a Rabbit.

514
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,850
~ An actual rabbit.
~ Yeah, yeah, but I think
they're the same thing.

515
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,650
No, a rabbit's... not a car.

516
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,010
That's what I, that's what I,
that's what I... It does exist.

517
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,730
Yes, it does. So anyway,
so you learn to drive at 16.

518
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,610
~ Yes.
~ In the States. And it went well?

519
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,570
Yeah, yes, no, no, it went very well

520
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,290
and then you were kind of
on probation for a period

521
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,970
of time when you get your driver's
licence, where you can drive

522
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,810
but you have to have somebody who
has a driving licence in the car.

523
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,130
~ OK.
~ And, um, and I didn't on
the first time I went out

524
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,930
and got into two car accidents
on the same day.

525
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,650
I was literally, I swear to God,

526
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,730
going to my very first acting
class, and I got rear-ended,

527
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,570
and I thought it was my fault.

528
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,250
And so I said, "I'm so
sorry, just go, go away."

529
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,010
And I didn't get any information,

530
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,610
and then had to pretend later
that I got hit in a parking lot.

531
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,330
They must have thought all their
Christmases had come at once,

532
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,170
somebody apologised for being
stationary when they ran into them.

533
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,690
So what was the second one?

534
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,090
I was trying to parallel
park and swung out and

535
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,530
side-swiped a woman in
a large, uh, old Cadillac

536
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,570
and she, she was very large
and her son was very large

537
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,090
and they had a very
large baseball bat!

538
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,810
And they were determined that
they were going to get money,

539
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,450
so they followed me home.

540
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,810
~ With a baseball bat.
~ With a baseball bat.

541
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,690
And I walked up to the front
door, my mum answered

542
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,290
and there were these two people, um,
wanting money, standing behind me.

543
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,490
And she had the sense of
mind to look in her wallet

544
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,690
and pretend that she only had 20,
and so she gave it to them and...

545
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,250
~ And they were happy?
~ And sent them on their way, yeah.

546
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,850
So, anyway, you grew up in
the UK, ended up in America,

547
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,730
ended up acting, obviously, so
presumably you end up in Los Angeles

548
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,210
~ at some point.
~ Yes.
~ What car did you have once
The X-Files had taken off?

549
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,810
Well, while I was, I don't know
why, but when we were shooting

550
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,290
in Vancouver, I had a Boxster,
um, and then while we were in LA,

551
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,370
I did a commercial and they paid me
in a car and I got to choose a car.

552
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,210
So I chose an old body 911.

553
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,490
~ 911?
~ Yeah.
~ I'd have gone for a Veyron.

554
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,930
Well, I'm sure that the budget,
uh, restricted me to a degree.

555
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,970
~ Oh, I see, it wasn't like ANY car.
~ It wasn't ANY car, but, yeah.

556
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,650
~ So you're a fan of the 911 Porsches?
~ Yes, very much, yeah.

557
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,650
What is it that you like about 911s?

558
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,690
Um, I liked about
that particular car,

559
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,330
I liked how much you could
feel the road in it.

560
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,970
It felt, you know,
it's a very basic car.

561
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,970
I always think they're popular
in America cos 911's what you dial

562
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,330
~ if you crash.
~ Yeah.

563
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,890
AMERICAN ACCENT: So what do I...
Oh, I know, there's a number.

564
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,890
~ Cos it's the same thing.
~ That's not bad. That's not a bad accent.

565
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,770
I'm better in the south...
but that's about it.

566
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,730
So have you got lots of speeding
tickets or are you...?

567
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,890
~ I've had a few.
~ You have?

568
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,810
The nicest, um, the nicest
thing that ever happened

569
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,050
was in Canada on Christmas
Eve in Vancouver.

570
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,250
I was properly speeding and a
policeman pulled up beside me,

571
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,730
drove in front of me and
slowed me down and then

572
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,490
he put his hand out the window
and gave me the thumbs up.

573
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,370
And that was it. What's
properly speeding?

574
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,890
~ Probably about 110.
~ Miles an hour?

575
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,010
Yeah. How many tickets have you
got? Do you get a lot of tickets?

576
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,090
~ I've just got my first in 35 years.
~ No!
~ Yeah.

577
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,130
LAUGHTER

578
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,010
You know when you've got
an innocent face like mine,

579
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,930
you don't like to cause offence,
which I don't, then you get...

580
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,330
~ I smell bull
~ BLEEP.
~ It was...

581
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,730
LAUGHTER

582
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,210
The other one you had in Los Angeles,

583
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,650
~ didn't you have a Land Rover?
~ I had a Defe... Yes, I did.

584
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:46,050
I, um, I fell in love with the
idea of having an old-fashioned

585
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,290
Defender, a red one with a cream top
and it was as much the look of it

586
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,410
~ as anything else and they're a
~ BLEEP
~ pain in the arse to drive.

587
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,450
LAUGHTER They are.

588
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,570
The wheels are this big and they
turn, you have to turn the whole...

589
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,930
~ And there's no shoulder room at all.
~ No, I bought it for about 12,000,

590
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,370
I put about 35,000 into it,

591
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,010
and I sold it on a celebrity
auction for 12,000.

592
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,650
Cos it's only recently they've
started making cars...

593
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,250
BRUMMIE ACCENT: "Oh, right,

594
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,690
"you want them to last and work?
We never thought of that!"

595
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,730
~ They are quite reliable now.
~ You and your accents, very impressive.

596
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,930
~ Well, you know...
~ Was that Australian?

597
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,020
LAUGHTER

598
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,450
Anyway, it's time now to
talk about your lap. Cos...

599
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,850
~ My 2,765 laps.
~ Well, it was a bit like that.

600
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,650
You have set a record.
Most amount of laps done.

601
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,490
Cos most people come down and
do seven or eight. You...

602
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,260
~ What? Really?
~ Yeah. You did 22.
~ Oh!

603
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,290
~ I'm going to be brutally honest with you.
~ No. I... No, what?

604
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,690
Well, your first five were
all over two minutes.

605
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,850
~ Right.
~ Which is, um...

606
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,240
~ Yeah, off the...
~ Well, crap.

607
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,370
It sucked at the beginning.

608
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,730
It was wet and I couldn't even
I couldn't see the lines

609
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,290
and I got three hours of sleep
last night, that doesn't help.

610
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,130
~ Um...
~ Right, wet, couldn't see the lines.
~ Three hours' sleep, yeah.

611
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,930
~ Body working OK? Oh, stick shift on...
~ Oh, no, frozen shoulder.

612
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,930
~ OK, so that's good one, two, three...
~ But that... They're not,

613
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,650
yeah, excuses!

614
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,770
~ So.
~ Yeah, yeah.

615
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,170
Would you like to see your lap?

616
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,410
~ Yes.
~ Would everyone else like to?

617
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,850
~ AUDIENCE: Yes!
~ Here we go, let's have a look.

618
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,050
TYRES SCREECH

619
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,060
Whoa, that's a lot of power
on the... on the start there.

620
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
That's a dirty look.

621
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Keeping it tight, very
tight through there.

622
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,690
Tyres being tortured.

623
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,570
~ Here we go.
~ This is good, this is really good.

624
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,490
SHE LAUGHS

625
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,170
And yeah, it is wet through there.

626
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,760
Well, moist.

627
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,330
~ My foot's on the floor.
~ Is it?

628
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,610
Right, now the Hammerhead.

629
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,450
Are we going to be too
brutal through here?

630
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,290
We are a bit, little
bit too much gas.

631
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,690
But held it all together nicely.

632
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,090
Keeping it in the middle
of the road on the way out

633
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,650
and, oh, that was a gear change.

634
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,290
I thought I turned
on climate control.

635
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,210
Don't get distracted with
the Follow Through looming.

636
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,000
Yes, nicely, that's very nicely done.

637
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,370
And, oh, very quiet and smooth.

638
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,890
Here we go, only two corners to go.

639
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,940
Oh, that was a sudden gear change
there and only Gambon left.

640
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,730
Very nice through there
and across the line.

641
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,020
CHEERING

642
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,570
So, ha-ha!

643
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,370
Bearing in mind, as
we've established,

644
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,850
that your first five laps
of your 22 were about here.

645
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,330
~ Yeah.
~ Two minutes. Where do you
think you came in the end?

646
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,410
I think I'm probably
still below Jack.

647
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,730
~ What, slower than 1.54.5?
~ I don't know what that means.

648
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,290
~ One minute...
~ I know what that means.

649
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,210
~ It's a unit of time.
~ I know.

650
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,730
Well... one.

651
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,890
~ Yeah.
~ So you improved.

652
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,260
Yes!

653
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,330
40.

654
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,690
Oh! Oh!

655
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,410
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

656
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,770
~ Eight.
~ No!

657
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,130
Point five.

658
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,850
~ Oh
~ BLEEP!

659
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,060
And it was mildly moist.
Which is actually...

660
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,610
Oh, wow, yes! I beat Charles Dance!

661
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,850
You beat Charles Dance,
you beat Joss Stone,

662
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,170
you beat Kiefer Sutherland.

663
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,090
~ That's a reboot!
~ That is quite something.

664
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,770
~ Wow.
~ Yeah, that's one of the fastest
wet times we've ever had.

665
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,380
~ Or mildly moist. I think it is.
~ It was more than mildly moist.

666
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,730
I'll be the judge of what's
moist and what's not.

667
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,170
LAUGHTER

668
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,970
~ And that was mildly moist.
~ OK.

669
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:28,330
I know what, you are easily not only
the fastest wet lap, but also...

670
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,370
~ most improved.
~ Oh.

671
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,890
So ladies and gentlemen,
Gillian Anderson!

672
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,260
~ CHEERING
~ Brilliant, that's good.

673
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,810
Now, tonight Jeremy and I are using
two huge American pick-up trucks

674
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,810
to rescue Richard Hammond,
who's been abandoned

675
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,450
on a freezing cold mountain
top in the Canadian Rockies.

676
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,250
We pick up the action after
we'd had a good night's rest

677
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,940
in a downtown Vancouver hotel.

678
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:15,250
We set off before dawn, not knowing
exactly where Hammond was.

679
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,170
But we did know he was
at least 400 miles away.

680
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,020
So, we had plenty of time
to get to know our vehicles.

681
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,330
I am driving a Ford
F-150 pick-up truck,

682
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,890
which is, by miles, the
bestselling vehicle in America.

683
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,010
Ford sells one of these
things every 35 seconds.

684
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,340
And that's only in America,
remember - 35 seconds.

685
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,490
If you were to park every
F-150 that's ever been made

686
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,490
since 1948, side by side -
not end to end, side by side -

687
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,250
the line would stretch
round the equator...

688
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,570
twice!

689
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,410
The reason it sells so well
is simple - it's cheap.

690
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,490
You can have an F-150 with
an automatic gearbox,

691
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,570
cruise control, air conditioning

692
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,450
and a 350 horsepower V8 motor,

693
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,090
for the equivalent of £20,000.

694
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,140
Now that's what we pay in Europe
for a Vauxhall Astra diesel.

695
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,770
By comparison, my pick-up
truck is a sales disaster.

696
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,730
What I'm driving here,
viewers, the Silverado,

697
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,090
the Chevrolet Silverado, is the
second bestselling pick-up truck.

698
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,740
They only manage to shift
one of these every minute.

699
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,100
I'm amazed Chevrolet
are still in business.

700
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,900
Meanwhile, very far away, my third
day on the mountain was beginning.

701
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,660
I didn't sleep last night.
I was cold all night.

702
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,770
I'm going to have to
get more firewood.

703
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,770
The thought of that,
swinging that axe again.

704
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,450
It's probably a good diet, this.

705
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,850
You'll see it on This
Morning at some point.

706
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,810
AS LORRAINE KELLY:
Well, what you need

707
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,850
is to be abandoned
by two good friends.

708
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,200
Well, when I say good friends,
I mean bastards.

709
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,850
Look, that's what I call a breakfast,

710
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,140
~ thank you very, very much.
~ Ah, that's perfect.

711
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,250
After our winter-warming breakfast,
we were back on the road

712
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,530
and delving once more
into our pick-up trucks.

713
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,330
I'm going to be honest with you
- this is no ordinary F-150.

714
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,890
This is the
top-of-the-range Raptor model,

715
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,450
which has been beefed up,
supercharged and intercooled

716
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,050
and then renamed Velociraptor,

717
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,090
by a company called Hennessey,
makers of the Venom,

718
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,420
one of the fastest road cars
the world has ever seen.

719
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,890
So the 6.2-litre V8 that
I have under the bonnet

720
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,450
produces - ahem - 623 horsepower.

721
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,730
That's 212 more than standard.

722
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,050
And that makes it quick
- alarmingly quick.

723
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,210
ENGINE ROARS

724
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,410
Listen to that!

725
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,580
It's like a jet.

726
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,250
While Jeremy was in a
supercharged rocket ship,

727
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,130
I was riding a wave
of low-down grunt.

728
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:46,970
I have at my disposal a 6.6-litre
turbo-charged V8 diesel engine.

729
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,050
It develops 765 pound-feet of torque.

730
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,810
That's more than one of those
Supersport Bentley Continentals.

731
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,330
I also have the Z71 off-road pack,

732
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,930
which means I get a lot of
under-body strengthening,

733
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,530
beefed-up dampers and
it has as standard

734
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,210
a sophisticated four-wheel
drive system.

735
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,010
I think for International Rescue,
this is like Thunderbird 2.

736
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,940
It's the one that does all the
really serious, proper work.

737
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,290
With 52 hours gone and
International Rescue

738
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:28,330
nowhere in sight, I was resorting
to extreme measures to find food.

739
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,170
This is the snare. It just
tightens, like that.

740
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,170
I lay this on the rabbit
trail, which is here.

741
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,060
Foot, caught, rabbit - dinner.

742
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,970
There.

743
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,170
Apparently the way you bait it...

744
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,760
is with pee.

745
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,810
VELCRO RIPPING

746
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,500
UNZIPPING

747
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,090
Another layer.

748
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,410
Two...

749
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,810
UNZIPPING

750
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,850
Four...

751
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,340
UNZIPPING

752
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,520
What if a bear comes now?

753
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,970
Meanwhile, James and I, keen
to be ready for any emergency,

754
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,740
had decided to buy VITAL
rescue equipment.

755
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,970
Why? What's... What's
that bit there for?

756
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,530
It's a can opener, bottle opener.

757
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,170
~ What a...
~ You need a bottle.
~ It's a bottle opener.

758
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,250
It opens beer! Yes, we want them!

759
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,690
Is that...? That's worth
having, isn't it?

760
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,970
~ What is it?
~ Scrapy, scrapy, brushy, brushy.

761
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,330
You don't need a brush.

762
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,170
Well, OK, saw the brush off.
I can't buy just one end, can I?

763
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,930
There you go, see,
there's just one end.

764
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,380
~ But you might as well have a brush as well.
~ No, you don't need a brush.

765
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,490
WOLF HOWLS

766
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,810
I haven't made these...

767
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,450
exactly like the ones in the book

768
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,850
cos I once saw Ray
Mears make snowshoes

769
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,140
and they were more
like this. WIND HOWLS

770
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,770
Aaagh!

771
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,570
Cold!

772
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,260
REALLY COLD!

773
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,210
That's it. That's where I peed.

774
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,940
No rabbit.

775
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,050
It's all rubbish! Nothing works!

776
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,210
~ Where the
~ BLEEP
~ are they?

777
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,450
MUSIC ON RADIO: More
Than A Feeling by Boston

778
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,610
♪ More than a feeling

779
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,610
~ ♪ More than a feeling
~ When I hear that old song... ♪

780
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,220
I have my seat heater
on, it's very nice.

781
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,250
I really am starting to DEEPLY
like my Velociraptor.

782
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,490
This reminds me, and you're going
to think I'm mad but it's true,

783
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:10,050
it reminds me of a 1992
supercharged Aston Martin -

784
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,010
they're very similar.

785
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,490
I used to LOVE that car.

786
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,650
This looks like rather
an attractive small town,

787
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,220
I wouldn't mind stopping for
something like a cappuccino.

788
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,050
By mid-afternoon, there was still
no sign of Yogi and Boo-Boo.

789
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,260
So I prepared myself for
a third night in the open.

790
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,250
And if you want to write to the BBC

791
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,090
and say this is some
rare type of tree

792
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,820
and has to be preserved, you
can stick it up your arse!

793
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,330
I'm sick of the sight of this place.

794
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,140
~ I'm a television presenter
from Birmingham, not Bear
~ BLEEP
~ Grylls!

795
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,170
Despite our best efforts, James and
I were still more than 150 miles

796
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,050
from our friend and colleague.

797
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,410
Night was falling, the
roads were getting worse

798
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,570
and there was another issue.

799
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,650
Sit-rep - James May does
not like driving in the snow

800
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,850
and has now REDUCED his speed...

801
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,970
to about three.

802
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,690
To annoy HIM, as much
as he was annoying ME,

803
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,530
I decided to ignite my collapsed sun.

804
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,850
Right.

805
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,570
YELLS: CLARKSON!

806
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,130
CHUCKLES QUIETLY

807
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,690
I've never, ever encountered a light
like that on the front of a car.

808
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,610
Seriously, very funny, but could
you turn the big light off?

809
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,730
Only when you speed up.

810
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,060
~ YELLS: Turn the
~ BLEEP
~ light off!

811
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,250
It was a long, horrible
drive but mercifully,

812
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,690
when we were just ten
miles from Hammond,

813
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,140
we found a lodge where
we could spend the night.

814
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,180
And the next morning,
I came up with a plan.

815
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,970
Hammond is ten miles away

816
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,250
and 4,000ft above us. So...

817
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,770
we have a race.

818
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,780
And if you get there first,
you DON'T have to rescue him.

819
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,730
~ Come on, that's an incentive.
~ No, you're right, it is, isn't it?

820
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,210
So if you don't get there first,
you have to drive, what,

00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,530
15 hours back to Vancouver

822
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,490
with Richard Hammond
in your pick-up truck.

823
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,410
Can you imagine driving
15 hours back to Vancouver

824
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,060
with him either dead or bad-tempered?

825
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,970
~ Where the
~ BLEEP
~ are you?!

826
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,850
I peed in a bottle in my tent
last night and it felt dirty!

827
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,240
Enough!

828
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,730
With a good breakfast
under our belts,

829
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,890
James and I were planning our routes.

830
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,650
So Hammond is around there, that's
where the signal came from -

831
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:54,410
from his watch. So if I go
up what I think is Wolf Pass,

832
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,570
the corpse of Richard Hammond
will be around here somewhere.

833
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,610
It's slightly longer, but it's
only a little bit longer,

834
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,290
but I'm avoiding that massive rise
there. I'm going to go that way.

835
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,570
~ Are you ready, May?
~ I've never been more ready.

836
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:12,130

This is an interesting
race, it really is,

839
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,130
because although our
pick-up trucks...

840
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,250
appear to be the same,

841
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,240
but actually they're
not the same at all.

842
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,130
His is all about strength and torque

843
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,980
and this is all about
speed and power.

844
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,650
And then there's our driving
styles. James' is very...

845
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,290
slow and methodical
and full of maths.

846
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,170

Absolutely gorgeous scenery.

853
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,450
Hammond will have been having
a lovely time looking at this.

854
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,850
It's like being in a spa.

HE BREATHES HEAVILY

859
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,620
In the Ford, I'd decided to
use one of God's highways.

860
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,720
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!

861
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,410
Rivers, as we know, are level,
unless they're waterfalls.

862
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,620
Just hope we don't
encounter one of those.

863
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,490
There's my camera. Yeah,

864
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,050
I can now see...

865
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,770
what I'm doing.

866
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,690

Knowing that Hammond

904
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,770
I was now climbing...

905
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,380

But as we climbed past 4,000 feet,

916
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,380

00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,050
THAT was shocking!

996
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,010
I have seen Thunderbirds
and I never saw Alan

997
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,050
flying along, listening to Boston,
eating a bar of chocolate.

998
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,850
~ No, you say that...
~ Neither did I see

999
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,130
Virgil suggesting they
stop for a cappuccino,

1000
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,410
they were both focused
on the job in hand.

1001
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,730
Yes. But in that film, we did prove
that your watch system works

1002
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,970
and both James and I

1003
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,930
completely fell in love with
our pick-up trucks, didn't we?

1004
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,490
Yeah, no, this is a very good point.

1005
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,290
Because, let's be
honest, for 12 years

1006
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,890
we've looked down our noses at
big, American pick-up trucks.

1007
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,330
But having spent quite
a few days in them,

1008
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,050
we ended up completely besotted.

1009
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,370
It's the value that staggers me.

1010
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:25,810
Because American pick-up trucks are
exempt from the gas guzzler tax,

1011
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,810
they are SPECTACULARLY cheap.

1012
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,370
Yeah. I'm surprised actually

1013
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,730
there aren't more people
importing them over here.

1014
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,010
Yeah, well, I think the problem
is a car, vehicle I should say,

1015
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,570
this size wouldn't really
work in Britain.

1016
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,130
And there's another problem.
Excuse me, Hammond.

1017
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,210
I think if you put
something in the back,

1018
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,010
every time you pull up
at a set of red lights

1019
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,530
someone is going to nick it.

1020
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,530
Yeah, you're dead right.
You're dead right.

1021
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,330
But even so, I maintain my
Silverado, it was brilliant.

1022
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,210
Well, it was, James,
but let's be honest,

1023
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,930
it didn't actually reach the
top of the mountain, did it?

1024
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,530
No, I wasn't going to mention that.

1025
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,970
Actually, just before the end
it did break a driveshaft.

1026
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,210
Yeah, I did wonder if you
were going to mention that,

1027
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,530
because it wasn't IN the film

1028
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,930
In the end, neither Thunderbird
Fat nor Thunderbird Slow

1029
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,930
~ actually rescued me.
~ That is true.

1030
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,250
No, an actual rescue person
had to come and save me.

1031
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,650
And can I just talk about the four
days - FOUR DAYS - of misery

1032
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,410
I endured whilst you two
dawdled from breakfast

1033
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,410
to breakfast in your heated trucks.

1034
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,810
No, I'm sorry, there isn't time.

1035
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,290
And on that bombshell
we really must end.

1036
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,930
Thank you so much for
watching. Good night!

1037
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,330
