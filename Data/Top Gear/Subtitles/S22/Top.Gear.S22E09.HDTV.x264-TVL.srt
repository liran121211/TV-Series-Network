1
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,870
Now, I know this is a car show,

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,950
but please bear with us, because
I want to talk about this.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,150
It's one of those watches that
are worn by people who play golf

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,550
and do business.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,430
And they're always banging on about
these pins, that you can see here.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,630
Yeah. They say that if
they pull those pins out,

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,150
the watch will send
their precise position

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,470
to a team of professionals,
who will come and rescue them.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,670
So, if they're out
climbing a mountain,

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,030
or rowing across an ocean...

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,990
Which they aren't, because they're
playing golf and doing business.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,750
No, but if they were doing those
things and something went wrong,

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,990
then, thanks to their
watch, they'd be OK.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,390
Ah, but would they?

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,470
To find out, the producers
decided that one of us

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,270
should be dumped somewhere with minimal
kit, with virtually no food,

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,630
somewhere very, very remote,

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,950
to see if the system works.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,420
Well...

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,310
.. that's it.

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,040
I am now marooned here...

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,030
.. wherever the hell "here" is.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,390
Bloody hell...

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,760
My only hope now is my watch, so...

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
.. it's time.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,270
I undo this...

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,300
.. there...

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,500
.. and then, pull that bit out...

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,510
.. and that's it, done.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,430
Pulling those pins activates
a distress signal

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,350
that's picked up by a LEOSAR
low Earth polar orbit satellite,

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,110
which then forwards
my exact coordinates

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,070
to a central command centre.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,870
The team here then scramble

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,990
the nearest highly-trained
search and rescue unit,

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,000
who arrive at my location
within hours.

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,510
Sadly, however,

38
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,350
today, the scramble command
has not been sent

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
to a highly-trained search
and rescue unit.

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,830
- .. Running on petrol.
- It's a brilliant idea.

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,190
- I'm not sure the Ferrari does that.
- DEVICE BEEPS

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,870
I think it does, but I think they're
just being honest about it,

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,390
because they're recognising that

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,310
it's a means of improving
the efficiency...

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,710
Is that your bag ringing?

46
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,990
Oh, I think this is the signal
from our esteemed colleague,

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,070
- Richard Hammond.
- Is it? Where is he?
- Wait a minute.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,710
He would appear to be in... Africa.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,160
- Is it?
- Let's have a look.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,390
No, I'll think you'll
find that is... Canada.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,070
Specifically, the Rockies.

52
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,630
Crikey. Um...

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,470
Actually, that is quite serious.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,550
We really do need to get
on with this, James, so...

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,910
Excuse me?

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Could we see the pudding menu?

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,960
Right...

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,400
That bit suspends off this bit...

59
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,960
- That watch transmits for 24 hours...
- WATCH BEEPS

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,070
.. and then, that's it.

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,110
Right, so, this is the mountain,

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,190
there's my tent.

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,150
Mountain, trees, hills,
this is all we are.

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,470
There's a cameraman,
a sound recordist

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,830
and a bloke from the office --
and he's just a media luvvie.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,590
I know you think there's a five-star
hotel just down there,

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,470
but there's not.

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,820
Nothing else. There's no
survival experts here.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,550
Fact of the matter is,
I'm completely stuck

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,540
until Yogi the Bore
and Boo-Boo get here.

71
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,550
Knowing we were his only hope,

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,390
we had some important
decisions to make.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,070
"Raunchy apple fritters" sounds quite
interesting. Pancake with cheese...

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,110
James? James, James, James...

75
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,590
You know in the colonies --

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,390
Australia, South Africa,
America, Canada and so on?

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,550
- Everybody loves pick-up trucks, yes?
- Yes.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,630
Well, why don't we get a pick-up
truck to go and rescue Hammond in?

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,110
Because pick-up trucks generally
only have two seats

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,510
and there would be three of
us, when we've rescued him.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,430
Well, we get two pick-up trucks
-- one for you, one for me.

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,510
It would A, increase our
chances of finding him,

83
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,310
and B, there'd be a seat
to get him back in.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,750
- But...
- In Thunderbirds...

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,550
Inevitably, One and Two kind of
went first, didn't they? Always?

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,750
Yeah.

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,390
Alan and... No, not Alan.
Who drove Thunderbird One?

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,950
- Scott.
- Virgil.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,270
- No, Virgil was Two.
- Was he Two?

90
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,670
Scott was One,

91
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,670
Virgil was Two, Alan was
Three, Gordon was Four...

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,060
Gordon!

93
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,590
In Canada, the temperature
was a bitter minus ten,

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,180
so I urgently needed some warmth.

95
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,360
What would have been wrong
with giving me a lighter?

96
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,120
Can't get my fire lit. Cold beans.

97
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,230
They're a bit frozen in the middle.

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,710
'Having finished our lunch...'

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,630
I'm not sure about the red, you know?

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,780
'We went to book some
flights to Vancouver.'

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,710
OK, you've actually just missed
the last flight out today.

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,750
- Have we?
- Yeah.
- Oh, what a rotten bit of luck.

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,190
Shouldn't we get another drink?

104
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,470
There's a Delta one that leads
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,350
I don't like Delta's seat upholstery.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,510
Would you go from Manchester?

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,510
Manchester? No, you
know, this is the BBC.

108
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,630
I think it would be idiotic
to go to Manchester.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,190
- I mean, that would be just stupid.
- There's Lufthansa...

110
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,150
Er, stewardesses wear trousers.

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,230
- There's one from Gatwick,
which goes via Calgary...
- Gatwick?

112
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,870
- He doesn't like Gatwick.
- I hate Gatwick.

113
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
WOLF HOWLS

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,390
Out there, somewhere...

115
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,280
.. there are bears...

116
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,720
.. as many as 180,000 black bears.

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,960
I can't remember what it was
-- about 15,000 grizzlies?

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
Freezing.

119
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,790
In the morning, I was cold and
exhausted from lack of sleep --

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,440
but most of all, I was anxious.

121
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,150
- Any minute now.
- WATCH BEEPS

122
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,100
Any minute.

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,420
I mean, they've had 24 hours.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
I mean, 24 hours?

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,640
You can get anywhere in the
world in 24 hours, surely?

126
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,710
Where the hell are they?

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,500
JET ENGINES ROAR

128
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,550
- I can't remember...
- James?

129
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,350
- We've stopped beeping.
- Well, yeah. It would.
- Why would it?

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,270
Cos the watch thing only transmits
the distress signal for 24 hours.

131
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,520
Then the battery runs out.

132
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,630
- Seriously?
- Well, yeah. It's only...

133
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,710
- Well, did you make a note of where he was?
- No, I didn't.

134
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
You've got the thing.

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,030
Well, I remember he was...
He was on something called...

136
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,550
I think it was "Wolf Mountain"
and you go up "Bear Pass".

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,510
Sounds GRIZZLY.

138
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,830
LAUGHTER

139
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,230
That was a good joke.

140
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,560
Do you know, actually, the biggest
problem is not bears and wolves...

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,470
- Cougars. Loads of cougars.
- Well, that's all right, then.

142
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,470
No, not that sort of cougar.

143
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,590
[JEREMY GROWLS] That sort of cougar.

144
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,240
Oh, you mean like a big cat thing?

145
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,510
As I couldn't move from the spot

146
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,510
where the watch had transmitted
the distress signal,

147
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,480
I was hard at work trying to make
my life here more comfortable.

148
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,910
I want somewhere to sit.

149
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,560
I can't sit on the snow,
so I'm building a shelter.

150
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,310
Spark, you [BLEEP!]

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,590
There we go.

152
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,240
We have fire.

153
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,190
And with my supplies dwindling,

154
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,840
I also needed to think about food.

155
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,150
Animals for food...

156
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,830
.. guinea pigs.

157
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,390
All animals can be a
source of nourishment.

158
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,560
A few, including worms and insects,
can be collected with little skill.

159
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,590
I'm bored, I'm cold, I'm unhappy,

160
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,950
I'm hungry, I'm scared...

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,910
Agh!

162
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,310
And I don't want to be wearing
a hat, just for a minute!

163
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,500
Ah!

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,990
To alleviate the boredom
and stave off the cold,

165
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,360
I tried to make some SAS-style
pine needle tea.

166
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,510
Agh!

167
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,030
Ow, ow!

168
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,870
Ow!

169
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,260
Where are they?! Just where?

170
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,510
'Unfortunately, we were a little
bit delayed at Vancouver airport.'

171
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,630
Yes, of course.

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,590
'But eventually, we made
it to the car park,

173
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,830
'where our pick-up truck rescue

- Yeah?

176

That's not a light, that's
a collapsed sun, isn't it?

177
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,310
Never mind that, look --

178
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,710
mine actually comes up to my nipples.

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,950
I didn't realise it was... Do you
know what the other thing is?

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,670
If I actually find Richard Hammond,
I'm not going to see him, and I?

181
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,230
I'll just run straight over him.

182
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,230
Have you noticed something
else about mine?

183
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,950
This entire vehicle...

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,230
is a transportation device
for its own spare wheel, look!

185
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,830
That's all the back is for!

186
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,430
- That's really stupid.
Look at the size of it!
- Look at it!

187
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,470
Anyway, we've got
everything we need here.

188
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,870
I've got a big, warm coat,
I've got a massive car,

189
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,510
a rough idea of where
Richard Hammond is...

190
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,270
Yeah, so let's go...

191
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,630
into Vancouver, get a hotel,
good night's rest,

192
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,820
get rid of this jet lag.

They've got to get here tomorrow...

in The Wolf Of Wall Street,

200
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,470
one of my favourite films
of the modern age.

201
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,790
She's now in a new film and she's
brought along her co-star,

202
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,870
so please welcome Margot Robbie

203
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,510
and a man called Will Smith!

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,990
Oh, heavens above!

206
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,990
Look what we've got for you!

207
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,030
Yeah, we got you as well.

208
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,670
Good to see you, good to see you.

209
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,230
Good to see you both.
I'll go round here.

210
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,020
- Thanks for having us.
- And relax.

211
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,820
Have a seat.

212
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,270
Have a seat.

213
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,950
- This is fantastic!
- Isn't this fantastic?
- This is great.

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,870
I was almost going to begin by
apologising for the trailers.

215
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,750
- The trailers? Oh, those trailers, yeah.
- They're really nice.

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,150
- Will set his bar very high
with trailers though, so...
- Really?

217
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,790
Yeah, his trailer is pimp.

218
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,150
Yeah, I'm very serious
about the trailer.

219
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,710
The trailer, it has to be...

220
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,350
You've got to hook it up, you've
got to have a stereo system...

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,590
Yours had mirrors on the roof.

222
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,350
LAUGHTER

223
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,830
MOUTHS: No, it didn't.

224
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,230
I'm not insinuating anything,
I'm just saying...

225
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,870
That's going to get in trouble.

226
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,590
That's going to get into trouble.

227
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,580
Already in trouble,
where my mind's gone.

228
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,790
- Really, not that long ago,
you were in Neighbours.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,030
What interests me about Neighbours,
which is an Aussie TV show...

230
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,910
- I know what Neighbours is, man!
- Don't pretend you know!

231
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,230
I know what Neighbours is...

232
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,230
Two days ago, they asked him
what show I did in Australia --

233
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,750
a very popular show -- and you
said it started with "C"...

234
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,630
- I couldn't remember the name...
- There's no "C" in it.

235
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,230
I just can't see Will Smith
finishing a day at work going,

236
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,550
"Do you know, I think
I'll watch Neighbours."

237
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,310
- "6.30, my show's on!"
- Russell Crowe started in that, didn't he?

238
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,030
- Guy Pearce was another
one, Kylie's another one...
- Yeah, yeah.

239
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,790
And I always wondered, do
you know Coronation Street?

240
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,950
- Because that's produced literally...
- Yeah, I know all those shows, man!

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,760
- You don't. And...
- I've got the DVDs and everything!

242
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,150
- It's just unbelievable.
- I have all this, the... the...

243
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,950
Coronation Street and
Neighbours and all those.

244
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,310
EastEnders, yeah.

245
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,110
- Now, you're over here,
obviously, to promote a film.
- Yes.

246
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,350
It's called Focus, but it isn't
about the small Ford hatchback...

247
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,670
which disappointed
some people in here.

248
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,350
It's a love story between you
two, which is rather sweet.

249
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,550
- Yeah.
- It's interesting, it's...

250
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,910
My character plays a conman,

251
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,910
a master thief

252
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,710
and part of being a master
thief is, he's a liar.

253
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,510
And he meets Margot's
character, Jess,

254
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,990
and falls madly in love

255
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,390
and realises quickly that lying and
loving don't go together too well.

256
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,230
- They go together often...
- LAUGHTER

257
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,950
.. but they don't go together well.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,670
- I believe we have a clip,
which we're going to show now.
- Really? OK.

MUSIC: It's A Man's, Man's,
Man's World by James Brown

260
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,550
- Are you working an angle?
- I wouldn't trust him, if I were you.

261
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,750
But I should trust you?

262
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,950
- You've got a problem.
- I am going to kill you.

263
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,030
Kill me later.

264
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,950
- You lost everyone's money -- my money!
- Hey!

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,670
- Wow.
- Wow.

266
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,310
- This is your mess.
- I think you're losing it.

267
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,510
- Why'd you come up here?
- Professional curiosity.

268
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,760
And I like boobs. I figured
it was a win-win.

269
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,590
CRASH

270
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,030
At the end of the day,
this is a game of focus.

271
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,960
APPLAUSE

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,070
Did you notice when
I had my shirt off?

273
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,590
You noticed, didn't you?
Did you see that shot?

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,990
Yes, that's what everyone is
aware of in that trailer...

275
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,830
- I just want to know if you saw the shot!
- Margo had her trousers off.

276
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,910
- Oh, yes. You saw that(!)
- Slightly more distracting...

277
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,070
I get that, I get that.

278
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,550
And I've seen you with no
shirt on a million times,

279
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,470
but I've never seen... Well, I have
seen Margot with no trousers on.

280
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,430
LAUGHTER

281
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,350
I've never seen...

282
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,950
- This just got awkward.
- It did.

283
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,470
Now, one of the things that
make it even more awkward is,

284
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,470
you filmed quite a lot of
the movie in Argentina...

285
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,070
Yes, yeah.

286
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,070
LAUGHTER

287
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,790
How did that go for you?

288
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,710
For me? It was good,
it was good, man.

289
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,270
Argentina is fantastic.

290
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,550
- Is it(?)
- LAUGHTER

291
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,750
- What's wrong with Argentina?
- What's wrong with Argentina? What happened?

292
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,190
Every [BLEEP] thing!

293
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,280
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

294
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,750
- No, but it is... I enjoyed
it and best of luck with it.
- Thank you.

295
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,910
- When does it open?
- 27th.
- 27th.

296
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,950
Is it the 27th here?

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,270
- Yes!
- Yeah.
- OK, yes.

298
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,950
Now, we've got to get on to cars,

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,270
- cos you grew up on a farm in Australia...
- Mm.

300
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,070
.. so you, presumably, have
been driving since you were 0,

301
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,230
- because it's such a vast area.
- Yeah, it's huge.

302
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,630
In our family, the rule was, you
could drive as soon as you could...

303
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,190
physically reach the pedals.

304
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,950
You could have the car on your own
when you reached double digits.

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,630
- So, when you were ten,
you were allowed to...
- Wow.

306
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,390
All the children at home are going...

307
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,390
And I remember being nine years
old and arguing with the parents,

308
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,670
being like, "Guys, this is
absurd. I'm not, like..."

309
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,630
And they're like, "No, you're nine.
You have to wait another year."

310
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,030
I was like, "This is... I can't
believe this! This is ridiculous."

311
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,830
- Have you been out to the outback?
- No, no, no.

312
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,270
I feel like you'd fit
right in. You got it.

313
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,070
See, it's a racial thing.
You went racial.

314
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,240
- Yeah, that's what it's about(!)
- LAUGHTER

315
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,310
So, what was your first car?

316
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,510
It was a candy apple red IROC-Z --

317
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,830
a Camaro.

318
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,710
Apparently, you don't
have those here.

319
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,270
No, we don't, no. We have...
What's the word? Taste.

320
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,800
LAUGHTER

321
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,950
I was thinking, maybe this
indicates you don't know

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,790
anything about cars -- then I started
to look in some of the lyrics.

323
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,430
- Are you familiar with the
lyrics of the early songs?
- Oh, jeez.

324
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,070
- I wasn't born.
- In a song called Gettin' Jiggy Wit It...

325
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,720
- Yes.
- I've heard of that. Yeah, I know that one.

326
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,630
I don't recognise that one.

327
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,510
He's got "850iS..."

328
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,390
"850iS if you need a lift."

329
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,070
"Who's the kid in the drop?"

330
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,350
"Who else? Will Smith."

331
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,030
They're all there. Now, "drop"
I presume means "drop top"...

332
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,110
Drop top, yes.

333
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,150
- They never did a drop top 850.
- They...

334
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,040
LAUGHTER

335
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,840
- It's a small...
- APPLAUSE

336
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,990
See, now here...

337
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,310
He thinks he knows everything,
he thinks he knows everything.

338
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,830
In the United States, we do a thing
where we customise our cars(!)

339
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,280
LAUGHTER

340
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,990
- Can I just give you another one?
- This is brilliant.
- Just Cruisin'.

341
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,830
"The Maestro."

342
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,110
- You know the next bit?
- Yes, yes.
- "Nice flow...

343
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,190
"Nice flow, hot like nitro.

344
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,990
- "Cool as...
- Cool as ice, though."

345
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,310
- It's a dichotomy.
- Do you know what a Maestro is?
- Oh, you've got one?

346
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,720
- There you go.
- LAUGHTER

347
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,560
Oh, my God!

348
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,390
It is so awkward for me
to hear you say my lyrics.

349
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,870
LAUGHTER

350
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,590
- I'll bet.
- It's making my eyes water!

351
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,630
We've done enough of this now.
We want to get on to your laps.

352
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,990
- OK, yeah.
- How did you enjoy it out there?
- It was really fun.

353
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,110
- It was really nerve-racking,
but it was really fun.
- Was it?
- Yeah.

354
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,630
It was fantastic. I've never...

355
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,870
- In the United States, the
stick is on the other side.
- Yeah.

356
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,390
So, having to drive and do it
with the other hand, it was...

357
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,950
That's an advantage for you, of course --
because you're used to driving like this.

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,550
- Which is why he's obviously
mentioning it right now.
- Yeah, he's already starting...

359
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,950
He's like, "In case he
beats me on the laps,

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,910
- "it's the whole stick-side thing..."
- In case her time was better.
- OK.

361
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,350
Margot, you went first and...

362
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,030
Well, there was a bit of an off.

363
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,870
Crashed.

364
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,550
Who'd like to see Margot's lift?

365
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,430
I said specifically, "Let's not
let Will know that that happened."

366
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,590
LAUGHTER

367
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,190
- Let's have a look. Come
on, let's play the tape.
- Oh, good.

368
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,470
Oh, whoa -- it's Chicago.
It's understeer on Chicago.

369
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,710
MARGOT YELPS

370
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,910
- Ooh! Oh!
- It's Ian, it's Ian!

371
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,430
It's Ian the cameraman.

372
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,630
- Sorry!
- LAUGHTER

373
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,830
And he's dead.

374
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
APPLAUSE

375
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,870
- Margot, we have a little...
- I am sorry about that.

376
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,350
Relax, we've got a little
present for you.

377
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,070
- It's the landing light unit.
- LAUGHTER

378
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,830
You can take that home, as a souvenir
of your trip to Top Gear.

379
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm so sorry!

380
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,190
- Right. Now, we've got both your
laps to have a look at, so...
- OK.

381
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,230
- .. ladies first.
- Ladies first, yeah.
- Let's have a look at your lap.

382
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,020
This is going to end in a fist fight.

383
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,270
- Right, here we go.
- ENGINE REVS

BRAKES SCREECH

385
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,030
Good, clean, aggressive start.

386
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,160
Up to third...

387
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,990
Let's have a look at this.
Good dab of the breaks.

388
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,790
It feels so much faster in the clip.

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,190
Everybody says it, but the
slower you look, weirdly...

390
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,710
Actually, I don't know. There's
a lot of understeer there.

391
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,990
That's ballsy.

392
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,110
Oh, God!

393
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,710
Here we go, we're going to make
it without running over Ian...

394
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,270
Oh, waving to Ian! There's a
little wave there, that's nice.

395
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,590
That was a "Sorry, Ian".

396
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,630
Don't brake, don't
brake, don't brake...

397
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,430
"Don't brake, don't brake!"

398
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,870
BRAKES SCREECH

399
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,430
- You do look like you're
concentrating in there.
- Yeah.

400
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,670
Trying not to hit anyone this time.

401
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
This is good. I'm liking
the look of this.

402
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,150
MARGOT SIGHS

403
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,920
- Right, coming up to the fastest bit.
- Foot down, foot down, foot down.

404
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,040
Confidence, that was. That
was the look of confidence.

405
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,790
- Get through the tyres, yes.
- Whoo!
- That does look quick, though.

406
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,670
- That was the fun run. I liked that.
- Second to last corner.

407
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,990
- This is what normally catches people out.
- Yeah, that's the one.

408
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,430
Through there easily,
through Gambon...

409
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,630
More understeer! A lot of understeer
and across the line. There we are.

410
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,800
APPLAUSE

411
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,920
And now...

412
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,270
- That was pretty... That was strong.
- It is strong, Mr Will Smith.

413
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,030
- Yeah, nah, but everything
was on the left for me...
- Yeah, yeah(!)

414
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,150
- Any more?
- I had back surgery, like three days ago.

415
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
LAUGHTER

416
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,990
Who'd like to see the lap with the
poor man with the back surgery?

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
CHEERING

418
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,350
Let's have a look. Here we go.

- BRAKES SCREECH
- Whoa, that was some revs!

420
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,560
- Yup.
- Whoo!

421
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,710
- All right, this is the one.
- Did you do a few practices?

422
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,070
Yeah, I did a few practice laps.

423
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,430
That's a hard bit of braking
mid-corner, there.

424
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,600
I'll tell you what, though --
that car bullied GM's finest.

425
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,950
Powering through, feeling good.

426
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,600
There we go. This is the spiritual
successor of the IROC-Z....

427
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,150
I'm on the wall now. They're
putting me on the wall.

428
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,080
My name, with all of the
fastest times on this track.

429
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,390
That is a confident man right there.

430
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,310
It's actually lovely conditions
for fast times, this.

431
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,830
Keeping it in the lines nicely.

432
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,150
Yes, just like watching Daniel
Ricciardo all over again.

433
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,400
This is the one that
makes my children proud.

434
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,630
Keeping in there -- no
braking, flat-out, yeah?

435
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,350
- No braking, flat-out.
- Good man.

436
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,510
Yeah, that's looking very tidy.

437
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,390
Second to last corner,
you have any problems?

438
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,630
No, that is neat. Very neat
-- and through Gambon...

439
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,990
Still on all four wheels,
unlike some people --

440
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,070
- and there we are, across the line!
- APPLAUSE

441
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,590
- That was nice.
- So much fun.

442
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,790
Well done, you two.

443
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,030
Where do you think you've
come on the board?

444
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,350
Uh...

445
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,310
I'd be really psyched if I get
on the board, to be honest.

446
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,670
You can't not be on it,
because trust me --

447
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,390
Jack Whitehall, Ed Sheeran...

448
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,470
So, there's space down there
for me? OK. I want 1.52.

449
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,270
1.52? And Will?

450
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,670
Uh... Well, I want, like, 1.22...

451
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,200
LAUGHTER

452
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,830
You asked what think I did.

453
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,750
I think I might be in the 1.50 zone,

454
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,110
right in there.

455
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,350
- Somewhere with the Hugh
Bonneville, Tom Huddleston...
- I felt like I...

456
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,390
These were wet times. Let's have
a look, shall we? Let's have a look.

457
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,830
- I've got the times here.
- OK.

458
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,150
- I'm going to do you first, Will.
- OK. Oh, jeez.

459
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,830
- This is really exciting.
- Will Smith...
- This is very exciting.

460
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,750
- You did a 1...
- That's a good start.

461
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,390
- .. 40...
- Ooh.

462
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,070
.. 7... Whoa.

463
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,230
- .. 2. OK, yeah.
- And that isn't bad at all.

464
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,990
APPLAUSE

465
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,110
That puts you...

466
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,160
- Wow. OK, yeah.
- That's really great.

467
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,470
- We like that.
- That is not bad at all.

468
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,830
And now, we must get
on to your co-star.

469
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,230
- OK.
- Oh...

470
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,590
If you beat me, this is
your last day on the tour.

LAUGHTER

472
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,230
I will never work again after this.

473
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,510
It's Leo, Will Smith and then, TV.

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,200
LAUGHTER

475
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,990

- Ooh!
- AUDIENCE GASPS

478
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,710

LAUGHTER

She'd better not, she'd better not...

482
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,320
- .. 1!
- Oh!
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

483
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm not making it up!

484
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,910
I'm sorry!

485
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
[BLEEP!]

486
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,660
This was a bad idea.

487
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,310
It's like the Academy Awards,

488
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,560
where you've got to clap
for the other person.

489
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,030
- I don't know what to say now.
- I actually can't believe that.

490
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,230
- Both of you have done amazing times.
- Oh, my God!

491
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,790
There was a tenth in it,

492
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,230
neither of you have got anything
to be ashamed about.

493
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,670
Oh, no -- one of us has something
to be ashamed about!

494
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,030
LAUGHTER

495
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,750
- I was trying to end on a really high note...
- No, no...

496
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,070
.. coming up with some nice things...

497
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,920
But you're right.

498
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,630
Ladies and gentlemen, I
think you'll all agree,

499
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,510
this has been an absolute joy.
Will Smith and Margot Robbie!

500
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

501
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,910
Now, last year, McLaren
gave us the astonishing P1

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,830
and Porsche gave us the
equally fantastic 918,

503
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,830
but we've always known that there
is another hybrid supercar coming.

504
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,310
Well, it's not coming any more.

505
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,910
It's here, it's the one you've
all been waiting for

506
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,990
and I have been driving it.

507
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,000
The Ferrari "The Ferrari"!

508
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,950
McLaren and Porsche may believe

509
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,080
they've created good-looking
cars in the P1 and the 918...

510
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,550
.. but I think they need to get
their pencil cases out again,

511
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,560
because this is what a
supercar should look like.

512
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,230
And this is what a supercar
should sound like.

513
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,080
ENGINE THRUMS AND REVS

514
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,430
No miserable V8s or puny
little turbochargers --

515
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
that is Ferrari's greatest hit.

516
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,670
The sound of 12 cylinders
properly arranged in a V.

517
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,520
Molto grazie!

518
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,590
And then, there's the price --

519
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,140
LaFerrari has the other
two licked there, as well.

520
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,510
The Porsche 918 -- £646,000.

521
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,670
The McLaren P1 -- £866,000.

522
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,460
The LaFerrari...

523
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,550
£1,000,000!

524
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,540
That's a proper price
-- no mucking about!

525
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,070
'And there's more.'

526
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,630
Pinky and Perky have
been at great pains

527
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,520
to explain just how clever the
McLaren and the Porsche are.

528
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,920
Well, this is also very clever.

529
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,430
'It's built from not one, but four
different types of carbon fibre

530
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,070
'to keep it as light as possible.

531
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,200
'In fact, it's lighter than
the Porsche or the McLaren.

532
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,470
'The driver's seat is fixed

533
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,590
'and instead it's the wheel
and pedals that move.

534
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,310
'This means you don't
need a seat mechanism,

535
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,790
'which means the driver can sit
lower, the roof can be lower

536
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,780
'and that drops the
centre of gravity...

537
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,470
'.. to the benefit of cornering.

538
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,860
'Then we come to the engine.'

539
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,630
Like the McLaren and the Porsche,
LaFerrari is a hybrid.

540
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,950
It has a petrol engine AND an electric
motor to drive the wheels.

541
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,630
But, whereas the other two

542
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,270
can be driven on electric power
alone like a Toyota Prius,

543
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,070
the Ferrari can't because,

544
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,040
Ferrari say, "We are not
interested in electric cars."

545
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,390
'Instead, the battery and
electric motor combination

546
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,030
'works a bit like the kinetic energy
recovery system in an F1 car.

547
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,430
'In very simple terms,

548
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,710
'it captures energy that's
normally wasted --

549
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,270
'during braking, for example -'

550
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,990
'and keeps it for when you need it.'

551
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,950
The electric motor,
the petrol engine --

552
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,030
they're all working together
all of the time.

553
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,280
You cannot separate them.

554
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,840
This is simply a 950
horsepower supercar.

555
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,590
'But, despite the racing technology,

556
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,640
'you don't find yourself in a world
of austere track car misery.'

557
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,910
You've got the sat-nav,
the air conditioning.

558
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,550
It's perfectly comfortable.

559
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,160
Actually, it's very civilised.

560
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,430
'However, this is also
supposed to be the fastest

561
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,150
'and most exciting road
car Ferrari has ever made.

562
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,800
'And to find out how exciting,
we must come here...

563
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,700
'.. Ferrari's Fiorano test track.

564
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,030
'To prancing horse fans,
this is the sacred tarmac

565
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,400
'where the company's greatest
F1 cars were born.

566
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,710
'But, when I rolled up, sacred wasn't
the word that came to mind.'

567
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,560
THUNDER RUMBLES

568
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,550
Oh, cock!

569
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,630
'After two hours of dithering
on the start line...'

570
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,080
- WHIRRING
- Pedals -- a little bit further away.

571
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,590
No, that's too far away. Hang on.

572
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,280
'.. the track was finally dry
enough for me to have a go.'

573
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,560
Red, red, red...

574
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,240
God's holy trousers!

575
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,990
Strewth, I'm already
at the first bend.

576
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,620
Lots of brakes.

577
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,200
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is 950 horsepower for you.

578
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,990
And while we're at it,

579
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,670
950 horsepower is a slam dunk
Top Trump over the other two.

580
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,680
And so is the top speed -- 218mph.

581
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,430
'But it's not just the amount of
horsepower that's impressive --

582
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,030
'it's the way it's served up.'

583
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,590
Even if you're a bit
clumsy or a bit timid,

584
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,590
as I am being on this one, you've
still got that enormous grunt.

585
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,440
It just hits you like
a runaway train.

586
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,470
That's the KERS system working.
That's exactly what it's for.

587
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,310
'On top of that, Ferrari has
remembered that not everyone

588
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,080
'who'll drive this car will be
called Sebastian or Vettel.'

589
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,470
Because LaFerrari will go quite
a lot faster than you can think,

590
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,030
Ferrari do quite a lot of thinking
for you. It has, for example,

591
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,030
a very sophisticated
traction control system

592
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,630
based on Formula 1 tech.

593
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,070
And you can leave it turned on.

594
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,720
Why not? It stops you crashing.

595
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,270
'LaFerrari also bristles
with active aerodynamics.

596
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,950
'That's not new on a supercar,

597
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,510
'but this system is controlled
by 21 computers, which means,

598
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,670
'according to the Ferrari eggheads,

599
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,630
'even I should be able to take
Fiorano's notorious turn seven...

600
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,220
'flat out.'

601
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,030
Active aerodynamics, here we go!

602
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,910
Don't bottle it, don't bottle it!

603
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,440
Ho-ho-ho!

604
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,600
It works! Look at that!

605
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,640
The faster you go,
the better it works!

606
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,630
I mean, like Jennifer's McLaren,
it is pure rear-wheel drive,

607
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,780
and that is quite intimidating,
but it's not a widow maker.

608
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Oh, my God!

609
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,800
Whoa, yes!

610
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
Wahey! Sorry.

611
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,750
Let's just slow this down a bit.

612
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,190
Richard Hammond, he
says the Porsche 918,

613
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,670
that's the one that takes the
hybrid supercar the furthest,

614
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,630
it's the most responsible,
if you like.

615
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,470
Jeremy likes the P1 because
he says it takes an idea

616
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,390
that was essentially
an environmental one

617
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,680
and uses it to make the
supercar more dramatic.

618
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,160
'In this respect, the Ferrari
is more like the McLaren.'

619
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,240
Except for two things --
LaFerrari looks better...

620
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,980
.. and I reckon it IS better.

621
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,440
This is the greatest
car in the world!

622
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,110
Now, tonight, Jeremy and I are using
two huge American pick-up trucks

623
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,190
to rescue Richard Hammond,
who's been abandoned

624
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,390
- LAUGHTER
- on a freezing cold mountain top

625
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,790
in the Canadian Rockies.

626
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,150
We pick up the action after
we'd had a good night's rest

627
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
in a downtown Vancouver hotel.

628
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,230
'We set off before dawn, not knowing
exactly where Hammond was,

629
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,510
'but we did know he was
at least 400 miles away,

630
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,400
'so we had plenty of time to
get to know our vehicles.'

631
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:01,230
I am driving a Ford
F-150 pick-up truck,

632
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,190
which is by miles the
best-selling vehicle in America.

633
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,110
Ford sells one of these
things every 35 seconds

634
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,470
and that's only in America, remember.

635
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,060
35 seconds!

636
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,870
If you were to park every
F-150 that's ever been made

637
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,310
since 1948 side by side
-- not end to end,

638
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,550
side by side -- the line would
stretch round the Equator...

639
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
twice!

640
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,750
'The reason it sells so well
is simple -- it's cheap.'

641
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,070
You can have an F-150 with an
automatic gearbox, cruise control,

642
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,630
air conditioning and
a 350 horsepower...

643
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,150
AMERICAN ACCENT: .. V8 motor

644
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,470
for the equivalent of £20,000.

645
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,760
That's what we pay in Europe
for a Vauxhall Astra diesel.

646
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,040
'By comparison, my pick-up
truck is a sales disaster.'

647
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,870
What I'm driving here,
viewers, the Silverado --

648
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,430
the Chevrolet Silverado -- is the
second-best-selling pick-up truck.

649
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,080
They only manage to shift
one of these every minute.

650
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm amazed Chevrolet
are still in business.

651
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,070
'Meanwhile, very far away, my third
day on the mountain was beginning.'

652
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,350
I didn't sleep last night,
I was cold all night.

653
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,230
I'm going to have to
get more firewood.

654
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,110
The thought of that, swinging
that axe AGAIN...

655
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,790
It's probably a good diet, this.

656
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,750
You'll see it on This
Morning at some point.

657
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,110
"Well, what you need is to be
abandoned by two good friends.

658
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,860
"Well, when I say 'good
friends', I mean 'bastards'."

659
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,150
- Look!
- That's what I call a breakfast.

660
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,520
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, that's perfect.

661
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,550
'After our winter-warming breakfast,
we were back on the road

662
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,830
'and delving once more
into our pick-up trucks.'

663
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,270
I'm going to be honest with you.

664
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,310
This is no ordinary F-150.

665
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,190
This is the top of the
range Raptor model,

666
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,710
which has been beefed up,
supercharged and intercooled

667
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,710
and then renamed VelociRaptor
by a company called Hennessey,

668
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,430
makers of the Venom,

669
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,160
one of the fastest road cars
the world has ever seen.

670
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,110
So, the 6.2 litre V8 I have under
the bonnet produces -- ahem --

671
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,070
623 horsepower.

672
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,520
That's 212 more than standard.

673
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,150
And that makes it quick.
Alarmingly quick!

674
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,550
ENGINE ROARS

675
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,470
Listen to THAT!

676
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,260
It's like a jet.

677
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,510
'While Jeremy was in a
supercharged rocket ship,

678
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,430
'I was riding a wave
of lowdown grunt.'

679
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,790
I have at my disposal a 6.6 litre
turbo-charged V8 diesel engine.

680
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,710
It develops 765 pound-feet of torque.

681
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,800
That's more than one of those
Supersports Bentley Continentals!

682
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,670
I also have the Z71 Off-Road Package,

683
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,750
which means I get a lot of underbody
strengthening, beefed-up dampers

684
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,110
and it has, as standard,

685
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,630
a sophisticated four-wheel
drive system.

686
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,270
I think, for International Rescue,
this is like Thunderbird 2.

687
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,680
It's the one that does all the
really serious, proper work.

688
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,990
'With 52 hours gone

689
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,750
'and International Rescue
nowhere in sight,

690
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,470
'I was resorting to extreme
measures to find food.'

691
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,470
This is the snare.

692
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,550
It just tightens like that.

693
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,190
I lay this on the rabbit
trail, which is here.

694
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,150
Foot -- caught, rabbit -- dinner.

695
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,000
There! Apparently, the way
you bait it is with pee.

696
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,030
VELCRO UNFASTENING

697
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,520
ZIP OPENS

698
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,640
Another layer... Two...

699
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,520
Four...

700
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,240
What if a bear comes now?

701
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,510
'Meanwhile, James and I, keen
to be ready for any emergency,

702
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,120
'had decided to buy vital
rescue equipment.'

703
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,430
- What's that bit there for?
- A can opener. A bottle opener.
- What...

704
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,550
- It's a bottle opener.
- It opens beer. Yes! We want them.

705
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,670
- That's worth having, isn't it?
- What is it?

706
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,710
- Scrapey-scrapey, brushy-brushy.
- We don't need a brush.

707
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,510
Well, OK, saw the brush off.
I can't buy just one end, can I?

708
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,070
No, no, see, there's just one end.

709
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,230
Yeah, but you might as
well have a brush as well.

710
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,510
No, you don't need a brush.

711
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,630
WOLF HOWLS

712
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,790
I haven't made these exactly
like the ones in the book

713
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,270
cos I once saw Ray
Mears make snowshoes

714
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,660
and they were more like this.

715
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,870
Ahhh! Cold!

716
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,760
REALLY COLD!

717
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,670
That's it -- that's where I peed.

718
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,640
No rabbit.

719
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,840
It's all rubbish! Nothing works!

720
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,390
Where the [BLEEP] are they?

721
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,080
MUSIC: More Than A Feeling by Boston

722
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,150
I have my seat heater
on. It's very nice.

723
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,310
I really am starting to deeply
like my VelociRaptor.

724
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,150
This reminds me -- and you're
going to think I'm mad,

725
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,390
but it's true -- it reminds me of
a 1992 supercharged Aston Martin.

726
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,910
They're very similar.
I used to LOVE that car.

727
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,270
This looks like rather
an attractive small town.

728
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,320
I wouldn't mind stopping for
something like a cappuccino.

729
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,190
'By mid-afternoon, there was still
no sign of Yogi and Boo-Boo,

730
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,240
'so I prepared myself for
a third night in the open.'

731
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,150
And if you want to write
to the BBC and say,

732
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,550
"This is some rare type of
tree and has to be preserved",

733
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,000
you can stick it up your arse.

734
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,550
Sick of the sight of this place.

735
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,760
I'm a television presenter from
Birmingham, not Bear [BLEEP] Grylls.

736
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,710
Despite our best efforts,

737
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,350
James and I were still more than 150
miles from our friend and colleague.

738
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,910
Night was falling, the
roads were getting worse

739
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,150
and there was another issue.

740
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,870
Sitrep -- James May does
not like driving in the snow

741
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,590
and has now reduced his
speed to about three.

742
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,750
To annoy him as much
as he was annoying me,

743
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,430
I decided to ignite my collapsed sun.

744
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,840
Right.

745
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,880
CLARKSON!

746
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,590
I have never, ever encountered
a light like that

747
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,630
- on the front of a car.
- Seriously, very funny,

748
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,910
but could you turn the big light off?

749
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,030
Only when you speed up.

750
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,550
Turn the [BLEEP] light off!

751
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,990
It was a long, horrible drive

752
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,710
but, mercifully, when we were
just ten miles from Hammond,

753
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,920
we found a lodge where
we could spend the night.

754
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,600
And, the next morning,
I came up with a plan.

755
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,790
Hammond is ten miles away
and 4,000 feet above us,

756
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,830
so we have a race,

757
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,920
and, if you get there first,
you don't have to rescue him.

758
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,470
Come on, that's an incentive.

759
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,630
No, you're right, it is, isn't it?

760
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,310
So, if you don't get there first,
you have to drive, what?

761
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,630
15 hours back to Vancouver

762
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,750
with Richard Hammond
in your pick-up truck.

763
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,630
Can you imagine driving 15 hours
back to Vancouver with him

764
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,200
either dead or bad-tempered?

765
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,950
Where the [BLEEP] are you?

766
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I peed in a bottle in my tent
last night and it felt dirty!

767
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,460
Enough!

768
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,990
With a good breakfast
under our belts,

769
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,270
James and I were planning our routes.

770
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,390
So, Hammond is around there.

771
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,110
That's where the signal
came from from his watch,

772
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,670
so, if I go up what
I think is Wolf Pass,

773
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,230
the corpse of Richard Hammond
will be around here somewhere.

774
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,830
It's slightly longer, but it's
only a little bit longer,

775
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,150
but I'm avoiding that massive rise.

776
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,550
I'm going to go that way.

777
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,950
You ready, mate?

778
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,750
I've never been more ready.

779
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,360
Three, two, one -- begin!

780
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,590
This is an interesting
race, it really is,

781
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,240
because, although our pick-up
trucks appear to be the same...

782
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,230
.. but, actually, they're
not the same at all.

783
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,590
His is all about strength and torque

784
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,030
and this is all about
speed and power.

785
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,030
And, then, there's
our driving styles.

786
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,590
James's is very slow and
methodical and full of maths,

787
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,430
mine's more sort of...

788
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,950
ENGINE REVS

789
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,100
.. put your foot down
and hope for the best.

790
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,870
Traction control is on.

791
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,630
Thumbs outside the wheel. That's
the other off-road tip.

792
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,590
Absolutely gorgeous scenery.

793
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,670
Hammond will have been having
a lovely time looking at this.

794
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,990
It's like being at a spa.

795
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,520
[BLEEP.]

796
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,680
You are going on there.

797
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,600
In the Ford, I'd decided to
use one of God's highways.

798
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,510
Rivers, as we know, are level

799
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,270
unless they're waterfalls.

800
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,420
I just hope we don't
encounter one of those.

801
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,640
There's my camera. Yep. I
can now see what I'm doing.

802
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,430
Two miles completed.

803
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,420
No serious problems.

804
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,990
Jeez!

805
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,840
Yes. Good work.

806
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,240
I love my pick-up truck.
I really love it.

807
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,870
Both of us were now off

808
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,150
the beaten track

809
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,120
and full of steely determination.

810
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,390
Come on, Jeremy. You
need to get there first.

811
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,910
Thunderbird 1 is power sliding.

812
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,400
Oh, yes!

813
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
This is called wrestling
with the controls.

814
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,630
Whoa!

815
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,360
Oh!

816
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,430
♪ Silverado

817
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,870
♪ Why don't you come
to your senses? ♪

818
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,670
Temperatures and pressures
all in the green.

819
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,150
This is shouting and power
versus thought and torque.

820
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,790
Come on!

821
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,150
I've got some rooster tails now!

822
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,400
Oh!

823
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,720
Good news, Hammond, the VelociRaptor
works well in these conditions.

824
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,280
Where is he? Where is he?

825
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,710
Hello. Hello.

826
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,750
I'm James. Oh, I'm Jeremy.

827
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,950
Shall we be friends, James?

828
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,990
Yes, let's be best friends
for ever and ever.

829
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,270
Right, James, I must tell
you all about myself.

830
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,630
Actually, that's my favourite hobby
-- telling people how wonderful I am.

831
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,470
Oh, is it really, Jeremy?
That's funny,

832
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,390
because I actually am
brilliant... Are you?

833
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,350
Yes, I am but I'm very
modest. Are you?

834
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,870
Yes, that's what I drive
a yellow Ferrari. Do you?

835
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,030
I drive everything better
than everybody else.

836
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,990
Let's have another friend but let's
leave him to die on a mountaintop,

837
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,190
shall we? Oh, that would
be funny, wouldn't it?

838
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,750
Knowing that Hammond
would be on high ground,

839
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,960
I was now climbing hard.

840
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,390
God, I love this thing.

841
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,480
I really, properly do.

842
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,830
All day yesterday, this was
an Aston Martin V8 Vantage.

843
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,350
Now it's a Group B Audi Quattro.

844
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,560
On my route, I too was climbing.

845
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,920
Do your stuff, Z71 Pack.

846
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,670
You can actually feel
the wheels going,

847
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,670
"Is it this one? Is it that one?

848
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,840
"I'll put a bit of power there.
I'll put a bit to that one."

849
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,710
But, as we climbed past 4,000ft,

850
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,560
the going started
to get really tough.

851
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,990
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

852
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,640
Thunderbird 2 is still go.

853
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,110
Keep those revs up. Keep
the wheels spinning.

854
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,630
Come on, Jeremy. You
need to get there first.

855
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,750
I do not want to drive
back to Vancouver

856
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,950
with my VelociRaptor being soiled

857
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,240
by Hammond's cheesy,
decomposing bottom.

858
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,030
Oh, my head's come off. Has it?

859
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,470
Well, a man threw a knife at
me but I caught it in my teeth.

860
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,110
Literally, my head came
off. Oh, but I'm OK.

861
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,070
Oh, are you?

862
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,070
In the cock!

863
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,590
Right in the nads! Look at that!

864
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,680

865
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,390

00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,910
[BLEEP.]

868
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,990
Situation update, viewers, bit
too close to the edge, there.

869
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,750
I've got to be careful how I move,

870
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,670
otherwise I'll fall into the valley.

871
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,880
'Still, could be worse.'

872
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,120
Whoa! Oh, no!

00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,640
Whoa!

875
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,150
Faced with the prospect of having to
rescue the world's angriest man...

876
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,910
Where are you, you pair of
[BLEEP] middle-aged [BLEEP]?!

877
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,590
James and I had both decided
to rip out our own fingernails.

878
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,750
Ow!

879
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,080
Ow!

880
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,990
This made progress much easier.

881
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,190
That feels good.

882
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,270
Temperatures and pressures
are still in the green.

883
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,510
With snow chains fitted, you're
supposed to be gentle,

884
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,480
but, luckily, my colleague
doesn't know what that means.

885
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,470
Dig and claw.

886
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,670
Dig and claw. Come on. Dig in.

887
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,460
Damn and blast.

888
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,910
Come on.

889
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,870
Come on.

890
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,670
You know you want to do this.

891
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,520
You don't want Richard
Hammond in you.

892
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,030
Oh, no!

893
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,320
'The news was grim.'

[BLEEP].

895
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,950
You are genuinely a bit of
a desperado here, Silverado.

896
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,190
Loving that.

897
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,910
And loving that, as well.

898
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,190
I'm still coming, Richard Hammond.

899
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,390
And you know what?

900
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,040
So was I.

901
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,950
We are underway. Three
wheels on my wagon

902
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,390
and I am still rolling along.

903
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,240
Come on, machine.

904
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,160
Where's James May? Where is May?

905
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,430
Bit of beans there.

906
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,480
Slightly less beans,
there, for the climb.

907
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,110
That's an engine,

908
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,100
and it's not a plane,
it's a car. It's...

909
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,430
That's got to be them!

910
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,190
Where the bloody hell have they been?

911
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,830
Come on.

912
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,830
Do it! Claw!

913
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,920
Stop panicking, just... ease it off.

914
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,710
Really struggling. Really
struggling here.

915
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,160
Come on!

916
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,830
It's Hammond! Hammond is there!

917
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,870
How could it have taken THAT long?

918
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,550
May, bad news. You're going to have
to take Hammond back to Vancouver.

919
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,950
That's a powerful vehicle.
That is a go-anywhere car!

920
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,950
So where the [BLEEP] have you been?

921
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,110
And he's in an appalling
temper. Absolutely shocking.

922
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,990
Where are you going? Well, now what?

923
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,680
Oh, that's your rescue, is it?

924
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,790
Hold on.

925
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,190
That was shocking.

926
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,510
I have seen Thunderbirds and
I never saw Alan flying along

927
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,470
listening to Boston eating
a bar of chocolate.

928
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,510
- No, you say that...
- Neither did I see Virgil
suggesting they stopped

929
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,670
for a cappuccino. They were both
focused on the job in hand.

930
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,190
Yes, but, in that film,

931
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,430
we did prove that your
watch system works

932
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,830
and both James and I completely fell
in love with our pick-up trucks,

933
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,830
- didn't we?
- Yeah, no, this is a very good
point because, let's be honest,

934
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,870
for 12 years, we've looked down our
noses at big American pick-up trucks

935
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,390
but, having spent quite
a few days in them,

936
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,630
we ended up completely besotted.

937
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,630
It's the value that staggers me.

938
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,910
Because American pick-up trucks are
exempt from the gas guzzler tax,

939
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,710
- they are spectacularly cheap.
- Yeah, I know.

940
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,950
I'm surprised there aren't more
people importing them over here.

941
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,270
Yeah, well, I think the problem is
a car this... Vehicle, I should say,

942
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,790
this size wouldn't really work in
Britain and there's another problem.

943
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,870
Excuse me, Hammond.

944
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,270
I think, if you put
something in the back,

945
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,510
every time you pull up
at a set of red lights,

946
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,870
someone is going to nick it.

947
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,590
Yeah, no, you're dead right.

948
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,230
But, even so, I maintain, my
Silverado, it was brilliant.

949
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,350
Well, it was, James, but, let's be
honest, it didn't actually reach

950
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,390
- the top of the mountain, did it?
- No. I wasn't going to mention that.

951
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,910
Actually, just before the end,
it did break a drive shaft.

952
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,310
Yeah, I did wonder if you
were going to mention that,

953
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,830
because it wasn't in the film.

954
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,110
In the end, neither Thunderbird
Fat nor Thunderbird Slow

955
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,670
- actually rescued me.
- That is true.

956
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,310
No, an actual rescue person
had to come and save me,

957
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,750
and can I just talk
about the four days,

958
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,150
four DAYS of misery, I endured
whilst you two dawdled

959
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,510
from breakfast to breakfast
in your heated trucks?

960
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,110
No, I'm sorry. There isn't time.

961
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,550
And, on that bombshell,
we really must end.

962
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,240
Thank you so much for
watching. Good night!
