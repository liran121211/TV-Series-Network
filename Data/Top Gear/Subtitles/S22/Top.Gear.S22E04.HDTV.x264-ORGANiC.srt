1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,210
Tonight, a BMW i8 at full chat
in the Yorkshire Moors...

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,930
the cream of Hollywood
on our track...

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,180
and a pointless thing
about old Land Rovers.

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,260
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,660
Thank you, everybody, thank
you! Thank you so much.

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,250
Thank you, and welcome.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,370
Welcome to what is, for the
first time in many years,

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,690
an actual car show.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,010
We've packed it with many facts
and a lot of informations.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,530
And we're starting the ball rolling
with this, the Mercedes SLS.

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,810
This was one of my favourite cars

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,570
and I was very sad when
they stopped making it.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,490
But, happily, there
is now a replacement,

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,010
which I haven't been
driving on the track...

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,930
because James has.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,210
This is what they've come up with.

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,940
It's called the AMG GT.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,700
And it costs between
£97,000 and £120,000.

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,290
Now, I have to be entirely
honest with you -

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,290
when I woke up this morning and
got out of bed to come and drive

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,340
this car, it was with a certain
amount of disquiet.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,090
I've always thought that
AMG Mercedes are a bit -

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,060
as my mother would say - unnecessary.

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,700
I don't like the
Stormtrooper body kit look.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,650
I don't really like those
pseudo-special forces names

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,820
like "SLS" and "Black".

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,640
Jeremy likes them a lot.

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,650
With this car, however, you sense
that something is different,

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,500
that everything's
a bit more grown-up.

30
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,010
See, their last coupe,
the SLS, had a massive,

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,250
and again, not entirely
necessary, 6.2-litre V8.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,850
This car also has a V8,
but it's a brand-new one

33
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,570
and it's a much more
modest four litres.

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,130
Because of that,

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,530
you might expect it to take a little
longer to get from A to B.

36
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,050
However...

37
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,820
ENGINE ROARS

38
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,610
The 0-60 time in that 6.2-litre
SLS was 3.8 seconds.

39
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,890
On this, the four-litre car, it is...

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,570
exactly the same.

41
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,290
The top speeds are almost
exactly the same as well,

42
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,420
both up in the high 190s.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,770
Strewth!

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,820
And AMG has achieved this by
using brains to make the brawn.

45
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,850
This car has two turbochargers.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,290
Normally, turbochargers would
be bolted onto the outside of

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,410
the engines, but on this car, they
live inside the V of the engine.

48
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,370
What this means is the
engine is more compact,

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,820
the turbos are more efficient.

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,010
So this car costs £50,000
less than the old SLS,

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,420
it uses a lot less fuel and
it still goes just as quickly.

52
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,620
That is what they call on
The Apprentice a "win-win".

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,770
And then there's the styling,

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,050
which also has a new
level of sophistication,

55
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,340
with an interior that's more James
Bond than Fast And Furious.

56
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,010
On the outside, it's
much the same story.

57
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,250
These doors are perfectly conventional

58
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,730
in and out sort of doors.

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,410
They are NOT like those idiotic
gull-wing things you get on the SLS,

60
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,970
which makes it look as if it's
sniffing its own armpits.

61
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,410
This rear spoiler is
actually an option,

62
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,850
but even that, by AMG's
standards, is quite discreet.

63
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,740
In fact, the whole thing is quite
pretty. Quite classic, even.

64
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,970
And now we must move on to
cornering, an activity where

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,780
AMG normally scores maximum
points for mentalness.

66
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,370
This is, when all's said and done,
a 503 horsepower rear-wheel drive

67
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,060
muscle car, and that sounds like
a recipe for extreme trickiness.

68
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,570
In fact, you can corner
quickly in this thing,

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,650
and without soiling your trousers.

70
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,690
TYRES SCREECH

71
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,610
Which, once again, is thanks
to intelligent engineering.

72
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,890
In a normal car, the
engine and the gearbox,

73
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,250
they're just dead weight hanging
in there and they move around a bit

74
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,010
and sort of spoil the balance
as you go round corners.

75
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,090
In this car, the mountings
for all that stuff are active.

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,170
So, as you go through a bend,

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,720
they stiffen up to keep
all that weight in check.

78
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,930
It's a bit like the way a cat can
walk along the top of a fence

79
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,920
using its tail to keep
itself in balance.

80
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,450
However, if, like Jeremy,

81
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,140
you want to devour your back tyres
in one sitting, you still can.

82
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,290
TYRES SCREECH

83
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,080
Yes, thank you!

84
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,290
And then, there's the noise.

85
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,290
Are you ready? Here we go.

86
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,140
ENGINE GROWLS

87
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,340
HE BARKS

88
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,890
HE BARKS

89
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,450
I hate it when my prejudices
are demolished,

90
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,170
but this card is giving me the fizz.

91
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,370
What I like most of all is that
the GT is cleverly designed

92
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,250
to be Jekyll and Hyde.

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,250
I'm just going to quieten it down.

94
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,490
Turn off the manual change,
the noisy exhaust.

95
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,010
We'll put it back into comfort mode,
comfort suspension... There you go.

96
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,330
When you turn all that off, it turns
into this incredibly civilised,

97
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,580
long-legged cruiser.

98
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,770
I like what they've done.

99
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,970
They've got rid of the Andy McNab
names and all that nonsense

100
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,540
and given us an AMG for grown-ups.

101
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm glad I got out
of bed this morning.

102

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,660
It's what I've been saying
for a long time.

105
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
So there you go, May.

106
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,010
Ha-ha-ha! I've been saying for
ages, AMG Mercs are brilliant.

107
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,090
Yes, there are couple of massive
problems with this one, though.

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,570
~ What?
~ Well, firstly, it reminds me of you.

109
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,290
~ LAUGHTER
~ The second one is that, to be honest,

110
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,330
for not much more than
half the price of this,

111
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,130
you could have a Nissan GT-R,
which, as we have established,

112
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,650
is the finest car in the world.

113
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,850
It's certainly up there,
I will grant you that.

114
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,610
But I'll tell you what we'll do,
we'll sort it out on the track, OK?

115
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,970
We'll see how fast this
one can get round.

116
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,570
That of course means handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:56,010
Some say that last week, he won
a BAFTA for Best Original Smell.

118

LAUGHTER

119
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,330
And that when he dies, he
thinks he'll go to Devon.

LAUGHTER

121
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,210

123
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,770
And he's... not in the car.

124
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,210
Oh, yes, Stig not happy about
Ricciardo's lap... He's punched him!

125
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,090
He's punched him! That's bad.

126
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,810
He's really not happy
about that fast lap.

127
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,810
He's in the car now, and he's
off. A wheel-spinning start.

128
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,970
Obviously in a furious temper.

129
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,170
503 horsepower thundering
through the light but strong

carbon fibre prop shaft.

131
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,770
Oh, he's vandalised the first corner.
He is really very annoyed.

132
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,490
But he is driving beautifully.

134

Another slice of the calming
Carpenters there.

135
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,610
Through Chicago, looking very fast
and very controlled. Now Hammerhead.

136
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,690
James says this car can suffer
from snap understeer,

137
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,810
so let's see what happens.

138
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,250
No, not a thing. It's worth
remembering, of course,

139
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,490
that James suffers
from being a moron.

banging up the double clutch gearbox,

144
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,730
letting the perfect balance of
the transaxle layout do its stuff.

145
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,770
Just a stab of brakes past the tyres.

Stig pretending the pedal

Ready?!

153
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,290
It did a 1.17.5.

154
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,410
And that is... Well, look.

155
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,170
That's quicker than the
old SLS Black and, ahem,

156
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,610
quicker than the Nissan GT-R.

157
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,890
Which shows, James, that you don't
know what you're talking about.

158
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,890
Hmm, interesting. Didn't actually
feel like it would be that fast

159
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,450
when I was driving it, to be honest.

160
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,690
No, that's because... yeah,
YOU were driving it.

LAUGHTER

162
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,930
Right, and now we must do the news.
And we start with big news.

163
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,690
This is the biggest news we've
had in a long time, I would say.

164
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,850
Because Ford, for the very first
time, is making the Mustang

165
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,410
in right-hand drive and will be
bringing it to the UK officially.

166
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,690
You can buy them over
here. There it is.

167
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,610
Two versions - you can have a
four-cylinder EcoBoost for £28,000,

168
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,330
or for £33,000, a five-litre V8.

169
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,130
Mm, the one I want, though,
is the Shelby, the 350...

170
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,930
~ GT, yeah, yeah, yeah.
~ .. or something like that.
It's 520 horsepower V8.

171
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,450
~ That's the one. There it is, look.
~ It looks brilliant.

172
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,810
But you can't, they're not
bringing that one here.

173
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,770
~ They're not selling that one to us.
~ Why?
~ It's going to Canada in a year.

174
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,850
Yeah, I know, but so is
the internet, but that...

175
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,690
But that's not coming
here, no, we can't...

176
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,850
~ Why won't they sell it to us?
~ I don't know.

177
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,650
But you must be very looking forward to a
right-hand drive Mustang, Richard Hammond.

178
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,250
Yeah, you'd think... No, not really.

179
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,010
Because I don't want a
right-hand drive Mustang.

180
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,970
Once it becomes right-hand drive,
it's like it's trying too hard

181
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,690
to be British and sophisticated
and something it's not.

182
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,610
I know what you mean. It's like
when Americans come over here

183
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,050
and start using words like "bloody".

184
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,330
~ Yes!
~ Isn't it?
~ It's exactly that.
~ It is.

185
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,770
And they say, "I'm going
to the bloody pub!"

186
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,770
~ It doesn't sound right. It's the same.
~ Exactly, it is.

187
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,850
Or they say "mate". They try and say
"mate", but it just doesn't work.

188
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,770
Yes, cos they think we're
Crocodile Dundee,

189
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,330
~ cos it's all the same, cos
they haven't got atlases.
~ Yeah.

190
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,090
So that, realistically, should
be called, now it's coming here,

191
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,450
the "Ford Bloody Quid Mate".

192
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,090
LAUGHTER

193
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,770
Should be its name! Ooh, now...

194
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,250
Can I just do a survey?

195
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,650
How many people here enjoyed the
ambulance film we did last week?

196
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,610
AUDIENCE: Yes!

197
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,930
OK, you see, the problem we have
is that we've had an electronic

198
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,410
communication from a man called
Mr E36-Man-4000, who says,

199
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,370
"Dear so-called Top Gear, I HATED
your thing on ambulances.

200
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,210
"Why don't you stick to cars?"

201
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,570
Shall we show Mr... What's
he called, Mr Hashtag?

202
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,570
Shall we show him what
this show would be like

203
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,370
if we just talked about cars?

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,690
~ Yeah, OK.
~ Yeah, all right.

205
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,610
I tell you what I drove this week...

206
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,820
~ Volkswagen Passat diesel.
~ Did you?
~ Mm.

207
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,180
Surprisingly comfortable.

208
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,130
I also drove an Audi TT.

209
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
~ Which is much nicer than you'd think.
~ OK.

210
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,610
Actually, I've been driving the
new Porsche 911 Turbo, which is

211
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,170
very fast but surprisingly quiet.

212
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,380
Oh, is it? Mm-hm.

213
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,290
LAUGHTER

214
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,770
Um, Aston Martin have built
a new one-off for a Bond film.

215
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,170
~ It's called the DB10.
~ Yeah, mm.
~ AUDIENCE: Ooh!

216
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,170
~ I don't think much of that, actually.
~ I don't like the way it looks.

217
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,730
~ No, I don't.
~ No, I do.
~ OK.

218
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,610
~ Erm, Vauxhall...
~ LAUGHTER

219
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,000
.. has a new car, the Corsa.

220
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,060
I've got nothing on that.

221
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,810
Shall we give up on car news?

222
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,250
I'm going to take charge again,

223
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,450
because I want to talk about
something else, right?

224
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,130
I want to talk about some
experts who said last week

225
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,890
they wanted to rip up all of Britain's
railway lines and replace

226
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,490
them with motorways that would
then only be used by coaches.

227
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,170
~ And I think that would be a shame.
~ Why would that be a shame?

228
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,210
Because I like having
coaches on motorways.

229
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,250
~ Why?
~ Because you can drive alongside
them and use their Wi-Fi.

230
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,850
Can you?! LAUGHTER

231
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,610
You can, honestly! Have you
not done that? It's fabulous.

232
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,170
My kids always say, "Daddy,
Daddy, slow down to 70."

233
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,330
~ I mean, sorry, "Speed up to 70."
~ Yeah.

234
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,090
"Catch the coach, quickly,

235
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,970
"so we can snapchat this
picture of a poo I've done."

236
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,610
They do!

237
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,250
~ So it's like a free roaming Wi-Fi?
~ Exactly! Do it on the way home.

238
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,050
It's incredibly cheap.

239
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,930
Now, a few years ago, we improved
police cars, and last week,

240
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,170
~ we improved ambulances.
~ Yes, we did.

241
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,050
We are now the emergency service
for the emergency services.

242
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,450
Yeah, we are. That's what we are.

243
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,930
Quite a lot of people have written
to us and said, "Right,

244
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,450
"when are you going to
improve fire engines?"

245
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,970
Mm! No, but there's
a... No, actually...

246
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,210
We've looked into this
and there's a problem,

247
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,770
because if you have to build
a vehicle big enough for all

248
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,050
the water you need and pumps
and ladders and buckets

249
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,330
and six burly men, and
women, in Wellingtons,

250
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,810
what you end up with
is a fire engine.

251
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,930
~ Yeah.
~ But, specifically, a British
fire engine. That's important.

252
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,290
Yeah, not one of those stupid
American ones where all

253
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,170
~ the firemen stand on the outside.
~ They do!

254
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,170
So you get there and there's nobody
on board to put the fire out!

255
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,330
Do you know what I like about
the British fire engine?

256
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,780
It says "Dennis" on the front.

257
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,250
Dennis is a reassuring name.

258
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,210
A Dennis would remember
to return your lawn mower.

259
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,970
It is interesting, actually, because American
fire engines have really stupid names.

260
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,170
I've got a picture of an
American fire engine here.

261
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,610
~ Guess what that's called?
~ Fire Engine.

262
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,010
No, it's called The Igniter.

263
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,890
~ LAUGHTER
~ It is!

264
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,570
~ How does...? "I've already got a fire!"
~ Exactly!

265
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,330
It should be called The Extinguisher.

266
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,090
~ They've probably got an ambulance
called The Haemorrhage.
~ Yes.

267
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,330
~ LAUGHTER
~ Right, earlier on, James

268
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,010
had a go at a proper road
test in a one-off car show

269
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,250
~ and now it's my turn.
~ Try not to muck it up.

270
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,930
No, no, no, relax, this is going
to be a blizzard of facts

271
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,650
because I'm going to talk
about the new BMW M3.

272
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,050
It has a smaller engine
than the old model,

273
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,770
three litres rather than four.

274
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,730
It has two fewer cylinders,
but it is turbo-charged,

275
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,690
so you get a little bit more
horsepower and 111 more torques.

276
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,170
That means it's four
seconds a lap faster

277
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,730
round our track than the old car.

278
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,090
And four seconds is a huge
gulf because, remember,

279
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,170
that was already five
seconds a lap faster

280
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,650
round the Ascari track in Spain

281
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,570
than the equivalent
Mercedes and Audi,

282
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,050
so this is properly quick
AND it's more economical,

283
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,370
but, and this is the big one,

284
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
is it nicer to drive?

285
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,370
Well, here it is, slithering
about on our track.

286
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,570
TYRES SCREECH

287
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,940
Look at that. I mean, that's
just... the M3 signature dish.

288
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,850
But, straightaway, I must tell
you there is a bit of a niggle.

289
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,210
~ TYRES SCREECH
~ If you stick the tail out

290
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,610
in a corner, which you can,
easily, because it's an M3,

291
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,650
you'll find it very
hard to hold the drift

292
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,300
because the power steering is now
electric rather than hydraulic.

293
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,970
Going round a corner like this

294
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,490
is like wrestling with the tail
of an excitable crocodile.

295
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,730
It's not just hard to hold the slide,

296
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,490
it's also hard to straighten
up again afterwards.

297
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,280
See what I mean?

298
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,050
Now, I admit, in the real world,

299
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,010
this isn't going to be
much of a problem...

300
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,050
ever, if I'm honest.

301
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,810
And anyway, you can solve
it by taking the steering

302
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,970
out of Sport Plus mode and
putting it in Comfort mode.

303
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,160
Then everything is fine.

304
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,090
Oh, yeah!

305
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,210
In fact, everything
is more than fine,

306
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,020
everything is absolutely sublime!

307
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,850
I'm not going to beat about
the bush, this car is...

308
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,170
utterly brilliant.

309
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,370
It's well made, it's
got seating for four,

310
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,010
it's got a decent-sized boot,
it's comfortable, it's quiet,

311
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,730
it's got lots of standard equipment.

312
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,490
In many ways, this car
is like the perfect dog -

313
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,050
it's loyal, it's cute,
it doesn't chase sheep,

314
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,970
it doesn't go wrong all the time

315
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,130
and yet, if a burglar
comes, it has the power

316
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,460
to rip his throat out.

317
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,490
"Look at me! I'm an attack dog now!

318
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,060
"I'm fierce and bitey!"

319
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,210
And that really is that.

320
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,930
It is a fabulous, wonderful car

321
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,610
and if you have £56,000 lying around,

322
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,130
you should buy one immediately.

323
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,250
Or should you?

324
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,010
Because today, we live
in strange times.

325
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,050
Environmental times.

326
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,130
And BMW has another new
car which reflects that.

327
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,060
It's one of the most talked-about
cars in years and this is it.

328
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,490
It's called the i8 and it's a hybrid,

329
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,170
which means it's powered
by an electric motor

330
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:59,130
and a tiny three cylinder, 1.5 litre,
turbo-charged petrol engine.

331
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,050
That doesn't sound
like much of a recipe.

332
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,410
It sounds like a sort of
glorified Toyota Prius,

333
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,970
but let me give you
the headline figures.

334
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,610
This car does 155mph

335
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,970
and 134 miles to the gallon.

336
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,570
And because it's so economical,

337
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,690
you get a £5,000 grant from
the government if you buy one,

338
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,370
it's exempt from the
London Congestion Charge

339
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,090
and the road-tax bill,
as you can see here, is...

340
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,340
nil.

341
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,930
It really does sound, then,

342
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,610
like this car answers everyone's
prayers, but does it?

343
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,370
Are pure-bred petrolheads
like me really going to say,

344
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,620
"Mm, yes, what I really want next
is a three-cylinder hybrid?"

345
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,370
Well, that is what I'm
going to try and find out.

346
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,570
I'm going to set the satellite
navigation for Whitby

347
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,610
in North Yorkshire and, obviously,
in a car as futuristic as this,

348
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,610
you don't push buttons to do that,

349
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,690
you trace the letters you
want on this pad here,

350
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,820
so, wuh...

351
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,820
.. huh...

352
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,970
.. ih...

353
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,580
tuh...

354
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,170
Ah-ha! OK.

355
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,810
'Whitby, North Yorkshire,
guidance started.'

356
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,650
Now, the reason I've
chosen Whitby is,

357
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,450
A, you get the best fish and
chips and the world there

358
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,650
and, B, the M3 we saw earlier
is waiting for me there,

359
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,090
which means, when I arrive,
I will face a simple choice.

360
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,900
Will I want to drive
home in that or this?

361
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,010
With the sat nav looking for the
most economical route to Whitby,

362
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,330
I put my sensible head
on and settled down

363
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,940
for a 200 mile fact-finding mission.

364
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,370
You have a choice of
three driving modes.

365
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,410
Number one, electric drive.

366
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,850
That's the electric motor only.

367
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,650
It gives you a range of 20 miles,
19 more than you get from a Prius

368
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,180
and probably enough for you
to do your morning commute.

369
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,530
Then, if you move the
gear lever over here,

370
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,890
you engage sport mode and that
means the electric motor

371
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,330
and the petrol engine are working
together to give 352 horsepower

372
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,620
and it makes the car sort of
firm and bitey and Nurburgringy.

373
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,780
But, since we are on the A1,
I shall go for... comfort mode.

374
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,800
Lovely.

375
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,490
'And it really was lovely.'

376
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,050
I know there is an electric
motor in the front,

377
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,010
driving the front wheels through
a two-speed automatic gearbox.

378
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,730
I know there's a petrol
engine at the back,

379
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,210
driving the rear wheels through
a six-speed automatic gearbox.

380
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,770
I also know there is another small
electric motor at the back,

381
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,340
filling in the gaps and doing
all sorts of clever things.

382
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,930
And yet, sitting here,

383
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,770
this car feels no weirder
to drive than that...

384
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,450
whatever it is, that
hatchback thing there.

385
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,410
I've got a steering wheel,
gear lever, accelerator,

386
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,010
brake and Ken Bruce on the radio.

387
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,250
How normal is that?!

388
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,890
♪ BBC Radio 2! ♪

389
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,930
But there is a problem.

390
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,250
If you're driving in comfort mode,
you're not really charging up

391
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,300
the batteries and, eventually,
they are going to go flat.

392
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,370
One solution is to
turn off the motorway

393
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,490
and charge them up at the mains,

394
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,500
but, as you're about to see,
this is not to be recommended.

395
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,370
"Connect your vehicle and validate."

396
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,490
Look, I can operate a Hoover!

397
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,370
Oh, this is stupid!

398
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,580
Well, it must... It must be
charging. It's plugged in, so...

399
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,370
I shall go and get a cup of coffee.

400
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,530
While we wait for the batteries
to charge, let me show you

401
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,890
this incredible app that you
can get with your i8, OK?

402
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,250
If I push that, I can
set the air conditioning

403
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,340
so the car is cool when
I get back into it.

404
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,690
How amazing is that?!

405
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,290
If I can also flash the headlights,

406
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,570
so I could find it if I've lost
it in a car park. I can lock it.

407
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,330
I can unlock it.

408
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,610
I don't know why you'd want to
do that remotely, but you can.

409
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,250
I wouldn't be at all surprised
to find a feature on here

410
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,340
that enables the i8 to find
another i8 for a good time.

411
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,130
'After an hour, I
went back to the car

412
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,810
'and found that the charging
point hadn't worked.'

413
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:08,090
If you had a pure electric car,
you would be completely stuffed,

414
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,810
but this is not a pure electric car.

415
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,400
So I'm not.

416
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,090
I can either drive along
without the batteries

417
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,930
or I can put the gear lever
over here to engage sport mode

418
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,260
and then they are being charged
up as I drive along.

419
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,980
What's more, in sport mode,
the i8 is properly fast.

420
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,330
I scoffed when BMW said they
were going to make a hybrid

421
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,820
that was as fast as a 911 or
a Chevrolet Corvette, but...

422
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,240
.. it really is!

423
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,740
'It's so fast that soon
I was in the North.'

424
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,370
This is Doncaster. This
is where I grew up.

425
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,810
It was a mining town
back then, but now look.

426
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
It's a wind farm.

427
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,340
Bit less romantic, the windmills,
and they employ fewer people, but...

428
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,100
Time moves on, I guess.

429
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,450
'So far, then, the i8 had done well.

430
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,010
'But to find out if it could truly
win the heart of the petrol head,

431
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,650
'I turned off the A1 and plunged into

432
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,690
'the beautiful North
Yorkshire Moors.'

433
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,780
DRAMATIC, SWEEPING MUSIC

434
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,490
So, let's find out.

435
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,920
Oh, God above, this is good!

436
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,620
This is a revelation!

437
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,690
It's the lightness that
staggers you most of all.

438
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,060
It's almost as though I'm steering
using nothing but thought.

439
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,050
And because the heavy battery pack
is located in the middle of the car,

440
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,050
here, low down, it has the
same centre of gravity as...

441
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,740
as a worm!

442
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,850
Couple that to the
four-wheel-drive system and, honestly,

443
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,580
you can go round any corner at
any speed that takes your fancy.

444
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,170
The harder I go, the faster I drive,

445
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,130
the sharper I brake,

446
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,860
the more electricity I'm
making for the batteries.

447
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,850
If you get busted for
speeding in this car,

448
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,330
you get a thank-you letter
from Greenpeace.

449
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,120
And rightly so!

450
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,930
'But before we get carried away
with this environmental stuff,

451
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,660
'there's one important point
we all need to remember.'

452
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,130
I've always had a fundamental
problem with hybrids.

453
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,850
And it's this.

454
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,690
We all know the world
has limited resources

455
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,010
and we must do all we
can to eke them out.

456
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,930
And you're not going to do that

457
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,170
if you drive around in a car that
has, effectively, two engines.

458
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,970
You don't solve the problem
of conspicuous consumption

459
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,490
by using conspicuous consumption.

460
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,970
The thing is, though,

461
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,610
while you have to rape the
world to make a car like that,

462
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,970
the benefits of owning
one for you and I,

463
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,460
in the here and now, are
immense, because that car...

464
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,890
That car is staggering.

465
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,650
It's breathtaking.

466
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,330
MUSIC: The Hovis Theme, New
World Symphony by Dvorak

467
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,320
It's nearly as
breathtaking as that view.

468
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,130
'With the advert for Yorkshire
over, I got back on the road.'

469
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,730
It is incredible to think

470
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,250
that I'm now cruising into Whitby
in silent electric mode,

471
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,890
using electricity that I made
by driving quickly on the moors.

472
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,130
The message really is very
clear from this car.

473
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,500
If you want to save the
planet, drive fast.

474
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,780
'After a short eco drive through
the pretty fishing port of Whitby...

475
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,660
'.. I arrived in the harbour, where
I faced a very difficult choice.'

476
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,210
Cod or haddock...?

477
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,960
I think cod.

478
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,450
'Then I faced an even
more difficult choice.

479
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,780
'Which of these cars would
I drive back to London?'

480
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,290
This is the hardest decision I've
ever had to make between cars, ever.

481
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,290
It's like the M3 is the best
of where we've come from

482
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,610
and the i8 is where going.

483
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,010
There must have been
a moment in history...

484
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,850
when everybody had typewriters

485
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,690
and typewriters had been
around hundreds of years

486
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,570
and they were brilliant, and then
somebody came along with a laptop.

487
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,020
That is what's going on there.

488
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,460
No, I've made my mind up.

489
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,850
Bet you weren't expecting that!

490
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,890
APPLAUSE

491
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,290
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,010
~ What?
~ Hold on, hold on, hold on.

493
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,090
Let me make sure I got this straight.

494
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,290
~ You, let's be honest,
are our resident dinosaur.
~ I am.

495
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,930
And you prefer the i8 to the M3?

496
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,330
~ No.
~ But in the film...
~ Yes, I know.

497
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,850
I was wrong.

498
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,130
The thing is, I've had some time
to do some thinking since then

499
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,330
and there are one or two
bits and bobs on the i8

500
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,570
that would drive you mad.

501
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,290
I mean, rear visibility is atrocious,

502
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,210
the boot is microscopic, this window
doesn't go all the way down,

503
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,770
so you can't drive along
with your arm hanging out

504
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,290
and I discovered last week that
an i8 has just been bought

505
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,810
by Wayne Rooney.

506
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,890
Oh, no. LAUGHTER

507
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,850
~ And it gets worse.
~ How can it get worse than that?

508
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,610
Because, in a laboratory in Munich,
it can do 134 miles to the gallon,

509
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,890
but have a guess how many miles
to the gallon I averaged.

510
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,650
~ 80?
~ No.

511
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,770
~ 79?
~ No!

512
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,770
~ 78?
~ No, James!

513
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,290
I averaged 31 miles to the gallon.

514
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,410
And other i8 owners are reporting
the same sort of thing

515
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,050
and it only has a tiny little
fuel tank, seven gallons,

516
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,010
which means you're going to be
stopping for fuel all the time.

517
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,250
So, when you said, "It's a laptop,"

518
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,850
~ it's one of those really early-days laptops?
~ It is.

519
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,330
They are on the right road,
make no mistake about that,

520
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,170
but they are not there just yet.

521
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,330
So, anyway, let's move on, let's put
a Star In Our Reasonably Priced Car.

522
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,850
Now, my guest tonight was
Jordan Belfort's wife

523
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,290
in The Wolf Of Wall Street,

524
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,650
one of my favourite films
of the modern age.

525
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,570
She is now in a new film and
she's brought along her co-star,

526
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,130
so please welcome Margot Robbie

527
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,610
and a man called Will Smith!

528
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,170
CHEERING

529
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,090
Oh, heavens above!

530
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,850
Look what we've got for you!

531
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,090
Yeah, we got you as well.

532
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,410
~ Good to see you.
~ Good to see you both.

533
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,730
Margot, I'll go round here.

534
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,770
And relax.

535
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:22,410
~ Have a seat! Have a seat!
~ This is fantastic!

536
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,770
~ Wow!
~ Is it really fantastic?
~ This is great.

537
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,010
Cos I was going to begin

538
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,250
by apologising for
the trailers we have.

539
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,970
~ The trailers! Oh! Those trailers, yeah.
~ They're really nice.

540
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,570
~ You know...
~ Will set his bar very high
with trailers, though, so...

541
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,530
~ Really?
~ Yes, his trailer is pimped.

542
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,210
I'm very serious about trailers.

543
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,530
The trailer, you know, it
has to be, like, you know,

544
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,170
you got to hook it up, have a stereo
system, you know, it has to...

545
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,650
Yours had mirrors on
the roof... if I recall.

546
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,930
LAUGHTER, HE MOUTHS

547
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,570
I'm not insinuating anything,
I'm just saying!

548
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,730
That's going to get in trouble!

549
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,890
That's going to get us
in trouble, there we go!

550
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,880
Already in trouble
where my mind's gone!

551
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,490
~ No, cos really, not that long
ago, you were in Neighbours.
~ Yeah.

552
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,330
What interests me about Neighbours,
which is an Aussie TV...

553
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,090
~ I know what neighbours is!
~ Don't pretend you know.

554
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,290
Two days ago, they asked him
what show I did in Australia,

555
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,810
a very popular show, and
you said it started with C.

556
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,690
~ I couldn't remember the name.
~ There's no C in it.

557
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,130
I just can't see Will Smith
finishing his day going,

558
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,330
"You know what, I think
I'll watch Neighbours."

559
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,210
"Ooh, 6.30, my show's on!"

560
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,170
~ Russell Crowe started in that, didn't he?
~ Mm.

561
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,290
What's his name, Guy Pearce was
another one. Kylie is another one.

562
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,210
~ Yes, yes.
~ I was wondering, do you
know Coronation Street?

563
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,770
~ Cos that's produced...
~ I know all those shows, man!

564
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,090
~ You don't! And you won't because...
~ I got the DVDs and everything!

565
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,250
It's just unbelievable, I'm afraid.

566
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,090
I know all about this,
the Coronation Street

567
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,930
and Neighbours and all those.

568
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,370
EastEnders, yeah.

569
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,490
~ Now, em, you are over here,
obviously, to promote a film.
~ Yes.

570
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,170
It's called Focus, but it isn't
about the small Ford hatchback,

571
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,090
which will have disappointed
some people in here. It's...

572
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,770
Well, it's a love story between
you two, which is rather sweet.

573
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,050
~ Yeah.
~ It's interesting, it's...

574
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,650
My character plays a
conman, a master thief,

575
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,810
and part of being a master
thief is he's a liar and...

576
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,090
he meets Margot's character,
Jess, and falls madly in love

577
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,410
and realises quickly that lying and
loving don't go together too well.

578
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,810
They go together OFTEN, but
they don't go together WELL.

579
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,530
~ I believe we have a clip,
which we can show now.
~ OK.

580
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,570
~ ♪ This is a man's world... ♪
~ Are you working an angle?

581
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,770
~ I wouldn't trust him, if I were you.
~ But I should trust you?

582
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,490
~ You've got a problem.
~ I am going to kill you.
~ Kill me later.

583
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,050
~ You lost everyone's money, my money?!
~ Hey!

584
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,570
~ Wow!
~ Wow!

585
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,170
~ This is your mess.
~ I think you're losing it.
~ Whoa! Whoa!

586
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,570
~ Then why did you come up here?
~ Professional curiosity.

587
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,660
And I like boobs. You know,
I figured it was a win-win.

588
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,460
'At the end of the day,
this is a game of focus.'

589
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,610
Did you notice when I had my shirt
off? You noticed, didn't you?

590
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,170
Did you see that shot? I just want
to know if you saw the shot!

591
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,290
That's what everyone took
away from the trailer.

592
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,010
~ Margot had her trousers off.
~ Oh, yes! You saw that!

593
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,890
~ Slightly more distracting.
~ I get that. I get that.

594
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,770
And I've seen you with no shirt on
a million times, but I've never...

595
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,920
Well, I have seen Margot
with no clothes on.

596
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
I've never seen you...

597
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,090
~ This just got awkward.
~ It did.

598
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,290
Now, one of the things that
make it even more awkward

599
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,770
~ is you filmed quite a lot
of the movie in Argentina.
~ Yes. Yeah.

600
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,930
LAUGHTER

601
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,370
~ How did that go for you?
~ For me?

602
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,610
It was good. It was good, man.

603
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,290
~ Argentina's fantastic.
~ Is it?

604
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,610
LAUGHTER

605
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,850
~ What's wrong with Argentina?
~ What's wrong with Argentina? What happened?

606
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,210
~ Every
~ BLEEP
~ thing!

607
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,660
LAUGHTER

608
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,410
The thing is... Well, I enjoyed
it and best of luck with it.

609
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,930
~ Well, thank you, man.
~ When's it open?
~ When does it open?

610
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,370
~ 27th.
~ 27th.
~ February 27th.
~ Is it the 27th here? Yes! OK! Yes.

611
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,050
Now, we've got to get onto cars

612
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,330
because you grew up on
a farm in Australia,

613
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,090
so you, presumably, have been
driving since you were naught

614
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,930
because it's such a vast area.

615
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,810
Yeah, it's huge, but, yeah,
in our family, the rule was

616
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,490
you could drive as soon as
you could like, you know,

617
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,970
physically reach the pedals

618
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,730
and you could have the car on your
own when you reached double digits,

619
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,050
~ so when you were ten, you were allowed to...
~ Wow.

620
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,450
And I remember being nine years old

621
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,890
and arguing with the parents, being
like, "Guys, this is absurd.

622
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,250
"I'm not like..." And they're
like, "No, you're nine.

623
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,810
"You have to wait another year."
And I was like, "This is...

624
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,970
"I can't believe this.
This is ridiculous."

625
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,850
~ Have you been out to the outback?
~ The out... No, no, no.

626
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,010
I feel like you'd fit right
in. You'd just love it.

627
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,370
So it's a racial thing?
You went racial.

628
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,300
LAUGHTER

629
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,210
And, so, what was your first car?

630
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,850
It was a candy apple-red
IROC Z, a Camaro.

631
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,250
~ Apparently you don't have those here.
~ No, we don't. No.

632
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,290
We have... What's the word? Taste.

633
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,900
LAUGHTER

634
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,450
I was thinking, "Maybe this would
indicate you don't know about cars,"

635
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,570
and then I started to look
into some of the lyrics.

636
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,170
~ Are you familiar with the
lyrics of the early songs?
~ Oh, jeez.

637
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,570
I wasn't born.

638
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,930
~ In a song called Gettin' Jiggy Wit It...
~ Yes.

639
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,010
I remember that. Yeah,
I know that one.

640
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,090
LAUGHTER

641
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,290
I don't recognise that one.

642
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,450
It's got 850is.

643
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,410
850is if you need a lift.

644
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,530
~ Who's the kid in the drop?
~ Who else?

645
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,130
~ CROWD: Will Smith.
~ Will Smith.

646
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,970
~ Now, drop, I presume, means drop-top.
~ Drop-top, yes.

647
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,170
They never did a drop-top 850.

648
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,620
LAUGHTER

649
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
It's a small problem.

650
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,490
No, no, hold on.

651
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,410
Now, see, he thinks
he knows everything.

652
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,970
He thinks he knows everything.

653
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,860
~ In the United States, we do a
thing where we customise our cars.
~ Yeah.

654
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,730
~ Can I just give you another one?
~ This is brilliant.

655
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,450
Just Cruisin'. The Maestro.
Do you know the next bit?

656
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,050
~ Yes, yes, yes.
~ Nice flow.

657
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,050
~ Nice flow. Hot like nitro.
~ Cool as ice, though.
~ Cool as ice, though.

658
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,330
~ That's a dichotomy.
~ Do you know what a Maestro is?
~ You've got one?

659
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,980
There you go.

660
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,700
Oh, my God.

661
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,620
It is so awkward for me to hear
you say my lyrics like that.

662
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,530
~ I'll bet.
~ No, it's making my eyes water.

663
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,490
We've done enough of this now.
We want to get onto your laps.

664
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,850
~ OK, yeah.
~ How did you enjoy it out there?
~ It was really fun.

665
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,610
~ It was really nerve-racking,
but it was really fun.
~ Was it?
~ Yeah.

666
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,410
~ You...
~ No, it's fantastic.

667
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,090
I've never... You know,
in the United States,

668
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,330
~ the stick is on the other side...
~ Yeah.

669
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,810
.. so having to drive
with the other...

670
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,010
That's an advantage
for you, of course,

671
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,530
because you're used to driving...

672
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,290
~ Which is why he's mentioning it right now.
~ He's already started.

673
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,130
Like, "In case she
beat me on the laps."

674
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,210
~ It's the whole switching the side thing.
~ In case her time was better.

675
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,090
OK. Margot, you went first and...

676
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,610
Well, there was a bit of an off.

677
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,850
Crashed. Yeah.

678
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,330
Who'd like to see Margot...

679
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,370
I said specifically, "Let's not
let Will know that that happened."

680
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,210
Let's have a look. Come on. Let's
play the tape. Margot's off.

681
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,460
Oh, wow, it's Chicago. It's
understeer at Chicago.

682
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,450
~ It's Ian! It's Ian!
~ Oh!

683
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,370
That is Ian the cameraman!

684
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,570
Sorry!

685
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,290
And he's dead!

686
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,450
~ Margot, we have...
~ I am sorry about that.
~ No, relax.

687
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,330
We've got a little present for you.

688
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,890
It's the landing light you hit.

689
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,730
You can take that home as a souvenir
of your trip to Top Gear.

690
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,850
I'm so sorry about that.

691
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,890
~ Right, now, we've got both
your laps to have a look at.
~ OK.
~ Ladies first.

692
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,250
~ Ladies first!
~ So, Margot, let's have a look at your lap.

693
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,040
This is going to end in a fist fight.

694
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,570
Right, here we go.

695
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,220
TYRES SCREECH

696
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,050
Good clean, aggressive start.

697
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,490
Up to third. First
corner, first corner.

698
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,770
Let's have a look at this.

699
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,130
~ Good dab of the brakes.
~ It feel so much faster in the car.

700
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,090
Everybody says it, but
the slower you look...

701
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,730
Oh, I don't know. There's a lot of
understeer there. That's ballsy.

702
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,130
Oh, God.

703
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,530
Here we go. Are going to make
it without running over Ian?

704
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,250
Oh, waving to Ian! There's a little
wave there. That was nice.

705
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,650
That was a "Sorry, Ian!"

706
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,890
Big corner, don't brake,
don't brake, don't brake!

707
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,140
Don't brake! Don't brake!

708
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,290
~ You do look like you're
concentrating in there.
~ Yeah.

709
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,650
Trying not to hit anyone
this time round.

710
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,700
This is good. I'm liking
the look of this.

711
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,050
~ Yes.
~ Phew!

712
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,690
Right, coming up to the fastest bit.

713
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,460
Foot down, foot down, foot down!

714
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,860
~ Confidence, that was. That
was the look of confidence.
~ Great face.

715
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,370
~ Through the tyres. Yes.
That does look quick.
~ Very aggressive.

716
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,970
That was the fun one. I liked that.

717
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,810
Second-to-last corner, this is
what normally catches people out.

718
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,250
~ Yeah, that's the one.
~ Through there easily. Through Gambon.

719
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,010
More understeer! A lot of understeer

720
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,660
and across the line! There we are.

721
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,450
That was very good.

722
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,040
And, now...

723
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,210
~ That was strong.
~ It is strong, Mr Will Smith.

724
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,210
Yeah, no, but it was on the left.

725
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,930
~ For me, I'm used to driving...
~ Yeah, yeah. Any more?

726
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,850
I had back surgery
like three days ago.

727
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,210
Who'd like to see the lap

728
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,730
with the poor man with
the back surgery himself?

729
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,340
CROWD CHEERS

730
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,610
Let's have a look. Here we go.

731
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,650
TYRES SCREECH

732
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,900
Whoa! That was some revs!

733
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:30,010
~ Yep.
~ Whoo!

734
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,890
~ Right, this is the one.
~ Did you do a few practices?
~ Yeah.

735
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,090
Yeah, I did a few practice laps.

736
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,490
That's a hard bit of braking
mid-corner, there.

737
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,580
I tell you what, though, that
car - Bubba GM's finest.

738
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,290
Put that power into the
road. Feeling good.

739
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,210
There we go. This is the spiritual
successor of the IROC Z.

740
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,010
I'm on the wall now. They're
putting me on the wall.

741
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,450
My name with all of the fastest
times on this track.

742
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,450
That is a confident man right there.

743
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,290
It's actually lovely conditions
for a fast time, this.

744
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,810
Keeping it in the lines nicely.

745
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,810
Yes. It's just like watching
Daniel Ricciardo all over again.

746
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,450
This is the one that
makes my children proud.

747
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,650
Keep it in there. No
braking. Flat out. Yeah?

748
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,170
~ No braking. Flat out.
~ Good man.

749
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,410
Yep. That's looking very tidy.

750
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,330
Second-to-last corner,
you have any problems?

751
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,610
No, that is neat. Very neat.

752
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,770
And through Gambon.

753
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,130
Still on all four wheels,
unlike some people,

754
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,090
~ and there we are. Across the line.
~ Whoa!

755
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,970
~ That was nice.
~ That was so much fun.

756
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,610
~ Yeah.
~ Well done, you two.

757
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,130
Where do you think you've
come on the board?

758
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,210
I'll be really psyched if I get
on the board, to be honest.

759
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,730
You can't not be on the
it, because, trust me,

760
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,650
Jack Whitehall, Ed Sheeran...

761
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,450
So there's space down there
for me? OK. I want 1:52.

762
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,340
1:52, and Will?

763
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,020
Well, I want, like, 1:22.

764
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,850
~ Oh, you're asking what I think I did?
~ Yeah, yeah.

765
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,170
I think I might be in the 1:50 zone.

766
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,490
Right in there.

767
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,930
~ Somewhere with the Hugh Bonneville...
~ I felt like...

768
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,490
These are wet times. Well,
let's have a look, shall we?

769
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,650
~ Let's have a look. I've got the times here.
~ Oh, jeez. OK.

770
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,930
~ I'm going to did you first, Will.
~ OK.

771
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,610
~ Oh, jeez.
~ This is really exciting.

772
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,770
~ Will Smith...
~ This is very exciting.

773
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,250
~ You did a 1...
~ That's a good start.

774
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,410
~ .. 40...
~ Oh!

775
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,810
~ ..7...
~ Whoa!

776
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,410
~ ..2.
~ OK. Yeah. I'm not mad at that.
~ That is not a very bad time at all.

777
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,690
That puts you...

778
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,330
~ Wow. OK, yeah.
~ That's really great.

779
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,370
I'm not mad at that.
I'm not mad at that.

780
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,570
~ That's not bad.
~ I like that.
~ That is not bad at all.
~ Yeah.

781
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,050
~ And, now, we must get onto your co-star.
~ OK.
~ Oh, God.

782
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,600
If you beat me, this is
your last day on the tour.

783
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,290
I will never work again after this.

784
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,580
It's Leo, Will Smith, and then TV.

785
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,930
Margot Robbie,

786
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,170
~ 1...
~ Oh, good!

787
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,500
~ ..40...
~ What?
~ She'd better not.

788
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,330
~ .. 7...
~ Oh!

789
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,330
She'd better not. She'd better not.

790
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,980
~ .. 1!
~ Oh!
~ Oh!

791
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,820
I'm not making it up.

792
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,810
I'm sorry!

793
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,260
~ Holy
~ BLEEP!

794
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,730
This was a bad idea.
This was a bad idea.

795
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,170
It's like the Academy Awards

796
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,420
where you've got to clap
for the other person.

797
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,810
~ I don't know what to say now.
~ I actually can't believe that.

798
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,570
Both of you have done amazing
times. There was a tenth in it.

799
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,530
Neither of you have got anything
to be ashamed about and it has...

800
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,970
Oh, no! One of us has something
to be ashamed about!

801
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,050
~ I was trying to end on a really high note...
~ No, no.

802
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,090
~ .. coming up with some nice things...
~ Yeah.

803
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,080
.. but you're right.

804
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,490
Ladies and gentlemen, I
think you'll all agree,

805
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,980
this has been an absolute joy.
Will Smith and Margot Robbie.

806
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,090
Right, now we must move
on to some very sad news.

807
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,210
The Land Rover Defender
is going out of production

808
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,730
and our producers thought that that
meant it deserved a fitting obituary

809
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,780
and all we needed for that was
a beach and a rural simpleton.

810
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,290
It's a little known fact that several
of mankind's greatest inventions

811
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,020
have started out as drawings
in the sand on a beach.

812
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,930
Henry Royce of Rolls-Royce fame

813
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,330
made his first sketch
of the Merlin engine,

814
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,050
the incredible motor that powered
the Spitfire and the Lancaster,

815
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,570
in the sand at his local beach.

816
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,770
Norman Woodland, no, I'd
never heard of him either,

817
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,090
was in Miami when he
revolutionised shopping

818
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,740
by drawing the first
barcode in the sand.

819
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,450
And, in 1947, here at Red
Wharf Bay in Anglesey,

820
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,440
it was the same story
for the Land Rover.

821
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,210
The sketch was done by a
chap called Maurice Wilks

822
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,810
who was the Technical
Director for Rover cars.

823
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:13,330
At the time, he used an old Bren gun
carrier to get around on his farm

824
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,170
until, one day, he swapped it for
his neighbour's old Willys Jeep

825
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:23,140
and soon thought, "Hang on. We
can make something like this."

826
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,930
So, he sketched out his
creation in the sand

827
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,580
and a first prototype was quickly
built over the following few months.

828
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,660
Sadly, though, there
was a bit of an issue.

829
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,010
You see, Maurice thought putting
the steering wheel in the middle

830
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,810
would mean they could sell it to right-
and left-hand drive countries,

831
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,400
without having to re-engineer it.

832
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,610
But then they realised that,
amongst other things,

833
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,010
that was going to make hand
signals rather tricky.

834
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,800
So, it was back to the drawing board.

835
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,450
And, a mere ten months
after that shaky start,

836
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,660
the first Land Rover was born.

837
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,570
It came in this green

838
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,890
because the only paint Land
Rover could lay their hands on

839
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,010
was surplus army leftovers
they used for Spitfires.

840
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,170
The body was aluminium, not for
clever engineering reasons,

841
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,530
but because steel
was in short supply.

842
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,250
If ever there was an underdog...

843
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,650
it was this.

844
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,290
Nobody back then could have predicted

845
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,060
what a phenomenon the underdog
would turn out to be.

846
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,210
The military bought
it by the thousand,

847
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,290
and it was used by everyone from
the Medical Corps to the SAS,

848
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,970
while in civilian life, it was
the very definition of versatile.

849
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,250
You could have a Land Rover tank,

850
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,770
a Land Rover train,

851
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,450
a Land Rover conveyer belt,

852
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,290
a snowplough,

853
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,690
a fire engine,

854
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,050
and, rather annoyingly...

855
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,140
a Land Rover hovervan.

856
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,490
If explorers wanted to explore,

857
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,410
adventurers wanted to conquer terrain
that was unconquerable...

858
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,800
they turned to one of these.

859
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,890
It was the first production vehicle

860
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,940
to travel 18,000 miles
from England to Singapore.

861
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,420
The first to cross the Bering Strait.

862
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,090
And the machine of choice
for Ranulph Fiennes

863
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,970
on his epic trans-global expedition.

864
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,250
In fact, at one time,

865
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,530
the first car ever seen by 60% of the
developing world was a Land Rover.

866
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:53,810
And, on top of that, it's been
in production for 67 years.

867
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,970
67 years.

868
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,970
Production run alone makes
this thing one of the greats.

869
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,410
Look at the other icons -
Beetle, I'd say 57 years.

870
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,010
2CV, that was a real
fly-by-night - 42 years.

871
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,650
So great is my love for this
machine that when, 13 years ago,

872
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,130
we ran a Top Gear competition
asking viewers to vote for

873
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,530
the greatest car of all time,

874
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,810
I championed the Land Rover.

875
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,410
And the public clearly agreed.

876
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,200
Because it won.

877
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,010
I drove a Series 1 in that film.

878
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,130
It was old and tatty and worn.

879
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,570
But I fell so completely in love
with it that I actually bought it

880
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,490
so I could restore it.

881
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,530
I'll never forget the day I
brought it home 13 years ago -

882
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,810
it stood in this very
yard like a lost orphan.

883
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,250
So I took it into the
workshop, stripped it down,

884
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,970
and laid it all out on the floor
so I could begin that long,

885
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,850
loving process of restoring
it to its former glory.

886
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,640
And here it is.

887
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,810
Yeah, I mean...

888
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,050
I have been REALLY busy.

889
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,450
And-and the thing is it's...

890
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,450
good to have a lot of spare parts
cos Land Rovers break down a lot,

891
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,810
so you never know.

892
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,960
Can't be too sentimental
about these things.

893
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,770
But because it is the
greatest car ever made,

894
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,860
I must now try to make amends
by giving it a fitting sendoff.

895
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,690
And this is the perfect
starting point.

896
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,650
There are many great
Land Rover TV adverts,

897
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,570
but what you're watching now
is the most famous of them all.

898
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:49,810
This is the one where it winches
itself up a vast, steep dam.

899
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:52,250
'Next time you're late for work

900
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,770
'it's worth remembering that nothing

901
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,620
'but nothing gets in the
way of a Land Rover.'

902
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,650
Now, the thing is...

903
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,770
that advert, as exciting as
it looked, was, I'm afraid,

904
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,210
the result of... shall we say,

905
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,970
the magic of television,

906
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,850
because the Land Rover
didn't winch itself up.

907
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,090
The winch on the front bumper
pulled it the first few feet

908
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,890
out of the water,

909
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,770
but then it was actually hauled
the rest of the way up

910
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,140
by a much bigger winch hidden
at the top of the dam.

911
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,930
So I think you can probably
see what's coming next.

912
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,650
As our tribute to the
Land Rover Defender

913
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,220
we are going to redo
that stunt properly.

914
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,220
Oh... God.

915
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,380
The dam I'll be climbing
is Claerwen in Wales.

916
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,210
It's 1,200 feet wide and,

917
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,410
more worryingly for
me, 200 feet high.

918
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,050
To make things worse,

919
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,930
the Land Rover I'll be
using is 64 years old.

920
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,730
So, in order to do what they
never managed in the TV advert,

921
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,260
we've added some bits.

922
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,930
When they made that advert there
wasn't a winch around big enough

923
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,930
to take on board all the cable
you need to go up a big dam.

924
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,210
So we - well, not Jeremy
and me, somebody else -

925
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,700
has built this ginormous one.

926
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,450
Then there's the matter
of the engine.

927
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,650
You see, when this thing starts to
go up the dam it will go vertical,

928
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,010
and at that point the engine
at the front will cut out.

929
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,090
Problem, because we need the
engine to power the winch.

930
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,410
Solution...

931
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,570
a second engine just for the winch.

932
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,530
Best of all this is
built so it can pivot.

933
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,090
As the Land Rover goes
vertical this stays level.

934
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,090
None of this gave me
much comfort, however,

935
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,740
when I was standing at the bottom.

936
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,930
Oh, bloody hell.

937
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,090
It's much steeper

938
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,770
than the other dam in the advert.

939
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,490
For a brief moment I thought
I was off the hook

940
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,730
because the start point looked
completely inaccessible.

941
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,570
Sadly, the producers
had thought of that.

942
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,780
I hate problem solvers.

943
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,530
And this is just a
little amuse-bouche.

944
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,170
Eventually, I was in place.

945
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,540
The winch cable was
attached to the top.

946
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,100
And it was time to begin.

947
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,210
That's the engine in the back
that powers the winch, remember,

948
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,610
cos of the angle.

949
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,730
Um... I'd love to think of
something else to say or do.

950
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,890
I can't, so I'm going
to go. So, um...

951
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,740
Right, here I go.

952
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,570
Oh, it's tensioning up.

953
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,490
This is OK so far.

954
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,940
Oh! There it is.

955
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,250
Oh, my God!

956
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,300
Oh! Oh-ho-ho! Oh!

957
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,650
I know it's slow.

958
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,580
Any faster and I risk burning out
all the winch motors and things.

959
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,380
Plus, there was an issue with
the face of the dam itself.

960
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,570
The one on the advert was smooth
concrete, this is rough stone.

961
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,090
I didn't take that into account.

962
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,850
What I've got to do is
steer between these rocks

963
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,650
where they stick out from the face.

964
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,130
METALLIC GRINDING Oh! It's jerking.

965
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,930
I'm having to read the surface.

966
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,850
CLANG! Oh!

967
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,370
CABLE GROANS

968
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,620
This vertical off-roading
gave me another problem.

969
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:16,290
Because the Land Rover is winching
itself up on its own winch,

970
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,770
the cable has to feed
evenly onto the drum.

971
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:23,020
If it doesn't do that,
everything gets ruined.

972
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:29,210
I couldn't see the drum, so, up top,
the producers were spotting for me.

973
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,730
Straighten up, please, Richard.

974
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,930
Ah...

975
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,660
Oh...

976
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,570
Oh...

977
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,210
Because it's so slow I've got time
to think about what would happen if...

978
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,650
I can't, I daren't.
I am now terrified.

979
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,890
I am now absolutely petrified.

980
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,210
Oh...

981
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,740
Past the halfway point it
started to get even worse.

982
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,250
I can feel the front wheels
now going very light...

983
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,850
because... where it goes concave,
where it bellies in like that...

984
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,540
my winch cable is pulling the front
of the car off the ground. Oh!

985
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,300
And I can't tell you
how horrible that feels.

986
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,130
Oh-ho!

987
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,330
Stop, stop, stop.

988
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,890
I'm stopping, I'm stopping.

989
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,680
ENGINE SHUTS OFF

990
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,610
~ Honestly, mate, you've
got about 20 seconds, I'm
~ BLEEP
~ scared, OK?

991
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,330
And I mean it.

992
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,290
OK, take your mind off it, take
your mind off it. Um... this...

993
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,250
THUMP! Ah!

994
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,170
The water behind this dam
can supply Birmingham

995
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,810
with 79 million gallons a day.

996
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,890
~ Who gives a
~ BLEEP
~ right now?

997
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,210
It's all right, we're good.

998
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,460
It's really vertical now.

999
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,610
Oh, God.

1000
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,890
CABLE GROANS

1001
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,610
I can hear the lines...

1002
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,860
I can actually hear the
tension in that wire.

1003
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,530
As I get to the top,

1004
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,290
the cable becomes less strong.

1005
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,090
Partly because, as well as the
weight of the Land Rover and me,

1006
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,140
it has to be carrying the weight
of itself and the winch.

1007
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,530
CABLE GROANS

1008
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,490
Oh, God, I'm depending so much
on things made by other people.

1009
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,730
Every single part now - the brake
that stops the winch feeding out,

1010
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,020
the engine - everything.

1011
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,250
In the face of unutterable terror

1012
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,700
I was, finally, nearing the top.

1013
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,160
We have nearly done this,
I've nearly cracked it.

1014
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,930
200 feet of near vertical rock.

1015
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,620
Just a few inches, another
few turns on the winch.

1016
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,730
What a fantastic way...

1017
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,090
to pay tribute...

1018
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,970
to the car... What?

1019
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,210
It was at this point the
producers broke the bad news.

1020
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,090
Because of where the winch
cable was attached,

1021
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:30,330
the Land Rover wouldn't be able to
climb over onto the flat dam top.

1022
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,220
And this meant only one thing.

1023
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,820
I'm going to have to go back down.

1024
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,460
I'm going to have to
winch it down the dam.

1025
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,060
I really need a piss!

1026
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,580
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1027
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,610
Thank you. It was nothing.

1028
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,400
It was nothing.

1029
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:03,210
So... you failed.

1030
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,810
Well, I almost got to the top.

1031
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,250
Yeah, but then you just came
straight back down again.

1032
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,530
I'm sorry, Hammond, if I said, "I'm
going to drive to Bristol," and then

1033
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:14,570
got NEARLY to Bristol and came home
again, that's NOT going to Bristol.

1034
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,490
Look, the main thing is I
gave the Land Rover Defender

1035
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,290
~ a fitting sendoff.
~ Yeah, but they're working
on a new Defender now

1036
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,210
and it looks EXACTLY
the same as the old one.

1037
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,730
So you said you'd drive to the
top of a dam, which you didn't,

1038
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,690
to pay tribute to a car that you
said was about to die, but it's not.

1039
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,170
Yeah.

1040
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,930
Well, that means you're a liar and
you've completely wasted our time.

1041
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,610
Yeah.

1042
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,770
And on that bombshell, I'm
afraid it's time to end.

1043
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,490
Next week normal service is resumed.

1044
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,970
James and I have a lot
of crashes on purpose.

1045
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,100
Hopefully we shall see you then.
Thank you for watching, good night!
