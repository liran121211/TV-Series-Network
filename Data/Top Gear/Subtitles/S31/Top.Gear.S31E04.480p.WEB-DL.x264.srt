1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,040
(calm music)

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,640
(intro music)

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,720
(audience applauds)

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,940
- Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,540
We've got a proper treat
of a show lined up for you.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,060
Tonight, each of us gets to do something

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,540
truly extraordinary and I'm talking

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,460
proper bucket list stuff.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,140
I drive the world's rarest supercar.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,340
Chris drives an actual time machine,

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,420
and Fred drives to Lincolnshire.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,220
(audience laughs)

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,260
- Living the dream

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,660
- But, we kick off with a review.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,340
Isn't that right, Christopher?

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,180
- Yes.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,820
(audience laughs) There's
a new supercar out there

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,140
from Aston Martin and it's
like no supercar seen before

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,420
and rather irritatingly
they sent Patrick McGuinness

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,460
to drive it.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,260
(audience laughs)

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,820
(dramatic sound)

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,960
- [Paddy] Meet Victor,

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,240
a hulking, brooding brute of a machine.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,460
(car engine revving)

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,020
That's part 80s muscle
car, part futuristic racer.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,420
(car engine revving)

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,000
It is seriously powerful,
it's seriously rare.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,720
It's everything you could possibly want

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
from a supercar.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,940
Just look at it, this might
be the best looking car

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,220
I've ever seen.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,500
In fact, I think he might
be the best looking thing

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,820
I've ever seen.

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,380
And when I said it was
powerful, I wasn't lying

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,480
836 horsepower and when
I said it was rare,

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,220
this is the only one
that will ever be built.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,900
And the man who owns it
has kindly lent it to us.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,730
(dramatic music)

40
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,750
(breathes deeply)

41
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,370
- Okay, better be careful, ish.

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,030
(starts car)

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,150
(laughs)

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,250
(car revving sound)

45
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,770
(car throttles)

46
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,330
Oh my word.

47
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:10,070
This is not right, it's gone
mad, it's gone absolutely mad.

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,910
Up front, the Victor's
packing a stonking great V12.

49
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,370
Weighing in at a massive 7.3 litres.

50
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,470
No turbos for efficiency,
no hybrid for economy.

51
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,290
Victor is an absolute old school monster.

52
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,910
As for how fast this
monster will run though,

53
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,250
because it's a one-off,
nobody quite knows.

54
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,090
But what I can tell you, is this...

55
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,850
It'll get past sixty in
first gear, 90 in second.

56
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,210
120 in third,

57
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,670
and I've still got three gears to go.

58
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,410
(car throttles)

59
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,650
Geez Louise.

60
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,050
So in conclusion, nought to
sixty, very, very small number

61
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,450
max speed, very, very big number.

62
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,330
Right, enough of that now,

63
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,690
time to give the old ticker a rest.

64
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,790
(cheerful music)

65
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,870
So, what on earth is this Victor then?

66
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,410
The wild performance is pure 21st century,

67
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,770
but the way it goes about
it is savagely primitive.

68
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,790
Take the interior, a steering wheel

69
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,070
from the Millennium
Falcon, but a gear knob,

70
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,490
from an old Walnut tree,
none of it makes sense.

71
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,270
Until that is, you understand
the decades of Aston history,

72
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,370
that have been poured into it.

73
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,150
(dramatic music)

74
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,430
Think of the Victor as Aston
Martin's Greatest Hits.

75
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,110
This is the ultimate compilation.

76
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,710
The looks are pure old school muscle.

77
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,550
In fact, the designers
took inspiration from this,

78
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,670
their 1970s race car
nicknamed 'The Muncher'.

79
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,990
Then we went to the 1980s
and the V8 Vantage road car

80
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,790
and looking at this, you can already see

81
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,710
the family resemblance.

82
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,430
Then underneath we go
all 21st century Aston

83
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,110
with a 177 supercar.

84
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,790
Same chassis, same engine,
but with extra power.

85
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,390
And to finish it all off, same
steering wheel and suspension

86
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,590
as the Vulcan racer.

87
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,990
(dramatic music)

88
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,270
Of course, to put it another way,

89
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,830
you might say the Victor
is just a big mash-up

90
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,470
of reheated Aston
leftovers, but trust me...

91
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,030
(dramatic music)

92
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,950
Get properly stuck in and you soon find

93
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,050
that as leftovers go, these
are very, very tasty.

94
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,390
(engine revs)

95
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,350
(yells)

96
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,450
Man! Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

97
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,750
Whoo!

98
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,530
(car throttles)

99
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,810
That's- now what we're talking about! COR!

100
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,690
(car throttles)

101
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,010
The steering, the ride, the
way it puts its hammer down.

102
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,410
This doesn't feel like a mash
up, this thing is proper.

103
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,410
(car throttles)

104
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,590
Woo-hoo-hoo!

105
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,630
Yaaay!

106
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,590
(laughs)

107
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,690
That is mad!

108
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,450
But, it isn't half as mad
as what the thing costs.

109
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,310
Now, let's be honest, you're
not gonna be disappointed

110
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,410
that this thing's very expensive.

111
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,370
Well, trust me, you're
not gonna be disappointed.

112
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,090
Because the Victor costs 4 million pounds.

113
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,950
And who cares? They've only made one.

114
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,390
All right, if you're gonna
be all boring and rational,

115
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,470
you could for the price of one Victor,

116
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,430
have 20 new McLarens and go just as fast.

117
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,470
(car engine revving)

118
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,990
But forget boring and rational,

119
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,870
it's a supercar,

120
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,670
it's not supposed to make sense.

121
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,550
Come on.

122
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,270
(car throttles)

123
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,370
Oh my word!

124
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,550
But let's face it,

125
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,630
these bonkers, crazy expensive supercars

126
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,730
are meant to be ridiculous,

127
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,750
they're meant to be daft.

128
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,550
(laughs)

129
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,010
I absolutely love this car.

130
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,370
And the Victor, well, it's
the daftest of the lot.

131
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,070
Do you know what? I love
that stuff like this exists.

132
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,870
And I love that I got
the chance to drive it.

133
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,190
But most of all, I love that
it's still in one piece.

134
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,590
(melancholy music)

135
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,090
Victor, it's been a pleasure.

136
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,990
(car door closes)

137
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,990
(exhales)

138
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,090
Absolute work of art.

139
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,250
(upbeat music)

140
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,130
(audience applauds)

141
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,950
- Stunning.

142
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,790
- That for me is what an
Aston Martin Should look like.

143
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,550
- It's a muscle car.

144
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,710
- It does look amazing,

145
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,390
but even for a one off, 4 million
quid? That's bonkers, Pad.

146
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,110
- Yeah, but the price
literally doesn't matter.

147
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,150
They're only making this
one and it's already sold.

148
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,470
So you can't even buy it, just enjoy it.

149
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,590
- Right, I'm not comfortable saying this,

150
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,230
but I agree with McGuinness.

151
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,150
(audience laugh)

152
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,870
It may be a load of old
Aston bits underneath,

153
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,590
but when it looks like this.

154
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,390
It's brilliant.

155
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,550
- Exactly.

156
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,670
- And now we must move on
because Freddie Flintoff

157
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,190
has an itch to scratch.

158
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,430
I thought that had cleared up.

159
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,350
- I do feel the need
to explain now, Paddy,

160
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,670
Because ever since I started Top Gear

161
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,190
there's one thing I've wanted to do.

162
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,630
I've wanted to learn to race properly,

163
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,100
to become a qualified racing driver,

164
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,870
kind of like what Chris does.

165
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,150
- Ooh, so you're saying that I'm your idol?

166
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,830
- I am not saying that at all

167
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,830
get that straight out of your head.

168
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,590
What I wanted to know was,

169
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,750
can you turn the middle-aged ex-cricketer

170
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,630
with a dodgy knee into a
proper serious racing driver?

171
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,730
So I went to find out.

172
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,010
(dramatic music)

173
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,030
I've had a fascination with speed

174
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,430
ever since I can remember

175
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,750
whether it's cars or cricket balls,

176
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,850
I want everything to be fast.

177
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,030
It's dangerous, you feel vulnerable,

178
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,110
you feel alive.

179
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,830
Rather than say, why do
you wanna drive fast?

180
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,930
Why would anybody not want to?

181
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,270
(upbeat music)

182
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,190
To become a racing driver,

183
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,270
first, you need a license,

184
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,090
and that means you have to take a test.

185
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,070
Mine would be in just two days
time, so to get up to speed,

186
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,530
I'd be getting a crash course
in racing from the experts.

187
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,350
Ginetta is a British road
and race car manufacturer,

188
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,710
one whose driver development program

189
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,470
has produced the likes of W
Series champion, Jamie Chadwick

190
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,610
and McLaren F1 star Lando Norris.

191
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,450
This is a company with
a serious reputation.

192
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,590
One that I'd be trying my best not to ruin

193
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,150
as I arrived at the Blyton Park test track

194
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,890
to meet top trainer, Mike Simpson.

195
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,190
- Wow, hi Mike, this is
proper then, isn't it?

196
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,470
- It is, morning, Fred.

197
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,190
How are you doing?

198
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,870
- All right.
- Welcome

199
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,730
- [Freddie] I've done a few
track days and you turn up

200
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,670
and there's some nice cars out,

201
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,990
but these are proper racing cars.

202
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,990
- This is what we do for a living.

203
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,750
When we start off 14
year old kids actually,

204
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,310
straight from Karting
or school in the G40.

205
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,150
- Not going in that, am I?

206
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,590
- You're not going in that,
we're gonna skip a step

207
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,030
and go straight into the GT4 level G55,

208
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,130
which is a thoroughbred race car.

209
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,950
- Have you seen this show before, Mike?

210
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,990
- I have, yeah, yeah.

211
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,790
- Have you seen me in a car?

212
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,110
- I have, yeah.

213
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,950
- That's why I'm here.

214
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,790
- Oh good.

215
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,710
- Yeah.

216
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,730
- Just thought we should clear that up.

217
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,030
- No, it's fine, I trust you.

218
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,870
(both laugh)

219
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,390
- [Freddie] It's not often
I hear them words

220
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,390
near a car.

221
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,670
(dramatic music)

222
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,230
The G55 GTA is designed
to give drivers like me

223
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,170
the first test of a proper race car.

224
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,510
Its 3.7-litre V6,
produces 270 horsepower,

225
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,230
which doesn't sound like a lot,

226
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,870
but coupled to a full race spec gearbox

227
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,730
in a car that weighs just 1100 kilos,

228
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,270
it gives you plenty to think about.

229
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,050
(car throttles)

230
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,870
- Oh my word.

231
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,310
- Go on, Fred.

232
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,990
(dramatic music)

233
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,910
- I'm going for me racing License.

234
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,390
When I started this job,

235
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,190
this is one thing I wanted to do.

236
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,030
- [Mike] It goes, doesn't it?

237
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,870
- I don't know why I didn't
expect it to be so fast.

238
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,730
But I've got two days
before I go for me test.

239
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,790
It's brilliant.

240
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,630
But at the same time,

241
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,790
I'm aware that I've put meself

242
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,890
under quite a bit of pressure.

243
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,350
- [Mike] Down to third.

244
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,630
- [Freddie] The other thing for me is,

245
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,110
I wanna be decent at it,

246
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,190
so I'm gonna have a real go at this.

247
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,290
- [Mike] Nose in.

248
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,190
Your line discipline's very good.

249
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,150
- [Freddie] Yeah don't be fooled,

250
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,250
I'm not a complete muppet.

251
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,830
- [Freddie] Getting to grips with the car

252
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,930
on a damp and slippery track,

253
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,030
Mike needed to see what he
was really working with.

254
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,130
And that meant going solo, to
lay down my first lap time.

255
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,630
- [Freddie] Rome wasn't built in a day.

256
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,950
Preston might have been.

257
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,550
- Three, two, one, go!

258
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,990
(car engine revving)

259
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,110
(car thuds)
- [Freddie] Whoa!

260
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,550
That was a messy start.

261
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,590
(car throttles)

262
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,390
We're on the gas.

263
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,910
Don't chase it now 'cause
you've had a bad start.

264
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,310
Now get braking.

265
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,990
Get off the brakes, I'm in
hot here, can it hold it?

266
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,590
Oh, I've held it, I've held it!

267
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,130
I felt I was going too
fast, but we're all right.

268
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,140
Yes, there we go.

269
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,760
We've got the nose of the car.

270
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,540
(car throttles)

271
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,200
- 1:24.07.

272
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
We can work with that for sure.

273
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,480
- [Freddie] Baseline established,

274
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,780
it was time for the
real training to begin.

275
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,680
- Second, off the brake. Feed it in.

276
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,920
Go!

277
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,680
Hard now, in a straight line.

278
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,520
Now we're talking.

279
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,520
So you wanna be braking about now,

280
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,640
start to come away from
the brake, on the power.

281
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,000
- [Freddie] Woohoo!

282
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,040
- Go on, lad.

283
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,240
- [Freddie] I did feel a
bit twitchy at sometimes,

284
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,720
but I got out of it, but,

285
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,800
where is he? Not 100%
sure how I got out of it.

286
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,800
(laughs)

287
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
- Control the throttle now.

288
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,600
Yes, now, brilliant.

289
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,680
- He's going well done, and
I'm going, yeah, cheers mate.

290
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,520
Not a clue.

291
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,360
(laughs)

292
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,200
- [Mike] Squeeze the power.

293
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,600
Start to wind the steering off.

294
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,520
Go, go, go!

295
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,280
(car throttles)

296
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,160
Off the brake, second.

297
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,440
Feed it in, catch it if
you need to, catch it.

298
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,280
(screams)

299
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,400
So close.

300
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,580
(laughs)

301
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,680
- It's starting to look quite aggressive,

302
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,880
where before you sort of had a lift,

303
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,000
and then braked a bit and
then braked a bit more,

304
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,720
where now you're flat out, bang.

305
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,560
- Yeah.

306
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,840
- And that's how a racing driver acts.

307
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,640
(car engine revving)

308
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,440
- I think I need to get faster,

309
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,000
but in a controlled manner.

310
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,680
And I know I've only been
doing it for a morning,

311
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,560
but now I've only got
a day and a half left.

312
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,160
(dramatic music)

313
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,040
- [Freddie] And just
to add to the pressure,

314
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,220
the afternoon session would be soaking.

315
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,600
- [Mike] You wouldn't be
able to pitch at the Lords,

316
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,440
would you, like this?

317
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,840
- Oh I'd be well gone by now.

318
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,160
We're cricket, we don't do rain.

319
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,560
(car throttles)

320
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,640
- A little bit aggressive on turning.

321
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,480
Just turned it a little sharp there.

322
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,840
(car throttles)

323
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,000
- That was a kerb wasn't it?

324
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,960
- Yeah, bit of kerb.

325
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,560
The biggest challenge of Fred's
going to be to understand

326
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,600
how much you can ask of the car.

327
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,260
(upbeat music)

328
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,980
So we need to go through a
little bit of pain out there

329
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,840
and make some mistakes, for him to feel it

330
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,360
and figure out where he needs to be.

331
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,080
(car tyres drifting)

332
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,920
- [Freddie] Nearly.

333
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,280
- What, nearly hit the barrier?

334
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,400
(car engine revving)

335
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,720
- Argh.

336
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,220
- He will be a racing
driver by the end of this.

337
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,720
- [Freddie] Day two of training.

338
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,240
And with just 24 hours to
go until the license test,

339
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,640
Harris wanted to check in on my progress.

340
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,400
I was so pleased when I
saw the sun this morning,

341
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,340
when I opened my curtains.
- Yeah.

342
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,760
- It's like don't want no more rain.

343
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,360
Here he is.

344
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,320
Look at him, boy racer.

345
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,720
- [Mike] Popping and banging, all right.

346
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,600
- Andrew.

347
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,480
- [Freddie] How are you?

348
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,440
- Good how are you?

349
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,560
- Really good, actually, really good.

350
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,400
- Enjoyed it?

351
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,740
- I've enjoyed it more than
I thought it was gonna.

352
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,000
I thought I'd like it,
but I've really liked it.

353
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,480
- Okay, weather today's barmy, yesterday?

354
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,280
- Oh it was dreadful, it
was dreadful. (laughs)

355
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,080
- Excuse book.

356
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,040
- It was bouncing down, wasn't it?

357
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,940
You're working on the excuse
book, I like it, mike.

358
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,560
- I'm just giving you facts,
I'm just giving you the facts.

359
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,200
- He did a great job, and we
put him through his paces.

360
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,400
- It was a test of me skills.

361
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,400
- Did you find yourself having
to take it quite seriously

362
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,960
or more serious than you expected?

363
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,080
- I was really focused.

364
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,560
There's no messing about really.

365
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,720
What I didn't do,

366
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,080
I didn't just go gung-ho at the start.

367
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,880
I started easy.

368
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,840
- Normally what you do is you
go 110% and then ramp it back.

369
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,760
- Back, yeah, I went
the other way this time.

370
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,920
- Okay, well I'm loving this.

371
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,560
Well, Fred, at the end of this

372
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,200
and I can't believe I'm saying it.

373
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,000
- [Freddie] Say it.

374
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,860
- You're gonna be a racing driver.

375
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,940
- Well, you know cricketer,
boxer, musical theatre, actor,

376
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,760
philanthropist.

377
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,880
(Chris laughs)

378
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,840
What's that word for-

379
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,680
- Philanthropist.

380
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,520
- That's the one, charity.

381
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,080
- Yeah, yeah.
(laughs)

382
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,480
- What's the one where he does businesses?

383
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,600
- [both] Entrepreneur.

384
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,960
- Right? I'm gonna leave you to it.

385
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,440
- No, no, no, no, you're not.

386
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,080
- Why?
- You're going to put a lap down,

387
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,040
so I've got something to aim at.

388
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,240
- Okay, so what lap time did
he manage yesterday in the wet.

389
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,680
- He did a one minute 24.7.

390
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,200
- Go and get ready.

391
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,600
- I was gonna have a cup of
coffee, but now I'm... okay.

392
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,760
- Want us to warm the
car up for you, Chris?

393
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,560
- Yes please, Fred.

394
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,280
That's what was racing
drivers do, isn't it?

395
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
(all laugh)
- Come on, Fred.

396
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,320
(car engine revving)

397
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,420
- Three, two, one, go!

398
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,780
(car throttles)

399
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,000
- Oh, he's having a right
go here, look at him.

400
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,740
(car throttles)

401
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,360
- [Freddie] This is fast, isn't it?

402
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,680
- Second gear at the chicane,
so he got a good exit.

403
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,800
- This is a technical little
bit, gotta get an apex,,

404
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,560
sacrifice a bit in the middle.

405
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,160
Then going for it and
open as soon as possible.

406
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,040
(car throttles)

407
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,900
- I'm standing back.
(chuckles)

408
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,760
- I don't wanna be anywhere near this.

409
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,600
- Oh.

410
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,340
(car throttles)

411
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,760
- I've always had respect for
Chris Harris, 'course I have.

412
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,000
Probably even more so now.
I've been doing a bit of this,

413
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,160
'cause he bangs on about it, doesn't he?

414
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,960
Me and Paddy just humour him, where now,

415
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm starting to think, fair play, Chris.

416
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,860
You're actually really
good at this, aren't you?

417
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,480
- Hazard a guess?

418
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,360
- 13, 14, somewhere there.

419
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,360
- No, you're quicker than that.

420
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,200
- What?

421
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,240
- 1'11?
- Yeah.

422
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,560
- Probably seven, eight.

423
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,240
- I think I've given you
something to aim for.

424
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,760
- If I get anywhere near
that, I'll be over the moon.

425
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,820
- I know, that's a
serious challenge is that.

426
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,600
- He's saying it's quick.

427
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,400
- No, no, you'll get in there.

428
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
- Well, yeah, we've got some work to do.

429
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,040
- [Freddie] Harris, had just
gone round 13 seconds faster

430
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,180
than anything I've managed so far.

431
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,080
But now, with a dry track to play with,

432
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,480
it was time to see how
close Mike could get me

433
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,760
to that 1'11 benchmark.

434
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,800
(car throttles)

435
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
- There's a hell of a lot more grip.

436
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,680
(car throttles)

437
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,240
The hardest bit is, I've
gotta put it all together

438
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,440
in one lap and then do it
again and again and again.

439
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,400
(car throttles)

440
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,320
- That was a 15 zero.

441
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,400
Little quick, catch it,
catch it, catch it, catch it.

442
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,520
(car tyres drifting)

443
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,220
- [Freddie] Racing requires consistency.

444
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,160
And with training time almost
up, the only way to get that

445
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,980
would be to head out on my own and focus.

446
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,960
- Three, two, one, go.

447
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,700
(car throttles)

448
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,640
- Little bit of a touch on
the brake, bring it round.

449
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,560
One of the things I've found
is if I talk through it.

450
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,440
Mind that kerb, it's the
big one, mind that puddle.

451
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,600
Almost commentating me own
driving, it helps me concentrate.

452
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,080
Into fifth, now on the brake.

453
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,400
And I'm thinking about what gear I'm in,

454
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,120
my speed going into corners, my lines.

455
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,460
If I talk through it,
I'm almost planning it.

456
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,080
Don't go chasing Harris, just drive.

457
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,080
- This is a very
different Andrew Flintoff.

458
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,520
- [Mike] It's measured and controlled.

459
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,240
- Now out.

460
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,980
(car throttles)

461
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,940
Go go go.

462
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,680
- What did he get?

463
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,920
- 1:13:08.

464
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,760
- That's not bad.

465
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,040
- It's not bad at all.

466
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,400
- [Chris] Go!

467
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,360
(car throttles)

468
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,560
- Better start.

469
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,340
- I've had a correction,
keep concentrating.

470
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,560
- [Mike] This looks nice.

471
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,400
- [Chris] This is quick.

472
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
- [Mike] Go on, Fred.

473
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,480
- 13:09.

474
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,320
- [Chris] Go!

475
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,200
(car throttles)

476
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,060
- I think that was really good.

477
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,560
- Yeah.

478
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,160
- [Freddie] Not too shabby.

479
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,000
- Nice.

480
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,400
- I think there was less
messing about there.

481
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,280
- Yeah.

482
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,320
- Don't back off.

483
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,080
(car throttles)

484
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,280
- I think that was a better lap.

485
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,400
- 13:07.

486
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,480
- So that's where he's at, 13:07.

487
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,320
- It's three laps within
a tenth and a half.

488
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,600
That's impressive actually.

489
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,800
(car throttles)

490
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,040
- So that's it, training's over.

491
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,400
- Top job as far as I'm concerned.

492
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,120
The fact that you were
consistent is everything.

493
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,160
- That's right, and that's
what a racing driver's job is.

494
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,720
Consistency is how you win a race.

495
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,960
- The next stage now
is to get the license.

496
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,480
It's gotta be official, exam time.

497
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
- I'm gonna SWOT up tonight, Chris.

498
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,660
(dramatic music)

499
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,560
- [Freddie] My test would
take place the next afternoon

500
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
at Donington Park.

501
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,240
The exam itself is split into two parts.

502
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,520
Practical, and first up, theory.

503
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,380
(dramatic music)

504
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,520
- Hello.

505
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,280
- Hello.

506
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,320
- My name is Stuart Jones,

507
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm your examining instructor today.

508
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,040
- Hey Stu, I'm Fred.

509
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,320
I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't a little bit nervous.

510
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,120
I've learnt all the facts, I hope.

511
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,280
- [Stuart] First section,
second section, third section,

512
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,640
you have to get a hundred percent.

513
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,480
- Yep.

514
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,120
- Fourth section, you've got to get five

515
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,520
out of the eight questions right, okay.

516
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,380
(dramatic music)

517
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,920
- I've been looking to find
out what else I can revise

518
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,940
for the other questions,
and it seems you can't.

519
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,720
It's the first time I've been in a forum,

520
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,800
trying to find out,

521
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,480
but no, they just say it's common sense

522
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,580
and things you should know.

523
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,340
The things that I should know

524
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,360
aren't quite right sometimes.

525
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,720
(chuckles)

526
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,140
(mumbling)

527
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,120
- Are we confident?

528
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,160
- Relatively.

529
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,240
- All right, well we'll put
that in for marking now,

530
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,920
and then we'll go get suited up

531
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,680
and we'll go do our practical.

532
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,640
- Okay, yeah, thank you.

533
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,140
I was banking on that
being the easy bit.

534
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,960
This is the hard bit now, on the track.

535
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,920
And look at the weather,
the clouds are coming in.

536
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,840
We don't need none of that.

537
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,280
It looks like the end
of the world down there.

538
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
We need to get out, and,

539
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,960
yeah, this is the bit
I'm more nervous about.

540
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,400
(dramatic music)

541
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,880
The practical test plays
out over three laps.

542
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,240
Stuart will be assessing
every aspect of my driving,

543
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,240
looking to make sure I had the control

544
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,560
not to pose a risk to
myself or other racers.

545
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,760
(car door closes)

546
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,920
- Things that will fail you instantly

547
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,120
is if I have to take control of the car,

548
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
if you run off the circuit,

549
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,920
if you miss a flag or a light

550
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,560
and I have to tell you
about it, or if you kill me.

551
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,160
(chuckles)

552
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,320
Okay, that's an instant failure

553
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,920
and I will haunt you afterwards.

554
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,260
(chuckles)

555
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,580
Okay, green light tells
us that the track is live.

556
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,640
Okay, make sure you check
for other people on circuit.

557
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,840
- We're all good.

558
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,620
(car throttles)

559
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,920
- [Freddie] Stuart, would
give me a couple of laps

560
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
to get to know the track.

561
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,860
And then we'd begin.

562
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,640
- Right, you're on your test.

563
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,360
Go, go, go, go, go!

564
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,200
Three good laps, Fred.

565
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,160
- I'm coming in, at
this one, coming around.

566
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,760
Little bit of a lift and in.

567
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,080
On the brake.

568
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,120
Drop gear.

569
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,000
On to the brake, drop down,
look for the apex, seen it,

570
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,480
going in.

571
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,760
Onto the accelerator,
braking, looking out there.

572
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,080
To fourth, gonna clip
this Kerb, bit of a lift.

573
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,720
Coming out, coming out.

574
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,520
Feeding it.

575
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,640
- One more lap Fred.

576
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,820
- Onto the brake, now I'm turning in.

577
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,280
Down into third.

578
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,200
Coming round, coming
round, now I'm out of it,

579
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,320
get on, get on, get on.

580
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,770
I can see the apex, I'm coming in.

581
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,250
Middle of the track.

582
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,490
I'm on it.

583
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,370
- Okay, pit lane this
time, pit lane this time.

584
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,830
Nice and easy into pit lane.

585
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,670
Okay, so from a practical point of view,

586
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,810
you were definitely consistent.

587
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,690
I was watching you,

588
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,050
your head's moving all the time,

589
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,930
which is superb.

590
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,410
You're looking through the corner,

591
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,530
you're looking at your mirrors,

592
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,530
you're very aware of what's going on.

593
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,930
You ticked all the boxes

594
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,770
for you to pass your practical tests.

595
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,610
We just need to see

596
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,090
whether we've got you
through your theory now.

597
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,190
Okay.

598
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,110
All right, all right.

599
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,530
So, section one.

600
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,630
- Yeah.

601
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,530
- You got 15 right.

602
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,370
- Yes.

603
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,890
- And you needed to get 15
right, so that was a pass.

604
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,530
Section two, you got three right,

605
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,850
and you needed to get three right.

606
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,730
- Oh thank God for that.

607
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,650
It didn't sound many, three, did it?

608
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,010
- Section three.

609
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,810
Again, you got all the
questions right on that.

610
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,910
On your last one, which is
sort of your general knowledge.

611
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,410
I'm pleased to say you passed.

612
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,530
- Oh get in! No, high
five it, high five it, Stu.

613
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,130
Get in, I can race! Come on!

614
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,050
I didn't pass me driving
test till third time.

615
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,850
- Oh, he tells me that now. (laughs)

616
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,850
Brew time?

617
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,950
- Oh, of course, I'll make them.

618
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,170
- [Crew] Here he comes.

619
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,890
- Has anybody asked for a racing driver?

620
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,530
I don't know, I don't know.

621
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,210
I don't know.
- [Crew] Well done, well done.

622
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,070
- Thank you, thank you.
(crew applauds)

623
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,150
I'm so relieved.

624
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,090
Yeah, I actually drove
all right there as well.

625
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,450
But to get a racing license is one thing.

626
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,550
To call yourself a racing
driver is a whole new game.

627
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,630
(dramatic music)

628
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,710
(cars throttle)

629
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,130
This is the GT Cup Championship,

630
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,170
a Pro-Am series that sees
grids of over 30 cars

631
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,270
racing side by side.

632
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,330
For my first ever race,

633
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,890
I'd be sharing a track with
Lambos, Porsches McLaren's

634
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,990
and Astons.

635
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,810
And raising the stakes even
higher, the car I'd be driving

636
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,910
had gone up a level too.

637
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,630
It's called the GT4.

638
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,970
It looks a lot like the old GTA,

639
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,770
but this one has a hundred
more horsepower, bigger brakes,

640
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,510
more aero and slick tyres.

641
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:26,150
What all that meant was free
practice was an eye opener.

642
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,550
Cars everywhere.

643
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,610
Come on, go on, off you go.

644
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,890
Oh, you (beep).

645
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,330
He was giving me nothing, that lad.

646
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,070
(cars throttle)

647
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,170
I was battling then, I
really was, meself, the car,

648
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,810
everything that's going on.

649
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,570
(dramatic music)

650
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,670
Didn't see you.

651
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,210
(beep)

652
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,330
(cars throttle)

653
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,430
Come on, Fred, you're better than this.

654
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,030
I expected it to be hard.

655
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,210
Not this hard.

656
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,290
(chuckles)

657
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,390
Jesus.

658
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,050
Feeling way out of my depth,

659
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,050
and about as far from competitive

660
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,090
as I'd been since we started.

661
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,410
Mike was doing his best to find
some good in my performance.

662
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,890
- Wait for that front to bite.

663
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,810
So you did a 14.5.

664
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,050
It's good, good progress.

665
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,210
You started on a 23, so good progress.

666
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,310
- Yeah.

667
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,050
A two minute 14 second lap
time was all well and good,

668
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,090
but it didn't take a genius to work out

669
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,610
that to even get up to
the back of the pack,

670
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,550
I'd need to find nearly 10 seconds.

671
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,650
I'm in the deep end, aren't I here?

672
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,610
I need to start swimming.

673
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,110
At the minute I'm treading water, I think.

674
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,410
But with qualifying up
next, which would decide

675
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,250
where in the pack I'd
be starting the race.

676
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,650
In all honesty,

677
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,430
I was just fighting to
keep my head above water.

678
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,850
(car throttle)

679
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,250
Oh, too much speed.

680
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,370
Calm yourself down.

681
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,810
You're driving like a road
car, you don't like that.

682
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,410
Think like a driver.

683
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,050
You're no longer a cricketer.

684
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,150
That ship has sailed, son.

685
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,830
One's off, he's got his
bonnet open as well.

686
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,390
Oh, you absolute (beep).

687
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,970
Making it through just about unscathed.

688
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,890
(car bumps)

689
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,410
(beep)

690
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,430
I had qualified two places
off the back of the grid.

691
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,090
For the race itself,

692
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,250
me and Harris will be driving as a team,

693
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,150
each getting a 25 minute
stint at the wheel.

694
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,050
As I would be heading out first,

695
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,730
while the pit crews were hard at work,

696
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,090
prepping the cars for the main event,

697
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,830
I went to compare notes with my teammate.

698
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,290
It was just a bit of a sensory overload.

699
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,370
You know, you've got all these
people, all these cars,

700
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,730
all these noises.

701
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,690
I don't know if embarrassed
is the right word,

702
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,850
but you've got all these
people there for you.

703
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,410
And then you're thinking,
am I doing all right here?

704
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,810
- Let's face it, normally,
in your other life,

705
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,770
you just rock up, smash it, it's easy,

706
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,650
'cause you can just deploy
ball skills, coordination,

707
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,730
bit of confidence.

708
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,530
This is a bit more involved, isn't?

709
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,370
There's a lot more going on.

710
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,210
You can't just...
- Yeah.

711
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,210
- It's inconceivable
that you'd just rock up

712
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,050
and smash this.

713
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,810
If your noggin isn't quite engaged,

714
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,050
and you're a reasonable driver,

715
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,710
that can be difference between
10 positions on a race day.

716
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,250
- What's your trademark?

717
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,770
- Follow the person that's fast.

718
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,610
- Yeah.

719
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,690
(both laughs)

720
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,970
Is that it?
- Yeah.

721
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,570
- You're like the lad who
copied homework, aren't you?

722
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,670
- Oh, absolutely.

723
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,270
(dramatic music)

724
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,410
- [Freddie] What I really wanted

725
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,250
was to see how close I could get

726
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,530
to a competitive time.

727
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,870
- One minute, boys, till
we start queuing up.

728
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,970
- Yeah, all good.

729
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,170
Maybe, if I could somehow stay in touch,

730
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,450
I might even give Harris the
chance to fight for places,

731
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,670
but that was just the wishlist.

732
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,210
The only real question
was, would all the training

733
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,250
and the testing and the practice

734
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,910
count for anything when it mattered?

735
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,370
- [Commentator] You can see
just how warm it is here

736
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,430
at Snetterton as the cars are
heading out onto the grid.

737
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,250
- A lot of cars for little, Snetterton.

738
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,870
Lot's of very, very, very fast cars.

739
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,070
- Here they come, the big
boys are coming through.

740
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,570
(blows whistle)

741
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,650
This is bonkers.

742
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,030
How do I get myself
into these situations?

743
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,350
Need a wee.

744
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,970
- [Chris] Hey, Fred, all looking good?

745
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,530
- [Freddie] Yeah, all good thanks mate.

746
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,850
- Stay out of trouble on that first lap.

747
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,690
Let them all go off around you,

748
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,250
just stay out of trouble
on that first lap.

749
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,350
- Will do, boss.

750
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,050
Come on, Freddie lad, time to shine.

751
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,250
See what you've got.

752
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,530
(dramatic music)

753
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,350
- [Commentator] So whilst they head

754
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,250
on their final formation lap,

755
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,650
let's guide you through the
grid and the starting drivers.

756
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,290
- Don't stall it, don't
stall it, don't stall it,

757
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,470
he's rolling, he's rolling, he's rolling.

758
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,010
He's away, go on, Frederick.

759
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,870
- [Commentator] This is
where we see number 3,

760
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,450
Charlotte Gilbert starts
alongside car number 19,

761
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,810
which is James Hillary.

762
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,690
The 17th row of the grid is
number 6, Alex Stevenson,

763
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,610
alongside car number 10,

764
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,050
it's a new entry for
the Team HARD Ginetta,

765
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,630
in the hands of Freddie Flintoff.

766
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,690
- Oh, there's a bit of
traffic out on this course.

767
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,790
Look at all the cars!

768
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,750
Ohh nerves.

769
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,610
- I'd love it if there
was a heart rate monitor.

770
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,530
This is a man who famously is ice cool,

771
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,730
but I suspect he's up in the 150s now.

772
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,830
Dripping with sweat.

773
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,250
- We come round these
corners for the next time

774
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,350
we're gonna be off.

775
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,750
- [Commentator] They
start to get themselves

776
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,450
into neat two by two order.

777
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,270
- [Crew] Red, red, red,
red, red, red, red, red.

778
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,890
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

779
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,570
- Round 8 of the 2021 GT Cup
Championship gets underway.

780
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,730
- Just keep them in me sight.

781
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,210
- [Commentator] Contact,
and that's John Seal

782
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,010
who's gone into the back of John Dillon.

783
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,930
- And they're all at it, these lads.

784
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,810
Braking, braking.

785
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,250
They stay in their packs, Freddie-boy.

786
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,030
(cars throttle)

787
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,670
- Come on, Fred.

788
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,770
- [Freddie] I'd survived the first lap,

789
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,610
but with that 2:14 practice
run still ringing in my ears,

790
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,530
it was time to get my head down

791
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,370
and use the rest of my stint

792
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,870
to see how much faster I could go.

793
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,110
- Get in your rhythm.

794
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,610
- Hanging on there, geez!

795
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,710
That was a fastest I've taken that.

796
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,770
- Ohh, come on.

797
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,250
- 40.6, first sector, that's
his quickest first sector.

798
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,330
- You have the weekend already.

799
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,370
- Yeah.

800
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,470
- That's as quick as some
of these up here, look.

801
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,650
- Yeah.

802
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,530
- [Freddie] Russell, you little git.

803
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,810
Oh, I don't know what, stay there you,

804
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,010
stay there, stay there.

805
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,110
- Come on!

806
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,630
- 02'08.5 Wow!

807
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,270
- Oh, well done lads.

808
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,510
- Power, come on.

809
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,770
(cars throttle)

810
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,890
- He's just been overtaken
by a couple of cars,

811
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,130
but crucially, for Fred, he
can see what's ahead of him

812
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,210
and he starts to follow stuff.

813
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,330
And when he's got something
to follow, he goes quicker.

814
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,770
If we could just have a car in front of us

815
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,690
with an Australian batsman on
the back of it, he'd be at it.

816
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,550
- He'd break that record, wouldn't he?

817
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,130
- He'd be at it like a rat.

818
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,370
- [Mike] He would.

819
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,210
- [Crew] Okay, Fred, there's
about 15 minutes remaining,

820
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,610
pace is good.

821
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,770
Thanks mate.

822
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,170
The clock was ticking down
to my handover to Harris

823
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,910
and I was starting to find my stride.

824
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,170
- Wow.

825
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,010
- Mega, that's really

826
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,010
- 39.4

827
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,010
- I mean look up here.

828
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,970
- In the first sector.

829
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,050
- 39s up here look.

830
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,150
This is a mega lap, this.

831
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,350
- Come on, don't tense.

832
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,930
- He's hanging on here, isn't he?

833
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,890
(dramatic music)

834
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,670
(cars throttle)

835
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,170
- [Mike] 02'05.

836
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:48,970
- That's amazing.

837
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,810
- That's perfect.

838
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,890
- That's his best lap by two seconds.

839
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,170
- Another two seconds, yeah.

840
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,530
- Come on, Fred, 2:05.7,

841
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,630
so fastest lap was your fastest lap ever.

842
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,730
- [Commentator] Freddie Flintoff
has done a fantastic job

843
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,090
over the course of this weekend,

844
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,750
and he's picked up more
and more and more pace.

845
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,010
- [Freddie] But this is racing

846
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,690
and I was about to be reminded

847
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,460
that your luck can change in an instant.

848
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,200
(car throttles)

849
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,860
- Cars playing up.

850
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,460
- [Crew] Okay mate, we've
got about 6 (indistinct)

851
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,980
till your stop, just hold out till then.

852
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,480
- Just getting into it, argh.

853
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,640
(dramatic music)

854
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,400
(car throttles)

855
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,200
- [Commentator] And into the
pit lane they start to pour.

856
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,180
- Well, he's just done a 2:08,

857
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,060
but the car went past
and didn't sound so good.

858
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,900
(car throttles)

859
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
- Come on, stay with
me, baby, stay with me.

860
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,780
- Box this lap, Fred, box this lap.

861
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Box, box, box.

862
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,920
- [Commentator] Into the pit
lane comes Freddie Flintoff.

863
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,460
- How bad's the engine, Fred? Is it dead?

864
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,300
- As soon as you get in fifth

865
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,120
and you get your foot to the floor,

866
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,180
when it gets to the top end
it just starts misfiring.

867
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Just see how you think, Chris, argh.

868
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,640
(car engine revving)

869
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,280
- [Commentator] Chris Harris at the wheel

870
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,180
of the GTA Ginetta, could
make his way into the race.

871
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,920
(cars throttle)

872
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,380
- Oh, I've got a big old misfire.

873
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,660
This is gonna be a fairly
torrid few laps I think.

874
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,520
(dramatic music)

875
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,680
Yeah, this is undrivable now.

876
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,920
So sorry, but that is not drivable.

877
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,800
- [Freddie] Just two
laps into Harris's stint.

878
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
- Got nothing.

879
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
It's just died.

880
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
- Our race was over.

881
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Here he is, he's gone.

882
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,260
- Ohh, what a disappointment.

883
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Sorry, Fred.

884
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,540
- [Commentator] Retirement
for the number 10 Ginetta.

885
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,220
A sorry end to the weekend
for Freddie Flintoff

886
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
and Chris Harris.

887
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,180
- So that is the other side
of racing for Andrew Flintoff.

888
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Sometimes it happens like
that, but Fred did so well,

889
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,100
actually, it is what it is, isn't it?

890
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,180
And I'm really pleased for him.

891
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,740
I don't feel that sad at all.

892
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,580
Strange feeling.

893
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,720
Normally I'll be throwing my
helmet around, but I'm not.

894
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,800
(dramatic music)

895
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,700
- So that was disappointing.

896
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,240
But selfishly, I'm actually quite pleased.

897
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,500
All my career, I've struggled with debuts.

898
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,300
I've never thought I've
done myself justice

899
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,060
when I've done something
for the first time.

900
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,940
I reckon this is my best
debut I've ever had.

901
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,260
And we didn't finish,
whether that's a reflection

902
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,420
of how bad the other ones are,

903
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
or how well this one went, I don't care.

904
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,100
From where I was, so nervous,

905
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,340
not wanting to put me foot down

906
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,100
and worrying about the limits of the car.

907
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,140
I was hoping that something'd
happen at some point

908
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,980
where it'd all be put
together, and it seemed to.

909
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,500
I can race, come on.

910
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,620
(car throttles)

911
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,900
You know, I'm still not the fastest.

912
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,020
I'm probably still one of the slowest,

913
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,900
but from where I started, for
me that was an achievement.

914
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,780
And for a moment, probably
two or three laps out there,

915
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I did feel like a driver.

916
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm not gonna spray any champagne.

917
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
But what a weekend.

918
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,540
(audience applauds)

919
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,380
- Gutted.

920
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,740
- Me too.
- Gutted.

921
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,860
- So much fun, so much fun.

922
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,700
- [Chris] That is racing.

923
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,140
- [Paddy] Gutted.
- [Freddie] Ohhh.

924
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,380
- I'm gutted for you.

925
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,220
Look, you didn't finish the race,

926
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,900
but look how happy you both are.

927
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,540
Fred, how did it feel
to be a racing driver?

928
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,740
- I'll tell you what, Pad, I loved it.

929
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,060
I didn't think it'd be that hard.

930
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,700
I've got a new found
respect for racing drivers.

931
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,500
- Yeah.

932
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,260
- And although this lad is not me idol,

933
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,940
I've got more respect
for what this lad does.

934
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,100
He can drive.
- Oh, he can do a little bit.

935
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,900
Now listen, is there any chance

936
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,820
you two'll ever finish a race?

937
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,540
We had it in Baha, we had it in this one.

938
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,220
(all laugh) You've got to
be able to finish a race.

939
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,080
- Oh, yeah, we'd like to, we'd like to.

940
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,880
- You've gotta be able to do it boys.

941
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,700
- And I hate to say it,

942
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,940
I'm behind the wheel
when it breaks always.

943
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,780
- Yeah, there you go.

944
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,620
(all laugh)

945
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,980
- Do you wanna do the
next one with me, Pad?

946
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

947
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,060
- Thank you.
(all laugh)

948
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,140
- You're unbelievable.

949
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,300
- You just said, you break the cars.

950
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,580
- Flipping turncoat you are.

951
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,020
(all laugh)

952
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,860
- Chris, what do you make
of Fred's performance?

953
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,340
- He did a great job, but most of all,

954
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,340
we finally saw the professional sportsman.

955
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,100
The eyes changed, they changed.

956
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,300
- Yeah.
- Dangerous, he was.

957
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,060
And now we must move on because this year

958
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,820
marks the 40th anniversary
of one of the most famous

959
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,460
and strangest cars ever made.

960
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,660
(dramatic music)

961
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,320
The superstar celebrating the big 4-0.

962
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,540
(upbeat music)

963
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,640
is the unmistakable, the
timeless, DMC DeLorean.

964
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,580
Yes, it was four decades
ago, back in 1981,

965
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,500
that this stainless steel wedge

966
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,920
arrived back from the future.

967
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,820
(car throttles)

968
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,860
It would, of course, become
the greatest movie car

969
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,580
of all time,

970
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,740
but not even Hollywood could
have dreamed up the story

971
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,220
of its creation.

972
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,180
A story of supermodels and drug deals,

973
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,740
the story of a man who
would stop at nothing

974
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,120
to change the course of history.

975
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,400
That man was John Zachary DeLorean.

976
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,300
A genius engineer,

977
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,700
born and raised in Detroit,

978
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,700
working at General Motors in the 1950s,

979
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,480
he would go on to develop
Pontiac's legendary GTO.

980
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,360
This was the man that arguably
invented the muscle car.

981
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,060
And in a world of grey suits,

982
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,000
DeLorean was a sharp-dressing,
swaggering, playboy.

983
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,660
He hung out with the stars.

984
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,620
He married models.

985
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,820
He even treated himself
to a brand new chin.

986
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,860
- Probably to be
successful as an executive

987
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,420
you have to have a certain amount of ego.

988
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,300
- That ego, though, didn't sit well

989
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,740
with the buttoned-up world
of boardroom bureaucracy.

990
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,840
DeLorean wanted more.

991
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,740
So in the 70s,

992
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,820
he stomped off to form
his own car company,

993
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,340
one with a grand vision
to create an affordable,

994
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,520
exciting and ethical sports car.

995
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,720
One that he said would live forever.

996
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
Not lacking confidence, our John.

997
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,540
- He wanted a car that was striking.

998
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,020
I remember him saying to me
very early on in the program,

999
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,060
that there were three things

1000
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,500
that were absolutely sacrosanct.

1001
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,980
One was the stainless steel body,

1002
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,580
the other was the rear engine,

1003
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
and the third were the gull-wing doors.

1004
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,140
- [Chris] To sort the styling, in 1975,

1005
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,700
DeLorean turned to the legendary designer

1006
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,100
behind some of the most beautiful Ferraris

1007
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,320
and Maseratis ever made,
Giorgetto Giugiaro.

1008
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,300
DeLorean wanted his car
to look like nothing

1009
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
that had gone before.

1010
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,940
Suffice to say, Giugiaro obliged.

1011
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,040
And all DeLorean needed now
was somewhere to build it.

1012
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,220
Scouring the globe for juicy tax breaks,

1013
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,420
he almost did a deal in Puerto Rico,

1014
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,740
but he ended up on the
other side of the Atlantic,

1015
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,740
here in Belfast.

1016
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,600
(dramatic music)

1017
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,420
In the late 70s,

1018
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,620
Belfast was in the grip
of sectarian violence.

1019
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,340
The Labour government of the day

1020
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,900
reckoned that creating
jobs was key to peace,

1021
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,200
so DeLorean was welcomed with open arms.

1022
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,260
- You know, there's complete
euphoria about this factory.

1023
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,040
In nearly every household
there's an application form.

1024
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,660
- [Chris] Ever the
optimist, DeLorean told them

1025
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,580
he'd build a factory from
scratch in a muddy bog

1026
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,620
on the outskirts of the city
and that he'd deliver the car

1027
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,840
to market in just two years.

1028
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,420
It was an insane timeframe.

1029
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,380
Getting a car from concept to the road

1030
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,460
normally takes about five years,

1031
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,460
and that's assuming you've
got a functioning factory

1032
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,020
and a trained workforce.

1033
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
DeLorean had neither.

1034
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,900
What's more, that muddy bog

1035
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,900
that the factory was to be
built on was in Dunmurry,

1036
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,260
a site sandwiched between Protestant

1037
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,360
and Republican neighbourhoods.

1038
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,500
- We adopted a positive
discrimination policy

1039
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,180
to make sure that we
got a 50/50 workforce.

1040
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,420
And we had a workforce

1041
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,260
that worked together alongside each other.

1042
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,520
There was not one iota of
problem inside the plant.

1043
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,980
- So, improbably the
factory, which is still here,

1044
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,460
came together with barely a hitch.

1045
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,420
The problem was the car was
nowhere near ready to be built,

1046
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,780
but DeLorean had a solution for that too

1047
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,500
and it took him to the
very other side of the UK,

1048
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,900
to Norfolk, the home of Lotus.

1049
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,140
(rock music)

1050
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,260
Wanting his car to be as sharp
to drive as it was to look at,

1051
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,500
DeLorean turned to the
best in the business,

1052
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,060
Lotus boss, seven-time Formula
1 Constructors' Champion,

1053
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,020
Colin Chapman.

1054
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,800
(cars throttle)

1055
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,380
- Colin Chapman had built up Lotus.

1056
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,180
It was selling cars in
every country in the world.

1057
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,500
They were high-performance sports cars

1058
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,540
which were acclaimed worldwide.

1059
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,740
And Colin had achieved everything

1060
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,820
that John DeLorean wanted to be.

1061
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,200
So he knew that if Colin
Chapman took on the job

1062
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,500
and said that he could
do it, he would do it.

1063
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,540
- [Chris] Chapman was
soon to learn, though,

1064
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,740
that while DeLorean has been busy selling

1065
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,060
his cutting-edge sports car dream,

1066
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,840
the actual prototype was
woefully underdeveloped.

1067
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,620
- It turned out it had
no space for a fuel tank,

1068
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,260
it had no space for a spare wheel.

1069
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,460
There were a number of different things

1070
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,880
that the basic packaging had to address.

1071
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,580
(upbeat music)

1072
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,980
- As luck would have it, though,

1073
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,800
Chapman already had a car
to base the DeLorean on,

1074
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,560
his world-class Lotus Esprit.

1075
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,700
And using its chassis and
a modified fibreglass body,

1076
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,160
the new car began to take shape.

1077
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,420
But in order to achieve that all-essential

1078
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,380
car of the future look,

1079
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,400
DeLorean wanted that body
clad in stainless steel.

1080
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,390
- In essence, it was
building the same type of car

1081
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,790
that we were used to at Lotus

1082
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,350
but you had to finish
up with a set of panels

1083
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:02,990
that were all beautifully matched.

1084
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,650
That presented a huge problem in itself.

1085
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,030
- But against all the odds,

1086
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,710
John DeLorean and his team delivered.

1087
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,710
In January, 1981, 40 years ago,

1088
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,810
the DeLorean landed.

1089
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,350
Sleek and sharp-edged

1090
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:29,110
and clothed in that beautiful
bare stainless steel.

1091
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,890
The DeLorean looked truly space-age.

1092
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,270
It was an extraordinary achievement.

1093
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,110
To this day,

1094
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,250
no car has ever reached production faster.

1095
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:48,530
John DeLorean had realised
his sports car dream,

1096
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,970
but there was just one problem.

1097
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,050
It was terrible.

1098
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,990
So bad that sitting here right now,

1099
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,950
I don't quite know where to begin.

1100
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,050
But let's begin with the engine.

1101
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,310
DeLorean was gonna use the rotary engine

1102
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,590
from the Mazda RX-7, cost and
expediency meant he didn't.

1103
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,690
Bad decision.

1104
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,550
What he ended up with was a V6

1105
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,670
that had been jointly
developed by Renault, Peugeot

1106
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,770
and Volvo, producing a not
very exotic 130 horsepower.

1107
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,310
The thing weighed quite a lot

1108
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,230
because of the stainless steel panels,

1109
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,150
so performance was terrible.

1110
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,390
With this manual gearbox
it would do nought to 60

1111
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,270
in nine and a half seconds,

1112
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,790
but it was slower with
the three-speed automatic

1113
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,890
that most Americans wanted.

1114
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,930
So, it wasn't a performance car at all.

1115
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,250
Good Lord.

1116
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,870
It wasn't a very refined car either.

1117
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,110
In throwing it together so fast,

1118
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,470
the engineers had had
to build the DeLorean

1119
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,770
with whatever they could
lay their hands on.

1120
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,430
The brakes come from a Ford Cortina,

1121
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:14,630
the glove box from a
Volkswagen, the door locks,

1122
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,490
Austin Allegro, Gear knob, Renault Feugo.

1123
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,110
You're not really robbing
from royalty, are you?

1124
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,530
And then there's the handling.

1125
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,970
Oh my God.

1126
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,450
It's terrible.

1127
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,230
Halfway through the corner,
if you just back off,

1128
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,830
it wants to oversteer immediately.

1129
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,350
Wow.

1130
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,990
I mean, it's relatively controllable,

1131
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,910
but on a public road, good God,

1132
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,570
it's an accident waiting to happen.

1133
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,250
And it would be an
expensive accident at that.

1134
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,430
In 1981, when this was launched in the US,

1135
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,370
it was the same price as a Porsche 911.

1136
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,870
DeLorean's dream of this
affordable sports car,

1137
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,630
well, it was over before it had even begun.

1138
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,730
It was too expensive.

1139
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,430
But, instead of stopping to work

1140
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,190
on the car's flaws,

1141
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:23,190
in a move designed to show
the world that all was well,

1142
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:25,810
DeLorean ramped up production.

1143
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,210
This was to prove a poor decision.

1144
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,710
- It was a bad time to
be launching a new car.

1145
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:39,290
World markets had gone to
hell in a hand basket in '81,

1146
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,710
there was a massive oil crisis.

1147
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,310
There were people knifing each other

1148
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,870
in the gas queues in Los Angeles.

1149
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,510
- [Man] DeLorean sales are
falling faster than most

1150
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,270
in a thoroughly depressed US car market.

1151
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,550
- It meant, of course, that we
needed financial help again.

1152
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,790
- [Chris] But the political
landscape in the UK had changed.

1153
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,870
The DeLorean backing
Labour government was out

1154
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,850
and the Conservatives were
in, led by Margaret Thatcher.

1155
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,190
- To say that she was unenthusiastic

1156
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:11,790
about putting more money in,
would be an understatement.

1157
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,110
There was no way

1158
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,270
that any more money was
coming from government.

1159
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,990
So it was really down to John in the main

1160
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,050
to find ways to raise investment.

1161
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,110
- And things were about to get worse.

1162
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,950
In a last ditch attempt
to keep the business afloat,

1163
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,390
DeLorean started to do deals

1164
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,770
with people you really
don't want to do deals with.

1165
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,190
In October, 1982, in a
Los Angeles hotel room,

1166
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,970
John DeLorean was arrested
in an FBI drug sting,

1167
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:49,970
apparently doing a deal to
shift 25 kilos of cocaine.

1168
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,470
- In the factory, there was
a mix of disillusionment

1169
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,430
that he could possibly
have done such a thing,

1170
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:59,910
but there was also this
secondary element of

1171
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,390
many of them considering John

1172
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,070
to be the equivalent of Robin Hood,

1173
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,310
the saviour who was prepared to do anything

1174
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,410
to salvage their jobs.

1175
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,350
- [Journalist] Any comments?

1176
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,590
- [Man] The American, John DeLorean.

1177
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,630
- [Anchor] In court this morning,

1178
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,710
John DeLorean was told-

1179
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,830
- [Chris] At his trial two years later,

1180
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,430
DeLorean pleaded that he was
a victim of FBI entrapment.

1181
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:23,010
He was found not guilty.

1182
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,990
- Car maker John DeLorean has been cleared

1183
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,430
of all charges against him

1184
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,450
at the end of his drug-trafficking
trial in Los Angeles.

1185
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,350
- [Chris] But the damage had been done.

1186
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,390
Having built just 9,000 cars,

1187
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,170
the DeLorean motor company was dead.

1188
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,170
John DeLorean's dream was over.

1189
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,510
And that might have been
that for the DeLorean story,

1190
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:57,610
the car and its creator
destined to fade into obscurity.

1191
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:03,850
And then, a year after
DeLorean's trial, this happened.

1192
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,750
- Watch this, watch this.

1193
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,610
- Back to the Future
was a global blockbuster.

1194
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,390
The time-traveling
DeLorean's flux capacitor

1195
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,310
and flaming tire trails

1196
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,650
made it an instant Hollywood superstar.

1197
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,170
- Hah! 88 miles per hour.

1198
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,970
(dramatic music)

1199
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,870
- I'm a Back to the Future obsessive.

1200
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,290
I must watch them every other
week with one of my kids.

1201
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,330
This is, for me, the
ultimate film star car.

1202
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:52,110
88 miles an hour was the number

1203
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,390
that just lodged in all of our heads.

1204
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,590
And there's that famous speedometer.

1205
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,110
And of course it only goes to 85.

1206
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,830
I've never understood why they did that.

1207
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,670
(dramatic music)

1208
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,570
So why choose the DeLorean?

1209
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,830
Well, to use the immortal
words of Dr. Emmett Brown,

1210
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:13,510
"If you're going to make a
time machine out of a car,

1211
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:15,610
why not do it with some style?"

1212
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:17,670
What a line.

1213
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,370
(upbeat music)

1214
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,310
Ironically, had Back to the
Future arrived a bit sooner

1215
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,670
in this space-time continuum,

1216
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:32,310
it might actually have saved the DeLorean.

1217
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:36,030
As it was, this most famous of cars

1218
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:40,990
will go down in history as a
victim of bad luck, bad timing,

1219
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,290
and a bad boy boss.

1220
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,790
But you know what? When
you're driving this car,

1221
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:50,870
none of it really matters

1222
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,270
because it's instantly recognisable.

1223
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,470
Even 40 years after it was launched,

1224
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,190
people know exactly what it is.

1225
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,070
And 40 years from now they'll
still know exactly what it is

1226
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,150
because it's the time machine.

1227
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,830
(car throttles)

1228
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,490
(upbeat music)

1229
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:18,790
In fact, perhaps John
DeLorean did build a car

1230
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,990
that would live forever,

1231
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:24,330
just not quite the way he imagined.

1232
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,970
(audience applauds)

1233
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:36,830
- Yeah.

1234
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:40,550
- The most recognisable film car of all.

1235
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,750
- I'll tell you, amazing story.

1236
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:46,670
Amazing eyebrows.

1237
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,510
- Oh yeah.

1238
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,710
- And what a chin.

1239
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,310
- I can't believe how
futuristic it looks, even now.

1240
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,910
- Yeah, I don't know they did it.

1241
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,590
- I reckon they shaved a bit round here

1242
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:55,790
and then reshaped it.

1243
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,950
(audience laughs)

1244
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,750
- Huh?
- It's the car, not the chin.

1245
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,670
- Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

1246
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,190
All right then, I suppose
if you want attention,

1247
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:07,590
outside Harrods, forget your
Bugattis and your Paganis,

1248
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,230
get yourself a failure from Belfast.

1249
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,070
(audience laugh)

1250
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,030
made out of old Lotus bits.

1251
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,470
- And no question, the
second greatest movie car

1252
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,310
of all time.

1253
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,150
(chuckles)

1254
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,510
Don't even go there, that is the greatest.

1255
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,350
- Excuse me.

1256
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,190
- Yeah.

1257
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,870
- James Bond? DB5?

1258
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,910
- Oh, relax, lads, relax.

1259
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,750
What about Herbie?

1260
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:24,910
- Ooh, Herbie.

1261
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:25,730
Show a bit of love, show
a bit of love for the bug.

1262
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,550
(laughs)
Herbie!

1263
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,710
- Does the DB5 have a flux capacitor?

1264
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:29,990
Does Herbie have a flux capacitor?

1265
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,430
No, game over.

1266
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,910
- Listen, you go back in time

1267
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,190
every time you open
your wardrobe to the 70s

1268
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:35,990
by the looks of things.

1269
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,110
(all laughs)

1270
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,590
- You should go back in time
and visit your hair. (laughs)

1271
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,150
- It's come back, no need for that.

1272
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,030
(all laughs)

1273
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,430
- We must leave it there

1274
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,270
because we're out of time time.

1275
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:47,990
Next week it's all about the youth,

1276
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:51,710
as we try to find the best first
cars for brand new drivers.

1277
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,390
We're gonna need a TikTok account.

1278
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,590
Thanks so much for watching.

1279
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,430
Good night.

1280
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,270
How dare you.

1281
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,250
(audience applauds)
