1
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,570
Tonight, we're discussing
a very contentious issue,

2
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,219
something that has really
split the nation. This is big.

3
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,700
This is bigger
than putting pineapple on a pizza,

4
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,059
which I'm OK with.

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,659
Nothing wrong with that, Pad.
Correct.

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,599
Cos tonight, ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,700
we're going there.

8
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,179
We're tackling the big one.

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,059
We're talking about...

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,149
caravans.

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,700
Ooh!

12
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:01,379
Now, as you're probably aware,
over the years,

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,659
Top Gear has had a bit of a bumpy
relationship with caravans.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,499
It has, but things
are different now.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,009
Us, we're all about caravanning.
We grew up in them.

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,859
Well, we did.
He's more of a villa man.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,649
Can't put the staff in a caravan,
can you?

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,369
Anyhow, point is, caravans,
we love them

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,139
and we're here to tell you
that things are changing

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,659
in the world of caravanning.

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,970
Take a look at this.

22
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,139
The humble caravan.

23
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,949
For decades,
this darling of the nation

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,859
has provided millions of us
with fun, affordable freedom.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,499
The only thing is there's a chance
the world of caravanning

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,889
is just starting to look a bit
old-fashioned.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,169
After all,
this is the 21st century.

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,580
We want to go further, be better

29
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,300
and we reckon
there's a revolution coming.

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,899
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,660
And the future of caravanning starts
with something called...

32
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,810
the MINK.

33
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,539
Just look at it.

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,379
It's sleek, it's minimal,
it's all-terrain.

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,660
It's exactly what caravanning
should be.

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,889
This is what's called
a micro-caravan

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,689
and it's being towed
by 56 grand's worth

38
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,500
of all-new, all-electric
Polestar 2.

39
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,249
And it looks like the future,

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,899
because it is the future.

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,939
It's relaxing, refined, it's silent.

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,889
You really do feel
like you're getting away

43
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,300
from the hustle and bustle.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,689
Now, Polestar says you can get
nearly 300 miles on a full charge,

45
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,059
and with 400 horsepower
four-wheel drive,

46
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,610
it'll get your caravan
anywhere it needs to go.

47
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,749
But there's more than one way
to start a caravan revolution.

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,949
So to see what the other two
were running,

49
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,139
the first place we needed to go

50
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,940
was a Seaview caravan site
in Berwick-upon-Tweed.

51
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,249
Oh, it's getting some looks,
this fella.

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,379
Morning. Morning, you all right?

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,019
I don't know if he likes it or not.

54
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,739
And as you'd expect,

55
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,809
McGuinness had already made himself
right at home.

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,539
Ah!

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,019
This is the life, Geoff, innit, eh?
Just the job.

58
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,659
Is that an Occasion 640
you've got there?

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,169
Fine caravan.

60
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,099
Oh, here he is.

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,689
Here he is. Look at him!

62
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,169
Oh!

63
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,410
Just in time for breakfast.

64
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:49,669
Oh, Paddy McGuinness
in his natural habitat.

65
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,019
Hey, Polestar 2. Very, very nice.

66
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,460
A little bit of Scandinavian
chic in Northumberland.

67
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,379
Yeah, but what's that?

68
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,939
That, Paddy, is the MINK.

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,859
Look at it.
I say, it's very stylish.

70
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,179
It's a nice-looking thing.

71
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,829
I want to know about this one here.
Oh. Come on. What have you got?

72
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,819
The Go-Pod Platinum.

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,219
Platinum, of course.

74
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,340
Top of the range.

75
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,460
This has got everything
that's in a bigger caravan,

76
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:15,659
it's just shrunk down.

77
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,739
It's perfect.
It's light, it's nimble.

78
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,259
I don't want to nit-pick, Paddy,

79
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,409
but it's meant to be
caravan of the future.

80
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,099
Yeah. That's like caravan
of the present,

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,409
but shrunk in the wash.

82
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,609
Oh, no, it's got everything.

83
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,369
Flat screen TV, USB points,

84
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,049
cookers, fridge, bedroom.

85
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,179
It's got the lot.

86
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,969
Come in.
Have a look round. Yeah.

87
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,939
So, what we've got here...

88
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,519
Go on. What have we got?

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,669
What we've got here...

90
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,099
This is, like, the living room.

91
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,619
This is nice, here.

92
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,779
And you've got
everything you need, though.

93
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,859
Everything you need!

94
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,699
If you just turn round
this way...

95
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,939
You say it's got everything
you need! You've got a bed.

96
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,309
I mean, it's like home from home,
this.

97
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,969
Home from home,
if you live in a small home.

98
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,460
Hey, toilet, you say?

99
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:00,299
Here we are.

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,830
This is what you want.

101
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,461
What's that?

102
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,389
Bang. Have a sit on that.

103
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,229
I did say sit.

104
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,340
Come to... No, not now.
Just test it out. Just have a...

105
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,530
Eh? I... How's that?

106
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,059
I'd fill this!
I was going to say...

107
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,829
You're a big lad.
How much room in there is there?

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,979
I like it, Pad. It's all you need.

109
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,859
That's what life on the road
is all about. I like it.

110
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,019
I'm not sure about the boring
electric car on the front, though.

111
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,669
The Merc.
Come on, please.

112
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,299
It's boring, innit? Come on. Please.

113
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,419
Have a look round.

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,899
We're in the world of caravanning.

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,879
People love an SUV,

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,969
so Mercedes have gone,
"Well, there you are."

117
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,539
"There's an electric one."

118
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,669
Look at the inside of it.
Look, it's a fantastic motor.

119
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,259
It is all right, actually. Yeah.

120
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,379
Now, I want to know about this MINK.
Yeah, I'll show you around.

121
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,499
I've never seen one.

122
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,059
It won't take long. No!

123
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,139
Look at it. Here we go.
Look at that!

124
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,179
You've got your panoramic roof.

125
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,699
You've got mood lighting.

126
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,249
You've got all your
Scandinavian sheets.

127
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,059
Wool. You keep going,
"You've got this, you've got that,"

128
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,899
but essentially you're saying
that just about a bed.

129
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,829
No, it's not just a bed.
You're going,

130
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,409
"You've got a bed,
and then you've got a pillow

131
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,179
"and you've got, like, a headboard."

132
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,819
Yeah. Aside from a bed,
what else have we got going on?

133
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,659
I'll take you round the back.
Got a kitchen. Come on. Yeah.

134
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,819
Oh, look at that!
Oh, see, that's nice.

135
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,210
We've got all the appliances
under here.

136
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:30,169
Prep kitchen. Lovely.
Chopping board.

137
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,109
Sink. Look at it.
We've got a stove.

138
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,899
Do you know what?
It is very Scandinavian.

139
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,380
It's cool. Yeah.

140
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,460
Honestly, the good people of Seaview
didn't know what had hit them.

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,909
And for anyone wondering
how Harris was going to top

142
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,189
these two game-changers...
Morning, Chris.

143
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,259
the answer was...
Morning, all. How are we?

144
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,389
he wasn't.

145
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,099
Audi e-tron Sportback
55 Quattro S Line.

146
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,779
I'm not bothered. What about that?

147
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,899
That's the OPUS.

148
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,351
Are you doing a tip run?

149
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,129
The world's first self-inflating...

150
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,899
You can't throw fridges away.

151
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,699
The world's first
self-inflating caravan.

152
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,470
Sleeps ten. Sleeps ten?

153
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:13,699
Let me show you.

154
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,569
This is the matter of a minute.
Watch this.

155
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,850
Oh, here we go.

156
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,750
Nut gun.

157
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,549
So it turns out the OPUS
is from that special corner

158
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,029
of the caravan world

159
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,969
labelled, "Some assembly required."

160
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,259
Come on. Good lads.

161
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,179
Are you doing it all? Jesus.

162
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,099
And while Harris got busy
ruining everyone's holidays...

163
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,259
What is he doing?

164
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,379
Sorry.

165
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,129
we tried to at least keep
Geoff onside

166
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,210
with a spot of caravanning's
number one sport.

167
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,220
Go on, Geoff.

168
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,850
Oh, that's a good shot,
Geoff. Go on, Geoff. Hit it!

169
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,259
La, la! La, la, la, la!

170
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,030
Ah, nothing to see here.

171
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,859
Oh, hit it, Geoff.

172
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,989
Joan, Joan! Get Geoff's angina
tablets ready just in case.

173
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,569
Anything can happen, here.

174
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,620
Safety first.

175
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,350
I think my first holiday
was in Morecambe in a caravan,

176
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,129
and I think it never leaves you.

177
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,340
We used to go to a static just
over the border in Scotland. Lovely.

178
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,210
That my Auntie Josie had.
Yeah. Never met my Auntie Josie.

179
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:31,819
No. I don't know if my dad just
broke into one. I never met her!

180
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,770
We went every year for ten years.
"It's your Auntie Josie's!"

181
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,659
Why have you got a crowbar, Dad?

182
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,110
Lads, she's ready.

183
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,939
And she was magnificent.

184
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,059
Ooh! Two and a half metres
of headroom.

185
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,429
Here we go.
Do you know what? I like this.

186
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,629
Just got a few things
to finish off here. Look.

187
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,699
Put this extra seat in here for you.

188
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,460
In she goes. Bit of Velcro.

189
00:08:57,461 --> 00:09:00,489
It's like a seat on a yacht, that,
isn't it? It is, innit?

190
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,779
OK. And table.

191
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,350
That's for your dinner.

192
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:06,019
OK, and...

193
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,499
fridge.

194
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,899
Double gas hob.

195
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,709
Right. You're sitting on the sink.

196
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,500
Want to watch a bit of TV?
Portable projector, and...

197
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,739
Oh. Oh! Oh!

198
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,579
Oh! Outstanding, sir.

199
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,189
Look at that. Well done, Chris.

200
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,350
I'm actually impressed, Chris.

201
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,909
Yeah. That's cos it is impressive.

202
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,470
Right, well, what's next?
Very nice.

203
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:31,220
Now we've had the show and tell,
let's get on the road.

204
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:34,649
What do you mean, get on the road?
I've just unpacked it. Lock her up.

205
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,109
Hey, as we say in the world
of caravanning, let's tour.

206
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,700
Is that what they say? Yeah.

207
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,829
You know what, Paddy?

208
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,299
This Polestar really picks up
when you put your foot down.

209
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,849
Staying at 50 is going to be
a bit of a challenge.

210
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,419
That's the thing with these caravans,

211
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,109
they're so light and nimble, you
don't even know you're towing them.

212
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,220
If you've got a
Bailey Unicorn 4 Berth on the back,

213
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,040
you're all over the shore,
but these... It's a dream.

214
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,269
To see if our caravans
of the future

215
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,989
really were as go-anywhere
as we reckoned,

216
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,759
we've been told to head to a remote
overnight camping spot

217
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,110
high on the Northumberland moors.

218
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,419
That meant we had plenty of miles
to get to grips

219
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,130
with our trusty electric steeds.

220
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,179
Now, one of the things that drives
me mad about electric cars

221
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,119
is this incessant need
to shake things up.

222
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,629
"Let's do something different."
Why?

223
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,099
Why reinvent the wheel

224
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,499
when the wheel works perfectly fine
on its own?

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,579
And that's why I like the EQC.

226
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,059
It doesn't have to scream
and shout, this thing.

227
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,260
It's nice and simple,
and it's all the better for it.

228
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,749
All right, the price isn't simple.

229
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,709
But 65 grand does
buy you 400 horsepower.

230
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,189
You'll get to 60
in about five seconds

231
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,989
and with more torque
than Fred's Polestar,

232
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,270
if you want,
you can tow a bigger caravan.

233
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,709
And unlike the Polestar,

234
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,940
you won't have to spend 20 minutes
explaining to people what it is.

235
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,739
Fair point.

236
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,829
But if you're after a badge
that needs no introduction,

237
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,590
let's face it,
other options are available.

238
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,379
Audi released its e-tron
SUV a couple of years ago,

239
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,179
but this is the Sportback version.

240
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,989
A bit lower, a bit funkier looking
and of course,

241
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,829
a bit more expensive.

242
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,046
As tested,
this is a sniff under 90 grand.

243
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,116
That's a huge amount of money,
but then again,

244
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:39,596
it's a lovely object.

245
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,046
The interior is gorgeous.

246
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,556
I love the screens.

247
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,636
I love the layout.

248
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,956
It looks great.

249
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:49,836
Your kids are going to think you're
the coolest mum or dad out there.

250
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:52,977
Although not perhaps
the quickest.

251
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:57,457
Like the other two,
the e-tron has 400 horsepower,

252
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,756
but only when you put it
in boost mode,

253
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:02,116
which lasts for eight seconds.

254
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,886
The rest of the time you get
about 350,

255
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:07,047
so it's a bit down on punch.

256
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:10,317
Do you know what, lads?

257
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:13,356
Isn't it just nice to be out
driving our electric cars

258
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,916
with our little,
tiny ecofriendly caravans

259
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,486
with big wind turbines
in the distance?

260
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,687
It doesn't get
greener than this, boys.

261
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,276
It doesn't.

262
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:27,166
But if we're honest,
it could get a bit cheaper.

263
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,986
I've got to tell you, lads,
this MINK is beautiful,

264
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:33,436
but this one starts at 15 grand.

265
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:36,476
That is an expensive bed.

266
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:39,826
My Go-Pod's 15 grand
and there's a bit more to it.

267
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,686
You can stand up in mine.

268
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,596
How much is that blow-up tent,
Chris?

269
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:47,687
It's £20,000.

270
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:54,116
Sorry? I thought you said
the blow-up tent was £20,000.

271
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:56,756
But it's complicated
and it's massive.

272
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,437
It does mean that I've got quite
an expensive rig, though.

273
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,756
The truth is, we all had.

274
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:05,996
There's simply no denying that
all-electric,

275
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:09,967
go-anywhere caravanning
is an expensive business.

276
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:14,687
So are these pricey pioneers
really up to the job?

277
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:16,916
To start finding out,

278
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:21,967
we were told to make a quick detour
off the beaten track for a test.

279
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:25,686
I'm going to go and have a look.

280
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:28,246
Are you getting it, Chris?
Yeah. Oh.

281
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:31,166
As designated reader...

282
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,077
the one that can read,
I'll read. Yay!

283
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,846
Time to see which of
your caravans

284
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,646
is best suited
to the adventure lifestyle... Yes.

285
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:39,967
with a hill climb.

286
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,156
That's the hill. Cars starts
at the bottom of the hill. Yeah.

287
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,717
You start at the top.

288
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,686
Cars start at the bottom,
we start at the top.

289
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,126
Well, how does that work?

290
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,967
How are we going to get down?

291
00:13:56,797 --> 00:14:00,636
In a giant inflatable ball,
obviously.

292
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:01,766
Oh, ey!

293
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,966
Oh, wow! Oh.
Let's get him in. Get him in.

294
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,257
I'm stuck!

295
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:10,486
Oh! Shot in.

296
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:11,917
We got him in.

297
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:14,717
Can you see the head?

298
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:20,077
You're crowning. It's a boy!
He's crowning, he's crowning.

299
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,126
Yes, because apparently adventurous
lifestyle types

300
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:25,406
go in for this sort of thing.

301
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,406
With our cars waiting
at the bottom,

302
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,917
we'd now each take turns
rolling down to meet them.

303
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,646
Best of luck to you.
Oh, yeah. You mean that?

304
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,686
- Three, two, one...
- Go!

305
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:40,536
Oh!

306
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,796
Blooming heck, what's going on here?

307
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,356
Oh, oh, no.

308
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:46,276
Oh, no.

309
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,686
Oh, this is awful.

310
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,917
Jeez. Oh.

311
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:53,046
Oh, my God, no.

312
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,276
No, thank you.

313
00:14:57,717 --> 00:14:59,486
Whoa, whoa!

314
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,566
Is this meant to be fun?

315
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,716
That's horrible. Oh!

316
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:08,486
Who does this for fun?
Have we stopped?

317
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,276
This is the thing, getting out.

318
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,327
Did I start the stopwatch?
52 seconds.

319
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,966
Did you start the stopwatch?
Is it still running? Yeah. Right.

320
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,197
Ah, I'm in mud.

321
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,966
Oh, he's out. He's out! He's out.
Let's go, folks. He's gone.

322
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,796
It's a fair distance through there.
He's going through the swamp.

323
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:26,276
It's a fair distance, innit?
Look at him go. Look at him go.

324
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:28,407
This is where he'll make
his time up.

325
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,217
Here we go.

326
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:36,616
Here we go. We're off.

327
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,567
Blooming heck.
Let's get moving.

328
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:44,156
Oh, there's a caravan on the back.
I forgot.

329
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:47,516
It's already going
faster than he wants it to. Yeah.

330
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:49,286
Blooming heck.

331
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,636
Get up here.

332
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:53,876
Come on.
Come on, put your foot down.

333
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:56,126
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

334
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,606
Come on.

335
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,327
Go, go, go.

336
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:00,566
I'm out of breath.

337
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:01,617
Come on, Fred.

338
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:06,166
Oh, thank God for that.

339
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,207
251.63. Right.

340
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,517
Oh, he's back. Oh.

341
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:15,446
Minging.
First of all, how do you feel?

342
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:18,486
Oh, I'll tell you what,
it was awful.

343
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,556
Is it?
Do you care what your time is?

344
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,596
No. No, I didn't think you did.
251.63.

345
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,156
I think it's a strong time,
actually.

346
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:27,356
Based on what? On the fact that
neither of us are going to do it,

347
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:29,716
so it's the winner. Shut up.

348
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:31,726
It looks like it's the winning time.

349
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,126
Shut up. I'm having a bad day, here,
all right?

350
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,338
I'm having a bad day, all right?

351
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:41,126
But not quite as bad as McGuinness.

352
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:44,436
Oh, oh!

353
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,596
Oh, yes. Oh, he's in.

354
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:47,296
Very slick.

355
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,846
I'd just like to commend you
on your entry technique.

356
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:52,567
He's not going to like this at all.
No, he's not.

357
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:55,876
What are you looking at?

358
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:58,236
What are you doing?
Why are you there? Get back in.

359
00:16:58,237 --> 00:16:59,726
That was enough for me. Shush!

360
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,166
I already started feeling...
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!

361
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,087
I already started feeling
a bit nauseous, lads.

362
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,486
What? I can't...
Look, anything, lads, but that.

363
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:08,876
What, you're genuinely not...?

364
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,436
That's my Achilles heel.

365
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:12,446
Is there a punchline coming here?

366
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,367
Er, no.

367
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:21,087
So it turns out tumbling down hills
with no control whatsoever

368
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,006
is McGuinness' kryptonite,

369
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,957
but still keen to lay down a time

370
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,217
with a flag in the ground
where Flintoff ended up to aim for,

371
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:33,056
we agreed he could start
his run on foot.

372
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:36,496
Chris, send him off.
On your marks, get set, go.

373
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,806
Chris. Get out the way.
I'm going to take him.

374
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,657
No, no, no, no. No, no. No!

375
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:46,406
Come on. Paddy, watch out!
Go on. Go on, go on!

376
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,407
Go on! Go on!

377
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:03,286
Oh, my God.

378
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,726
You just ran him over with
an orb. Look at him.

379
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:12,496
Well, he's down there in
33 seconds.

380
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,646
He doesn't have to wear
a harness or anything.

381
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,636
I think this next stint could be
a bit longer, though. Watch this.

382
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,937
Oh, I'm absolutely BLEEP.

383
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:23,286
It's a bit boggy down there.
But it's 52 seconds.

384
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,447
It took you ages to get out.
He's gone.

385
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,856
He's absolutely done.

386
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:32,007
He's done.

387
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,577
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

388
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:50,726
Oh, my. My lungs are on fire.

389
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,576
I'm worried about this caravan.

390
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:53,607
Come on.

391
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,967
That was literally
the worst thing ever.

392
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,077
Oh, my God.

393
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:02,686
Here we go.
He smashed this.

394
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,936
He has smashed this.
He was always going to.

395
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,726
Oh, thank God that's done.

396
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,576
Over now.

397
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,527
He's beaten you by 40 seconds.
2.11 minutes.

398
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,047
Now we'll get the full... I'm so
excited. He'll be yammering it up here.

399
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,327
Brilliant. Really good.

400
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,416
That were like
the most low-rent version

401
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,856
of Raiders of the Lost Ark ever.

402
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:38,297
Let me tell you,
I didn't appreciate that, lads.

403
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:40,846
So, that is a result.

404
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,246
Sadly, you did it in two minutes,
11 seconds.

405
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:47,676
40 seconds quicker. Ouicker.
Great. I'm pleased about that.

406
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,352
Er...

407
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,654
Yeah. Any Daz?

408
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:54,774
Can you put mine on a clothes wash
as well?

409
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,484
Literally, I couldn't speak all
the way up in that car.

410
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,564
Well, that saves the viewer
some pain, doesn't it?

411
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,956
Should get him running more, then.
Yeah.

412
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:06,164
After my lightning run

413
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,164
it was time for Harris and his Audi

414
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,484
to give it a whirl.

415
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:10,514
Oh!

416
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:15,364
And, having been
so generous with my go...

417
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:16,684
Anyone got any Vaseline?

418
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,684
the least I could do for him

419
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,564
was return the favour.

420
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:23,924
Now, Chris, because we want
you to win

421
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:26,205
we're going to try and get
you going a bit quicker.

422
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:29,524
So me and Fred will probably
stop pushing halfway down the hill.

423
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,004
You're such...

424
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,134
What's he laughing at?

425
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,884
I might even push you up the hill.

426
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,844
Do I have to do it?

427
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:39,004
Three,

428
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,935
two, one, go.

429
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:49,804
Oh!

430
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:54,925
Our lad's giving it some of that.

431
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,654
Oh!

432
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,044
Oh!

433
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,244
Oh, no, he's not even stopping.

434
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:02,724
Oh!

435
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:08,004
Oh, it's bouncing.

436
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:13,654
Oh, please stop.

437
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,444
Please just stop
the horrible bouncing.

438
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,804
This is the bit now
where it took ages.

439
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:25,804
I tell you what, the speed we pushed him and
then he were down in about 20 seconds. I know.

440
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:27,444
Oh, I saw a hand.

441
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:28,794
Oh, there he is.

442
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,205
He is born again.

443
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,524
Go on, Chrissie.

444
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,804
Oh, he's taking the easy...

445
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,524
Oh, he's not gone through the bog.

446
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:37,225
Oh, come on.

447
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,534
We've got this.

448
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:40,164
We've got this.

449
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,215
He's going like a little angry
gazelle.

450
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:44,295
Yeah.

451
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,374
Seat belt on.

452
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,795
Drive, come on, Audi.

453
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:57,045
Vorsprung durch flipping technik.

454
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,394
She's going well.

455
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,445
Trailers just about there.

456
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:06,894
So weird with the silence.

457
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,244
Come on, Audi!

458
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,164
I wonder if he's talking
about the capabilities of the SUV?

459
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,474
Oh, he'll be saying nothing.

460
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:15,174
He might have done a review of the
ball when he were going down?

461
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:16,864
"Lovely traction".

462
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:19,394
There's no way I'm losing
to Flintoff.

463
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,614
I don't care about McGuinnis.
He's not even in the game.

464
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,035
Oh.

465
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:26,975
There we go. Good run.

466
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:28,835
Oh, here he is.

467
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:30,565
Here he is, well done, Chris.

468
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:34,404
He looks a little bit peaky.

469
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:36,254
All right? No, horrible.

470
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,604
Absolutely horrible.

471
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,174
You got some nice speed
up down here.

472
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:42,764
Well, it was airborne, largely because you
were still pushing it halfway down the slope.

473
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,095
I was doing you a favour.
I want you to get a good time.

474
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:46,574
You got two minutes... Yeah.

475
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,734
43.. Oh!

476
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:48,975
43.44.

477
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,934
It's an annihilation but it's between
you and me. You don't matter.

478
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,174
I think the victory is mine.

479
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,684
Are you really claiming that?
I've had to run down the hill

480
00:22:55,685 --> 00:22:57,164
another bloody ball roll over me.

481
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,404
I'm claiming it.

482
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:00,164
Can we sort this out
over a cup of tea? Yeah.

483
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:01,654
Let's go to the Go-Pod.

484
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:04,325
Are you going to put the kettle on,
Pad? Yes, I am.

485
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:20,404
Andrew Flintoff, that was some
of your strongest work.

486
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:24,124
I could watch a replay of you
wanging a large, inflatable orb

487
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,884
at that over and over again.

488
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,724
Forget the 2005 ashes.
One of the finest deliveries ever.

489
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:31,474
Never lose it, Chris.

490
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:34,364
Fair dues, Pad, you played the
bouncer well. Got right underneath it.

491
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:36,114
Hands out the way, textbook.

492
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,804
I have no choice, really, did I,
but to be honest,

493
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:41,004
I'd sooner to be under it
than in it.

494
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,294
Sounds wrong.

495
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,814
But enough about me being
steam-rolled by a giant ball.

496
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:46,454
Let's get back to basics.

497
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,965
Chris Harris skidding around
in a supercar.

498
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,245
Yes!

499
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,685
Say hello...

500
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:02,724
to the STO,

501
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:06,444
the £260,000 last hurrah

502
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,044
for Lamborghini's very successful

503
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:10,815
Huracan supercar.

504
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,884
Now, as last hurrahs go,

505
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,846
it certainly looks like it's dressed
for the occasion.

506
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:22,114
But mingle around the room a bit...

507
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:26,175
you'll soon discover
there are a couple of things...

508
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:30,015
spoiling the leaving do.

509
00:24:32,455 --> 00:24:35,924
For starters, it appears
to be completely stupid.

510
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:38,925
Not good stupid, stupid stupid.

511
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,054
£260,000

512
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:48,044
is 50,000 more than
a standard four-wheel-drive Huracan

513
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:50,885
for which you get precisely
no more power.

514
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:54,014
What you get instead is body work

515
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:57,405
that appears to have been scribbled
on by a six-year-old.

516
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:00,684
You also get a jiggly ride,

517
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:02,034
you can't see out the back

518
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,735
and there's nowhere to put
your coffee.

519
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:09,204
And if you're thinking none
of that matters, because this

520
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:12,664
rear-wheel drive, monstrously
be-winged Lamborghini

521
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:15,565
is so clearly all about the track...

522
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:20,244
well, frankly, that is also

523
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:22,255
a bit of a concern.

524
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:27,174
The truth is, this type of
Lamborghini

525
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:31,334
has been pretty ropey around a
circuit for quite some time now.

526
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:35,095
Yeah, there was plenty of noise
and bluster, but if you wanted

527
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:38,604
a satisfying, precise,
technical drive,

528
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:41,175
they weren't very good at all.

529
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:49,254
So, let's see if this STO
really can give the long -serving

530
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:52,335
Huracan a decent send off.

531
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,175
Woo-hoo-hoo!

532
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:20,134
Takes about two
minutes to realise this is not

533
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:22,484
the normal Lamborghini recipe.

534
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:24,734
They've done something quite
different.

535
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:27,294
Normally they make them dual drive,

536
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,024
whip the front drive shafts out,

537
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:32,284
and away you go, but for some reason
the steering never connects.

538
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,965
The car feels too spiky.

539
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:37,175
But this one just feels bang on.

540
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:48,175
What a machine!

541
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:52,814
It just feels instinctive and
intuitive.

542
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:55,694
I can just throw it around

543
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:58,845
and know it isn't going to
just bite me in,

544
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:00,895
cause me loads of grief.

545
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:05,565
Oh, I really like this car!

546
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,404
But it doesn't stop there

547
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:11,204
because when you're done
throwing it around,

548
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:15,734
you realise that all that stuff
they've stuck to the back of the car

549
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:20,354
isn't just Lamborghini's usual
overexcited approach to styling.

550
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:22,484
It is real...

551
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:24,184
aero.

552
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:28,344
That fin directs air clearly onto
the rear wing,

553
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:32,284
so we've got nearly half a ton
of downforce at 175mph

554
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:35,614
through this fast section of
Silverstone.

555
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:38,454
For a street car,
you can really feel it.

556
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:39,856
Impressive.

557
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:43,644
But not nearly as impressive

558
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,574
as the free breathing,

559
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:47,014
high revving,

560
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:51,064
5.2 litre V10 masterpiece

561
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:53,135
sat just over your shoulder.

562
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:59,125
It is one of the standout engines.

563
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:04,455
It's as much a musical
instrument as a form of propulsion.

564
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,564
Wow!

565
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:14,105
In a world of turbochargers
and hybrids and electricity

566
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:16,054
I know it's a dinosaur,

567
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,075
but...

568
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,726
what an engine.

569
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:28,894
An engine that now
has less to haul than ever before,

570
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:32,095
thanks to the STO's periodic table

571
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:34,345
of weight-saving upgrades.

572
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,334
There's a titanium roll cage,

573
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,424
magnesium wheels.

574
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:45,726
The entire front end is a single
piece of carbon fibre.

575
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:53,134
In fact, the STO is now 43 kilos
lighter

576
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:57,084
than the previous stripped out
circuit-ready Huracan,

577
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,415
the Performante.

578
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,174
Put all of that together, though,

579
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,695
and this next bit might come...

580
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,094
as a surprise.

581
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:12,254
Actually,
even though it's got 640 horsepower,

582
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:14,614
weighs under 1400kg,

583
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,084
in its category

584
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:18,564
the STO isn't that quick.

585
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:22,174
It gets monstered by McLaren
and 765 LT

586
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:25,574
and the GT3 Porsche,
which is a lot less money.

587
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:27,084
It's just as fast.

588
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:31,684
The truth is, among its faster
or better value rivals,

589
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:35,445
the STO doesn't quite add up.

590
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:42,084
But it doesn't matter, because
driving is about

591
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:43,444
more than numbers.

592
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:45,614
It's about sensations,

593
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:49,244
it's about
the connection between this machine

594
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,695
and the fleshy
lump in the middle of it.

595
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:57,094
And the STO is pure connection.

596
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,424
Everything about it is glorious
from the way that it goes,

597
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,764
the way that it stops,

598
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:06,605
all underscored by that glorious
V10 behind me.

599
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:14,994
As a way to bid farewell to
the Huracan then,

600
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:18,856
the STO is the ultimate swan song.

601
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:22,414
This isn't just this Huracan they've
made,

602
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:24,614
it's the best Lamborghini in 15
years.

603
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:28,775
In fact, for me to drive, it's
probably the best Lamborghini ever.

604
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:36,415
Woohoo!

605
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,214
Oh!

606
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:51,065
This thing makes me feel properly
alive.

607
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,374
Proper.

608
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,815
Proper.

609
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,254
It's a good-looking wheel. Proper,
proper.

610
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:13,214
Chris, I'm going to say you're
waxing lyrical about a car

611
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:16,054
that says STD on the side.

612
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:17,924
I hadn't spotted that. That is
unfortunate.

613
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:19,175
That's what everyone says.

614
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:25,284
Look, I'm sure it's great to drive
but...

615
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,224
Look at it. Would you want to be
seen driving it?

616
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:28,534
It's just not you, this, is it?

617
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:30,624
Well, maybe it is, I don't know,
but I suppose...

618
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,865
I suppose the thing is, it's so
great to drive,

619
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:35,725
you forget how much of a pillock you
look driving it.

620
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,564
High praise, indeed.

621
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:41,264
And now, it's time to return to our
electric cars in Northumberland,

622
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:45,415
where we were about to venture where
caravans have never ventured before.

623
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:03,424
It had been a busy morning for our
EVs,

624
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:07,444
and after stopping to brim their
hard-working batteries,

625
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:11,164
we were all set for a busy afternoon
as well.

626
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:15,054
Because having proven their
adventure lifestyle credentials,

627
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:19,014
it was finally time for our pioneers
to head off the beaten track

628
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:22,294
towards our wilderness campsite.

629
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:25,334
We're getting away from it now,
lads, aren't we?

630
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:27,444
Beautiful!

631
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,374
Or as they say, where you live...

632
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,524
lovely stuff.

633
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:34,294
Lovely stuff.

634
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,694
You know what? My kids have started
saying it.

635
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:39,164
They're driving the Mrs mad.

636
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:44,164
It's a northern phrase that can be
deployed anywhere.

637
00:32:44,165 --> 00:32:45,635
Lovely stuff.

638
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:54,624
I've got to say the old EQC in the
Go-Pod,

639
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:57,704
they're handling these roads, no
problem.

640
00:32:57,705 --> 00:32:59,705
Oh, so easy!

641
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:03,774
The only trouble with this car...

642
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,694
is the range.

643
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:09,294
It just drops like a stone.

644
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,606
Oh, I'm going to have to keep me eye
on that.

645
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:15,494
Look at this, boys.

646
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,855
This is all terrain caravanning.

647
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:19,944
Seeing these roads as well,

648
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:23,104
if you tried them in a Compass
Casita 868...

649
00:33:23,105 --> 00:33:24,424
Oh!

650
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,455
You'd be laughed out of the Caravan
Club.

651
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,164
Jeff's never seen this, has he?

652
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:35,344
Tell you what, it's a bit
nerve-racking, when it's just fog.

653
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:37,694
You can't see over the edges.

654
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:39,244
Mind the cows!

655
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:40,615
Oh, my God.

656
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,165
What the hell?!

657
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:47,094
♪ Don't know where we're going

658
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,934

00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,534
Before long, though, our road to

664
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:07,605
brought us to the perfect spot to
set up shop.

665
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:11,784
Flat as a pancake. Get on that!

666
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:14,505
That should do us grand, Fred.

667
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:17,344
Welcome to our new home!

668
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:20,014
Hey! Yeah.

669
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:23,584
Put the horses over there and get
the wagons down here.

670
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:25,444
All right, lads.

671
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:29,735
Oh, yes. The title of Britain's most
remote caravan site...

672
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,494
It's going to be grand, this.

673
00:34:31,495 --> 00:34:32,964
was surely ours.

674
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:35,974
Straight into your horse's parking
spot.

675
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,784
Lovely stuff.

676
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:42,495
But before we could bask in the
tranquillity of wild caravanning...

677
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:46,894
there was, of course, the small
matter...

678
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:48,164
Oh, God.

679
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:50,334
of erecting the OPUS.

680
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:53,144
Oh, deary me. All of my stuff's
covered in sheep poo.

681
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,094
Whey! Here we go!

682
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,974
There's the living room.

683
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,074
Come on. Here's the cinema.

684
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:01,504
Whoa!

685
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:02,664
Whoa! Oh!

686
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:03,735
Dickhead.

687
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:06,494
Oh, dear. Why was that my fault?
Oh, dear.

688
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:07,884
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

689
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:11,134
Ah, now, you've put your door facing
the wind.

690
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:14,254
You should've had your door facing
this way into camp,

691
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,605
where the fire is. Shut up,
McGuinness.

692
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:18,964
It suddenly changes up here,
doesn't it?

693
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:21,214
Yeah. Very chilly.

694
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:25,534
But with Harris' inflatable slowly
taking shape...

695
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:29,294
Oh, here he goes! He's blowing her
up. Whey-hey!

696
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,654
with the wagons fully circled at
last...

697
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:34,384
Are you done? Just about, lads.
Final clip in.

698
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:38,334
the producers decided it was time
for another test.

699
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,784
We've got a challenge. Oh! Thanks.

700
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:44,424
Which electric car has the spiciest
performance?

701
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:47,044
To find out, time for some hot laps.

702
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,865
Really hot laps.

703
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:50,974
So, it's just the cars, innit? Just
the cars.

704
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:53,615
This is good, this, cos we can
actually see what the cars will do

705
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:55,685
without the sport caravans on their
back.

706
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:58,504
Not entirely...

707
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:01,735
because in danger of seeing us
actually enjoy ourselves,

708
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:06,535
the producers had given this time
trial an eye-watering difference.

709
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:10,944
On a makeshift circuit around our
foggy hilltop,

710
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:15,304
we'd now each take turns driving
five laps against the clock.

711
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:17,904
But for each lap completed,

712
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:19,684
we'd have to eat...

713
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:21,044
a chilli.

714
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,615
Starting at the shallow end with the
humble jalapeno,

715
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:28,054
we'd climb the Scoville Heat Scale
of chilli intensity

716
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:32,454
through bird's eye, scotch bonnet
and Red Savina Habanero,

717
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:36,414
before finally reaching the world's
hottest chilli -

718
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:39,055
the mighty Carolina Reaper.

719
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:44,664
The winner would be the one to
finish their five hot laps

720
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:47,414
in the fastest time, or more likely,

721
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:51,855
whoever could go furthest without
calling for the Cool Bag -

722
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:54,054
a generous helping of milk and
yoghurt,

723
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,785
waiting in the footwell to ease the
burn.

724
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,584
And before any of us could figure
out

725
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:04,144
what any of that had to do with the
future of caravanning,

726
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:08,494
I found myself at the wheel going
first.

727
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:11,865
You two lads love a bit of spice,
don't you?

728
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:13,534
Is it a JAlapeno or a HAlapeno?

729
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:16,254
HAlapeno. It's HAlapeno for you.
Yeah.

730
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:19,044
Child's play. It's an appetiser,
innit? Child's play. No, it's not.

731
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:21,615
Child's play. I don't eat raw
chilli.

732
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,144
Right. Are we ready, Chris?

733
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:25,144
Three, two, one...

734
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:26,315
. .go!

735
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:29,605
He's not even put it in yet.

736
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:31,875
He's saving it. Come on. Get it in!

737
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,324
Oh, he's making light work of that.

738
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,894
Oh, it's a bit of a slow burner,
that.

739
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:37,855
Oh, look at that.

740
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,855
Right, that's done.

741
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:41,764
Oh, oh, he didn't like that.

742
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:43,974
You can go straight through the
chequered flags.

743
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:45,464
Paddy, pass him the second one.

744
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:49,378
It's a bird's eye but it's not
a captain's one, I can tell you.

745
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:51,171
Get it in you, son!

746
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:53,981
There are no breadcrumbs on that
one. No breadcrumbs on that.

747
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:56,331
Oh, he's bit half of it. Oh, he's
gone straight in.

748
00:37:56,332 --> 00:38:00,141
How is it, Chris? How is it?
That's lively, Andrew. That is...

749
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:02,381
That's lively.

750
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,612
Get it down t' nubbin.

751
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:05,821
Oh, look at that!

752
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,771
Have you seen the driving's changed
slightly?

753
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:11,411
A bit more urgency.

754
00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:12,862
Here we go. What've we got, Pad?

755
00:38:12,863 --> 00:38:14,321
Oh, oh. Scotch bonnet?

756
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:16,891
We're moving on to unchartered
waters now, Fred.

757
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:19,301
Get me glove on. I'd put your specs
on as well, Pad. I will do.

758
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:20,971
That'll burn your eye.
That's a good shout.

759
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,331
Oh, as long as you're all right.

760
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,301
Oh, look at that! Oh, no, that's
trouble.

761
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,972
That is trouble! That is trouble,
Chris.

762
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,531
This is going to hurt him. This is
going to hurt.

763
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:34,531
Oh, he's enjoying that! He's not.

764
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:38,051
Get that in you. You've done that,
Chris.

765
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,021
Come on, son! Go on! Oh!

766
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:41,411
Oh, it's down t' nub!

767
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:43,651
Get back. Come on, let's go!

768
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:46,031
Oh, it's when you burp it back up!

769
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:50,411
Drive, Chris. Drive!

770
00:38:53,682 --> 00:38:54,941
Are you ready?

771
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:57,331
Oh, it's red, Fred. Oh, my word.
It's red, Fred.

772
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:00,821
What in the name of Satan's
testicles is that?

773
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:04,531
That is the Red Savina Habanero.
That sounds hot.

774
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:06,681
Are you BLEEP?

775
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,251
What the hell is that? Get it in!

776
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:13,171
Yes, Chris! Keep driving, son.

777
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:15,862
This is impressive, let me tell you.

778
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:19,492
Eh, Fred, he's done it. We've got
one left, Chris.

779
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:22,171
I need that milk! No, no, no!

780
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,021
We're not going to finish them!

781
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:26,532
Get to the finish line.

782
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:31,381
Go on, Chris.

783
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:32,772
I can't talk.

784
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:37,261
Are you going again, Chris? No, I
need the milk. I need the milk.

785
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:40,661
Aren't you going again? I need the
milk. Give me the milk.

786
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:43,302
Oh, he's off. He's off.

787
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,101
Oh, Chris.

788
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:49,661
Very impressive.

789
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:52,121
Fantastic work, sir.

790
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:55,821
Oh, hey... I can't get it. I can't
get the burning away.

791
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:57,381
Do you want some yoghurt?

792
00:39:57,382 --> 00:39:59,261
It feels like someone's lit a match
in my mouth.

793
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:01,381
It's terrible.

794
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:03,091
Milk!

795
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:04,752
Milk!

796
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:06,743
I might give him this one.

797
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,211
Shall we go and start the fire?

798
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:14,742
Well done. We'll go get the fire. Go
and get the steaks on.

799
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:17,261
I can't! Do you want Tabasco on your
steak?

800
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,411
Why are we... why are we doing this?
Why...?

801
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:22,221
Caravanning. What has it got to do
with ca...

802
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:24,492
I'll tell you what, though. Argh!
Oh, no!

803
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,742
You've set a good precedent, though.

804
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:29,661
What's his time? I've reset it
but it's 5:25.

805
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:31,581
Good work, Chris.

806
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:33,051
Fair play to him.

807
00:40:33,052 --> 00:40:36,581
With four hot laps done in under
five and a half minutes,

808
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:41,102
once Harris had cooled off,
McGuinness had his work cut out.

809
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:44,851
Look at the face on him! Oh, God!

810
00:40:44,852 --> 00:40:46,331
Do you like your spice?

811
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:49,492
No, I do... I am chicken korma man
in curry house. You're in trouble.

812
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:51,951
Savour it. It could be a flavour
experience that you love.

813
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:54,131
I won't love it. Are we ready?

814
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:57,051
I'm stressed. Three, two, one...

815
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,312
go.

816
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:01,972
Oh, he's in.

817
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:05,851
Oh, keep your hands on the road,
Pad.

818
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:07,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

819
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:10,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

820
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:11,901
Whoa!

821
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,101
Oh, he's gone!

822
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:15,101
He's hurting. He's hurting. Go on,
Pad!

823
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:19,181
Keep going! You have to stop on the
line, Pad.

824
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:21,771
I'm going to have to slow it down a
bit here, now.

825
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:25,502
Oh, oh, oh, he's going. Oh, come on!

826
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:28,051
Bite it. Just the stem, just the
stem.

827
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,331
What's he doing? You can't spit you
out. No, no!

828
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:31,811
Who, whoa, whoa!

829
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,411
Eat it! It was a seed! Eat it!

830
00:41:34,412 --> 00:41:37,502
Whoa! It was a seed. You don't eat
watermelon seeds, do you?

831
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:39,411
Why should I start eating these
seeds?

832
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:41,311
Eat the chilli, man! Oh!

833
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:42,981
I am eating the chilli!

834
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:45,492
You're not eating the... The seeds
are the hot bit! Come on.

835
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:47,771
Ooh!

836
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,111
All right. I'll give you that, I'll
give you that.

837
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:51,821
There we go. One down.

838
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:54,311
Second chilli, Paddy. It's a bird's
eye.

839
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,541
Where am I going? I don't know where
I'm going.

840
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,011
Has it got to your eyes?

841
00:41:58,012 --> 00:42:00,541
Eat, eat. Just to get it in now,
while you're burning.

842
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,411
It won't get any worse. Just get it in.

843
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:03,921
Go on!

844
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:05,181
To the right, to the right.

845
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,572
Hold on. Come on.

846
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:09,901
Oh, oh, oh.

847
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,381
What's up?

848
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:17,771
Steer, steer!

849
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:19,411
Argh!

850
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,251
Eat it. Where am I? Eat it.

851
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:22,911
Left, left, left.

852
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:24,221
Left!

853
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,372
Lads... Eat the chilli... that can't
go in.

854
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,262
That is like the sun in me mouth.

855
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:34,131
Give us the things, quick.

856
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:36,291
Here you are, Pad. Open up.

857
00:42:42,982 --> 00:42:45,981
You're milking it now, Pad. You're
milking it!

858
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:48,101
You prick!

859
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:49,981
I really wasn't.

860
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:54,141
But I will admit, this time, I was
definitely out.

861
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,391
And that meant once I'd recovered...

862
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:03,061
the pressure was all on the
world's most competitive man.

863
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:05,752
Now, listen, what's that top one
called, Harris?

864
00:43:05,753 --> 00:43:07,411
That's called the Carolina Reaper.

865
00:43:07,412 --> 00:43:11,291
If you don't suck that down your
lovely neck... Shut up!

866
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:13,301
there's summat wrong with you.
Shut up.

867
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,701
With the day you've had, pipe down.

868
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:17,911
Walk the walk, talk the talk.

869
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:19,971
Three, two, one...

870
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,132
go!

871
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:24,422
There's the jalapeno. Get that in!

872
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,781
There's the nub. He's done that.

873
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,821
Quick, Fred, quick! Just don't crash.

874
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:35,421
It would be a shame, if you ate the
chillies, and then, killed us.

875
00:43:35,422 --> 00:43:37,341
Give him the bird's eye,
Christopher.

876
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:39,131
Pass it over. Is he in?

877
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:41,541
Yeah, one mouthful. Oh, he's nailed
that.

878
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:43,341
I'm with... I'm with the big lads,
now.

879
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:45,111
I'm with the heavyweights here.

880
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:47,991
Now, we're moving on, Andrew to the
Scotch bonnet.

881
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,382
Oh, this is... Oh, get it in you!

882
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,502
Here he goes. He's just smashed it.

883
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:56,652
He's just smashed it! Get it down t'
nub, Flintoff!

884
00:43:58,012 --> 00:43:59,301
There you go.

885
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,101
Blooming heck! Here we go now.
Blooming heck!

886
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:04,931
Here we go now. Blooming heck!

887
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:06,622
Oh, my stomach hurts.

888
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:09,141
You're nearly up to Harris level,
now, Fred.

889
00:44:09,142 --> 00:44:10,581
Blooming heck!

890
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:12,492
I should've just put it straight in
me undies

891
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:14,292
and cut the middleman out.

892
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:18,421
Are you going to go for the
Habanero? Aye, am I.

893
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,551
Get it in there! Oh!

894
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:23,301
I think we might be seeing a Reaper
at the end of this.

895
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,821
I think you might be seeing a lot at
the end of this!

896
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:27,791
Get it in you, Flintoff!

897
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,221
Are you down t' nub?

898
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:30,701
Ho-ho! Oh, my word!

899
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:33,291
This one's made of asbestos!

900
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:35,372
I've never seen anything like it.

901
00:44:36,652 --> 00:44:38,411
Come on. Last lap, Fred!

902
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,071
Get the Reaper out, Christopher.

903
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:41,981
Are you going to go for it? I'm in
trouble.

904
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:43,931
Are you going to go for it? Get it
in!

905
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,731
Go on, Flintoff! He's going to do
it.

906
00:44:45,732 --> 00:44:47,141
Lap five. Let's do it, Fred!

907
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,541
Get the Reaper in!

908
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:50,661
I'm in trouble. Get it in!

909
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:51,942
Tuck in!

910
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,261
No! Get it in!

911
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:56,261
Come on.

912
00:44:56,262 --> 00:44:57,872
Get that rest of it in!

913
00:44:59,192 --> 00:45:01,901
Take that off me! He's eaten that.

914
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,551
Good time, Fred.

915
00:45:03,552 --> 00:45:05,011
I'm in trouble.

916
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:07,651
Has he swallowed it, Chris? Check
his mouth.

917
00:45:07,652 --> 00:45:10,101
Check his mouth. No, he's eaten
that. He's eaten that.

918
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:11,851
I'm in trouble, lads.

919
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:13,503
I don't even drink milk.

920
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,292
Where's he gone?

921
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:23,011
Oh, good time.

922
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,421
Do you want milk?

923
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,791
Do you want... Do you want milk?

924
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,582
Get some water. Do you want milk?
Do you want yoghurt?

925
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:32,191
Put it in here.

926
00:45:32,192 --> 00:45:33,503
Put it in my mouth.

927
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,091
Fred, the yoghurt's the best.

928
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:45,552
The yoghurt's best. The yoghurt's
better.

929
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:52,741
Now, that, ladies and gentlemen,
is what a winner looks like.

930
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:03,431
Oh, eh?

931
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:05,261
This is nice, isn't it?

932
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,502
We've earned this. We have earned
this.

933
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:08,861
Well, two of us have.

934
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:10,941
But do you know? Yeah, come on, come
on.

935
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,651
I've done a bird's eye chilli for
you

936
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:14,451
and whatever the other one,
jalapeno.

937
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:16,011
They were sneaky, the captain.

938
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:18,461
Oh, the captain sneaks up on you.

939
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:20,981
I didn't think he was going to go
for the last one.

940
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:23,091
I am staggered he did the Reaper.

941
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:25,991
It was horrendous. It looked like
you had a seizure at the end.

942
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,191
I was like, "What is going on?"

943
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:30,731
Would you rather eat a California
Reaper

944
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:34,061
or go on a two-week camping holiday
in the MINK

945
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:36,421
with just Paddy McGuinness?

946
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:38,821
See, you're putting him in a
dilemma, there. I am.

947
00:46:38,822 --> 00:46:40,661
Two tricky ones. Is Paddy staying
with me?

948
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:42,632
Yeah, he's in there with you. I'll
top and tail.

949
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,661
I won't sleep directly at the side
of you.

950
00:46:44,662 --> 00:46:47,623
Paddy, I want to say you but...

951
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:52,021
there's not enough chillies in the
world to put me off.

952
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:53,861
Imagine staying there with him.

953
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:56,622
I've got to be honest, after he's
eaten that Reaper,

954
00:46:56,623 --> 00:46:58,831
I wouldn't want to do one night in
there with him.

955
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:03,101
Go on, get a steak on.

956
00:47:03,102 --> 00:47:05,101
Get it on, Chris.

957
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:07,181
Oh, lovely...

958
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:08,622
stuff.

959
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:18,231
The next morning, we awoke to find
the fog had lifted

960
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:23,431
and we could bathe in the beauty of
the Northumberland Moors.

961
00:47:23,432 --> 00:47:25,571
Right, you do him and I'll do me.

962
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:27,221
Oh, it's cold! Get in!

963
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:28,981
Come back! You have the loofah!

964
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:31,341
It's cold. Get the loofah in here.

965
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:32,861
We need a sponge.

966
00:47:32,862 --> 00:47:36,151
And once we'd updated the guide to
caravan etiquette

967
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:39,261
with a new entry on
the... ablutions...

968
00:47:39,262 --> 00:47:42,101
No, no, that's Fairy liquid!

969
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:44,141
It's gone in my eyes!

970
00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:47,701
all squeaky clean again, we were
just starting to break camp...

971
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:50,161
That's better now. Minty fresh,
lads.

972
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:54,101
when Flintoff discovered we'd
been left a little present.

973
00:47:54,102 --> 00:47:56,373
There's a card here. Pad, do you
want to get it?

974
00:47:57,712 --> 00:47:59,341
Challenge -

975
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:01,141
congratulations... Thank you.

976
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:04,382
you have proven that your electric
cars and caravans

977
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:06,591
can get off the beaten track.

978
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,171
But can they get back on it?

979
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:13,921
With whatever charge you have left,
you will now drive 100 miles

980
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:17,711
over England's highest road,
Harthope Moss,

981
00:48:17,712 --> 00:48:19,781
with the winner, the first to arrive

982
00:48:19,782 --> 00:48:23,632
at one of the country's top motoring
destinations.

983
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:25,271
What racetrack's around there?

984
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:26,552
Barnard Castle.

985
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:33,512
Let's pack up! Come on, then.

986
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:35,102
Get the horses on the road.

987
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:39,502
Right, because any self-respecting
tow car

988
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:43,591
really should get you both to and
from your destination,

989
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:46,302
our final test would be range.

990
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:51,021
We'd all fully charged our batteries
the day before

991
00:48:51,022 --> 00:48:53,502
and would now use whatever we had
left

992
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:57,701
to drive 100 miles up and over the
country's highest road.

993
00:48:57,702 --> 00:49:00,451
Barnard Castle here we come!

994
00:49:00,452 --> 00:49:05,431
This would be the future of
caravanning's biggest test yet,

995
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:07,711
and unfortunately for McGuinness,

996
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,992
it looked like it had already
claimed its first scalp.

997
00:49:13,342 --> 00:49:15,941
Maths wasn't me strong point at
school,

998
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:19,901
but even I can figure out that 49
miles range

999
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:25,061
and trying to do 100 miles distance
isn't going to work.

1000
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:29,151
I really like this EQC but there's
no way

1001
00:49:29,152 --> 00:49:30,981
no way

1002
00:49:30,982 --> 00:49:35,232
am I going to get to Barnard Castle,
glasses on or glasses off.

1003
00:49:36,342 --> 00:49:39,591
I'll be lucky if I get to the end of
this road.

1004
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:41,301
What's your range, Pad?

1005
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:42,821
48 miles.

1006
00:49:42,822 --> 00:49:44,301
73 here.

1007
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:45,741
Fred?

1008
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:47,001
120.

1009
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:49,741
He's still on the hundreds, this
lad.

1010
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:51,991
That's one of the things about the
Polestar 2.

1011
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,901
The range seems to be good.

1012
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:57,801
I've got the regen on, so every time
I take my foot off the accelerator,

1013
00:49:57,802 --> 00:50:00,461
it puts a bit of charge back into
the battery.

1014
00:50:00,462 --> 00:50:04,181
But the big question is the MINK
on the back.

1015
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:06,671
Harris, he'll be pulling all the
tricks of the trade.

1016
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:09,671
He'll be regenning down the hill.
He'll have a strategy.

1017
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,661
I'm just going to drive.

1018
00:50:11,662 --> 00:50:13,791
Where would you like to go?

1019
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:15,181
Barnard Castle.

1020
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,421
Starting route guidance.

1021
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:21,071
There you go. It's saying it's 98
miles.

1022
00:50:21,072 --> 00:50:24,301
And I've got a line that tells me
whether I'm going to get close.

1023
00:50:24,302 --> 00:50:26,572
I'm going to let the computer help
me out here.

1024
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:30,671
Lovely downhill sections.

1025
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:33,741
The big green charge indicator is
on.

1026
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:36,031
I'm adding miles now.

1027
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:40,541
Hot off the press, boys, I'm now on
39 miles.

1028
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,661
What is wrong with that car?

1029
00:50:42,662 --> 00:50:45,871
This has been happening since I
first got in it.

1030
00:50:45,872 --> 00:50:48,541
It's probably getting you back for
spraying it in milk.

1031
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:49,661
That were you.

1032
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:51,301
It came out of your mouth.

1033
00:50:51,302 --> 00:50:53,262
It had to. It had nowhere else to
go, Fred,

1034
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:55,651
with the level of force you pushed
into it.

1035
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,182
This is not a conversation to join
late.

1036
00:51:02,232 --> 00:51:05,181
Paddy's vengeful EQC aside...

1037
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:07,502
we had a decent run down off the
hill

1038
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:09,662
and were soon back onto the main
road.

1039
00:51:10,982 --> 00:51:14,791
But while Flintoff was sitting
pretty in his Polestar,

1040
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:17,591
it was quickly becoming clear that
I...

1041
00:51:17,592 --> 00:51:18,901
wasn't.

1042
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:22,021
So, it says I've got 75 miles to go.

1043
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:24,262
I've got 66 miles of range.

1044
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:25,671
Hm...

1045
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:27,711
Why is it not giving me any regen
there?

1046
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:30,591
I'm coasting. I'd have thought it
would've given me some regeneration.

1047
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:32,221
What's going on here?

1048
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,951
Regenerative braking is very clever

1049
00:51:34,952 --> 00:51:38,512
but there was just no way my heavily
laden e-tron would claw back

1050
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,612
enough miles to reach the finish
line.

1051
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:43,431
I'm going in here.

1052
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:45,341
I needed a solution.

1053
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:47,792
I'm dumping the trailer. This is the
way forward.

1054
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,952
Right, let's do this quick.

1055
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:56,752
Woo, woo!

1056
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:00,611
Oh, this is a joy.

1057
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:03,221
It feels like I've got another
hundred horsepower.

1058
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:05,072
Let's see what happens now, boys.

1059
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,670
I'm now on 26 miles and I'm not even
at the halfway point.

1060
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,830
Is it just me now? Paddy's gone.

1061
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,939
I can't see Harris' horrible red
Audi in me rear-view.

1062
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,859
He's up to something.

1063
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,779
62 miles.

1064
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,939
This is joyous.

1065
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,419
Read the small print. You see, if
you read the small print,

1066
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,419
it said nothing about having to turn
up to Barnard Castle

1067
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,109
with my trailer.

1068
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:44,470
So, what I can do hopefully is just
stay behind Fred

1069
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:47,189
until the very last minute, and
then, just overtake him

1070
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,139
before I get to Barnard Castle.

1071
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,549
Yes!

1072
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,220
And soon catching up to the back of
the Mink,

1073
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:56,699
it was time to give Flintoff the
good news.

1074
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,189
Hello, Andrew.

1075
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,789
Oh, here we go.

1076
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,419
Chris, have you taken your trailer
off?

1077
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,179
I thought, you were better than
that.

1078
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,759
What part of the rules said

1079
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,029
you had to arrive at Barnard Castle
with a caravan?

1080
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,909
Chris, it's a caravanning week.

1081
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,659
Everything we've done has been to do
with caravanning,

1082
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,019
and now, you've gone and done this.

1083
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,109
What I like is the grim
inevitability of this for you now

1084
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,709
cos I'm just going to follow you,
and at some point,

1085
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,709
you know I'm going to pop out and
just execute the overtake.

1086
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,070
I'd sooner eat another one of them
chillies than listen to this.

1087
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,139
Where's Paddy?

1088
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,510
He took a left-hand turn about three
miles back.

1089
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,139
I'm down to seven miles range,
now,

1090
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,069
and a tortoise has appeared on me
speedometer.

1091
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,020
I'm now officially in limp mode.

1092
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,749
You know, things are bad,

1093
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,420
when you're getting taken over by an
old Toyota Yaris.

1094
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,269
Wow.

1095
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,839
Actually, let's just see what
happens

1096
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,839
when we run the clock down to zero.

1097
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,300
See where we get to.

1098
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,739
It would've been nice to see Barnard
Castle, though, but...

1099
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,859
Anyhow, there we go.

1100
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,709
Back in the actual race,

1101
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,979
with miles clocking up...

1102
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,480
and the cheating git waiting to
pounce,

1103
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:23,350
my unshakeable Polestar was
beginning to feel the pressure.

1104
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:26,480
This caravan's making all the
difference.

1105
00:54:26,481 --> 00:54:30,790
38 miles to go, 40 miles of range.
This is going to be tight.

1106
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,709
Oh, it's just slowing down now.
The car's jittering away.

1107
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,579
It's a very similar feeling to when
you run out of petrol or diesel

1108
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,509
in your regular kind of car.

1109
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,351
Foot's pinned, nothing's happening.

1110
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,829
Well, there we go.

1111
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,020
That's that.

1112
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,220
Up ahead, though, with 22 miles to
go,

1113
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:01,629
our little tortoise and hare race

1114
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,919
had reached the foot of Harthope
Moss.

1115
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,470
Climbing 1,000 feet in just two and
a half miles,

1116
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,221
the highest road in England is an
electric car killer.

1117
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,299
Oh, 20, 20 mile range!

1118
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,189
Look at how steep this is. I do not
need this.

1119
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,139
Oh blimey, look all the way up
there, Fred!

1120
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,299
Oh, it's now saying reduced power
due to low battery charge.

1121
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,860
There's a tortoise popped up on me
screen.

1122
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,939
All me and the Polestar could do
was keep limping forward

1123
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,019
and hope we get over the top.

1124
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,470
Oh, my word.

1125
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,149
It does come to something,

1126
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,789
when you're in a car that costs
£90,000

1127
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:49,579
and you see a hill and it strikes
the fear of God into you.

1128
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,909
It does slightly defeat the object.

1129
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,710
This has got to be the top. It's got
to be the top!

1130
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,869
I never knew range anxiety could be
so funny.

1131
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:05,789
The big hill had been a hammer blow
for the Polestar's battery.

1132
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,829
Oh, my word, I've got five left.

1133
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,939
Regen, regen!

1134
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,269
And of course, the Audi and I had
been effortlessly cruising along

1135
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,230
in its wake.

1136
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:19,549
It's saying I've got 19 miles to go
and 37 miles of range.

1137
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,199
Urgh.

1138
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,269
I'm pleased for you.

1139
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,909
And that meant that all that
remained now

1140
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:30,149
was to plot out the last stage of
the road to victory.

1141
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,149
The nature of the overtake is
everything.

1142
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,669
It needs to be quick, dignified, no
gloating.

1143
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,230
It's just a pop out, in, done.

1144
00:56:39,231 --> 00:56:41,909
The way Lewis does it. Lewis is
superb at it.

1145
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,709
He just lines them up, and then,
just delivers.

1146
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,230
That's what I'm aiming to do.

1147
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:50,629
And, sure enough, a few more miles
down the road,

1148
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:53,719
the time came to strike.

1149
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,709
Chris, I've got no range.

1150
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,669
Zero range.

1151
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,360
Are you on zero?

1152
00:56:59,361 --> 00:57:01,939
I'm on 0%, zero range

1153
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,199
and it's flashed up on me screen
saying, empty battery...

1154
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh, you absolute knob.

1155
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,659
Oh, well done, Chris.

1156
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,350
Good friend, that. If I break down,
you just disappear.

1157
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:12,390
Thanks, mate.

1158
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,509
And with that, ladies and gentlemen,
we had our result.

1159
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,269
Right...

1160
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:24,221
Barnard Castle - win, tea, cakes
medals, gloating.

1161
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,379
Although it must be said, claiming
victory in the trailerless Audi

1162
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,299
did reveal a bit of a flaw

1163
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,510
in our grand vision for the future
of caravanning...

1164
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,819
Barnard Castle.

1165
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,599
There we go, boys!

1166
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,100
because it turns out

1167
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:44,789
an electric car can certainly get
you and your van

1168
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,590
wherever you might want to go...

1169
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,309
it just might not quite...

1170
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,589
Come on!

1171
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,139
get you back again.

1172
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,739
Come on!

1173
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,659
Well, come past then. What do you
want me to do?

1174
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,790
I'm doing 4mph.

1175
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,000
Oh, dear. Deary me.

1176
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,179
Victory to Harris, the Audi, and of
course, the OPUS.

1177
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,019
Chris, there is no OPUS.

1178
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,379
You went on a caravanning trip and
you didn't finish with your caravan.

1179
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,069
That's an immediate
disqualification.

1180
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,799
RTQ, Fred. Read the question.

1181
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,629
It didn't say anything about
finishing with your caravan.

1182
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:35,279
Chris, the entire film is about
towing a caravan.

1183
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,869
You, young man, are a bad sport and
a cheat.

1184
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:40,709
Paddy, I never thought I'd say this,

1185
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:44,149
you are a gentleman of honour.
Steady on, steady on.

1186
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,289
Compared to you, he is. Back me up,
Pad. Back me up.

1187
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,669
Thank you. Chris, as us caravaners
say, you never ditch your home.

1188
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,719
I'm giving the victory to Flintoff.

1189
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,539
Thank you! Get in, get in!

1190
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,719
Get in! What? You cheated.

1191
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,159
Robbed. You cheated. Robbed.

1192
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,189
You drove behind me, you ditched
me. Robbed.

1193
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,350
You cheated. Robbed!

1194
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:02,959
Thank you. Oh, dear.

1195
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,709
OK, and on not shock result - a
little electric joke, there -

1196
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,269
we must end the show.

1197
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,539
We'll be back next week with a big
adventure in Iceland

1198
