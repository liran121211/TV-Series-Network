00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,467
Hello, welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:36,307
It's a very exciting show tonight,
as we're doing something

3
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:37,787
we haven't done in a while.

4
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,228
It's time to dust off
the old suitcase and work out

5
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,298
what colour passport we need
because we're off abroad.

6
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:50,067
See, a while back, we got talking
about the noble tradition

7
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:52,437
of the great British expedition.

8
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:54,907
Scott of the Antarctic,
Ranulph Fiennes,

9
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:57,147
cruising with Jane MacDonald.

10
00:00:57,148 --> 00:01:00,157
Proper pioneering British stuff.

11
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:03,377
And it got us wondering on a budget
of a few thousand quid,

12
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:06,867
which would be the best British cars
to take on an expedition.

13
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,307
So we each went out and bought one.

14
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:12,027
However, the world being
how it was back in July,

15
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,947
there wasn't many options on offer,

16
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,877
but we did find one place -
a land not far from home -

17
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:20,547
with all the terrain you need
to test an expedition vehicle.

18
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,587
So we packed our bags
and shipped our cars...

19
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,027
to Iceland.

20
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:26,668
Whoohoo.

21
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,358
Wild, rugged,

22
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,907
and breathtaking to behold,

23
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:44,797
this isolated mound
of volcanic rock

24
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:47,747
in the middle
of the North Atlantic Ocean

25
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:50,437
packs more landscape
onto its shores

26
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,458
than countries ten times its size.

27
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:59,238
To test the mettle of a budget
British expedition vehicle,

28
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,537
Iceland is the ultimate
proving ground.

29
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,587
Look at the colours!

30
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:07,108
Greens.

31
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,747
Have you ever seen
a glacier that big?

32
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:11,228
I've not, no. I've eaten a few.

33
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,537
To be honest, I can't believe
Flintoff's not here.

34
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:16,147
He would love this.

35
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:19,787
Unfortunately, the day before
we travelled,

36
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:22,377
Flintoff had been forced
to self-isolate,

37
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,258
so couldn't join the trip.

38
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:29,158
Oh, I spy shipping containers.

39
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:38,108
But while Fred hadn't made it,
his wheels had.

40
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:39,988
Do you know this is the thing.

41
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,468
How have they got there?
Who's brought them in?

42
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:49,907
Now, obviously, these are sealed up.
Yeah.

43
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,547
It's a bit like looking
in someone's mail list.

44
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,947
But I think it's what
he would have wanted.

45
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,797
Shall we open his up?

46
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:58,787
I'll open.
You say what lies within.

47
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:03,157
Yes. Ah, of course.

48
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:04,717
He's gone classic.

49
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,958
Oh!

50
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,028
It's a manual!

51
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:13,257
I've never driven
a manual Range Rover before.

52
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,697
A diesel manual.

53
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:17,437
Classic. Classic.

54
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:19,267
Wow. Get over here.

55
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:21,108
He was always going
to go with that, weren't he?

56
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,587
It's a diesel to start with.
That's very rare.

57
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,307
These are very desirable,
and it's a Manuel.

58
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:28,597
Well, look at the wand on that!

59
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:29,988
This is a lovely car.

60
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,957
I mean, it's the choice.

61
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,397
When most people go,
"Well, it's an expedition.

62
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:37,797
"It's off road. I'm going to go one
of these." But it's a bit obvious.

63
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,547
I know it is a bit obvious,
but it's good.

64
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,118
It's a great solution.

65
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,257
Tell you what, Pad, it's got
the velour upholstery as well.

66
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:44,697
I'm jealous.

67
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:46,547
If he's not here to drive that,

68
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,617
and I prefer that to mine,
can I have that?

69
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,437
Well, I'm already bored with this

70
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,228
because it's just
the obvious choice.

71
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,467
And you're learning prepositions -
"bored with."

72
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,118
Before you met me, you'd have said
"bored of." Prepositions.

73
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,667
That's... You see, you're learning.
I've learned another word there.

74
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:02,467
You're not mangling
our language any more.

75
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,188
Ha-ha-ha!

76
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,627
There it is. Oh!

77
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,828
I'm so pleased about this.

78
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:25,467
The Vauxhall Chevette. Yes. Look
at it, Paddy. I used to have one.

79
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:27,707
Did you?
Not the rally version.

80
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,228
Wide arches.

81
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,957
White mini lights.

82
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,267
Massive!
Look at those fog lights.

83
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:35,337
Doesn't say expedition!

84
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:37,467
Why not? Well, it's a rally car.

85
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:39,957
It's got knobbly tyres.
It'll get me anywhere.

86
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,167
It will get you anywhere.

87
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:44,347
But I suspect in this,
give it an hour,

88
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,238
you won't be happy. Why not?

89
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,557
Look at the terrain
we're going to be going over!

90
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,187
You're going to be so uncomfortable
in that.

91
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,597
Look at the lights!

92
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:53,347
It's got spotlights.
It's got nice lights.

93
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:58,317
Yeah. It's fantastic.
And it says... Lombard RAC Rally.

94
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:00,317
Let's have a look inside.
Come on.

95
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:03,607
I used to love mine back in the day,
but my mine was comfortable.

96
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,238
Oh, Paddy, this is...

97
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,157
This might be the best car
I've had on this show

98
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:08,517
and I normally have the best cars.

99
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,757
What?!

100
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,837
Look at the wheel arches!

101
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,667
Look at the wheel arches.

102
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:16,187
Hang on, I've got to get out
for this. Did you just say...

103
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:18,307
Because I need to just clarify this.

104
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:21,988
the Vauxhall Chevette is the best
car you've had on this show.

105
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,317
You know you've said something
wrong, there, don't you?

106
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:26,747
Look at it!
Do you want to retract that remark?

107
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,517
It's brilliant.

108
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:31,797
What I'm going to do now
is introduce you

109
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,877
to a little bit of class.

110
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:35,517
Have we got a guest presenter?

111
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,238
Oh, oh, dear.

112
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,989
Hey.

113
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:45,038
Oh, he has. Come on. Hey.

114
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,078
Here we go.

115
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,708
It starts.

116
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,827
Ooh.

117
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:02,068
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

118
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:07,317
Have I nailed it
or have I nailed it?

119
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,197
One of my least favourite things

120
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,267
is admitting when you've done
something right.

121
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:12,637
I enjoy these moments.

122
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,787
And how good does it look
on off road tyres?

123
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:17,517
Fantastic! It's just...

124
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:19,517
This. The Silver Shadow for me...

125
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:22,417
is just... It's everything.
It's class. It's opulence.

126
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,417
It's just special, innit?

127
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,238
How can you
saying the word, "opulent"

128
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:29,757
make opulent sound not opulent?
Opulent.

129
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:32,347
It just doesn't sound opulent
when you say it. Why not?

130
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:33,958
Sounds like an ointment
you put on a toe.

131
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:39,118
This car was built on adventure.

132
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,427
First World War British Army

133
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:44,108
used these in Egypt and Jordan
all over the place.

134
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:45,597
Not Shadows, they didn't.

135
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:49,397
Lawrence of Arabia owned
eight of them. Not Shadows.

136
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:52,317
Look, you're living off a heritage
this doesn't live up to.

137
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,837
This is a 1970s machine.

138
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,917
These weren't adventure cars, these
were for weddings and pop stars.

139
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,627
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

140
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,557
Just hold on one moment there.

141
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,707
Now I knew you'd come at me
with the wedding thing.

142
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,637
Yeah. And I'm going
to give you a little factoid now

143
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,427
because this is something the great
Chris Harris will not know.

144
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,238
Now come down the front here.

145
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,148
The Spirit of Ecstasy.

146
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,437
Take two fingers.

147
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,917
Where are you going with this?
Take two fingers.

148
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,267
Now, take those fingers and just
stroke them on her frontage.

149
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,837
What am I... Is this a wind up?

150
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:28,627
No, just give it
a little - a little caress.

151
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,067
Now...

152
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:34,637
if they are smooth,
it's been used as a wedding car

153
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:39,277
because the ribbon wears them down.

154
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:42,738
If they're pert, not a wedding car.

155
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,338
What are you feeling?

156
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,232
Wrong.

157
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,242
They're pert. They are.
Not a wedding car.

158
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:52,421
They're in great shape. And do you
know what else as well, Christopher?

159
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:54,701
Have a look in the back.

160
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:58,421
No back seats.
I've had them taken out.

161
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:01,061
Expedition... a little bit lighter.

162
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,601
Basically, what you're looking
at here... Yeah.

163
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,671
is the Rolls-Royce
of expedition vehicles.

164
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:06,791
Oh, God!

165
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,061
That's what you're looking at.

166
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:10,031
Only you and I could have come
on an expedition

167
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,831
and leave behind the one
that's going to be any good.

168
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:13,551
Exactly.

169
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,781
Shall we get in? Yes. Come on.

170
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:17,352
Here we go.

171
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:23,961
So our Flintoff-less
two car adventure was under way.

172
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,671
Oh, lovely.

173
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,992
Expedition time.

174
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:33,342
First up, we've been told to explore
the island's wild coastline.

175
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:38,151
And if the whole point
of our mission was to discover

176
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:41,862
strange new worlds,
then it's fair to say Iceland

177
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:44,901
was getting straight down
to business.

178
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:46,681
Look at that landscape!

179
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:51,711
This is just flat, black,
volcanic rock and sand

180
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,021
all the way out to the sea.

181
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:55,961
This place is unlike
anywhere else on the planet.

182
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:58,911
Look at the greens on the right,
Chris.

183
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,501
We're following in the footsteps

184
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:03,581
of great British adventurers
here, aren't we?

185
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:08,191
Unfortunately, for Harris, though,
the whole point of our mission

186
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,911
was actually to see
how our cars coped

187
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,062
with Iceland's rugged landscape.

188
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,471
And the early news
from the Chevette...

189
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:20,191
Oof.
..was as predicted.

190
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,431
Ooh. Oh, oh, oh.

191
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:26,481
Urgh. What have I done here?

192
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,992
Are you feeling every single divot
in that car?

193
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:34,431
Oh, come on, then. Tell me
just how comfortable it is in there.

194
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:37,672
It is heavenly in here.

195
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:45,391
Just because you're going
on an adventure doesn't have to mean

196
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,321
you're going to be uncomfortable.

197
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:51,581
Oh, I'm too hot in here
and I'm feeling quite sick already.

198
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:55,471
I mean, looking at Chris's car,
he's not very comfortable.

199
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,311
He's got the door open
for a kick off

200
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:59,922
because he's getting gassed out
by the petrol.

201
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,682
Why be like that?
Why be like Chris Harris?

202
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:09,071
You want to travel in a bit
of style, a bit of class.

203
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:13,361
This car is fantastic, and it's got
all the mod cons on it as well.

204
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,071
I mean, granted these days
they're not mod cons,

205
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:19,761
they're more old cons but, back
in the day, were cutting edge.

206
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,481
It's even got
a Philips tape deck on it.

207
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:23,922
Oh.

208
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:28,352
Everything OK, Christopher?

209
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,701
It's very fumy.

210
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:34,141
This could be
a psychedelic experience

211
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:37,431
once I've had a few more
of these fumes.

212
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,302
Right. Here we go.

213
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,681
Always a good sign
letting the fumes out.

214
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:48,301
Just sorting my wardrobe, Pad,
nothing to worry about.

215
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,392
You just sit tight.

216
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:56,141
Now, then, the Vauxhall Chevette,

217
00:10:56,142 --> 00:11:01,271
not just the UK's
best-selling hatchback 1975 to '78.

218
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:06,631
No, this Chevette
is even more special

219
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,041
because apart from being noisy
and fumy and hot,

220
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,661
in becoming a rally car,
it's been given

221
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,711
a 2-litre twin carb engine

222
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:19,152
and the gearbox is from racing
specialists Quake.

223
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:23,281
This car's gear shift.

224
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,711
Oh, it reminds me of every single
supercar that's got paddles

225
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,191
as been completely wrong.

226
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:31,081
This is joyous. Snick, snick, snick.

227
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:35,561
Straight cut gears one to three,
fourth... If we go to fourth.

228
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,511
That's second, that's fourth.

229
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,551
Fourth is quiet.

230
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:42,072
I need to get into fourth gear
for a bit of peace and quiet.

231
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:47,562
And when it comes
to peace and quiet...

232
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,873
that is something
Iceland does very well.

233
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,221
Oh, this is a lovely little road.

234
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,002
Look at this!

235
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:16,113
Ooh. It smelt gorgeous then.

236
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,471
Now, with the fumes in your car,
Chris, you won't be able

237
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:25,031
to appreciate this,
but these flowers smell beautiful.

238
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:26,381
OK.

239
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:28,122
OK.

240
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,872
Aha! That's unpleasant.

241
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:34,002
So let's talk about power,
Christopher.

242
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,351
What's the Vauxhall croquette
packing?

243
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:39,201
100 horsepower,
courtesy of a Ford Pinto.

244
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:43,281
The Silver Shadow's got
a 6.75 litre V8,

245
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:47,631
and it's packing
a massive 200 horsepower, Chris.

246
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:50,951
There's no way
that's got 200 horses.

247
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:53,081
I reckon at least a third of them

248
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,152
have been packed off
to the glue factory.

249
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:58,791
Well, we'd soon see

250
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,431
because a few more miles
down the old dusty trail,

251
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,301
we were soon to discover

252
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:09,712
that when Iceland isn't doing
peace and quiet... it's doing this.

253
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:22,162
Yes, this favourite local pastime
is sand drag racing.

254
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:27,021
And since this is how Iceland's
petrolheads decide whose wheels

255
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:30,281
are fastest over the black stuff...

256
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,351
Look at some of this!

257
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:35,581
To see whether our intrepid
explorers were anything

258
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,641
like fit-for-purpose,

259
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:41,721
we've been told to go
and get stuck in ourselves.

260
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:43,551
Ah! That's right.

261
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:46,791
They're having a look around.
Royalty's here.

262
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,992
The Silver Shadow.

263
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,432
And a little blue thing.

264
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:55,432
Getting out of this
with any dignity isn't easy.

265
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:58,231
Oh.

266
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:01,842
Why do we always turn up
to these things underequipped?

267
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:06,661
Look at that!
That's interesting.

268
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:09,302
A T-shirt over the jumper.

269
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,232
Right, let's have a look round.

270
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:17,311
So it's what... 90 metres drag strip?

271
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,381
Yeah. Oh, all happening.

272
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,582
What's that all about?

273
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,111
Why would you want to do that?

274
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,561
I wouldn't, so let's
forget about that. Drag racing.

275
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,152
Yeah.

276
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:32,362
Oh!

277
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,002
They've named this after you.

278
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,642
Well, nearly.
What's the brake horsepower?

279
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:44,721
A thousand. A thousand.

280
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:47,391
A thousand. On sand.

281
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:48,882
Would you sit in that?

282
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:50,101
No!

283
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:53,882
Essentially what you're
sitting in, there is a rocket.

284
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,152
How much power does this have?

285
00:14:57,392 --> 00:15:00,442
1,200.1,200.

286
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,201
1,200. How much power is that?

287
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:07,742
Can easily be 2,000. 2,000.

288
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:10,521
Is this one of the fastest cars
on the island? Yeah. It is.

289
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:11,921
Yeah.

290
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:15,821
Did you just ask if the 2,000 brake
horsepower drag... drag racer

291
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:17,471
is one of the fastest cars on the
island...

292
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,021
What do you expect the answer to be?

293
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:21,241
There's probably...
There's a faster Corolla over there.

294
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:22,742
There must be a nut job
that's got 4,000.

295
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,381
You know what they're like
round here! Right.

296
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,882
Wow. I want to watch
one of these go.

297
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,752
Can you get in it and show us how
fast it goes? Yeah. Yes.

298
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,512
Oh, come on, then.

299
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,072
Here they go.

300
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:51,641
That is absolutely ridiculous.

301
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:54,081
And with the second biggest result
of the day

302
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:57,631
going to our new friend,
Icelandic Batman,

303
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:00,472
it was time for the main event.

304
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,801
Chris, I've got to say,
after watching those drag races,

305
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:07,391
these people here,
I think they're going to be

306
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,081
a little bit underwhelmed.

307
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:11,641
What! After a 2,000 horsepower
nitrous dragster,

308
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:13,151
why would they be disappointed

309
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,282
watching a Silver Shadow
bury itself?

310
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,951
But, just to add to the spectacle,

311
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:24,362
the producers had decided
to make this drag a three-way.

312
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:29,112
What's that doing here?

313
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:33,162
And what's he doing driving it?

314
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,032
He must have been double jabbed.

315
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:43,951
And that meant, with a special treat
lined up for the winner,

316
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:48,921
the first ever budget British
expedition vehicle foot race

317
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:50,962
was on.

318
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:56,721
We're away.

319
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:58,361
Oh, my God.

320
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,652
Can I get a bit more traction?

321
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,361
Stig's going well.

322
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:06,591
Now, we've got some power.

323
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,601
Now the Chevette comes into its own.

324
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,461
34, 36.

325
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,281
I've got him.

326
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,161
I'm nowhere near him.

327
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:22,822
The victor's the little Corvette.

328
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:33,362
That was ridiculous.
That was the slowest race ever.

329
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:40,231
Well, congratulations, we all knew
what the outcome were going to be,

330
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,671
but it was nice to see you
go over the finish line.

331
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:45,831
As ever, when someone wins,
they've got to get on the podium

332
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,461
and reap the rewards.

333
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,512
What rewards?

334
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,471
Why do they always dress me?

335
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,471
I always end up looking
like a complete idiot.

336
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:55,641
You'll be all right.

337
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,552
Ignore that - that frayed bit.

338
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,031
There's a massive knot
in that one, look.

339
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,471
OK, guys, here we go.

340
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,801
Is this it? Are we doing it?
Are we doing it?

341
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:06,681
All right.
Paddy, get over that way.

342
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,031
We're doing it. Go on, Chris.

343
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:13,241
Oh, BLEEP this
for a game of soldiers.

344
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,361
Ready? Yes.

345
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:18,151
Go on, Chris. Oh, Jesus!

346
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:22,121
Agh! I can't run. My leg's off.

347
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:24,721
Oh, Paddy!

348
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:27,111
Go on, Chris.

349
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,032
There she goes.

350
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:34,241
Agh! Blimey.

351
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:36,591
McGuinness!

352
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:39,012
How high up are we now?

353
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,801
Now I think it's around 300 metres.

354
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:44,961
Wow, OK.

355
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:47,111
Now what's happening?
Is the rope OK?

356
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,731
Pad, he's taken the rope away.

357
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,161
What do I do?

358
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,161
Enjoy it.

359
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:55,962
We're really high up.
Really, really high up.

360
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:01,041
It wasn't all bad news
for Harris, though.

361
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:05,921
The view up here
is absolutely outrageous.

362
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:10,762
Because once he'd finally touched
down, and we were on our way again,

363
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:13,551
at least he could get back
to enjoying

364
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,602
the luxurious comfort
of his Vauxhall.

365
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,191
How is the briquette?

366
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,171
This car makes so many noises.

367
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,752
Every single stone
that goes up inside the wheel arch

368
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,622
makes a massive bang.

369
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:30,752
The engine makes
a huge amount of noise.

370
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,632
The tyres make a noise,
but above all of it

371
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,671
is the whine
from the straight cut gears.

372
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:38,121
It takes over everything.

373
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:41,731
Just... can you ask, why have
you got the straight cut gears?

374
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:46,081
Because they give me much faster,
more satisfying gearshifts.

375
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:50,362
We're driving. We're pottering
around Iceland for God's sake.

376
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:58,551
And when it comes to pottering
around Iceland, one of our cars

377
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:01,802
really was in a class of its own.

378
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:05,401
I know I've said it before,
I'm going to keep saying it.

379
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:08,892
This car was proper cutting edge.
Back in the day,

380
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:11,911
the Silver Shadow was one of
the most advanced cars

381
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,271
in the world.

382
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:17,271
It had magic hydraulic suspension,
and everything was electric.

383
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:20,241
It showed the world
what we were capable of.

384
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:24,271
Little things like this...
Now, THIS is an absolute treat.

385
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,392
Look at this. When you put the radio
on, watch the aerial.

386
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:30,632
Look at that!

387
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:32,522
Isn't that amazing?

388
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:36,800
Aw, I miss things like that. The old
aerial pops up.

389
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:40,255
When you turn the radio off,
down it goes.

390
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,686
Look at that.

391
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,276
Oh, God.

392
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:50,195
Hold on a second. Slight
technical. Won't be a moment.

393
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:51,406
Aerial issues.

394
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,555
Here we go.

395
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:56,395
I've got a hole where my radio was.

396
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:59,767
I've got two wires. And you're
worried about your electric aerial?

397
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,456
That's the one.

398
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:11,525
Just to be clear, if a slightly
sticky aerial is the only thing

399
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:14,605
you can complain about on
your expedition,

400
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,276
that, my friends, is called winning.

401
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:23,995
And over in the Courgette, it had
been the straw that finally

402
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,555
broke Harris.

403
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:40,915
I'll come straight out with it, Pad.

404
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,806
This car is ridiculous.

405
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,715
Could we stop so I can phone Fred

406
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:49,166
and maybe rent his Range Rover
off him?

407
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,486
Sadly, though, we couldn't.

408
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:59,685
Because it was time for the next
stage of our expedition testing

409
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:00,806
to begin.

410
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:05,805
And since successful expeditions
aren't only about the fitness

411
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,715
of the vehicles,

412
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:11,125
before heading back into the wild,
we'd been told

413
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:16,165
we'd be trying out another of
Iceland's favourite pastimes.

414
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:20,886
This one designed to see
if we were also

415
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,046
match fit.

416
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:28,965
Yes, the Strong Man contest.

417
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:32,636
Us two up against some very
large locals,

418
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:38,276
led by the world's tenth strongest
man, Eythor Ingolfsson Melsted.

419
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:40,925
Here we go.

420
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,435
How do you do a hard walk?

421
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:43,606
Do that with your arms.

422
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,056
How are you? Hey, guys. How are you?

423
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:49,776
Can I ask a couple of questions?

424
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:51,535
How much do you weigh?

425
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,485
I'm around 145 kilos.

426
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:56,965
How much can you lift,
sort of weight?

427
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:59,355
I deadlift 300, to 70kg.

428
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:01,925
3... Whoa, that's a lot.

429
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:03,845
Now, we're going to do some
warm-up. What, here?

430
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,636
Yeah.

431
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:09,795
Now, somewhere in the middle
of this frankly hateful exercise...

432
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,075
Come on, let's go!

433
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:12,835
We are going!

434
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,535
it was revealed that McGuinness

435
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:18,415
and I would be competing together
over three rounds

436
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,575
with a vehicular theme.

437
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,165
Oh, God. 20 push ups.

438
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,155
Come on. Oh, God. All the way down.

439
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:25,796
Come on! I'm going!

440
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:33,636
And that meant we'd be kicking off
with the tyre flip,

441
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:36,925
where our strongman opponent
would be the fresh-faced

442
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:39,246
Kristjan Jon Haraldsson.

443
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:45,166
All right, guys!
In three, two, one...

444
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,436
Come on, McGuinness.

445
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,726
McGuinness, come on!

446
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:57,126
One more, Chris! Ready? Yeah!

447
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:07,995
I think Flintoff
would have been proud of that.

448
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:11,365
A surprise early win for Britain.

449
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,255
And next up was the car walk.

450
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:18,205
But with Kristjan back for
revenge,

451
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:22,406
this one did need a bit
more practise.

452
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:26,165
Three, two, one, go!

453
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,636
So, we're going on the "go"?

454
00:24:27,637 --> 00:24:29,205
Yeah. Right.

455
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,736
You ready? I just lifted it!

456
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:34,326
Go!

457
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:38,695
Kristjan, I don't know if you've
ever seen Top Gear,

458
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:40,965
but it's probably better just
putting an engine in it

459
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:41,996
and driving it, son.

460
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:47,805
Lost on him. Let's just do it.

461
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,605
All right, guys, are you ready?

462
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:52,406
No! Three, two, one!

463
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,636
Are you ready?

464
00:24:58,637 --> 00:25:00,156
Oh, BLEEP!

465
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,336
Paddy, stop it! Paddy!

466
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:08,366
Come on, Pad!

467
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:10,686
Yes!

468
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,686
I can't quite get up there.
Thank you.

469
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,605
1 -1, then.

470
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:22,925
And for the decider, Eythor
himself will be stepping up

471
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:26,085
for the fearsome truck pull.

472
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:29,275
Or to make it even vaguely
a contest,

473
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:33,795
the truck versus two much
lighter cars...

474
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:35,605
pull.

475
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:37,885
Hey, we're up against the big
lad now!

476
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:41,325
This is for Team GB. Tenth strongest
man in the world

477
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:45,135
versus the tenth funniest
man in the world.

478
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,405
And the smallest man in the world.
Shut up! Right.

479
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,695
OK, guys, are you ready?

480
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,647
Three, two, one.

481
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:55,326
Get down!

482
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:59,776
Go, go, go. We've got it.
We've got it.

483
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:02,215
Come on!
Keep going, Chris.

484
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:06,636
Suddenly, Harris's stripped-out,
lightweight Chevette wasn't looking

485
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:09,416
like such a bad choice after all.

486
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:12,766
Keep it going. Little steps.

487
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,725
Look at me feet.
Come on, son.

488
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:17,205
Keep going. I can't do much more.
Keep going!

489
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:20,795
And with the big, heavy
lorry digging its heels in,

490
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:26,056
it turned out the soft Icelandic
turf was also on our side.

491
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:34,126
Are we done here?

492
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:37,856
Eythor!

493
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:42,646
Oh! Every respect, sir.

494
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:46,955
Oh! That... How you guys
do that,

495
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:48,715
I'll never know.

496
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:50,495
Oh, thank you so...

497
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,885
But I think the main thing is...
The real winners were us.

498
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:56,606
He's right. It is us.
Well done! Yes!

499
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:00,085
Right! A protein shake.

500
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,376
See you on the other side.

501
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:04,726
Ooh, I'm seeing colours.

502
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:11,695
Now, having proven we could also
handle anything Iceland

503
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,445
could throw at us...

504
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:17,516
ish, the time had come to point
our two-car convoy

505
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:21,436
towards the island's wilder,
more remote, interior.

506
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:28,935
From here on out, tarmac roads would
be a distant memory.

507
00:27:28,936 --> 00:27:30,125
Whoa!

508
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:33,246
The expedition testing was back
in full swing...

509
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,136
with our next obstacle being...

510
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:38,486
water.

511
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,925
How's the little Chevette?

512
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:44,936
All right, this is a bit
more serious.

513
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:48,777
This is not good.

514
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:51,886
Fear not, my little friend.

515
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:56,725
This is where the Rolls-Royce
comes into its own.

516
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,136
Here we go.

517
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,955
Stay close, Croquette.

518
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:05,375
It might get moist.

519
00:28:05,376 --> 00:28:09,045
Here we go. Straight in. Come on!

520
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:11,295
Come on, Silver Lady!

521
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:14,605
Oh! Not a problem!

522
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,805
A lot of smoke coming out of
the bonnet, though.

523
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,406
How's he getting on?

524
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,886
Go on, son.

525
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,435
She's stuck.

526
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:32,006
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

527
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:49,735
Come on, little Chevette!

528
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:52,155
- Yes!
- Is that the little Croquette?

529
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:53,596
No turning back now!

530
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:14,396
Never in doubt, Patrick.

531
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:15,446
Whoa!

532
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:21,045
Oh!

533
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:22,397
Now we're expeditioning.

534
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,326
Look at that up in front of us
there, Chris.

535
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:32,776
Oh, now, that over there,

536
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:36,045
would you say - is that a volcano,
Christopher?

537
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,936
That is the most active volcano
on the island.

538
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,756
That is Hekla.

539
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:49,965
Just one of the many active
volcanoes that have shaped Iceland's

540
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,166
volatile, unstable landscape.

541
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:59,885
Hekla itself forms part of a 25-mile
long volcanic ridge that last

542
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:02,446
erupted 21 years ago.

543
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:06,885
The fact that its next eruption
is now considered by many

544
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:10,965
to be overdue only made it all
the more predictable

545
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:14,886
that this was where we'd been told
to head to spend the night.

546
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:20,805
Everywhere you look in this place,
there's evidence of some massive

547
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:24,335
force of nature having smashed
the landscape to bits,

548
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:26,885
or flattened it, or blown it up.

549
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:29,215
It's just so wild.

550
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:33,045
I was never sure if wilderness were
my thing, but I've got to say

551
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:35,096
I am absolutely loving this.

552
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,866
Look at the change of scenery now,
on the right-hand side.

553
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:47,565
Did you see that sign we just
passed, son?

554
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:50,815
Only four-by-fours allowed
on this road.

555
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:54,605
I feel like one of them
Great British explorers heading

556
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:57,685
off into unchartered territories.

557
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:01,407
Captain Cook, Scott of
the Antarctic, Shackleton.

558
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:05,376
You know they all died on their
voyages, don't you, buddy?

559
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:12,165
And Captain Cook had a boat, not
a Rolls-Royce!

560
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,485
Maybe. But, to be fair,

561
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:16,165
if he'd had the Chevette,

562
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,675
he'd almost certainly

563
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,935
have died sooner.

564
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:25,125
Oh! Why did I choose
this bloody car?

565
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:27,175
Why did I choose this bloody car?

566
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,965
How are you feeling about your
choice now, honestly?

567
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:32,225
Terrible.

568
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:36,865
Not to worry, though, because just
a few more easy miles up the road...

569
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:38,045
Whoa!

570
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:44,016
we finally reached our overnight
refuge, at the foot of a volcano.

571
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:49,125
That's a lava field behind it.

572
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:52,125
This is right in the firing line.

573
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:54,657
Oh, there's a picnic table
there, a little basket.

574
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:02,766
Oh.

575
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:09,455
Have you got a spare coccyx?
I'm broken.

576
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:12,335
I don't think I 'll ever tire of
seeing you getting out of that car.

577
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:13,965
Oh. Look at this, though, eh?

578
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,376
What a spot, Patrick.

579
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,945
Little picnic. Job's a good 'un.

580
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:22,045
Fortnum and Mason's hamper.

581
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:24,176
Oh, let me see. Other hampers
are available.

582
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:28,495
Oh, don't, don't.

583
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,125
Of course.

584
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:31,605
BLEEP. Don't.

585
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:35,375
Every hard-working expedition
needs its rations.

586
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,845
BLEEP me.

587
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:43,586
And ours was a selection of
traditional Icelandic delicacies.

588
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:46,835
No!

589
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:49,455
How are you even touching that?
They've taken the brain out. Look,

590
00:32:49,456 --> 00:32:51,485
you see its tongue and its teeth
here. Oh!

591
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:54,015
Let's get a fork out and have a go
at it. Come on.

592
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,165
How do you get in it?
That looks good, in there.

593
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,246
What's that? Well, that looks good
there. Buried goose!

594
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:01,935
No, no, Chris.

595
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,685
That's pretty good. You're on
your own.

596
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:05,885
I've got some crunchy nutters
in the car.

597
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:08,646
Ram's testicles. Where? There.

598
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:10,245
They're an odd shape.

599
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:12,895
I'm going to try a bit of testicle
on bread. You're not.

600
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,055
Why not?

601
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:17,647
Oh! No, no, no!

602
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,835
It's got a real, salty hit to it.

603
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:21,936
Urgh!

604
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:27,735
To be honest, I think
I've had my fill for the day.

605
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:31,325
The only trouble is, it's about
half ten at night.

606
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:35,125
It's broad daylight. Can I tempt
you with some mutton? No, no, no.

607
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:38,325
Uh, I've just noticed,
no curtains.

608
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:39,476
Great.

609
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:46,815
I don't know whether to say
goodnight or good morning,

610
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,456
but, anyhow, see you in a bit.

611
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:53,816
Oh, that's good gear, Pad.

612
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:02,846
Get out!

613
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:23,900
Fred, the one time we really needed
you - lifting stuff and eating

614
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,650
horrendous things, where were you?

615
00:34:25,651 --> 00:34:27,489
Genuinely, I'm gutted I
wasn't there.

616
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,379
You know what I'm most gutted about?
I didn't get a chance to drive

617
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,629
that Range Rover. Yeah. And it was
a lovely choice, Fred,

618
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,979
but if I'm nit picking,

619
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,619
you could have gone for the
three-door because the late

620
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,629
great Charles Spencer King...
On the plus side,

621
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,339
you did swerve three days of that.

622
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,929
I suppose self-isolating isn't
too bad after all. Anyhow,

623
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,660
it's time to move on and talk
about this -

624
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:48,619
the Chevrolet Camaro.

625
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,780
Actually, my Chevrolet Camaro.
Which used

626
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:53,539
to be my Chevrolet Camaro.
I know, Chris. I know.

627
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,910
Kaching.
No shame whatsoever.

628
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:59,509
The point is, I've always been
a sucker for fast American cars,

629
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,239
but I had to admit, they're not
built for British roads.

630
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,189
They're not refined. And the
steering wheel's on the wrong side.

631
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,190
But now there's an American sports
car that promises to solve all that.

632
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,419
Here it is.

633
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,179
The all-new Chevrolet Corvette.

634
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,149
For the first time ever,

635
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,189
it's got its engine behind
the driver,

636
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,791
and it's got its steering
wheel on the right.

637
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:39,369
This all-American hero is starting
to look a lot like one of your fancy

638
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,100
European sports cars.

639
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,419
The question is - does it go
like one?

640
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,300
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

641
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,290
Knock it down a couple of gears.

642
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,510
And...

643
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,819
Oh! There she goes!

644
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,350
She flies!

645
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,940
Oh, my word. 100mph already!

646
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,459
Nought to 60
in just over three seconds.

647
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,781
184mph top speed.

648
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,190
That isn't sports car fast.
That's supercar fast.

649
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,671
This is one quick car.

650
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,910
And that's thanks to Chevy's
6.2 litre, small-block V8,

651
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:40,460
making over 480 horsepower.

652
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,910
I love it!

653
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,099
Only the Americans can put
the word "small" anywhere

654
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,921
near a six litre engine.

655
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,020
Bonkers!

656
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,259
The thing is, though, American
sports cars have never struggled

657
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,859
with going fast in a straight line.

658
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,990
The problem's always been corners.

659
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,790
And when you do reach a corner in
your Corvette,

660
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:12,820
you discover...

661
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:17,990
it is brilliant!

662
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,580
Oh, whoa!

663
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,819
Old Corvettes, we'd have been in
a wrestling match on track,

664
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,270
but this one is with you.

665
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,870
It's a whole other fighter.

666
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:48,469
The gearbox is a fancy
dual-clutch paddle shift.

667
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,080
You can even have clever magnetic
shock absorbers.

668
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,589
And having the engine behind
the driver means you're right

669
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,920
in the thick of it. You know

670
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:02,790
exactly what's going on,

671
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,870
and what's going on is all good!

672
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,589
And it's the same story inside.

673
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,599
Sitting in an American car

674
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,579
has traditionally been a cheap
and cheerful experience.

675
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,900
But the Corvette's interior
is anything but.

676
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,029
There's leather everywhere.

677
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,229
There's screens and cameras
everywhere.

678
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,680
There's even one in the rear view
mirror.

679
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,566
And look at this. Press this,

680
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,716
it records your driving, overlaid
with data on how fast

681
00:38:41,717 --> 00:38:45,107
you're going and the G-force.
It does the whole lot.

682
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,366
And it's got a pop-out roof, so it's
a convertible, too.

683
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:53,116
Seriously, you've got everything you
need in here, and it doesn't feel

684
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,627
cheap and cheerful.

685
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:56,777
It feels expensive and cheerful.

686
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:04,077
So, how expensive is
the new Corvette?

687
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:07,187
Well, that depends.

688
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:13,417
See, in America, these cars start
at $60,000.

689
00:39:14,547 --> 00:39:16,467
That's £45,000.

690
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:21,146
£45,000 for a nearly 500 horsepower,

691
00:39:21,147 --> 00:39:22,387
mid-engine sports car.

692
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:28,627
I know Corvettes have always been
about bang for your buck.

693
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:30,907
But that's an absolute steal.

694
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:37,577
If you can't pay in bucks, though,
it's not quite such good news.

695
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:44,347
The Corvette we get over here
starts at 75 grand.

696
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,907
This one has tested...

697
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:49,508
85 grand.

698
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:52,117
Come on, America!

699
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:54,827
We gave you the English language.

700
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:58,507
We gave you the internet.

701
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:01,836
We gave you... James Corden.

702
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:04,347
And this is how you repay us?!

703
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,627
But here's the thing.

704
00:40:07,628 --> 00:40:13,037
Even at that price, this car
is still a total bargain.

705
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,627
Nothing else,

706
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:22,106
nothing else you can buy in the UK
right now gives you this much

707
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:24,826
performance for your pound,

708
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:26,587
this much car for your cash.

709
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:30,987
Pound for pound for fun!

710
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,707
This is right up there.

711
00:40:36,307 --> 00:40:38,628
I'm struggling to find something
I don't like.

712
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:49,628
Come on!

713
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:56,426
I'm a Northerner.

714
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:57,707
I love a bargain!

715
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:01,748
Stick some gravy on it, I'm sold!

716
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:20,836
Look at his face. Look at him!

717
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:24,146
Not a happy chappy. What's wrong
with you? OK.

718
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,776
This could go on a while,
but I'll keep it short.

719
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:29,767
It looks like two cars sewn together
in the middle. Doesn't look right.

720
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:31,866
It's not coherent, there's too much
volume back here.

721
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,757
But most importantly, I don't want
a mid-engine Corvette.

722
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,556
It should be an American muscle car,
front end to rear wheel drive.

723
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:41,066
I'm going to put it in terms that
you'll understand - biscuits.

724
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:42,706
Oh, right. Jaffa Cakes.

725
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:45,576
Yes. A Jaffa Cake should have
marmalade orangey stuff in it.

726
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:47,906
Not one of these new ones
with cherry or lime.

727
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:49,397
I want to know what I'm getting.

728
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:51,936
American muscle car.
This is trying to be a Ferrari.

729
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:53,986
It's trying to be European.
He has got a point.

730
00:41:53,987 --> 00:41:56,576
But, listen, there's plenty of
muscle car fans out there.

731
00:41:56,577 --> 00:42:00,637
So, Fred, would you keep the Camaro
or trade up to the Corvette?

732
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,226
Do you know what?

733
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:05,146
I like this car, but I love
that one.

734
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,546
Yes, Fred! When we put them nose
to nose, I've not even

735
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:10,186
looked at this. Yeah.

736
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:11,916
It's just all about that for me.

737
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,347
I love that car.
Paid over the odds, but love it.

738
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,647
Right, now it's time to do something
else we've not done for a while.

739
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:22,486
We're going to put this car
around our track in the hands

740
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:24,197
of The Stig.

741
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:33,356
Engine in the middle means more
weight over the rear wheels,

742
00:42:33,357 --> 00:42:35,447
which means better traction
off the line.

743
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:42,627
Sounding great, normally
aspirated V8.

744
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:45,206
It's greasy out there. Stig reckons
these sorts of conditions

745
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,417
can cost at least three or four
seconds a lap.

746
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:53,496
You can see the suspension almost
fighting the roll there.

747
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:56,547
Through Chicago. Looks flat
and fast.

748
00:42:57,727 --> 00:43:00,206
Stig working his way through
the eight-speed box.

749
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,326
No, manual option
on this Corvette.

750
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:04,856
Breaking hard at the Hammerhead.

751
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:06,486
Not so much stability on the brakes.

752
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:09,446
Really fighting to keep the car in
a straight line

753
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:11,937
Using all of the tarmac.
A little bit of grass, too.

754
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:15,077
Down into the Follow Through.

755
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:19,317
And he had a little bit of a brake
there! Unusual for The Stig.

756
00:43:21,037 --> 00:43:24,826
Second-to-last, the most difficult
corner, pick your entry point.

757
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:28,527
He's fighting it all the way
in little steering inputs.

758
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:31,007
Through Gambon now, what's he going
to do? Bit of grass.

759
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:33,597
Over the line.

760
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,197
So, it's a damp lap.

761
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:43,146
What do you think? I'm thinking it's
got to be faster

762
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:44,936
than the M3. OK.

763
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:47,066
It was a damp lap. Pressure's on.

764
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,586
The time was

765
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:52,856
1:21.7.

766
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:54,297
There it is.

767
00:43:56,097 --> 00:43:58,906
OK.
Just under the F-Type. Damp time.

768
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:01,546
Damp time. And this is the top of
the board, isn't it?

769
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:04,657
Well... We've tested a lot
more cars, haven't we, Pad?

770
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:06,906
I have thought of this, gentlemen.

771
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:09,717
What do you mean you've thought
of it? I've knocked this up today.

772
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,517
Oh, now, Patrick!

773
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,126
Eh? You've excelled yourself here.

774
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:17,566
Needs a bit more WD-40, I've got to
be honest.

775
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,756
I'm liking that, Pad. Won't be
a minute.

776
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,466
Still going. So, it could be about
four seconds quicker.

777
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:25,377
Here we go. Boom.

778
00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:27,916
It's sort of Honda NSX speed,
isn't it?

779
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:30,217
You've just pointed
somewhere you can reach.

780
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,426
So, there you go. Mid-table, not
relegation.

781
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:39,226
And now it's time to get back to our
big Iceland adventure,

782
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:41,116
where Fred was still stuck in the UK

783
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:43,886
and our British expedition
vehicles were about to be put

784
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:45,457
to the ultimate test.

785
00:44:51,077 --> 00:44:54,647
With the Icelandic summer
and its never-ending daylight

786
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:57,026
waking us bright and early...

787
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,377
Look at that.

788
00:44:58,378 --> 00:44:59,946
it was time to find out

789
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,817
what the last leg of our mini
expedition had in store.

790
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:08,466
Good night's sleep, that, Pad.
Surprisingly nice, that.

791
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:09,837
Oh, challenge!

792
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:19,936
"Iceland is the home of proper
expedition vehicles.

793
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:22,656
"To see how adventurous your cars
really are,

794
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:25,197
"you will now race against the king
of the locals."

795
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:30,367
Oh, God.

796
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:37,446
This absolute monster is
a Ford F-150 pick-up,

797
00:45:37,447 --> 00:45:42,117
modified by Icelandic off-road
legends, Arctic Trucks.

798
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:48,966
Their vehicles have been used to
conquer some of the most hostile

799
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:50,367
terrains on the planet.

800
00:45:53,528 --> 00:45:57,686
But as if that wasn't enough of an
unfair advantage, their latest

801
00:45:57,687 --> 00:46:02,247
creation would, of course,
be driven by The Stig.

802
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:06,866
This is a problem.

803
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:09,746
The ultimate expedition machine,

804
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,547
driven by the ultimate driving
machine.

805
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:19,246
And we're racing him in a Chevette
and an old Silver Shadow.

806
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:20,638
Yeah. Right.

807
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,177
And then there was the race route.

808
00:46:26,677 --> 00:46:29,486
Continuing to follow the rough
tracks that coursed

809
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,186
through the Icelandic interior,

810
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:34,746
we'd have to find our way to
the edge

811
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:36,628
of the Raudhaskal crater.

812
00:46:38,077 --> 00:46:42,456
The finish line was just 20
odd miles away, but as part

813
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:46,246
of the Hekla volcanic ridge, it lay
at the heart of one

814
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:49,408
of the world's most active
volcanic regions.

815
00:46:50,447 --> 00:46:54,096
So, to give us at least a fighting
chance,

816
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:57,326
we'd get a 30 minute head start.

817
00:46:57,327 --> 00:47:00,326
Just long enough, the producers
reckoned, for us to reach

818
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:02,566
the finish line first,

819
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:07,887
if our budget Brits didn't,
as they put it, die trying.

820
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:16,106
Right, rally, boy.

821
00:47:16,107 --> 00:47:18,666
We're a team on this. Don't
be shooting

822
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:21,307
off in the old Croquette and leaving
me for dead.

823
00:47:23,398 --> 00:47:27,106
Here we go. Three, two, one.

824
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:28,157
Go!

825
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:36,267
What's he doing? What's he doing?

826
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:37,626
What are you doing?

827
00:47:37,627 --> 00:47:39,537
My strategy is the faster I go,

828
00:47:39,538 --> 00:47:41,027
I reckon the faster you'll go.

829
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:45,007
Oh! Now we're moving.

830
00:47:46,177 --> 00:47:49,487
All kinds of stones thrown
at the Silver Lady!

831
00:47:51,057 --> 00:47:54,387
So, with just half an hour to get
as far ahead of The Stig

832
00:47:54,388 --> 00:47:58,927
as possible, apparently teamwork
had gone straight out the window.

833
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:02,057
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't see
a thing!

834
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:06,586
But having spent the whole trip
waiting for Harris's Chevette

835
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:09,346
to make any kind of sense,

836
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:12,947
it was at least nice to be there
for the big moment.

837
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:19,747
Woo! What a fantastic bit of road.

838
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:25,237
Finally! My choice is paying
dividends.

839
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,797
This is driving!

840
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:31,977
There he is. Go on, Harris!

841
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:36,446
The Chevette is still so agile.

842
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,697
Straight-cut gears!

843
00:48:41,257 --> 00:48:42,377
This is fun!

844
00:48:44,977 --> 00:48:46,337
Oh, she's singing!

845
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:48,827
Oh, she is singing.

846
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:04,456
While Stig bided his time
before the hunt began,

847
00:49:04,457 --> 00:49:08,676
with "Chrissi Makinen" pulling away
fast, it was all me and my Shadow

848
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,827
could do to hang on to the back
of him.

849
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:15,398
Oh, flat chat down here. Come on!

850
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:17,817
Whoa!

851
00:49:19,317 --> 00:49:20,508
Oh, BLEEP.

852
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,037
Phwoar, that one crept up on me.

853
00:49:27,837 --> 00:49:31,857
I can still see that little
Croquette's dust in front of me.

854
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:33,997
Come on.

855
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:47,236
This is rallying old -school.

856
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:49,277
They used to do hundreds of miles
like this.

857
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,357
No notes, just driving on site.

858
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:55,197
Crest.

859
00:49:57,637 --> 00:49:59,347
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

860
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:03,467
Whoa. Big jump.

861
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:06,626
Oh, sugar.

862
00:50:06,627 --> 00:50:09,627
Feels like my left suspension is
a bit different to my right.

863
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,116
This looks a bit jumpy.

864
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:28,557
Oh!

865
00:50:30,437 --> 00:50:34,066
She's moving about is the girl.

866
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:35,477
Oh!

867
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:42,906
How often are you going to get
the chance to take a Silver Shadow

868
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:45,528
rallying in Iceland?

869
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:51,407
Up ahead, though, it was quickly
becoming clear that my approach

870
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:56,268
to rallying in Iceland
had been a little overenthusiastic.

871
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:01,427
Moving down to third and I think
the Chevette's not very happy!

872
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,567
Engine's bogged down.

873
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:07,677
Either that or I'm losing power.

874
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:10,357
I could be.

875
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:13,966
I want to be going quick.

876
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:17,346
But I'm trying to get the car round
in one piece as well.

877
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:19,887
It's literally like rallying on
the moon!

878
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:24,317
Oh, my engine's not sounding
very good now.

879
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:28,957
We've got engine issues, I think.

880
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:32,237
Can't see Pad, I don't know where
he is.

881
00:51:34,477 --> 00:51:37,317
And then things got worse.

882
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:40,126
Caution there.

883
00:51:40,127 --> 00:51:41,236
Oh.

884
00:51:41,237 --> 00:51:43,357
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

885
00:51:45,987 --> 00:51:48,796
Not very clearly signposted.

886
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:53,476
It turns out, on those rough tracks
that cut across the Icelandic

887
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,637
backcountry, missing a turn is easy.

888
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:00,626
Almost as easy, in fact,

889
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:02,957
as grinding to a halt altogether.

890
00:52:07,927 --> 00:52:09,067
I'm stuck.

891
00:52:10,148 --> 00:52:13,607
Still, it's not like we were
being chased.

892
00:52:26,437 --> 00:52:27,636
Yes.

893
00:52:27,637 --> 00:52:32,237
Our 30 minutes were up and Stig
was on the hunt.

894
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:48,227
Oh, I can see him. There he is.

895
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:53,426
Is he stopped? Oh, my God, he's
stopped. What's he doing?

896
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:55,207
Have you stopped? What's going on?

897
00:52:57,278 --> 00:52:58,846
The directions weren't very clear.

898
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:01,047
I went straight on and now
I can't get moving.

899
00:53:02,197 --> 00:53:04,327
I'm going to nudge up to you,
ready?

900
00:53:09,997 --> 00:53:11,047
Oh.

901
00:53:12,687 --> 00:53:13,717
We're off!

902
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:18,486
A lovely bit of rescue service from
the roller there!

903
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:21,037
Teamwork makes the dream work.

904
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:26,046
The plucky Brits
might have been back on the move,

905
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:29,337
but as Stig smashed across the plane
somewhere behind us...

906
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:35,487
soon it was the Shadow's turn
to start feeling the pressure.

907
00:53:39,947 --> 00:53:41,847
Jesus, it's bumpy here, Chris!

908
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:47,417
I think I've lost power steering or
I've got a puncture.

909
00:53:47,418 --> 00:53:49,046
Lost power as well. Bloody hell!

910
00:53:49,047 --> 00:53:52,077
Philips is hanging out the tape
deck. Get in!

911
00:53:56,037 --> 00:53:59,646
Come on, Pad. Get that roller going.

912
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:01,957
Slowing down a bit on me.
Come on, girl!

913
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:07,476
This is where The Stig will gain
valuable time

914
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,566
on us, cos he'll go over those rocks
like they're nothing,

915
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:12,797
like they're popping candy.

916
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:30,288
Some of these crests are
a bit blind.

917
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:34,168
Watch out for the ridges
coming up! It's got...

918
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:38,676
Big lump down the middle.
Be careful, all right?

919
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:40,158
Oh, that looks a bit ominous.

920
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:43,167
Oh!

921
00:54:43,168 --> 00:54:44,567
Oh-ho!

922
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:49,076
Go on, the Silver Lady!

923
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,207
Cheers, pal.

924
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:02,158
The landscape had been taking
its toll.

925
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,877
It's getting hot in here now.

926
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:08,486
Come on, old girl.

927
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:12,317
But our cars were still just about
hanging on.

928
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:16,487
Raudhaskal was now just six
miles away.

929
00:55:18,237 --> 00:55:22,646
And as we began the final push,
round to the crater's edge,

930
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:24,077
the real question was...

931
00:55:25,217 --> 00:55:26,777
where was our pursuer?

932
00:55:29,677 --> 00:55:31,317
Can't see The Stig.

933
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:33,387
Still can't see him.

934
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:36,517
Can't see the Stig, pal!

935
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,726
Oh, we're down to three now.

936
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:42,086
I've only got three cylinders, so
you'll have to bear with me.

937
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:43,158
My engine's dying.

938
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:46,807
Come on, come on.

939
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:53,158
I can't see The Stig... Oh, Jesus,
he's here!

940
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:57,447
Oh, no.

941
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,246
That's a big rock!

942
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:02,397
Oh, God!

943
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:06,887
Go, Pad. Come on, Pad.

944
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:13,207
Hold on, Silver Shadow! Come on!

945
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,017
It's going to be tight.

946
00:56:18,727 --> 00:56:21,737
Come on, come on, the Shadow!

947
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:25,496
Come on, Pad. Keep up, mate!
Come on, Pad.

948
00:56:25,497 --> 00:56:27,007
We're going to drag you along.

949
00:56:28,877 --> 00:56:29,927
He's on me!

950
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:34,087
Come on, Paddy McGuinness!

951
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:37,037
I'm here, son!

952
00:56:37,038 --> 00:56:38,357
He's right on me.

953
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:42,677
Argh! Get round.

954
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:44,937
Oh!

955
00:56:46,677 --> 00:56:48,037
Go on, get up there!

956
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:49,597
Come on, the roller.

957
00:56:50,877 --> 00:56:51,927
We have got him!

958
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,526
Oh! Made it!

959
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,217
Yeah! What?!

960
00:57:08,048 --> 00:57:09,087
Oh!

961
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:11,886
Wow!

962
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,756
We've done it, son! Wow.

963
00:57:14,757 --> 00:57:16,206
Woo!

964
00:57:16,207 --> 00:57:19,606
We've just raced to the top
of a volcano.

965
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:21,117
I'll tell you what...

966
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:24,006
There he is!

967
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,816
Good work. Never in doubt.

968
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,366
There he is.

969
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:28,397
Oh!

970
00:57:30,097 --> 00:57:31,327
Look at that.

971
00:57:33,437 --> 00:57:35,447
That is immense.

972
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:39,127
That over there, all lava.

973
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,116
Do you know that?
That's unbelievable.

974
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:45,937
I love the way this is
a voyage of learning for you.

975
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:49,477
Oh, drink it in.

976
00:57:59,298 --> 00:58:01,647
Found a volcano. Wow.

977
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:08,297
What a trip. Great cars,
unbelievable scenery, and we beat

978
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:11,006
The Stig to the top of the volcano.
It was fantastic.

979
00:58:11,007 --> 00:58:12,726
The only thing missing was you,
big man.

980
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:15,016
I'm still gutted. I would love to
have been there.

981
00:58:15,017 --> 00:58:17,167
I've got serious FOMO. Serious.

982
00:58:17,168 --> 00:58:19,686
What about the cars? Little
soldiers, both of them. Yes.

983
00:58:19,687 --> 00:58:21,686
Widebody Chevette, Fred.

984
00:58:21,687 --> 00:58:23,406
Look at that. Yeah.

985
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:26,836
Well, it's time to decide who bought
the best car.

986
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,086
Obviously, Chris, you're going
to go with the Croquette.

987
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:30,287
Yes. Yeah.

988
00:58:30,288 --> 00:58:33,096
And I'll go for the Silver Lady,
which means casting vote's

989
00:58:33,097 --> 00:58:35,406
yours, Fred, and I bet you're going
to go with Chris,

990
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:36,736
cos it's his Chevette.

991
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:39,086
"Ooh, it's Chris's Chevette."

992
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:40,766
Really? "Ooh!"

993
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,446
All right, then. On the one hand,
I'm looking at a blue car

994
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:45,606
with a big white dot on the bonnet.

995
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:49,047
Yep. This one, I'm looking at
a national treasure,

996
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:52,456
an institution. Something
with better class, well-built,

997
00:58:52,457 --> 00:58:54,606
obviously unlike the driver.

998
00:58:54,607 --> 00:58:57,966
So, for that reason, I'm going
Rolls-Royce.

999
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,936
Sorry, Chris. Rolls-Royce!

1000
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:02,456
I can't believe it! I can't
believe it!

1001
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,206
I love a Royce, I love them!

1002
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,846
Double teapot. Pathetic.

1003
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:08,756
That's it for tonight, but more good
stuff next week.

1004
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,406
The big lad becomes a qualified
racing driver.

1005
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:13,616
The little lad drives a DeLorean.

1006
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:16,966
And I drive a car worth £4 million.

1007
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,567
Thanks so much for watching.
See you, then. Goodnight!

1008
00:59:49,247 --> 00:59:52,247
This is the bit
