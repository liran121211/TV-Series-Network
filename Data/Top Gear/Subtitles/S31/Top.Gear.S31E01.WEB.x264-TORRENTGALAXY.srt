1
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:37,877
Yes, yes, yes.

2
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:40,077
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

3
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,477
We are back!

4
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:49,636
Love it, and we are still
here at BBC Television Centre,

5
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,536
and I've gotta say boys,
it's good to be here.

6
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:53,396
The history of this place,

7
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:54,996
the shows that have been made here,

8
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,756
and there's a lovely Greggs

9
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,556
on the corner down there, fantastic!

10
00:00:58,656 --> 00:00:59,936
Oh, love a steak bake, Paddy.

11
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,676
Love one, love one.

12
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,716
And we've got a
cracking series coming up,

13
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:06,796
so much good stuff, super cars,
paint bombs, spicy chillies.

14
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,396
And his face when he saw
that sheep brains pate,

15
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,672
and when you ran him
over with the big ball.

16
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,456
Yeah, no, listen this
is all well and good,

17
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:14,436
but no one's got a clue
what we're talking about.

18
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,956
Do you wanna see a sizzle?

19
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,796
Roll the VT.

20
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,836
Huh, right, I'm-

21
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,895
- Woo hoo hoo.

22
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:40,791
Are you gonna go for a habanero?

23
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:43,315
Get it in you, Flintoff.

24
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,315
I'm in trouble.

25
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,155
Come on.

26
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:48,255
Ahhh, ahhh.

27
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:50,475
I think I've pulled summat.

28
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,715
Go on, Jeff.

29
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:54,911
Oh, that's a good shot, Jeff.

30
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:55,935
Go on, Jeff, hit it.

31
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,715
Oh, now we're moving.

32
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:02,015
Shot it.

33
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:04,835
I've seen the end.

34
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:08,675
Ohhh!

35
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:09,775
That's Fairy liquid!

36
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,374
Now this is my kind of day.

37
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:26,774
You're milking it now Pad.

38
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,074
You're milking it!

39
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:40,134
Woo, hoo hoo!

40
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,634
Exciting, that's all to come.

41
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,274
But what are we kicking things
off with tonight with, Fred?

42
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,394
It's a good one, Pad.

43
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:51,954
Track specials, sports cars
made even faster, even sharper,

44
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:54,794
to make you feel like a
hero around a race circuit.

45
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:56,514
And since pretty much well, forever,

46
00:02:56,614 --> 00:03:00,634
the best of the bunch has been
this, the Porsche 911 GT3.

47
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:01,834
Here's the new one.

48
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:05,153
And surprise, surprise, it is brilliant.

49
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,633
It really is, it's a beauty.

50
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,193
But there's some serious
opposition out there,

51
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:13,553
who are gonna give this little
rascal, a run for its money.

52
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,213
So, the three of us went
to try some of them out.

53
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,133
First onto the grid,

54
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:29,493
is the Aston Martin Vantage, F1 edition.

55
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:36,313
It's based on the latest
Formula 1 safety car,

56
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:39,153
which for a road-going track special,

57
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,253
is a pretty good place to start.

58
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,633
But beneath the fancy
paint job and big wing,

59
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:47,833
what this is really,

60
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,932
is the car the Vantage
should always have been.

61
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,672
Now the V8 Vantage
has been around a while.

62
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,672
I drove one on the show
a couple of years ago,

63
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,472
and it was good,

64
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:04,352
but it wasn't this good.

65
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:09,552
Everything possible to
turn a decent sports car

66
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,352
into a track monster.

67
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:15,552
More downforce, more
power, more everything.

68
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,512
The twin turbo V8 has been upgraded

69
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:24,632
to produce 527 horsepower,

70
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,292
so it'll now get to 60 in
just three and a half seconds.

71
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,952
And to make sure you can
use that extra shove,

72
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:34,212
they've gone to town on the chassis too.

73
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:39,351
It's got stiffer bump
stops, more negative camber,

74
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,451
and increased compression damping.

75
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,351
Now I don't know what all that means,

76
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,711
but what I will tell you,
it helps me do this.

77
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:56,611
Oh yeah, this is a day out.

78
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,671
Yeah, ha haaa!

79
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,391
Never mind the old Vantage.

80
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,911
Thing of the past,

81
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,111
you want the F1 edition.

82
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,671
All right, the satnav's still rubbish,

83
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,751
but a good thing about this car
is you're having so much fun

84
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,271
you don't even notice.

85
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:22,190
And you're basically driving the only car

86
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,290
Lewis Hamilton can't overtake.

87
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,490
Who knew safety could so much fun?

88
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,970
Very nice, but for my
money, not quite nice as this.

89
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,650
The Alpha Romeo Giulia GTAm,

90
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,870
based on the already brilliant top

91
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,970
of the range Giulia Quadrifogolio,

92
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,470
thanks to a whole load of
performance-enhancing upgrades,

93
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,230
this is now a completely different animal.

94
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,190
Ha ha ha!

95
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,630
0-60 this thing in less than four seconds

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,470
and it's a four-door saloon.

97
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,869
There we go-hoho!

98
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:17,229
Alfa's F1 team even had a hand

99
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,349
in making sure it goes
round a track like it should

100
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,029
and it definitely does.

101
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,665
And that's because they didn't stop

102
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,989
at the upgraded twin turbo V6

103
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,069
that now makes over 530 horsepower.

104
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,189
They also went to town

105
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,829
stripping out every bit
of weight they could find.

106
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,509
It's got a titanium exhaust,
polycarbonate windows,

107
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,869
and inside there's
aluminium and carbon fibre

108
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,029
as far as the eye can see.

109
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,669
They've even taken the
rear seats out of the back.

110
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:53,548
It's proper geeky Chris Harris stuff.

111
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:01,388
The point is, this four-door
saloon is now quite simply

112
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,868
the most extreme Alfa road car in decades.

113
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:10,988
Whoa, there we go, we've got it back!

114
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:12,088
Get on that.

115
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,908
It really does feel special, this.

116
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:20,088
The steering, the brakes.

117
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,188
You just think it, it does it!

118
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:26,848
And all that aside, just look at it.

119
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,268
It's the Giulia but beefed up.

120
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,748
It takes your breath away this car!

121
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:41,407
Oh, Paddy.

122
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,427
Wow, I'm clapping the
car, not the driving.

123
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:50,427
Ooh, I don't mind.

124
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,107
Think I've got a bit of car envy there.

125
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,707
I'm seriously thinking
of proposing to this car,

126
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,587
I love it!

127
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:57,983
I'll tell you, it's
crass, it's in your face,

128
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:00,187
but it's brilliant, look at it!

129
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:03,307
It's absolutely amazing.

130
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:05,707
155 grand, how much?

131
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:06,707
155 grand?

132
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:07,547
Yeah.

133
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,067
Maybe I've not got car envy.

134
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:09,907
Go on.

135
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:10,747
155 grand?

136
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:11,947
- Yeah.
- For an Alfa?

137
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:12,947
What's yours?

138
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,387
150.

139
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:15,747
Not much difference.

140
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,227
The Atson's cheaper than the Alfa.

141
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,947
Well, you've gotta remember,
Fred, these are rare cars.

142
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,987
You turn up to a track day in these,

143
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,663
people come out of the woodwork,
they wanna talk to you.

144
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,782
Yeah, but you know what,
Paddy, you don't want them to.

145
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,346
They come out of the woodwork.

146
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:32,026
It'll be tyre compound,
it's about the springs.

147
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:33,706
Mate, you don't wanna talk to them.

148
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,306
Just wanna drive it, enjoy it.

149
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:38,306
Speaking of tire compounds,
where is Chris Harris?

150
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:40,746
Skidding around somewhere,
you know how he's like.

151
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:45,846
Now that is completely,
and utterly correct.

152
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:50,426
Have some of that!

153
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:55,106
Come on!

154
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:59,946
Oh, look, put simply, for the money,

155
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:03,546
you can't beat a Porsche
911 GT3 as a track special.

156
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:07,426
If you wanna better it, you've
gotta go up a price bracket,

157
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,066
or two, or three.

158
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,705
Meet the reassuringly expensive,

159
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:22,565
reassuringly outrageous, McLaren 765LT.

160
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,945
With over 750 horsepower,

161
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:30,265
and a top speed north
of 200 miles an hour,

162
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,625
this isn't just one of
the very fastest cars

163
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:37,325
McLaren has ever made, it's
also one of the most intense.

164
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,345
This isn't some friendly,

165
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:47,145
let me help you with
that skid, sir super car.

166
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:50,205
This thing is spiky, you
really are on your own.

167
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:53,865
But that just adds to the sense of...

168
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,244
Whoa ho ho, excitement!

169
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,064
What a monster.

170
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,384
Track day specials are not
meant to be relaxing and kind.

171
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,264
They're supposed to keep
you right on your toes,

172
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:13,384
and this thing, boy, does it do that.

173
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:20,104
And that's because the 765LT sees

174
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,544
all of McLaren's racing pedigree

175
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:26,424
distilled into one very potent cocktail.

176
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:30,144
Apart from the uprated ceramic
brakes, titanium exhaust,

177
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:33,624
active rear wing and
acres of carbon fibre,

178
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:37,064
the 765 is now lighter and more powerful

179
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:40,544
than the already lightning-quick
720S it's based on.

180
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:43,419
And what this all adds up to,

181
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,343
is a car that is shockingly first.

182
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:53,203
Too fast for the road?

183
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:55,743
I'd say so.

184
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,063
To really get close to
what it's capable of,

185
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,363
you've got to be on a circuit.

186
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:03,779
And you'd better bring your A-game,

187
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:08,803
and probably a spare pair of boxer shorts.

188
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,063
Good lord!

189
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,063
Oh.

190
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,703
Yes, boys.

191
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,583
Don't tell him, that was pretty good.

192
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,503
All right, lads, now
this is my kind of day.

193
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:31,222
Proper geeky track day
specials, look at that!

194
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:33,862
It's a bit of you, innit, this.

195
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:34,702
Ahh.

196
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:35,542
How much?

197
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:39,502
280 grand, because
to beat a GT3 Porsche,

198
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,102
you've gotta spend 280 grand.

199
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,062
Yeah, but with you

200
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,302
there's always a few extras, isn't there?

201
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:45,862
400.

202
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:49,142
400 thousand pounds?

203
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,698
So, more than a few extras,
that, 400 grand?

204
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:51,462
400?

205
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,862
It looks like a
400-thousand-pound car, look at it.

206
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:55,822
For 400 grand you
could buy both of these

207
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,922
and still have enough over
to get some decent T-shirts.

208
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,502
Right, 400 thousand pounds.

209
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,582
Let's see what that'll buy you.

210
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,382
Time for a drag race.

211
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:06,542
A drag race?

212
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,462
Totally irrelevant.

213
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,622
I know, but bit of fun innit?

214
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,722
Bit of fun!

215
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:21,181
So gentlemen, basic
drag race, and Chris,

216
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,821
if by the time and Fred get up there,

217
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:23,741
you have not pulled up,

218
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,101
got out and had a cup of
tea, there's something wrong.

219
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:29,961
This will do 0-120 miles
an hour in seven seconds.

220
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,741
Come on, Harris, let's
see what you've got.

221
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,601
Three, two, one, go!

222
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:53,901
Oh, he's off!

223
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,161
Ohh, that McLaren is gone!

224
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,220
Come on, the Aston.

225
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,300
I can't even see them!

226
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,780
Oh, coming back on the Aston!

227
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Come on.

228
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,620
Here we go.

229
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Look at the McLaren.

230
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,480
160, 170,180, dearie me,
the speed is outrageous.

231
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,100
Pretty much 200 over the line, wow!

232
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,820
First loser, baby!

233
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Jeez!

234
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,540
In surprise order then,

235
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,140
the Alfa had beaten the
Aston to second place.

236
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,780
Magnifico!

237
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,219
Do you know what, Pad?

238
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,339
I can't even be unhappy for you.

239
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,979
Harris's McLaren
had smashed the both of us.

240
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,139
Sometimes straight-line speed is boring,

241
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,499
but not when it's that fast.

242
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:01,579
And the producers
had decided a drag race

243
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,919
was not the best way to test
our three track specialists.

244
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,479
Challenge, Pad.

245
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,099
Can we just confirm who won?

246
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,935
Yeah, but it was obvious
that was gonna happen.

247
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:12,699
Shall I read this?

248
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,939
Can we just say as well, he
won by about three seconds,

249
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,375
but if you put that into pounds and pence,

250
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,699
so he's paid 245 thousand
pounds more than my car

251
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,379
and it gave him three seconds back.

252
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,699
Value for money, that.

253
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,579
Here we go.

254
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,939
Since the best track special

255
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,379
should make you feel like
a hero around the circuit,

256
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:32,059
you will now find out what
yours can do, at a track day.

257
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,498
Yes, very nice.

258
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:34,658
That is more like it.

259
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,138
None of this drag race nonsense.

260
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:37,894
Well, he's got an
advantage on the track,

261
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,678
'cause everyone will be behind him going,

262
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,578
oh, it's the safety car, let's go slow.

263
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:42,818
So he can hold everyone back

264
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:46,178
while me and you have a good
razz around, Christopher.

265
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:48,598
Well, yes and no,

266
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:55,698
because it turned out the
track day we'd been sent to,

267
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,758
was the Formula 1 British Grand Prix.

268
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,858
Every year, Silverstone circuit plays host

269
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,778
to the fastest cars on the planet,

270
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:09,298
all racing for glory

271
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:12,238
in front of hundreds of thousands of fans.

272
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:18,018
The jewel in the crown of the
British Motorsport calendar.

273
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,877
As track days go, this is a big one.

274
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:27,937
F1 weekend at Silverstone boys.

275
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:30,697
This is serious stuff.

276
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,257
I feel like we've signed
up for a game of five aside

277
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:37,157
and somehow ended up in an
FA Cup final at Wembley.

278
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,533
How excited are you, Chris?

279
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:40,577
You love the F1.

280
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:43,297
Any driver that can handle
one of those machines,

281
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:46,657
surrounded by 20 similar
nutcases is a hero in my book.

282
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:49,037
They're all heroes, even
the ones at the back.

283
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,257
The question was though,

284
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,757
what on earth were we even doing there.

285
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:09,256
Oh lads, we're only
rolling onto the track!

286
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:11,012
Are you sure we should
be on here, Paddy?

287
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,416
I'm not, Fred, I'm really not.

288
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,836
I feel like I'm trespassing.

289
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:21,076
There's a crowd on for our track day.

290
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:29,956
Formula 1 drivers, three of them.

291
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:36,256
So, because our track specials
were all made by companies

292
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,896
that also happen to run F1 teams,

293
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:42,416
we'd been told we'd be
taking on their drivers

294
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:45,016
in a relay race.

295
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,876
From Aston Martin, Sebastian Vettel.

296
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:53,275
From Alfa Romeo, Antonio Giovinazzi.

297
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:57,915
And from McLaren, Lando Norris.

298
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,335
Three of the finest racing
drivers in the world,

299
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,435
against us lot.

300
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,855
Ahh.

301
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:11,555
Wow.

302
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:13,695
Lads.

303
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,815
Gents, thank you so much for taking time

304
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:20,455
out of your busy weekend
to presumably humiliate us.

305
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:21,295
No worries.

306
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:22,851
Are you looking forward
to driving these cars?

307
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,935
Yes, of course, if you warm them up.

308
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,015
Very, very simple, lads.

309
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,455
It's a relay race.

310
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:31,095
Sebastian, you'll start
us off in the Aston.

311
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,655
One lap of the track,
you'll come back in here,

312
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,415
and you'll touch the bonnet of the Alfa.

313
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:37,414
This is the important part.

314
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,894
Don't get run over.

315
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,694
Antonio, you'll then set
off, you'll do your lap,

316
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,574
you'll come back in,

317
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,934
come over to your
McLaren touch the bonnet.

318
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,814
Lando, you will then setoff my friend,

319
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,374
do your lap come in here,

320
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:52,134
and that's when we stop
the clock, simple enough?

321
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:52,974
Think so.

322
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,294
Right lads, you're gonna
lay down the benchmark,

323
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:59,614
and us three are gonna see
how close we can get to you.

324
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,814
All right, Sebastian,
get yourself in Cocker.

325
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,414
I've gotta start. All right.

326
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:05,574
Here we go, come on.

327
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,034
Have you seen how thin they are?

328
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:07,814
- Very thin.
- Yeah.

329
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:08,654
Seen how thin they...

330
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,454
Seen how thin they are?

331
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:11,554
Very thin.

332
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,714
I think this old men have no chance.

333
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:25,013
Sebastian, are you ready?

334
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,113
I'm ready.

335
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:29,593
Three, two, one, go!

336
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,373
Oh, he's off, he's off.

337
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,093
Good start.

338
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:39,773
Oh my word.

339
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:40,693
Follow that line.

340
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,213
Have you been round here before?

341
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:43,053
Never, have you?

342
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,253
Never.

343
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:51,473
Get yourself ready, Antonio.

344
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:54,453
Lando, what would you
go round in an F1 car?

345
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:56,253
1.26.

346
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,053
Oh dear God.

347
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,133
Oh Jesus Christ.

348
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:03,453
Here we go, Cobbs Corner,
my favourite round here.

349
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:07,813
God, he's not messing about is he?

350
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,012
We won't be going round
quite as quick as that.

351
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:11,212
He's not messing about.

352
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,492
Now is the best section ever.

353
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:19,592
Maggots Becketts, and Chapel.

354
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,732
High-speed corners.

355
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:23,652
What G do you pull?

356
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:25,252
Er five.

357
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:26,452
Five, five Gs?

358
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,552
Five and a half?

359
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,332
Here he comes.

360
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:32,512
Don't forget, he's gotta tap the bonnet.

361
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:35,408
Oh, it's the change over.

362
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:36,568
This is where we get our time back.

363
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,012
That's not the bonnet!

364
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,212
That's not the bonnet!

365
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,212
10 seconds!

366
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,312
He thought it was rear-engined.

367
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,132
Whoa.

368
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:58,491
Look at the Alpha.

369
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,291
How beautiful is that?

370
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:00,251
Good car, ain't it?

371
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,091
Go on, Lando.

372
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:01,931
Get yourself ready, Lando.

373
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:04,031
Go on, son.

374
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,951
Those tyres are suitably warmed up now.

375
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,311
It's a good lap.

376
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:14,611
Here he comes.

377
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:15,411
Here he comes.

378
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,731
Ohh!

379
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,127
It's all about the change over.

380
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,291
It's all about the
baton, all about the baton.

381
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:24,391
He's done it again!

382
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,331
Oh my word.

383
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:28,611
He's gone.

384
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:32,631
Oh my god, I've never
driven this car before.

385
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:36,591
It's quicker than I thought.

386
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:41,710
How was that, pal?

387
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,410
How was it?

388
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,510
It's hard, but...

389
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,250
It's hard, huh?

390
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,450
- Yeah.
- It's heavy?

391
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,850
You drive like this.

392
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,950
Oh what a beast.

393
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,970
That does look quick.

394
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,070
'Cause he is quick.

395
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,730
Oh, he's using it all.

396
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,890
Right over there.

397
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,990
Holy moley.

398
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,850
Oh, here he comes.

399
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,950
Let's cheer him on.

400
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,630
Whoa, whoa, bloody hell!

401
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,210
Ohh!

402
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,529
See how fast that was going?

403
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,789
Ohh, that looked lively.

404
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:40,649
What's he doing?

405
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,049
Oh, you see.

406
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:44,149
I've gotta drive that.

407
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,269
Ah.

408
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,509
Ah, well done.

409
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:00,889
Easy.

410
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:03,129
Lando, what is it with
young lads and donuts?

411
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,449
You can't resist, can you?

412
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:06,549
No man, I couldn't.

413
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:08,089
Ok, got the times lads.

414
00:22:08,189 --> 00:22:08,949
Come on then, what have you got?

415
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,249
What have we got?

416
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:15,408
Team F1, your combined time was 7.31.62.

417
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,708
To be honest, for three
laps that's not too bad, yeah.

418
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,128
- Not so bad.
- Yeah.

419
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,724
Obviously we are not going to beat that.

420
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:21,608
We are two middle-aged men

421
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,188
from Lancashire and one from Bristol.

422
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:24,088
Yeah exactly.

423
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:24,928
How we doing that?

424
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:26,924
We are gonna need five
or 10 seconds or something.

425
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:27,948
What will you give us?

426
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:29,928
What are we going to give them?

427
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,028
10 seconds each?

428
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:32,728
How much older are they?

429
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:34,248
A lot, a lot, a lot.

430
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:35,248
A lot, and fatter.

431
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:36,968
30 seconds is embarrassing.

432
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:38,608
Shut it, we'll take it.

433
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,448
We wanted 40.

434
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:40,548
31.

435
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:45,408
Let's see what they think, 31?

436
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:47,488
Yeah, there you go.

437
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:48,968
31, that's a good one.

438
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,164
Right, we know what we've gotta do.

439
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:51,288
Fred, you're up first, son.

440
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:53,208
Go on, knock them dead, knock them dead.

441
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,308
I'm nervous.

442
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:04,207
Just to be clear in a sport
where every hundredth counts,

443
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:08,307
a 31-second handicap
is a shamefully long time.

444
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,407
But while eight minutes and two seconds,

445
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:13,647
was now the target to beat,

446
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:17,327
with two of our team having
never driven the track before,

447
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:19,607
there was also the very real question

448
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:21,707
of whether we'd even finish.

449
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,827
Okay, Freddy, are you ready, son?

450
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,487
I think so, Pad.

451
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:32,247
All right, do
it for the middle-aged men.

452
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:34,367
Here we go.

453
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,467
Three, two, one, go.

454
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,827
First corner's and right-hander,
it's a right-hander.

455
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:46,442
I've no idea where I'm going.

456
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,246
The next corner's a left-hander.

457
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:49,606
I'm gonna get in already.

458
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,706
After the right, there's a left.

459
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,346
Come on keep going.

460
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:57,426
I'm only up against Sebastian Vettel.

461
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,526
I think he's doing really well.

462
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,366
Do you?

463
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:07,086
Yeah.

464
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:08,406
Come on!

465
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,846
Get on, get on, get on.

466
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,946
Get some speed up.

467
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:19,686
All of a sudden, the
suit feels a lot tighter,

468
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:21,786
and the car feels a lot heavier.

469
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,226
Get round.

470
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,405
Come on, Fred.

471
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:31,505
Come on, Fred.

472
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:33,445
Brake, brake, brake.

473
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:37,985
Oh, he's not going in the
back of me, that's alright.

474
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:44,805
What's the going on?

475
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:45,645
Go! Go!

476
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:47,445
The breaks!

477
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:50,645
Oh my god, He can't
get the handbrake off.

478
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,745
What's going on?

479
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:55,285
Ho, ho, ho!

480
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:57,385
What's going on?

481
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:10,845
- He is a clown.
- Absolute muppet, that lad.

482
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,965
What was going on
with that parking brake?

483
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:20,524
Oh, that nearly caught me out.

484
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:22,624
Come on Chris.

485
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:27,464
140, I'm in the wrong gear.

486
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:30,984
Oh god, oh, come on Alfa.

487
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,604
Right let's get flat out here.

488
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:36,704
Get some time back, for god's sake.

489
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:43,504
Harris needs to be absolutely mustard now.

490
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:45,684
Come on, Pad.

491
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:47,784
Where is he now?

492
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:51,044
Chris will be good.

493
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:56,144
Oh my god.

494
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:02,963
Oi, oi, oi.

495
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:03,923
It wouldn't go!

496
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:05,799
Not the parking brake, I'm
like, what's going on?

497
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:06,523
Handbrake, handbrake.

498
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:07,383
You just embarrassed yourself

499
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:08,263
in front of three world-class drivers.

500
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:10,423
Sorry about that, lads.

501
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,603
McGuinness's
issues on the start line

502
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,403
had cost a whole heap of time.

503
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:20,883
I couldn't believe that.

504
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:22,123
Really high-pitched voice.

505
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:23,443
It wouldn't go mate.

506
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:24,603
Why won't it go?

507
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:26,583
I took my foot off the
brakes, it wouldn't go.

508
00:26:29,263 --> 00:26:30,843
Antonio stitched me up!

509
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:37,163
It was now all on Harris
to wring everything he could

510
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,263
out of his McLaren to
keep us in the running.

511
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,639
I think he's made up for
some of your lost I'm here.

512
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:46,443
Yeah, thank God.

513
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:48,722
Right, here he comes.

514
00:26:48,822 --> 00:26:50,822
Get back everyone.

515
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:55,762
Fast uh?

516
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:56,602
Yeah.

517
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,702
That was close to you.

518
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:03,402
We'd all made it round,
which was a result in itself.

519
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,362
Go on, Chrissie Harris.

520
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:13,082
But that did of
course leave the small matter

521
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:15,162
of our time.

522
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:17,362
Oh, come on, Pad, here we go.

523
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:18,322
Here we go.

524
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:19,802
- Come on, Pad.
- Right now.

525
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:20,762
Yeah.

526
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:24,082
So lads, you did it in 7.31.62.

527
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:27,542
You give us 31, that takes you to 8.02.62.

528
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:31,302
We did it in 8.24.34, ahh!

529
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:36,761
Miles off!

530
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:37,661
I feel as though that 10 seconds,

531
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,157
I were trying to get the handbrake off.

532
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,881
10, that was like at least 30 seconds.

533
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,821
But what a pleasure to
be beat by these guys.

534
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,521
Yeah, thanks so much.

535
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,501
- Cheers, boys.
- Thank you very much.

536
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,921
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much, lads.

537
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,881
I was dying for you there, Pad, dying.

538
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:09,801
I was until I thought,
if that had been me,

539
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,521
McGuinness would have just
dined out on it forever.

540
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:18,091
I still think
Antonio stiffed me.

541
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,560
Oh, we got hammered, boys.

542
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,120
We did, but what a day, come on.

543
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,920
Unbelievable.

544
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,760
F1 weekend.

545
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,000
We got to drive F1
weekend at Silverstone.

546
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,516
People would give their
right hand for that.

547
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,280
It was an amazing day.

548
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,200
It was a treat.

549
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,560
It was spectacular.

550
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,200
Although I was packed into
that suit, I've gotta say.

551
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
No one noticed, Pad.

552
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,120
Now, we might have lost to the F1 guys,

553
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,400
but I've been drilling into the data.

554
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,680
- Ooh.
- Really?

555
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,480
You know I love a bit of data.

556
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,760
You know what caught my eye?

557
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,600
Go on.

558
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,360
The two lap times of the McLaren.

559
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,920
Lando Norris, F1 ace,
future world champion,

560
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,600
against our very own Chrissie Harris,

561
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,520
sturdy lad from Bristol,

562
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
oh look at that.

563
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,159
Who wants to know how
close the lap times were?

564
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,519
Yeah.

565
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:08,639
Yeah.

566
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:09,439
Yes.

567
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,279
- Not sure Chris does.
- No.

568
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:15,519
But Lando's lap, two minutes 17 seconds.

569
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:16,619
Wow.

570
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:17,839
Ohh.

571
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:22,699
Now, Chris' lap,
two minutes 18 seconds.

572
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,199
He only beat him by one second.

573
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,799
Wow, one second, one second.

574
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,319
Pound for pound you're faster.

575
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,199
Wow.

576
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,319
Adjusted for weight, it's panto season.

577
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,359
He's milking it.

578
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:42,719
Let's hear it for fat lads everywhere.

579
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:43,639
Never hear end of it.

580
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:45,199
Let's hear it for fat lads.

581
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,119
Never hear end of it.

582
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,155
Adjusted for weight, I'm
claiming that as a draw.

583
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,918
Oh, I say one second, that
my friend is proper impressive.

584
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:55,078
Which baffles me why he
doesn't win many challenges.

585
00:29:58,418 --> 00:29:59,838
Handbrake.

586
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:02,238
Yeah, yeah, bit of a
technical, I'm gutted.

587
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,078
Really?

588
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,278
But it's not as though
it was at Silverstone

589
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:08,798
in front of three F1 drivers
and thousands of people,

590
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:09,638
so it was all right.

591
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:10,738
I got away with that one.

592
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:12,558
We should finally put the Diablo to bed.

593
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:15,358
Yes, every cloud has a-

594
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,198
- That is a burn!

595
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:18,674
See the one thing I will give you tough,

596
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:20,478
Pad, is your choice of car.

597
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,638
The Aston, it's all right.

598
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,478
Yeah.

599
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:25,758
But the Alfa, I love
it, absolutely love it.

600
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:26,598
This is what I mean.

601
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:28,034
You're saying the Aston it's kind of...

602
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,678
It's all right, you're
dismissing it because of this.

603
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:32,718
Come on, don't forget
this, it's a monster.

604
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:34,798
That is unbelievably fast.

605
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:35,638
A weapon.

606
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:36,798
Absolute weapon.

607
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:38,037
Right, it's time to move on

608
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,877
to something a little bit more personal.

609
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:42,157
They say never meet your heroes.

610
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,197
Well I did and it was one of
the best things I've ever done.

611
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:47,297
Take a look at this.

612
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:58,337
It's an Evel
Knievel rally, far out. Wow!

613
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:07,797
Now, back in the
day when I was a little lad,

614
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:10,237
this was the toy to have.

615
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:13,037
The Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle.

616
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,797
And I know it doesn't look much now,

617
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:18,357
but this could turn any
living room or any pavement

618
00:31:18,457 --> 00:31:20,597
into your very own stunt show.

619
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:27,836
Evel Knievel, was the world's

620
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:30,476
most famous motorcycle daredevil.

621
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:41,596
Known for his huge death-defying jumps,

622
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,596
every time he got on a bike,

623
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:45,916
he would either break a new world record,

624
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:49,016
or break himself trying.

625
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:56,876
But the truth was growing
up here in Bolton,

626
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,676
Evel Knievel wasn't really real.

627
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:00,996
He wasn't on British TV.

628
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:02,396
There was no YouTube.

629
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:03,756
And he lived in America,

630
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:07,276
which to me and my mates was
a completely different world.

631
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,236
What we needed in this country

632
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:12,115
was a true blue daredevil superstar

633
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:14,215
that we could call our own.

634
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:16,315
Here comes Eddie Kidd.

635
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:19,355
He's done it, incredible!

636
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,315
Daredevil champion of the world,

637
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:22,875
Britain's Eddie Kidd!

638
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,355
How are you doing?

639
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:25,195
Good mate, how are you?

640
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:27,755
I'm good, my name is Stephen Flaherty.

641
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:29,395
I'm from London.

642
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:31,495
And I grew up with Eddie Kidd.

643
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:36,475
I'm Christine Morris, Eddie's sister.

644
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:40,155
I'm Marjorie Kidd and
I'm Eddie Kidd's mum

645
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,975
for the last 61 years.

646
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:50,375
He always had a little bike,
he used to cycle everywhere.

647
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:56,234
He was always sort of climbing
and running and jumping.

648
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,950
We used to go to the cinema quite a lot,

649
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:59,394
used to go late night cinema.

650
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,814
We went to see a film on Evel Knievel.

651
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:04,674
And that was it,

652
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,874
they were absolutely hooked on it.

653
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:10,234
That's just something
that we both wanted to be.

654
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,334
We just both wanted to be Evel Knievel.

655
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:17,474
So this young lad, Eddie Kidd,

656
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:20,034
he's riding around North London on his BMX

657
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,474
with all his mates,

658
00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:24,514
doing jumps and pretending
to be a daredevil.

659
00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:27,754
And then one day, he gets on a motorcycle.

660
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:31,154
And then everything changes.

661
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:35,594
He was never frightened, Eddie.

662
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:40,214
He never, ever showed fear at all, never.

663
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:45,873
We used to go to a place in
East London called Eton Manor,

664
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:47,233
we used to practice there.

665
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,913
We'd had a couple of guys
come from the Royal Artillery,

666
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:51,473
the manager at the time,
the owner,

667
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,753
he had some T-shirts made up

668
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,073
of somebody jumping a bus long ways.

669
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:59,113
Us being kids we always
said no no one can do that,

670
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:01,313
only Evel Knievel, he's the only one.

671
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:03,593
The guy that was doing it at the time,

672
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:06,193
he came up short a couple of times.

673
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:09,493
So, Eddie was sitting
there on his little bike.

674
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,593
And he said, "I'll do that."

675
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:14,693
Oh, shut up, don't be silly.

676
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,033
But he kept saying, can I do it?

677
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:18,873
Can I do it?

678
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,213
And he said yeah, go on then,

679
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:22,573
as a joke.

680
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:28,672
And Eddie did it.

681
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:33,072
He'd done it. It was amazing,
we couldn't believe it.

682
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:33,912
And from then,

683
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:36,172
he became the star of
the show from then on.

684
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:39,892
Eddie was unleashed.

685
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,792
In 1975, still just 16 years old,

686
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:50,452
he jumped 13 double decker
buses, a new world record.

687
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:58,732
Three years later, he cleared 14 buses.

688
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:06,752
Eddie was quickly proving himself

689
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:11,852
to be one of the most skilful
riders ever to wield a bike.

690
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,551
He just had hand-to-eye
coordination that was phenomenal.

691
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:19,311
He could have been a top
golfer, tennis player,

692
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,031
anything else he'd set his mind to.

693
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:26,831
So here, we have this super talented lad

694
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:30,431
doing things on a bike the
world had never seen before.

695
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,951
But that wasn't the end
of the story for Eddie,

696
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:35,591
this was a bloke, who had it all.

697
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:45,071
He was a pinup of such proportions.

698
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:47,431
I mean, he was over
all the girls' bedrooms

699
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,791
and he was on every magazine.

700
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,891
He was as big as the pop stars.

701
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:56,191
If I say hordes of girls,
I'm not exaggerating.

702
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,591
Everywhere you went it was,

703
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:58,987
"Eddie Kidd, Eddie Kidd, Eddie Kidd."

704
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:00,051
- Eddie Kidd.
- Eddie Kidd.

705
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,090
Eddie Kidd.

706
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,910
His rise was meteoric.

707
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,710
I don't really think I'm sexy.

708
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,810
Oh, come on.

709
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,350
Eddie became the face,

710
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,030
or rather the rear, of Levi jeans.

711
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,830
Vivienne Westwood designed
his bike leathers.

712
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,950
And of course, those looks
and a talent like none other,

713
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,310
meant Hollywood wanted
a piece of the Kidd too.

714
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,430
Double for James Bond,
Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas.

715
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,410
Doubled for Richard Gere in
"First Knight" on the horse.

716
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,630
Eddie even starred
in 1981's "Riding High",

717
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,190
where naturally, his first
full silver screen debut

718
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,470
called for another incredible stunt.

719
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:53,549
From motorcycle stuntman,
to model, to actor,

720
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:54,989
and I dare say it,

721
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,369
even had a go at the
singing as well.

722
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:02,349
Throughout the eighties
and early nineties,

723
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:04,029
Eddie was everywhere.

724
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,189
He had the looks,

725
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:09,109
he had the style, and me and
all my mates wanted to be him.

726
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:14,209
And then in 1993, he did a
stunt that blew us all away.

727
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:26,949
I think to be a motorcycle
jumper, you have to be brave.

728
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,189
You have to be confident.

729
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,048
The drop off the side was hundreds of feet.

730
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,588
By Eddie's standards,

731
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:39,548
the Great Wall wasn't
an especially long jump,

732
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:43,608
but it was insanely dangerous.

733
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,228
You're setting yourself off

734
00:37:46,328 --> 00:37:48,068
knowing that this could be

735
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:51,108
the last time you're
gonna be able to walk,

736
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,268
and breathe, and run.

737
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,528
Off he goes down the ramp.

738
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:06,668
He takes off, disappears from my view.

739
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:11,768
I can't see him.

740
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:17,907
Yeah?

741
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,827
Yeah, yeah.

742
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:20,667
You alright?

743
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,347
All right, yeah.

744
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:27,427
To have that straight bottle to do that,

745
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:30,627
to get on the bike and kill that stunt,

746
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,667
and nail it, is a phenomenal talent

747
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,927
that you don't come across very often.

748
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:42,647
It was impressive to a guy like me.

749
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:46,587
'Cause I never did it.

750
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:48,987
But when you walk into a brand new jump

751
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:50,667
and there's this much room for error,

752
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,387
which is none, it's like be real spot on,

753
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:56,267
or you're in trouble.

754
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,367
And he did it spot-on.

755
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:03,746
For years, Eddie had
tried to lure his old rival,

756
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:06,466
Evel Knievel into a jump-off,

757
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:08,266
but he didn't take that bait.

758
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:11,546
And by '93, he'd long since retired.

759
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:16,386
But Evel's son Robbie was
now also a daredevil rider.

760
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:19,286
In fact, he was even better than his dad.

761
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:26,426
I was like, this is
only worthy challenger

762
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:29,786
that I've seen that looks like me,

763
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:33,426
focused on that jump that
I wanna jump against.

764
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:34,346
I was like, what?

765
00:39:34,446 --> 00:39:36,326
You're gonna have a Knievel
versus Kidd at last?

766
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:38,406
This thing is a dream come true.

767
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:42,606
They called it the Daredevil Duel.

768
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:46,706
Robbie in the trademark
Knievel white suit,

769
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:49,145
versus Eddie all in black.

770
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:56,205
What I remember is
just total competition.

771
00:39:57,085 --> 00:40:01,605
Ladies and
gentlemen, Robbie Knievel.

772
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:07,385
I thought I was the best,
and he thought he was the best.

773
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:09,965
From London,
England, Eddie Kidd!

774
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:16,465
Each rider had three jumps.

775
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,425
Furthest combined distance,

776
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:23,525
would be crowned daredevil
champion of the world.

777
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:28,505
It's the craziest thing every time,

778
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:30,725
because you're risking your life.

779
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:37,084
He's got it lined up.

780
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:43,324
My first jump was small, like 192 feet.

781
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:48,584
I believe
Eddie Kidd is ready to go.

782
00:40:53,604 --> 00:40:56,504
Then Eddie comes out and does 214.

783
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,064
Eddie Kidd is letting it rip,

784
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,224
nearing 90 miles an hour.

785
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:05,624
214 ft.

786
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:06,464
Yeah!

787
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,564
I'm like oh, man, I'm in trouble.

788
00:41:10,524 --> 00:41:14,784
My next jump, I just said this is
it, I'm going to risk it all.

789
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,464
I watched that thing with bated breath.

790
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:20,264
Because these were world record,

791
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,423
everyone was a world record jump.

792
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,343
That's Robbie airborne.

793
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:25,743
This was a big one.

794
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:27,463
Oh it's a huge jump!

795
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:29,223
I was like, yeah.

796
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,423
That could well be the
biggest jump of the night.

797
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:37,283
That whole jump competition
went on the last jump.

798
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:39,979
Knievel had done his three jumps.

799
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:42,003
Eddie was doing this last jump.

800
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:48,483
The biggest
jump of Eddie Kidd's career.

801
00:41:58,363 --> 00:42:00,503
He needs 210 feet.

802
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,903
Kidd is coming, and he's
off the launch ramp.

803
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:04,403
Eddie comes right back like that,

804
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:06,443
and you think no, no, no, no, no.

805
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:19,682
Bang, somehow he brings it back.

806
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:26,702
- Yes!
- 215 feet for Eddie Kidd.

807
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:29,942
That was a massive
achievement for Eddie.

808
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,482
The son of Evel Knievel and he beats him.

809
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:37,682
When I saw him grab that belt,

810
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:42,002
I go, he deserves it.

811
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,218
At last he's gotten that recognition,

812
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:50,762
where he surpassed the Knievel legend.

813
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:56,001
The best jumper for sure that
I ever seen in my life.

814
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:14,121
I never worried about Eddie.

815
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,461
Why?

816
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,561
Why did I not worry about it?

817
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:23,521
Because he had so much
confidence in himself.

818
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:28,901
Eddie never had any bad accidents.

819
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:31,181
Never broke a bone in his body.

820
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:32,501
He was almost...

821
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,901
Teflon Eddie, he just bounced back.

822
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:37,001
He was indestructible.

823
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,260
Three years after the Daredevil Duel,

824
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,780
Eddie was back in Britain performing here,

825
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,260
at a motorcycle festival
called The Bulldog Bash.

826
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,820
Now the jump was pretty standard

827
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,460
for someone as skilled as Eddie.

828
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,420
50 odd feet over the drag strip.

829
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,260
But the landing,

830
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,140
that was going to be a
little bit more tricky.

831
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,980
He got there and I said,

832
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,780
you're jumping into a hill,

833
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,280
and there's no way you can do that.

834
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,580
All my ears of experience
following Motocross

835
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,220
and being involved in it,
you will injure yourself.

836
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,060
When you have a landing ramp,

837
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,940
you come down,

838
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,220
the landing ramp brings you
down nice and slowly to gravity.

839
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,120
You know, it's a smooth transition down.

840
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,180
You cannot land uphill.

841
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,899
I did really try and talk him out of it,

842
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,879
but he said he'd committed
himself and he was gonna do it.

843
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,815
He lands and he's
straight into an uphill,

844
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,219
so bike does that, literally, bang,

845
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,319
and his head hit the petrol tank.

846
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,619
His body went limp.

847
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,259
Straight away you could see,

848
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,859
that he was knocked unconscious,

849
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:49,659
didn't make any attempt
to put any breaks on.

850
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:51,335
You think he's got control of the bike

851
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,059
even though he's unconscious,

852
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,339
'cause he seems to slow
as he goes to the top.

853
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,859
And you're thinking, he's got
it, he's got it, he's got it.

854
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,375
And then almost in slow
motion, if you watch it back,

855
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:01,599
almost in slow motion,
he drops of the edge.

856
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:07,279
And that's when I knew, it
wasn't a simple accident.

857
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:12,618
When I managed to get around there,

858
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:14,298
he was at the bottom of this bank

859
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:17,378
laid there with two Hell's
Angels close to him,

860
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:19,478
and they were calling the ambulance.

861
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:24,838
I thought he was dead.

862
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:33,478
We got a phone call saying
that Eddie was in the hospital.

863
00:45:36,158 --> 00:45:39,438
When we got there, he was in a coma.

864
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:42,558
They told us that he was in a coma.

865
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:48,758
I couldn't believe it, that
he'd had this accident.

866
00:45:52,678 --> 00:45:55,438
I remember going in
and the doctor saying,

867
00:45:58,197 --> 00:46:00,457
the next 72 hours or whatever it was,

868
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,557
dunno know what it was.

869
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:04,977
Well, I thought, and then I walked out.

870
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:07,077
In fact it's making me emotional now.

871
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,117
Because I thought they were
telling me he was gonna die.

872
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:20,517
Eddie survived, but it
was a close-run thing.

873
00:46:21,437 --> 00:46:23,857
He spent three months in a coma.

874
00:46:23,957 --> 00:46:25,777
And when he finally awoke,

875
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:28,777
he was left with
life-changing brain injuries.

876
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:33,777
That was 25 years ago
but here's the thing.

877
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:35,697
When I set out to make this film,

878
00:46:35,797 --> 00:46:39,057
I didn't just wanna tell you
the story of my childhood hero,

879
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,217
I wanted to meet him.

880
00:46:41,317 --> 00:46:44,456
To pay my respects to
a great British legend,

881
00:46:44,556 --> 00:46:47,396
and show him just what a trail he blazed.

882
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:56,996
Eddie now lives on the south coast.

883
00:46:57,876 --> 00:47:00,216
He has a carer, Glenn.

884
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:01,076
Hello, pal, how are you?

885
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:01,896
Hey, Pally how are ya?

886
00:47:01,996 --> 00:47:02,736
Good to see you.

887
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,096
Glad to see ya.

888
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:08,136
And they were good enough
to let me stop by for a chat.

889
00:47:08,236 --> 00:47:11,836
The governor, the absolute governor.

890
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:16,536
Eddie, pleased to meet you, sir.

891
00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:18,176
Pleased to meet you.

892
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:20,536
I know he said "Paddy".

893
00:47:20,636 --> 00:47:25,636
Eddie I cannot
believe I'm here with you.

894
00:47:29,355 --> 00:47:32,495
My mates will be so jealous.

895
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:35,615
Honestly, when I was a
kid, I had your posters

896
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:36,895
up in my bedroom,

897
00:47:36,995 --> 00:47:39,375
until my mum took them
for her own bedroom.

898
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:41,695
But I don't wanna talk
about that on camera.

899
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:43,895
But it's an absolute thrill.

900
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:46,935
I'm so glad you've let me
come and see you down here.

901
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:50,015
Would you mind if I just get
rid of my nervous energy,

902
00:47:50,115 --> 00:47:51,211
and just have a little bit of a look

903
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,815
at some of your items around?

904
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:54,015
Go, go, go.

905
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:54,815
Go, go, go.

906
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,775
Right, I'm on it, I'm on it.

907
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,975
I've gotta come over here first.

908
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:02,375
Oh, wow, these the Vivienne Westwood ones?

909
00:48:02,475 --> 00:48:03,575
Some weight on them.

910
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:06,135
Look at the weight!

911
00:48:06,235 --> 00:48:07,235
Am I okay-

912
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:09,371
I was gonna say, am I okay
to touch your helmet, Eddie?

913
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:11,395
So that's-

914
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,574
- Look on the back.

915
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:16,674
The back?

916
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:18,754
It ain't easy being this good.

917
00:48:22,594 --> 00:48:24,594
- Can you spell it?
- Fear no Evel.

918
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:27,874
Look at that.

919
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:32,614
So this is the actual bike then?

920
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:35,174
Look at the tank, Paddy.

921
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:36,774
That's from the crash.

922
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:38,854
Oh, this here.

923
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:42,374
I mean, this is for me a real surprise

924
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:44,734
at seeing the damage caused.

925
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:46,834
Because it's just as quick as that.

926
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:50,834
So this bike you nicknamed Sid.

927
00:48:51,994 --> 00:48:54,294
Because they say it was so vicious.

928
00:48:54,394 --> 00:48:56,394
Yeah.

929
00:48:56,754 --> 00:48:59,474
That is mad.

930
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:05,273
So this is the Great
Wall of China jump, oh.

931
00:49:10,153 --> 00:49:14,313
It was the hardest jump he's done.

932
00:49:16,113 --> 00:49:20,573
And the mayor, he was down
the bottom speaking to people.

933
00:49:20,673 --> 00:49:21,373
He missed it.

934
00:49:21,473 --> 00:49:23,333
He asked Eddie to do it again.

935
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:25,333
No way.

936
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:26,493
I don't think-

937
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:30,253
- I don't think so.

938
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:35,653
So, I noticed Sid out
in the hall there, Eddie.

939
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:37,573
Who else drove that bike apart from you?

940
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:38,693
Was anyone-

941
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:41,113
- What's he done, what's he done?

942
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:41,893
What have I done?

943
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:42,693
What?

944
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:44,173
Ride, ride!

945
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,692
Oh no, no!

946
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:47,532
He drove a bike!

947
00:49:47,632 --> 00:49:48,892
No, how have I done it?

948
00:49:48,992 --> 00:49:50,932
How have I done that
in front of the gaffer?

949
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:52,132
That is the worst thing

950
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:55,312
you can ever say, ever.

951
00:49:56,472 --> 00:49:59,092
I've upset myself. I've
upset my family name.

952
00:49:59,192 --> 00:50:02,252
I won't be allowed back up
in Bolton after this, Eddie.

953
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:03,692
Oh, god, you want to be doing-

954
00:50:06,812 --> 00:50:09,372
Pack it in, Eddie!

955
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:19,932
Now, it's probably just as well for me,

956
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:22,512
the story doesn't end there.

957
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:27,432
Because it was time to show
Eddie that trail he blazed.

958
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:33,791
And that meant taking a little drive.

959
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:37,091
The Black Knights ride again!

960
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,151
What a way to travel, lads.

961
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,491
Check this boys out now, Eddie.

962
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:03,511
Go on boys!

963
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:08,151
Yeah, all for you, Eddie!

964
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:21,470
Yes, wow.

965
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,870
That little trike at the back.

966
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,270
Wow, wow.

967
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:18,669
I've got a little surprise
for you up here, Eddie.

968
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:36,889
Eddie, while you get yourself acquainted

969
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,329
with your friends and family,

970
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:40,485
I'm gonna get out 'cause I've
got a bit of something special

971
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:42,509
lined up for you, pal.

972
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:45,229
Here we go.

973
00:52:54,988 --> 00:52:57,088
You all right, Eddie?

974
00:52:57,188 --> 00:53:00,088
Paddy Kidd at your service.

975
00:53:00,188 --> 00:53:03,288
And this is a bit of something
I've done just for you, pal.

976
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:26,028
Come on, Paddy!

977
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:31,688
Just for you, that, pal.

978
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:36,068
Oh, what are you laughing at?

979
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,967
It took me a month to practice that.

980
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:42,327
Let me get this off, here.

981
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:46,727
Where is the fire?

982
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:54,607
Well, listen, that
was just the appetiser.

983
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:56,607
Now it's time for the main course.

984
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:58,707
Hit it!

985
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:09,107
Yes, for Britain's best, we
brought together the best.

986
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:11,527
This is for you, Eddie.

987
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:13,567
Some of this great nation's

988
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,487
most talented performers on wheels.

989
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,047
This is for you, Eddie.

990
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:21,327
Everyone dedicating their lives

991
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:26,426
to pure daredevil showmanship.

992
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:28,846
This is for you.

993
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:35,666
Oh, oh, here we go!

994
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,585
Here he is.

995
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:40,325
Oh.

996
00:56:12,344 --> 00:56:15,824
Oh, bloody hell, I were
convinced he were off then!

997
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:27,224
Oh, yeah! Oh, here we go!

998
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:02,463
Eddie was the pioneer.

999
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:05,883
He paved the way and
inspired a generation of kids

1000
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:07,983
that are doing it now.

1001
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:12,963
He was the king of jumps.

1002
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:14,403
He would push it to the extreme,

1003
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:16,983
every time he would get on his motorcycle.

1004
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,483
The fact that he started
doing this when he was just 14,

1005
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,763
and jumping over buses in just a helmet,

1006
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:28,362
and a leather jacket, is insane.

1007
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:30,962
It takes that one person to do it

1008
00:57:31,062 --> 00:57:33,902
and then everyone else thinks,
oh yeah, we could do that.

1009
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:37,922
Everything that he did was
gnarly and without Eddie,

1010
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:40,262
I, you know, God knows where we'd be.

1011
00:57:41,822 --> 00:57:45,002
You pioneered for all of
us to have a fantastic career

1012
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:46,722
in this industry.

1013
00:57:46,822 --> 00:57:49,842
Thanks, Eddie.

1014
00:57:49,942 --> 00:57:51,942
Keep smiling, buddy.

1015
00:58:25,741 --> 00:58:29,061
Don't make him cry, he'll make me cry.

1016
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:34,921
Bloody hell, we're all at it.

1017
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:39,261
I think it were the petrol fumes.

1018
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:49,681
That was a special film.

1019
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:50,481
For sure.

1020
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,241
What are hero he is.

1021
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:53,397
And what a privilege to meet,

1022
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:56,481
the man is an absolute legend.

1023
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:57,761
- Yep.
- Fair play, Paddy,

1024
00:58:57,861 --> 00:58:59,240
that was different class.

1025
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,480
Proper tribute to a proper British hero.

1026
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,716
- Well played.
- Correct, correct.

1027
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,040
One of the all-time greats.

1028
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,476
Look how many people wanted to come out

1029
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,280
and say thank you to Eddie.

1030
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,560
He was an inspiration to so many people.

1031
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,880
He definitely was and
God bless you, Eddie.

1032
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,800
That's it for tonight.

1033
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,600
We'll be back next week, when
we fast forward to the future

1034
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,840
with some brand new,
state-of-the-art electric cars.

1035
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,280
And some tiny caravans.

1036
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,400
Very tiny, very small.
Perfect for you, Chris.

1037
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,500
Harsh.

1038
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,380
Thanks so much for watching, goodnight.
