1
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:32,173
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:36,652
Hello, welcome to Top Gear, where we
have some sad news,

3
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,852
because tonight is the last show of
the series, everyone.

4
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:41,682
Oh, no.

5
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,492
But we also have some good news,

6
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,572
because tonight we are on a public
service mission.

7
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,562
We're going to be fighting injustice

8
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:52,202
and tackling one of the biggest
disgraces in modern motoring.

9
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:55,092
And that's the sheer expense of
being a new driver.

10
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:58,382
What young people have to fork out
nowadays just to be on the road,

11
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,662
it's a disgrace, Pad. Scandalous.

12
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,732
You see, according to recent
research,

13
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,582
new drivers have to shell out on
average close to £5,000

14
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:10,092
on their first car, plus another
1,900 quid on insurance.

15
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,882
That's nearly seven grand straight
off the bat, Fred.

16
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:15,652
And for your seven grand, you'll
probably get something like this.

17
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,762
A Corsa with a few miles on the
clock. Yeah. Now, it's fine...

18
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,732
It's a bit Vauxhall Corsa, innit?

19
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,892
It is very Vauxhall Corsa, it is.

20
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:25,452
But don't worry, though, because for
that sort of money,

21
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,762
there are some far better options
out there,

22
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,533
as we shall now demonstrate.

23
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:38,092
Cars for new drivers?

24
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,313
Head to Plymouth, they said,

25
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:44,253
recently declared the UK's top city
for young adults.

26
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:56,303
All right, on this particular
Friday,

27
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:59,692
it was also the UK's windiest city.

28
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:04,122
But no matter because the big news
is that with a seven grand budget

29
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:09,294
for car and insurance, you can have
something a bit special.

30
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:14,663
Ah.

31
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,842
The MGB GT.

32
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:23,812
Oh, yes, I have gone classic and
what a classic this is!

33
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,923
£5,000 to buy.

34
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:29,212
And if I was a young 17-year-old
Paddy from Bolton,

35
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:32,023
it'd be 1,300 quid to insure.

36
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:39,183
All in all, that's £6,300 for a
great British sports car

37
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:42,044
that's dripping with 60's style.

38
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,662
And with a 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine,

39
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:49,973
plus rear-wheel drive, it is genius.

40
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,102
I mean, there was even
enough left over

41
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,133
to give it a trendy lick of paint.

42
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,202
And while I'm giving you the
McGuinness money saving tips,

43
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:04,482
this car is over 40 years old,

44
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:08,812
which means it's officially classed
as a historic vehicle,

45
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:13,662
which means it's exempt from road
tax and MOT.

46
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:16,252
Oh, I'm like a sexy Martin Lewis.

47
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:19,092
Oh!

48
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,213
The love bug.

49
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:32,292
Oh, whoa! I nearly lost me door.

50
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:36,212
I picked the wrong day to roll me
sleeves up.

51
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:39,053
It's not a day for hair neither, is
it?

52
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,982
See, this is where I've top trumped
you today.

53
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,812
This is one that bodes in your
favour.

54
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,902
Love it! Go on, give us the numbers.

55
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:47,742
It's obviously a Beetle. Yeah.

56
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,642
It cost me five grand...

57
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:54,053
and a 17-year-old Fred from
Preston - 870 quid to insure.

58
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:56,612
But there's more. Don't start.
There's more, there's more

59
00:03:56,613 --> 00:04:01,173
Cos it's over 40 years
old... no tax, no MOT.

60
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,202
Yeah, I've already told them that.
Huh?

61
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:07,212
That's cheaper than most of these
modern city cars.

62
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:11,492
Oh, yes, for just 5,800 odd quid,

63
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:15,852
you could get the original Urkel
four-cylinder icon,

64
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:19,403
whose timeless looks just get better
with age.

65
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:24,822
It's an absolute beauty! I love it
in white as well.

66
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:26,572
People from our era - Herbie.

67
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,184
Oh, what? What's this?

68
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,842
Has he left an SUV in the wash?

69
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:36,692
Oh, I don't know, Paddy. I think
he's done it again.

70
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,292
That's a Lada.

71
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:39,483
Lads...

72
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,402
I'm excited!

73
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:47,173
The Lada Niva, the Soviet
four-by-four legend.

74
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:48,482
Look at it!

75
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,402
I like it, when you're smiling. Only
a five and a half grand to buy.

76
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:52,682
What?! OK?

77
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:55,852
Under a grand to insure for the
17-year-old me.

78
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,972
Why would you want a Corsa, when you
can have this?

79
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,102
Look at it!

80
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,202
Forget the Land Rover Defender.

81
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:04,972
This pint-sized hero of the off-road
world

82
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:09,612
has been in production longer than
any other four-by-four,

83
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:14,572
and for just six and a half grand
all in, it is a total...

84
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,122
bargain.

85
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,572
Oh, I want to hammer you.

86
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:21,053
But, no, I love it. I love it.

87
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:25,102
I think this is the first time we're
all kind of like...

88
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:27,212
happy with these three motors.

89
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,923
Oh, one more thing. Go on. Yeah.

90
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:31,462
Because it's 40 years old... Yeah.

91
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:34,332
don't need an MOT, don't have to
pay for tax. Yeah.

92
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,682
He said that, I have told...

93
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,212
Three times, they've heard that.

94
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,212
It's a good money saving tip. Oh.

95
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:43,482
Now, most importantly, that looks
like a factory colour,

96
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:44,923
a factory off-white. Yep.

97
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,063
I can imagine that in... in period.

98
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,262
Is that a factory colour? What
colour is that?

99
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:52,933
Oh, this is like, you know, like the
fancy Audi and the Porsche colours?

100
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:55,642
Yeah. I think they call it potty
grey.

101
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:59,173
What colour was it originally? Well,
it was British Racing Green.

102
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:03,063
What, so you painted over BRG for
that?! Please, please, please.

103
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:05,282
Classic. What colour's that?

104
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,362
Berocca wee?

105
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:10,102
If I were doing it for you, I'd do
it burgundy red

106
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,092
but we're appealing to the youth.

107
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,902
Look, we could've argued about the
colour all day.

108
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:18,923
The point is, when it comes to
choosing your first car,

109
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:23,373
this little trio makes for one hell
of a menu to pick from.

110
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:27,212
Oh, I do love the Beetle.

111
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,183
Just driving it for the first time,

112
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:31,722
it's everything I thought it would
be.

113
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,732
It's lovely.

114
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:37,622
I'll make no secret of the fact that
I've always wanted a Niva.

115
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:38,852
Always.

116
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:40,183
It's joyous.

117
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:42,982
It was actually known as the poor
man's Aston Martin, this,

118
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,202
when it came out.

119
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,642
No-one's calling the Corsa a poor
man's Aston Martin.

120
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:50,572
Have you got an MG in the
collection, Chris?

121
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,362
I don't, but looking at yours,
there's something about the shape,

122
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,532
that sort of hatchback shape that I
love.

123
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,132
What about the Beetle, Chris? Have
you got a Beetle?

124
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:01,292
No, I don't have a Beetle. You were
either a Mini man or a Beetle man,

125
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,332
when I was young, and I was a Mini
man.

126
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,623
You still are.

127
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,063
Now, we might've been happy with our
motors

128
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,342
but the producers weren't convinced,

129
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:17,492
so to prove their first car
credentials,

130
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:21,412
we'd be taking them on a tour
through Devon and Cornwall...

131
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:25,702
starting... with Dartmoor.

132
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,934
What do you see a lot of on
Dartmoor?

133
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:33,012
Is it, um... Oh, what
are they called?

134
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:34,492
Um... Panthers.

135
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:36,173
Did you say panthers, Paddy?

136
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:37,572
Panthers?

137
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,982
Yeah, there's one roaming around
here, ain't there?

138
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:43,183
Is it not... Did I not read summat,
the Beast of Dartmoor or summat?

139
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:45,573
It's the Beast of Bodmin, you big
berk.

140
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:54,372
So, you've just passed your driving
test and you're buzzing,

141
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,722
what do you get?

142
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:58,372
Well, you want something speedy...

143
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:00,542
something sporty...

144
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:03,423
something to really show off to
your mates.

145
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:08,662
Sadly, you can't afford to get
insured on anything like that,

146
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,184
unless you go old.

147
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:18,012
The MGB was launched in 1962

148
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:22,012
and soon became one of Britain's
favourite sports cars.

149
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:25,902
Half a million, they built and it's
easy to see why.

150
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,902
So, for your first taste of
driving...

151
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:31,213
honestly, why wouldn't you?

152
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:36,342
It's light, it's nimble, it's
rear-wheel drive.

153
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,063
It ticks all the boxes.

154
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,502
And this car actually forces you to
drive.

155
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:43,292
I mean, look. Look at that.

156
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:45,982
You've got to wind the window down
on this thing.

157
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,612
You've got to drive it.

158
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:50,732
If the head gasket goes, you've got
to change it.

159
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,382
It's a learning curve, this car.

160
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,372
One of me neighbours used to have a
Beetle as a kid.

161
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:04,722
Liz Smith lived across the road with
her six kids,

162
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,352
running around with one of these.

163
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:08,012
I remember being in it one day.

164
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,372
It was a real novelty. It was
lovely.

165
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,582
The one thing which I learnt

166
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,572
other Beetle drivers, they all wave
at each other.

167
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:17,982
You'll be driving down the road,
they either pomp,

168
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,702
flash of the lights or a wave.

169
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:21,333
You're part of something.

170
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:28,422
The Beetle was built for over 60
years

171
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,383
in every corner of the world.

172
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:36,982
And if you want to talk numbers,
they made 20 million of them.

173
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:42,092
Every single one offering that same
affordable, economical,

174
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,743
cheap to run recipe.

175
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:50,012
So if you buy one of these, you're
not just buying your first car,

176
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:52,382
you're buying a piece of history.

177
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,522
And the thing that makes these
perfect for new drivers is

178
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:57,063
they're really slow.

179
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,092
Peaceful, you just slow down.

180
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,883
Where's the downside?

181
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,892
Well, probably the windscreen wipers
at this point and...

182
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,653
and a windscreen that I've just
got to keep wiping.

183
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,092
But I'm smiling.

184
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:13,733
I'm really am smiling.

185
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,732
Maybe.

186
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,622
But not as much as I was.

187
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:24,143
What a cool, cool vehicle.

188
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,453
I have so clearly got the coolest
car of the three.

189
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:33,782
This is... my 17-year-old dream.

190
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,892
The Lada Niva is the exception to
the rule

191
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,982
that all Soviet era cars were
terrible.

192
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:48,442
Designed as a workhorse for the
villagers

193
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:50,492
and farmers of rural Russia,

194
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:55,622
it was built to operate in some of
the toughest conditions on the planet.

195
00:10:55,623 --> 00:11:00,663
And as a result, it has endured like
almost no other car in history.

196
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:09,022
Nivas have been everywhere - North
Pole, South Pole, Everest Base Camp.

197
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,022
They are indestructible.

198
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:14,652
It's simple, it's practical, it's
tough.

199
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,613
I love it. I absolutely love it.
It's a hero car of mine.

200
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:26,813
But before we get too carried away
with the whole

201
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,132
old car for new driver pitch,

202
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,423
there are a couple of things you
need to know.

203
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,612
First - insurance.

204
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,782
Now, we've all rang round insurance
companies,

205
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,252
trying to get the best quotes.

206
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,532
You can ring one day, it'll be a
decent quote,

207
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,502
ring back the next day, it will
totally change.

208
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,712
And the other thing is it all
depends on where you live, too.

209
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:51,022
So if you live in London, you're
paying a premium,

210
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:52,612
which you should be used to.

211
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,382
You pay a premium on your houses,

212
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:57,462
you pay premiums on drinks, food,
everything down south.

213
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,022
But if you go with the classic car,

214
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:01,372
there's some really competitive
quotes out there.

215
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,252
Now... I say competitive,

216
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:09,012
providing you're not going for
something fast, expensive or rare...

217
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,662
you should be OK.

218
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,242
So basically, what we're saying is

219
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:16,862
buy something slow, cheap and
readily available

220
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:19,073
and move yourself to Preston.

221
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:23,023
You will save yourself a packet on
car insurance.

222
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,902
And then, there's the whole
40-year-old car thing.

223
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:31,612
Just because it doesn't need an
MOT and you don't have to tax it,

224
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,712
you still need to keep it
roadworthy.

225
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,152
No bald tyres.

226
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,622
Look after it.

227
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,732
And remember, it's an old thing.

228
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:42,012
Take some pride, cherish it.

229
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:44,823
One note of caution, though - just
before you go out and buy...

230
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:46,152
Oh, hello.

231
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:48,622
I'm free-wheeling here. Me engine's
cut out.

232
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:50,573
Unbelievable.

233
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,743
Come on!

234
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:57,453
Just having a couple of technicals
with the Beetle.

235
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,453
Go on, Fred. Go on, Beetle.

236
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,792
It's gone.

237
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:04,954
Oh, you... No, he's died. He's died.

238
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,262
Now, I know what you're thinking.

239
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:13,012
And, no, you don't want your first
car breaking down on you...

240
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:17,462
Of all the days. I don't need to be
pushing this car around Cornwall.

241
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,742
but this isn't a breakdown.

242
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,782
This is just a VW Beetle, giving its
new owner some exercise.

243
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:27,422
Urgh!

244
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,383
After all, these cars are over 40.

245
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,612
Oh, hang on. She's gone a bit back.

246
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,074
Everyone over 40's the same.

247
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:40,222
We're back on!

248
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,263
I think it just needed a rest, the
old girl.

249
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:47,143
We all need a rest at 40 odd, don't
we?

250
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,022
Go on, the Beetle. We're moving
again.

251
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,302
Good work, boys!

252
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:57,462
Now, for some reason, the producers
could yet see the brilliance

253
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,944
of our old car, new driver theory.

254
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,382
Oh, oh, oh!

255
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,452
Oh, God.

256
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:06,502
And in a shameless bid to disprove
it further,

257
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:10,173
they soon told us to pull off the
road for a test.

258
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,663
What the hell's this place?

259
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,662
Quarry.

260
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:23,102
Yours will be a home here, Chris,
won't it?

261
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,893
This is Niva country.

262
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:28,782
It's like you've got a cloaking
device around here, Paddy.

263
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,823
Look at you.

264
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,582
Oh, lads.

265
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,673
I spy... a Corsa.

266
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:38,944
Hang on, it's being driven by The
Stig.

267
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:42,694
What's he doing?

268
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:45,103
Who knows with him?

269
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:48,972
He's out of the car.

270
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,022
He's out of the car. He's walking
off.

271
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,332
Someone approaching my window in
high vis.

272
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,342
Thank you very much, Boss. No
problem.

273
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:57,392
Unsurprisingly, it's a challenge.

274
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,742
Having spent so much on their first
car,

275
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,862
the next challenge facing new
drivers

276
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:05,182
is getting as far as they can on
what little fuel they can afford.

277
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:09,672
On £1 of petrol, The Stig has just
driven a Vauxhall Corsa flat out

278
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:11,112
until it ran out.

279
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:15,022
He managed 11 laps in 6 minutes and
14 seconds.

280
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:17,252
You will now have the same amount of
fuel

281
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:21,452
to see how far your cars can go in
the same time.

282
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,332
Oh.

283
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,972
How many laps did he do?

284
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:26,312
11.

285
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,903
I'd take three at this point.

286
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,542
To see which of our classics was
best suited

287
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:35,612
to a new driver's frugal lifestyle,

288
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,943
with our tanks drained and filled
back up

289
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:40,542
with just one quid's worth of fuel,

290
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,833
we would now take turns seeing how
far we could go

291
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:47,462
within the 6 minutes 14 seconds set
by The Stig

292
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:50,333
in the UK's most popular first car.

293
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,772
Do you know what? Actually, this
challenge is right up my street,

294
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:59,052
cos when we were all younger in
Bolton and we got our first cars,

295
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,622
that's what we put in it,
£1 of juice

296
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,943
and it kind of ran for a while.

297
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:07,672
I remember me brother, his first car
was a Fiesta Mk2

298
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,943
just under 1.0-litre engine,

299
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:12,052
and he used to put £2 in it at a
time.

300
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,473
It used to go forever.

301
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:16,833
Oh, yes.

302
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:21,582
It was time to summon up all those
penny-pinching years of experience,

303
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,973
as Flintoff and his Beetle lined up
first.

304
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,412
Here we go, Fred.

305
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,834
Three, two, one, go.

306
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,252
Come on.

307
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,102
I should open the window, I'm
steaming up.

308
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,693
Windscreen wipers on.

309
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:40,412
I've got to say that this don't
really feel right.

310
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:44,622
Chris, I'm not sure if he's got his
foot down in that or not.

311
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:46,342
I can't find the gears.

312
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:48,622
Get round.

313
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:52,982
Now, look, we all know speed is not
the Beetle's forte.

314
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:55,182
Have you got your foot down there,
Fred?

315
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:56,592
What's the tactic?

316
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:58,663
Every foot on floor there, lads.

317
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:05,022
No-one was expecting it to beat the
Corsa.

318
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,943
Wrestling it around.

319
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,752
He is crawling round.

320
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,132
I can't see!

321
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:16,392
And while it did somehow manage to
put in ten valiant laps...

322
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:18,472
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

323
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,102
She's dying.

324
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:23,262
in the end, it didn't disappoint.

325
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,954
It's starting to go, boys.

326
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,983
I've gone.

327
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:42,252
Look at Fred, straight out in
puddle. No messing.

328
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:44,182
I've got wet feet, now.

329
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,353
Look at him! He's out of his mind.

330
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,713
As Flintoff got stuck into his
second workout of the day,

331
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:56,978
amazingly, his Beetle had lost out
to the Corsa by just one lap.

332
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,497
But our classics were still in with
a shot

333
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:06,177
because next to have a crack was
the expert car journalist

334
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:08,128
and his legendary Niva.

335
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:11,327
He's going to have a theory,
isn't he?

336
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:13,377
He's going to have a theory,
this lad.

337
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:16,467
He'll have worked out the times,
the cornering.

338
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,587
Don't hold me on the line,
McGuinness.

339
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,108
Here we go.

340
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:26,617
Three... two... Come on!

341
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:27,908
one, go.

342
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:34,177
Now, it turns out Harris did
have a theory.

343
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:36,377
So, nice and slowly.

344
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:38,177
Strong start, Fred.

345
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:42,747
The only problem was it
was totally wrong.

346
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,828
You're going to run out of time,
Chris.

347
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,487
There's a time limit on it as well.

348
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:47,657
Come on!

349
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:53,307
You've already done over 1 minute
20 seconds and you've done one lap.

350
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:57,938
It's not hard - to get anywhere near
the Corsa's 11 laps in the time,

351
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,578
you'd have to drive fast.

352
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,977
Third gear. Can I get into
fourth?

353
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:05,818
Do something, man! Just do
something.

354
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,578
Christopher, that was your fifth
lap.

355
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:13,387
Fifth lap and you have 2 minutes 50
seconds left.

356
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:15,107
This is top fun.

357
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:18,777
But with Harris still
none the wiser... Yes.

358
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:21,547
eventually his time ran out.

359
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,107
Three, two, one and stop.

360
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:28,699
It's still going. It's still going.
It's a little fuel miser.

361
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,027
Chris, the time is up.

362
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,417
Listen.

363
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,217
He's still going.

364
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,777
What's he doing?

365
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,698
This is embarrassing.

366
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,457
And she's just died, boys.

367
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,858
After an amazing victory,
the Niva dies.

368
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:49,498
Did you not understand the
challenge, Chris?

369
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:55,897
Harris had failed his Lada with just
eight laps in the time.

370
00:19:55,898 --> 00:20:00,317
So, last to have a crack at the
Corsa's 11 lap benchmark

371
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,218
was the mighty MG.

372
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:05,698
Are you ready to go, Patrick?

373
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:07,337
Yes.

374
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:10,468
Three, two, one, go.

375
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,458
Go on, MGB.

376
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:24,257
He's taking this very seriously,
isn't he?

377
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:25,498
Yeah.

378
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,579
Woohoo!

379
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,497
Stirling Moss set a land speed
record in an MG.

380
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,897
Granted, it weren't around a quarry

381
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:40,347
with a quid's worth of petrol in it,
but...

382
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:43,408
it's got racing DNA in its blood,
this thing.

383
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:47,627
Under three minutes now, Pad.
Keep going.

384
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,387
Under three minutes.

385
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:52,177
Right, come on, MG. Let's go.

386
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:53,938
That was almost oversteer.

387
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,058
Come on!

388
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:05,657
Under a minute. Go on, see if you
can eke it out.

389
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,257
Oh, it's got a bit jittery.

390
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:08,497
This is ridiculous.

391
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:11,298
The old MG's going to prove to be
more efficient than the Corsa.

392
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:14,578
Under 30 seconds.

393
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,257
Still going!

394
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:19,287
Go on. I hope you're watching this,
kids.

395
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:20,747
Keep going!

396
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,467
Ten, nine, eight... Keep going!

397
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:24,747
seven, six, five... Go on!

398
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:26,467
four, three... Go on!

399
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,907
two, one.

400
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:33,067
Oh, just gone at the end, boys!

401
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,188
Oh!

402
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:37,397
That were a lot of fun.

403
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:39,427
It looked so much better, when you
were having a go.

404
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,657
Right, here we go, Pad.

405
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:43,578
Stig did 11 laps and you were about
to complete your 12th,

406
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:44,828
so you beat him.

407
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,177
Fantastic!

408
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:51,867
Not just a victory for the MGB, but
a victory for the classics, lads.

409
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:56,787
And with the winner rightly treated
to a bit of help off the field,

410
00:21:56,788 --> 00:22:00,017
fuelled up and point well and truly
proven,

411
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:05,337
we got back to enjoying the drive in
our old school heroes.

412
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:09,057
Lads, so if you go back
over 40 years,

413
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,818
that takes us to 1981.

414
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:14,347
40 years ago, lads!

415
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:16,347
My daughter's nearly 17.

416
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:19,107
I can't imagine that I'm going to be
teaching her to drive.

417
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:21,347
I'm not sure I'm the man
for that job.

418
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:23,857
My kids don't listen, when I tell
them about cricket.

419
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:26,067
I've got no chance with driving.

420
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:29,068
Well, they're not on their own
there, Fred, let's be honest.

421
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:37,588
Look at the way we behaved,
when we're 17.

422
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,417
Everyone was out to go fast.

423
00:22:39,418 --> 00:22:41,747
If I start saying, "You can't do
that",

424
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:44,137
I'm just being a hypocrite cos
that's what I did.

425
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:46,057
I think that's quite a good
selling point

426
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:47,828
for all three of these cars,
isn't it?

427
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:50,627
You know, the kids can't go fast in
them.

428
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:53,467
But despite the compelling weight of
this argument,

429
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:56,297
the producers were apparently still
not convinced

430
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:58,788
by the genius of our first car
classics.

431
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:04,828
Because we were soon told to make
a stop at an abandoned RAF base

432
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:08,058
with an unlikely
history... of speed.

433
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,267
Back in the early 1950s, Davidstow
Airfield played host..

434
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,787
to Formula 1.

435
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:23,187
As venues go, it was about as far as
you could get

436
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:25,627
from the glamour of Monte Carlo.

437
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:30,297
But nevertheless, the Cornish Grand
Prix ran three times

438
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:33,868
and even saw Lotus in its
first-ever race.

439
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,938
But remarkable as that may be...

440
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:44,188
sadly, it had nothing to do with
our next test.

441
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,727
It's paint, is it, that's
coming at us?

442
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:51,067
Cos I can't cover my head properly.

443
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:52,709
I'm just worried about me hair.

444
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,097
People pay a lot of money
for this hair.

445
00:23:58,098 --> 00:23:59,507
Don't worry about that, lads.

446
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:01,427
I'm worried about me hair.

447
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:03,709
If that doesn't go in the edit,
I'm resigning.

448
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:08,507
So, because speed is the biggest
cause of accidents

449
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:09,987
among new drivers,

450
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:13,547
with our speedos and pretty much
everything else taped over,

451
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:19,098
We would now see who could get
closest to exactly 50mph.

452
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:23,297
Go over and we'd be out of the game,

453
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:26,709
as naturally, a paint bomb would go
off inside the car.

454
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:35,187
So, I'm going to use the logic of
when these cars were new,

455
00:24:35,188 --> 00:24:39,147
0 to 60 in around about 14 seconds
on mine and Fred's.

456
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:43,708
So, if I do the one Mississippi, two
Mississippi till I get to about...

457
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:46,947
ten Mississippi, I reckon that'll
be the cut-off point.

458
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:49,307
That'll be about 40 odd.

459
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:51,017
Right, are we ready?

460
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,547
Yeah, go on, then.

461
00:24:57,658 --> 00:25:01,368
Three, two, one... best of luck.

462
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:05,507
Oh, God, here we go.

463
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:07,228
This is horrendous.

464
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:14,257
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi...

465
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:15,917
Third.

466
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:19,017
Come on, the Beetle.

467
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,947
I'm flat out. Whatever happens,
I'm flat out.

468
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:24,937
six Mississippi, seven
Mississippi...

469
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,907
Oh, God, eight Mississippi.

470
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:29,627
I've got to be up near 30 or 40
here.

471
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,987
McGuinness is taking liberties,
there.

472
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,777
Nine Mississippi.

473
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:37,507
Ten... Oh, I reckon... I reckon...

474
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:39,067
I reckon that's about...

475
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:41,018
I mean, I'm well in front of them
two.

476
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,907
You were nearly getting sprayed,
there, I reckon, Pad.

477
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:52,987
If they tell me I got to 48, then
that's me out.

478
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:58,197
First run down, we crawl back to the
start line for the results

479
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:01,937
and we would have to decide whether
to stick with the speed we'd hit

480
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:06,148
or run again to try and get closer
to the magic 50.

481
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:10,458
Here we go, lads.

482
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:12,507
Ho, ho, ho!

483
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:17,307
Chris in the Lada... 38mph.

484
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,458
Damn!

485
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:22,787
Freddie in the Beetle... 37mph.

486
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,137
37?

487
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:29,708
Mr McGuinnes in
the MGB... 44mph.

488
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,227
Oh, no!

489
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:33,157
I'm sticking, boys!

490
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,347
No!

491
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:37,277
I'm last. I'm going again.

492
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:38,737
Mr Harris?

493
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:41,268
Well, I've got to twist and
I don't want to.

494
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,719
I'll count you off, boys.

495
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:48,227
Come on, then, Chris.

496
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,378
Three, two, one, go!

497
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:55,277
Flintoff.

498
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:57,638
Right, first, that's got
to be about 20.

499
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:01,077
A bit more than I had last time.

500
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,548
Second gear.

501
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:05,898
Oh, Harris has gone for it.

502
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,377
They're moving a bit!

503
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,148
It's a bit bumpy. I've got me foot
on the floor in third.

504
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,628
There.

505
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,588
Not sure I could've gone any faster,
there, Chris.

506
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:24,378
This is ridiculous.

507
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:27,067
What are you thinking, lads?

508
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:30,537
I reckon that was around 45 for me.

509
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:33,537
I don't reckon I can go much quicker
than that without risking it.

510
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:36,708
I think I would've got over 40, Pad,
but I had me foot on the floor.

511
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,218
I need flatter ground.

512
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:41,228
Thank you.

513
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:48,458
Oh, my days!

514
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,297
Mr Flintoff... Yeah.

515
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:53,097
42.

516
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,537
Still under McGuinness's time of 44.

517
00:27:57,538 --> 00:27:59,667
But Mr Harris...

518
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:04,537
maximum speed to hit before the
paint goes off - 50mph.

519
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:09,297
Christopher Harris,
you did it in... 49mph.

520
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:11,267
No!

521
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:12,708
I'm not having that.

522
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:14,898
I'm not having that.
We've got to go, Pad.

523
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:19,537
No.

524
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,948
Oh, no, it's a northern off.

525
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,177
Harris and his Niva had a thrown
down the gauntlet,

526
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:29,317
meaning McGuinness was back at the
table against me

527
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:32,827
and the stakes were getting higher.

528
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:35,947
Paddy, I'm going to back up and give
myself a run up.

529
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,998
Oh, God, here we go.

530
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:42,387
The chips are in the middle, Paddy.

531
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,589
I'm going all in.

532
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,427
I think he's going to the next
county.

533
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,588
It's cos it's uphill.

534
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:59,117
Boys, I'm off. I'm off.

535
00:28:59,118 --> 00:29:00,458
Count me in, Chris.

536
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:03,538
Three, two, one... go!

537
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:07,147
Oh, he's gone!

538
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:10,377
Oh, Flintoff, flying into it.

539
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:11,718
Come on!

540
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,877
49, that is crazy.

541
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,387
Come on.

542
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:18,517
Oh, I'm not doing me Mississippis.
I've lost myself!

543
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:20,867
Come on, come on.

544
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:23,227
Oh, no. Oh, that's feeling fast.

545
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,877
Come on.

546
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:28,108
Come on, the Beetle!

547
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,068
There. Right...

548
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:35,107
Jesus BLEEP!

549
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:37,817
Oh, no!

550
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,428
Paddy's gone, Chris.
Paddy's disqualified.

551
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,678
That is not good.

552
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,718
Eventually, I found me way back to
the start line...

553
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,027
I can't see. Where am I?

554
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:00,227
Oh, God!

555
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,177
I've hit a cone, lads.

556
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,718
and the results we're in.

557
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,828
Thank you.

558
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:10,599
Oh, ho-ho!

559
00:30:12,108 --> 00:30:14,827
I was doing 51.

560
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:19,617
Chris Harris, your time was 49mph.

561
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,257
Here we go.

562
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:25,977
Mr Flintoff in the
Beetle... your time is...

563
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:29,627
49mph.

564
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,977
We've got a twist off, boys.

565
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,339
Oh, no!

566
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:40,107
Oh, yes, it was Beetle versus Niva
for one final showdown.

567
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:41,707
So, what have you got, Harris?

568
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,598
Push them chips in the middle, son.

569
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,947
What have you got?

570
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:48,708
And to make sure the VW could
definitely hit 50,

571
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:52,508
we'd be lining up from the other
end, pointing downhill.

572
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:54,947
This is it, boys.

573
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:56,977
This is for the big one.

574
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:59,107
Go hard or go home.

575
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,437
Here we go.

576
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:03,469
Three, two, one... best of luck!

577
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:08,957
Don't be backing off on it, Chris.
Come on.

578
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,977
Come on, then, Flintoff. Come on,
then, Flintoff.

579
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:14,317
Come on, then, Flintoff.

580
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:16,348
Oh, it's looking quick, lads.

581
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:18,827
50mph coming in, Harris.

582
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:20,737
That's enough for me.

583
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:22,827
Keep going, Fred!

584
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:24,188
Come on.

585
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:26,668
I'm running out of runway.

586
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,148
Whoa, whoa.

587
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:36,057
Come on, Paddy. What's the numbers?

588
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:38,107
Oh!

589
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,877
Ho-ho, boys!

590
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:45,237
Chris Harris... 50mph.

591
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,617
Yes!

592
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,747
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

593
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:50,238
Mr Flintoff...

594
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:53,187
50mph. Whoa!

595
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:55,417
It's a draw, boys.

596
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,867
Does that mean I'm the winner cos
Chris was following me,

597
00:31:57,868 --> 00:31:59,507
trying to keep up with my speed?

598
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:02,318
We can argue the toss about that
after I've had a shower.

599
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:11,557
I was not wrecking the interior of
my car. I was not wrecking it.

600
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:14,267
That paint bomb going off.

601
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,348
I don't mind admitting I was
genuinely nervous.

602
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,057
It took me a week to get it out of
every nook and cranny,

603
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,507
and then, I started on the car.

604
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:23,507
You've only got yourself to blame,
though, Pad,

605
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,317
because myself and Fred, we're more
at one with our vehicles.

606
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:28,677
We tend to be. Yeah. You can't teach
it, it's natural.

607
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:30,397
It's car synergy.

608
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:31,957
There's nothing to boast about.

609
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,817
You literally had two cars that
wouldn't get to 50mph.

610
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:37,517
That is true. All right, Tony Hart,
listen to Morph.

611
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:39,547
Anyway, we'll get back to film
later.

612
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:40,957
Hello.

613
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,617
It's time to move on.

614
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:44,338
Yes, yes, it is.

615
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,348
Tonight, we're celebrating the
brilliance of old cars.

616
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,547
And if you're talking brilliant old
cars,

617
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:53,237
there's one that stands head and
shoulders above the rest.

618
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,428
Take a look at this...

619
00:32:57,428 --> 00:33:01,188
This is the story of the Lamborghini
Miura.

620
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,599
It was introduced to the world in
1966...

621
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:13,197
and it remains one of the most
beautiful,

622
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:15,548
most important cars of them all.

623
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:27,758
This is supercar genesis.

624
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:36,138
Oh, yes.

625
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:38,898
Yes!

626
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:44,758
What did this look and feel like in
the mid '60s?

627
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,627
Before the Miura, there
were fast cars.

628
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:54,107
Before the Miura, of course, there
were beautiful cars,

629
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:57,418
but there was nothing as outrageous
as this.

630
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:02,117
And like all the great inventions,

631
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:05,148
of course, it was born out of a feud.

632
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:14,987
A feud that begins in late '50s Italy,

633
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:19,078
where a businessman by the name of
Ferruccio Lamborghini...

634
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:25,637
has become rather successful in
the world of tractors.

635
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:29,947
Ferruccio is making so much money,
he's bought himself...

636
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,378
a few Ferraris.

637
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,667
Trouble is, they keep breaking down
and costing a bomb to repair.

638
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:40,197
So, he takes one apart and discovers
that his beautiful Ferrari

639
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:43,918
actually uses the same cheap clutch
as his tractors.

640
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:48,998
Ferruccio is not best pleased.

641
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,197
Tracking down the boss, Enzo Ferrari,

642
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:57,917
he says, "You build your beautiful
cars with my tractor parts."

643
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,957
"My cars are the best in the world",
Enzo replies,

644
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:06,028
before adding, "You are just a
tractor driver, a farmer."

645
00:35:08,468 --> 00:35:11,237
Now, Ferruccio doesn't
take this too well.

646
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:14,827
Incensed, he vows to seek
revenge on Enzo

647
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:19,638
by starting his own car company,
Automobili Lamborghini.

648
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:29,077
First out of the factory was the 350 GT.

649
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:32,357
It was very nice, but it was also a bit...

650
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,107
Ferrari.

651
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:36,277
To really stick it to Enzo,

652
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:39,507
Ferruccio and his team of brilliant
young engineers

653
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,947
needed to change the game.

654
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:44,988
They needed a car that would make
the entire world...

655
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,748
stop and stare.

656
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:53,667
And, boy, did they nail it!

657
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:57,738
This... is a
masterpiece of design.

658
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,387
But even more amazingly,

659
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:06,308
it seems no-one can agree on who
actually designed it.

660
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:09,717
There's a big plaque that says it
came from Bertone styling house,

661
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:12,277
but within that styling house, there
were two young designers

662
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:15,597
Gandini and Giugiaro.

663
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:18,867
Gandini claims he was the one
that drew it,

664
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:22,227
but Giugiaro stuck his hand up as
well and said, "I did it."

665
00:36:22,228 --> 00:36:25,537
I mean, imagine not knowing who
painted the Mona Lisa.

666
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:27,428
That's what we're talking about here

667
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:30,358
one of the most beautiful cars ever,
ever drawn.

668
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:35,717
And we still don't quite know
who did it.

669
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:38,188
One thing is certain, though

670
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:41,387
the look of the Miura was
only the beginning

671
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:44,308
of Lamborghinis out-there approach.

672
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:45,717
Take the engine

673
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:49,537
to make sure the car also had the
pace to embarrass Ferrari,

674
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:52,677
it was a 3.9-litre V12.

675
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:55,157
But inspired by the original Mini,

676
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:59,318
that engine shared its casing with
the gearbox to save space

677
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:03,147
and was mounted sideways
behind the driver

678
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:04,998
for better weight distribution.

679
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:12,228
And what an engine it was!

680
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:17,597
Bizzarrini V12 - smaller, lighter

681
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:20,717
and more powerful than anything
Ferrari had at the time.

682
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:23,547
It had 350 horsepower.

683
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:27,997
This later SV car - 385 horsepower.

684
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,747
Big numbers back then

685
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:34,037
and I can see the carburettor and
the throttles moving behind me.

686
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:37,157
Every time I push the pedal, you can
see it moving.

687
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:40,677
It feels like I'm just off the side
of the engine because I am.

688
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:42,797
It's about 16 inches away
from my shoulder.

689
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:47,358
And the noise...

690
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,638
Ho-ho!

691
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:56,077
Top speed - well, in true
Lamborghini fashion,

692
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:58,517
nobody quite knows that either.

693
00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:02,157
But it was at least 170mph...

694
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:05,517
which crucially made the Miura faster

695
00:38:05,518 --> 00:38:09,318
than anything Ferrari was
selling at the time.

696
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:13,877
Wing mirrors were optional in 1966.

697
00:38:13,878 --> 00:38:15,438
Why did you need them?

698
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:18,319
Who was going to overtake you, if
you were driving a Miura?

699
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:25,837
This was the fastest road car
in the world.

700
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,797
There were no questions,
it was the fastest.

701
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:31,189
Or at least...

702
00:38:32,258 --> 00:38:34,877
it was when it worked.

703
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:39,318
Early Miuras were built using steel
less than 1mm thick.

704
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,467
They were fragile, temperamental
cars, and they broke a lot.

705
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:48,438
The headlights were borrowed from a
Fiat and they were rubbish.

706
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:51,107
One owner apparently
confronted Ferruccio,

707
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:53,677
saying his car was lethal
to drive at night,

708
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,357
to which Ferruccio replied,

709
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,678
"What gentleman will want to spend
his nights in the car?"

710
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:03,367
Caddish retorts were all
well and good,

711
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:08,158
but in fact, the headlights were the
least of the Miura's problems.

712
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:15,267
The V12's carburettors
had this habit

713
00:39:15,268 --> 00:39:19,157
of dripping fuel down to the spark plugs,

714
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:23,547
which occasionally resulted in a
massive fire,

715
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:26,108
which kept owners on their toes.

716
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:29,717
As did the handling at very
high speeds,

717
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:33,987
because the fuel tank's in the
front, so when it was low on fuel,

718
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:36,517
the front would... lift.

719
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:40,329
So, yeah, your Miura could become
an aeroplane.

720
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,747
And it was hardly surprising.

721
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:48,957
Lamborghini's engineers hadn't had
test tracks or wind tunnels.

722
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:51,477
It was only once the car got
onto the road

723
00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:55,717
that they could see if their great
experiment had worked.

724
00:39:55,718 --> 00:40:00,827
This was a car born out of
improvisation and passion...

725
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:04,968
bravery, and it would seem quite
a lot of stupidity as well.

726
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:09,907
This interior is completely bonkers.

727
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,318
The speedometer's obscured,

728
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,757
the rev counter's hidden behind the
steering wheel.

729
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:15,917
I can't see any of this stuff.
It's too low.

730
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:19,627
It was just designed to look great,
to make you feel great.

731
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,517
It doesn't matter if it works or not.

732
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:23,958
It just makes you feel special.

733
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:28,557
It was a neat trick.

734
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:33,077
The Miura felt so special that it
quickly became...

735
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:36,357
the ultimate superstar accessory.

736
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:38,087
Miles Davis had one.

737
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:42,449
Frank Sinatra, Twiggy...
Rod Stewart had two.

738
00:40:44,518 --> 00:40:49,747
But for the rest of the world, it
was in 1969's The Italian Job

739
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:53,987
that the Miura truly became an icon.

740
00:41:03,398 --> 00:41:05,517
There's no decade in modern history

741
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:08,797
that's more romanticised
than the 1960s,

742
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:11,328
and this is the supercar of the '60s.

743
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:15,027
You just imagine the way it was
developed, the passion.

744
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:17,837
There's nothing logical or pragmatic
about it at all.

745
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,627
It's just a piece of green
ridiculousness on wheels

746
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:24,078
and I absolutely adore it for that.

747
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:36,997
The Miura proved for the first time
that a car could be admired,

748
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:41,037
not because it was practical or
comfortable or safe,

749
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,987
nor even, like its great rivals
from Ferrari,

750
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:47,398
because it had racing pedigree to
match its pace.

751
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:53,328
Instead, the Miura proved that a car
could be admired

752
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:57,157
simply for being... extraordinary.

753
00:41:57,158 --> 00:42:02,967
Every supercar since - Ferrari F40,
McLaren F1, Pagani Zonda

754
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:06,427
they all owe their existence to
this car.

755
00:42:06,428 --> 00:42:09,707
This is where it all started.

756
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:12,888
This... is the original.

757
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:46,477
Love it, love it.

758
00:42:46,478 --> 00:42:48,318
That is a stunning car. Yeah.

759
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,047
Stunning car.

760
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:53,198
I do love a proper Chris Harris
deep dive.

761
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,837
You really come away feeling like
you've learned something.

762
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:57,407
Yeah, a lot of information, there.

763
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,037
Not a lot of laughs, but a lot
of information.

764
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:02,917
And 1966 - what a year!

765
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,677
Birth of the Miura, England winning
the World Cup

766
00:43:05,678 --> 00:43:07,557
and Doritos were invented.

767
00:43:07,558 --> 00:43:10,127
Doritos? Yes.

768
00:43:10,128 --> 00:43:13,357
'66 - Doritos, '73 - Hula Hoops.

769
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:15,767
75 - Frazzles.

770
00:43:15,768 --> 00:43:18,037
Oh, I've got facts, too.

771
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:20,757
Yeah, and don't even get me started
on biscuits.

772
00:43:20,758 --> 00:43:22,957
I'm moving on before you start
on Quavers.

773
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:26,328
Anyway, it's time to get back to our
West Country road trip,

774
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:27,957
where we were about to find out

775
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:30,117
whether our old cars for
new drivers idea

776
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:32,788
was really the brilliant brainwave
we thought it was.

777
00:43:46,638 --> 00:43:50,078
Bathed as it was in sunshine and
blue skies,

778
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,188
as we arrived the next morning at
the Cornish coast,

779
00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:56,638
the Car Gods were clearly smiling
on our course.

780
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:59,957
Oh, look at the ocean, boys.

781
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,318
The Atlantic, that, I think.

782
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,188
Beautiful.

783
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:07,717
But the producers were still not on
board with our

784
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:11,267
old cars for new drivers concept.

785
00:44:11,268 --> 00:44:13,397
And at Perranporth Airfield,

786
00:44:13,398 --> 00:44:17,048
they said it was time to sort things
out once and for all.

787
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:20,237
Who have got here?

788
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:22,837
Lads, I spy young people.

789
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:24,267
Oh, here we go.

790
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:26,318
Oh, dear.

791
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,047
Yes, to find out what some actual
new drivers made of our cars,

792
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:35,247
we'd each been paired with one to
take on a driving test.

793
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:36,687
Hello!

794
00:44:36,688 --> 00:44:39,198
Hiya, pal, I'm Fred. Hi, how are
you? I'm Sanath.

795
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:40,687
Sanath, nice to meet you, mate.

796
00:44:40,688 --> 00:44:42,917
I'm Charlotte. Hello, Charlotte.
I'm Chris.

797
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:44,397
Hi, nice to meet you.

798
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:45,957
What's your name, pal? Heathcliff.

799
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:48,247
Heathcliff, love it. Great name!

800
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:50,767
Get your seat belt on, son. Where is
the seat belt?

801
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,627
Can you see it? Yeah. That's it.

802
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:54,837
It's not coming over. You got it?

803
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:57,557
Nice and easy, Heathcliff. Nice
and gentle.

804
00:44:57,558 --> 00:44:59,147
Have you got it? I think so, yeah.

805
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:01,517
There you are, son. Get it in that,
there.

806
00:45:01,518 --> 00:45:02,687
Hold on.

807
00:45:02,688 --> 00:45:06,507
Right, so while the young'uns get
familiar with our classics...

808
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:08,607
It just seems to get stuck there.

809
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:11,597
let's have a look at the
irresponsibly designed test

810
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:15,788
we'll be taking with Stig in his
trusty Corsa.

811
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:20,967
Naturally, we kick off with a hill start.

812
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,927
Then, there's a roadblock block,

813
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,198
where you get on the horn to clear
the van out of the way.

814
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:29,157
Up next is a reverse around a
roundabout,

815
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:33,088
before a toll barrier that once
open, of course, means...

816
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:34,718
you can gun it.

817
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:39,757
Then, it's a slalom through a
traffic jam of stationary cars,

818
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:42,397
slamming on the anchors for an
emergency stop,

819
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:44,277
where we would swap drivers.

820
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,037
Standard.

821
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:50,127
The final stint would see our teens
use their phones to sat nav us

822
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:54,428
ten miles down the road to that
first car road trip driving Mecca...

823
00:45:55,998 --> 00:45:57,557
Newquay.

824
00:45:57,558 --> 00:46:00,607
The winner will be whoever reached
the Hedland Hotel

825
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,597
in the fastest time.

826
00:46:02,598 --> 00:46:07,967
But with both team and car needing
to work in perfect harmony...

827
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:12,128
it'd be fair to say, we hadn't got
off to the best of starts.

828
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:16,147
What, are you a fan of cricket?

829
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,958
Yeah. Do you watch IPL?

830
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:19,147
Yeah.

831
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:20,867
What team do you support?

832
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,917
Like, preferably. Chennai Super
Kings.

833
00:46:22,918 --> 00:46:25,078
My guy. Are you Chennai? Yeah, cos
of Tamil, innit.

834
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,147
Tamil in the heart. Are you a big
fan?

835
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:29,557
Yeah, big fan. I played for Chennai
Super Kings.

836
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:32,567
Really? What year?

837
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:34,047
2008.

838
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:37,329
I mean, I was a baby at the time,
so I didn't watch cricket back then.

839
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:41,717
Right.

840
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,318
So, the gear shift, actually, when
you concentrate on it, is lovely.

841
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,157
It's only four gears - one, two,
three, four and an H.

842
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:48,917
So, like the car you drove... Right.

843
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:52,237
back to four. The clutch and the
pedals you'll find really weird...

844
00:46:52,238 --> 00:46:55,158
Yeah... because the throttle is
really far back...

845
00:46:58,128 --> 00:46:59,597
Oh, my God.

846
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:02,227
And the thing about this is it's
only four gears... Yep.

847
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:03,687
so you'll soon get used to it.

848
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:06,068
But they're just very close
together. Yeah.

849
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:08,407
And I tell you now...
When did you pass?

850
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,318
A month and 15 days ago.

851
00:47:13,718 --> 00:47:17,127
I started getting into cricket when
I was like 15 or about 13, 14.

852
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,288
Right, yeah.

853
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:20,797
Yeah.

854
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:22,047
You know what, Fred?

855
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,237
What about the 2005 Ashes?
Have you heard of that?

856
00:47:24,238 --> 00:47:25,517
Not even.

857
00:47:25,518 --> 00:47:27,567
Do you know what, when I get home...
No?

858
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:30,287
The first time England won the Ashes
for 21 years?

859
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:31,727
OK.

860
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:34,837
Has the game moved on that much?

861
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:37,587
Before his young team mate could
answer,

862
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:41,727
mercifully, it was time for the test
to begin,

863
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:45,637
where, lined up for a staggered
start a few minutes apart,

864
00:47:45,638 --> 00:47:48,678
Team Beetle would be up first.

865
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,157
Go on the lights here, Sanath. Are
you ready?

866
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:53,318
Hill start.

867
00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:56,767
Go, go, go.

868
00:47:56,768 --> 00:47:58,717
Get the handbrake down.

869
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:01,237
Whoa, wheel spin. Whoa!

870
00:48:01,238 --> 00:48:02,848
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

871
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:06,127
Nicely done. That's a nice start.

872
00:48:06,128 --> 00:48:07,667
Here we go. Got a left.

873
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:10,157
Get that steering wheel round. It's
heavier than you think.

874
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:11,927
Move him out of the way, sound it.

875
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:14,847
There we go.

876
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,158
Into reverse.

877
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:24,917
I am in reverse. Go on, try it.

878
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:26,727
A bit of gas, a bit of gas.

879
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:28,798
Oh, oh. Stop, stop, stop!

880
00:48:31,768 --> 00:48:33,209
Here we go.

881
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:37,797
Oh, lovely!

882
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:40,877
A 90 left, Heathcliff. That's what
we say in the racing game.

883
00:48:40,878 --> 00:48:43,367
Where's the horn? Right, so, give
him a pip.

884
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:45,877
Get out of the way! Get out of the
way, you bellend!

885
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:48,727
That's a word you use a lot, when
you start driving - bellend.

886
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:50,157
Left hand down. Left hand down.

887
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:51,597
Down, down all the way around.

888
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,367
Keep moving. There you go.

889
00:48:53,368 --> 00:48:55,147
Keep it in there. Keep moving.

890
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:56,877
Perfect.

891
00:48:56,878 --> 00:48:58,198
No stress.

892
00:48:58,199 --> 00:48:59,567
No stress. No stress.

893
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,847
This is going to be fun.

894
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:03,078
OK.

895
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:09,597
OK, we're going. Yes! Argh!

896
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:12,767
Whoa, whoa, now, back off a bit.

897
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:14,037
Second.

898
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:15,727
Brake now, brake now.

899
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:17,397
OK, sound the horn. Sound the horn.

900
00:49:17,398 --> 00:49:19,958
Move! Get him out of the way. First
gear again. First gear again.

901
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:21,287
Well done.

902
00:49:21,288 --> 00:49:22,637
Toll road. I'll lend you £1.

903
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:24,647
Hello, mate. Thank you.

904
00:49:24,648 --> 00:49:27,557
Oh, he's stalled. He's stalled.

905
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:29,517
Get that clutch in.

906
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,367
Here we go. Traffic jam coming up.

907
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:34,078
Here we go. Give it some gas.

908
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,167
You're good, you're good, you're
good. OK.

909
00:49:36,168 --> 00:49:37,577
Get it in second. In second.

910
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:39,357
Now, go that way. That way, reverse?

911
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:42,027
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Argh!

912
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:44,367
Who reverses round a roundabout?

913
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:46,397
Oh!

914
00:49:46,398 --> 00:49:50,088
Look at this! It's just two brothers
out on the road.

915
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:52,208
Here you are. There's a quid.
Get your window down.

916
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:54,437
Wind it down, first. Wind it down.
Oh, I can't get it!

917
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:57,209
Go, go, go. This is old school,
Heathcliff. Give it him.

918
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,297
Oh, my word.

919
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,327
Nice and smooth, Sanath.

920
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:04,678
Blooming heck!

921
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:08,717
See, just... That's my casual
styling, man.

922
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:10,958
Oh, is this your style? You're
all right now, ain't you?

923
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,517
You weren't like this back there.

924
00:50:12,518 --> 00:50:14,487
Two hands, two hands! Two hands,
yeah?

925
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:15,807
Emergency stop.

926
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:17,128
Whoa!

927
00:50:18,748 --> 00:50:19,927
Nice.

928
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:21,167
Well done, mate.

929
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:24,677
So, Team Beetle had reached the end
of the first leg,

930
00:50:24,678 --> 00:50:29,198
and having swapped drivers, were on
their way out of the airfield...

931
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,517
Oh, that's better.

932
00:50:30,518 --> 00:50:35,387
and onto the final ten-mile
navigation dash to Newquay.

933
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:37,088
Here we go. Which way am I going?

934
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:39,807
So, we are going... left.

935
00:50:39,808 --> 00:50:45,447
But Team MG were also now flying
towards the end of the course.

936
00:50:45,448 --> 00:50:50,677
♪ Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home

937
00:50:50,678 --> 00:50:56,298
♪ I'm so cold
Let me in your window

938
00:50:57,928 --> 00:51:01,397
I can't believe you've only passed
your test a month ago, son!

939
00:51:01,398 --> 00:51:04,447
This is very impressive.

940
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:05,757
I'm going to stop!

941
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:07,477
Whoa!

942
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:09,367
Heathcliff!

943
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:12,287
And as McGuinness and his young
Padawan swapped

944
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:17,477
for their next stint...
Get me seat belt. It's OK.

945
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:21,477
despite the GT's ongoing attempts
to hold them up...

946
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,447
Oh, no!

947
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:26,597
It's not having it. No, take your
time.

948
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:30,167
before long, they were back on the
move.

949
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:31,647
Right, we're in. Are you in?

950
00:51:31,648 --> 00:51:33,588
Let's go! All right.

951
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:39,727
Team Lada, meanwhile, was bringing
up the rear...

952
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:41,677
A bit more gas. Go, go, go!

953
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,017
I've got it. Ready?

954
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:45,368
but coming in... fast.

955
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:48,757
Whoa! What a stop!

956
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:50,758
Right, now, jump out and swap. OK.

957
00:51:55,118 --> 00:51:57,037
Come on.

958
00:51:57,038 --> 00:51:58,567
How are we looking?

959
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:01,447
We're going at 49mph. 49? Yeah.

960
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:03,647
That's practically rapid in this.

961
00:52:03,648 --> 00:52:05,290
Oh, my God! My hair.

962
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:07,328
Lob it back there. Don't worry about
your hair.

963
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,878
I've got hat hair. At least you've
got hair.

964
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:11,448
Yeah. Come on!

965
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:13,649
Be sensitive for a minute.

966
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:18,758
All right. 1.5 miles on this road.
All right.

967
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:20,028
A bit of that.

968
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:22,528
Oh, let's have it!
That's what we want!

969
00:52:22,529 --> 00:52:24,039
Here we go!

970
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,568
Paddy Makinen and his new co-driver
were right in the zone.

971
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:31,728
Right. 0.5 miles on this.

972
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:33,918
Good navigating, Heathcliff!

973
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,478
And it looked like the fight
for first car glory

974
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,479
would be between Britain
and the USSR.

975
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,658
We're on the limiter.

976
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,468
We're flying! Come on!

977
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:46,009
The Niva is flying!

978
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:50,969
Especially as the Cornish
countryside was now asking

979
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,158
more and more questions
of Fred's sluggish Beetle.

980
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:57,648
So the speed limit is
60 miles an hour on this road.

981
00:52:57,649 --> 00:52:59,048
Not a chance I can get to 60.

982
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:00,478
What, this car can't reach 60?

983
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:02,888
No way. Not a chance.

984
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,518
It's got 50 horsepower.

985
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,970
OK. That was when it was new.

986
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:09,839
Now, this is an experience.

987
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,808
Yeah, it is.
Look at the beautiful view.

988
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:14,608
I like this, you're on the map
properly. Embrace the scenery.

989
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,398
One mile we're going right.

990
00:53:16,399 --> 00:53:19,198
You happy with your hair?
Yeah, my hair's looking great. OK.

991
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,758
Do you want the mirror?
Are you happy with your hair?

992
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:23,578
Oh, wait! Oh! Oh, there's no...

993
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,018
There's no need for any of that!

994
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,839
All right.

995
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,448
So the other two might have been
having an easier run of it.

996
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:34,198
Right, five minutes, 1.8 miles.

997
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:36,648
What, to the destination?
To the destination.

998
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:38,608
We are nailing it, pal.

999
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:40,379
But this is Cornwall.

1000
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:44,089
And just when you think
you're going well...

1001
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,128
Come on, the Niva.
Come on, the Niva.

1002
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:48,038
In 1.6 miles, we're going right.

1003
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,938
That's in 1.6 miles.

1004
00:53:49,939 --> 00:53:52,468
you soon realise
you're never far...

1005
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:54,928
Oh, no! Oh, Jesus.

1006
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:57,248
from a bit of holiday traffic.

1007
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:59,018
Oh, my lord!

1008
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:00,478
Look at this.

1009
00:54:00,479 --> 00:54:02,678
Look at this, come on!

1010
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:05,648
The delays looked costly.

1011
00:54:05,649 --> 00:54:08,568
You wouldn't expect it.
Oh, my word.

1012
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:10,048
Or at least they would have,

1013
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:14,329
if the competition didn't still have
their own hills to conquer.

1014
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,259
Oh, my God!

1015
00:54:19,649 --> 00:54:21,839
It's going to be not easy. Come on!

1016
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,008
Up the hill! Pump it up! Pump it up!

1017
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:26,888
You can do it, little babe. Come on.

1018
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,568
Come on, doing well, come on.

1019
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,458
Come on! Let's go.

1020
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:32,758
Oh, come on, son!

1021
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:34,678
Yeah! Come on!

1022
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,128
Ooh, ooh!

1023
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:38,688
Urrrgh!

1024
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:41,849
Oh, my God, look at that view.

1025
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,478
The finish line was now
just a stone's throw away.

1026
00:54:45,479 --> 00:54:47,558
Oh, look at that for a view
down there.

1027
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:50,448
Look at that. I can smell
the fish and chips already.

1028
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:52,128
Oh, good lad.

1029
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:54,969
And with two of us
closing in fast...

1030
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,558
Here. Left up here?
Yeah. We've smashed this.

1031
00:54:57,559 --> 00:54:59,448
We have smashed this. We have!

1032
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:01,328
Sadly for Team Beetle,

1033
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:05,758
it turned out that somewhere along
the sightseeing crawl of Newquay,

1034
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:08,808
they'd also gone the wrong way.

1035
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,609
Is this the same road?

1036
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:14,918
This is the same road here.

1037
00:55:14,919 --> 00:55:17,808
Yeah, and then left. Left? Yep.

1038
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:20,408
Why did you take us that way?
Yeah, well...

1039
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:22,888
Is that you there,
taking your pictures? Yes, come on.

1040
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:26,288
I think the navigator told me
to go for a scenic route.

1041
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:30,558
And that meant, with
a few extra valuable minutes lost,

1042
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,128
as the scenic route finally brought
them round to the finish line...

1043
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:37,839
Yeah. Oooh!

1044
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,048
Yes!

1045
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:41,849
Team MG was right behind.

1046
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:46,658
My lad, Heathcliff!

1047
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:49,368
Sorted. Lads are here.

1048
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:50,639
Oh, my word!

1049
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,528
How did you get here so fast?

1050
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:55,118
Love that, Heathcliff.

1051
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,458
Some navigation there, pal.

1052
00:55:57,459 --> 00:55:59,918
Which way did you come?
The way it told us to go.

1053
00:55:59,919 --> 00:56:01,128
We did the scenic route.

1054
00:56:01,129 --> 00:56:03,198
We went round that way first
and then came back.

1055
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:05,378
Did you? Here we go.

1056
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,168
It's the gang.

1057
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:10,608
Ohhhh!

1058
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:17,198
Girl power! Girl power!

1059
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,408
I've got to tell you,
you were not far behind us.

1060
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:23,018
Smashed it. I've got a feeling
you might have done it.

1061
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,178
Well played.

1062
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:26,378
Oh, hello, there. Thank you.

1063
00:56:26,379 --> 00:56:28,018
Right, OK.

1064
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:30,248
Freddie and Sanath.

1065
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:34,528
27 minutes and 12 seconds.

1066
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:36,797
I don't think...
I think we're last here.

1067
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:38,736
Chris and Charlotte.

1068
00:56:38,737 --> 00:56:42,886
21 minutes and 32 seconds?!

1069
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:44,567
Which way did you go?

1070
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:49,406
So Chris and Charlotte,
21 minutes and 32 seconds.

1071
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,838
Paddy and Heathcliff.

1072
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,407
Also, 21 minutes and...

1073
00:56:56,127 --> 00:56:58,396
28 seconds!

1074
00:56:58,397 --> 00:57:00,896
Good lad!

1075
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:04,736
We got close.
That's my boy! That's my boy.

1076
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:07,566
Hey, go on, get yourself in there,
son, you've earned it.

1077
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:10,396
Get in, big man.
That was... that was good fun.

1078
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:12,996
You'll be having a shave next.
Good lad.

1079
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,206
Good lad, Heathcliff!

1080
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,766
They were all great, weren't they?

1081
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:26,536
They were all great.

1082
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:30,916
So, we set out to find cars
for new drivers that were affordable

1083
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:33,286
and more interesting than
a Vauxhall Corsa.

1084
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:35,526
I've got to say, boys,
I think we've nailed it.

1085
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:37,646
Cracking trio.
I have to stop you there, Pad.

1086
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:41,097
I admit they are brilliant,
but I found a few issues with them.

1087
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:42,696
No ABS, no airbags.

1088
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:44,636
Don't steer straight. No brakes.

1089
00:57:44,637 --> 00:57:47,056
Sounds like me, now.
I have to on this one, Chris.

1090
00:57:47,057 --> 00:57:50,727
I feel for this one because...
because the more I drove this,

1091
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,847
the more I realised,
there's not a chance

1092
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:54,616
I'm putting a child of mine in it.
No way.

1093
00:57:54,617 --> 00:57:57,486
He's got a point. They're charming,
but they just serve to remind you

1094
00:57:57,487 --> 00:57:59,336
how far the motor car's come.

1095
00:57:59,337 --> 00:58:03,126
Correct. So what we're saying is,
if you've just passed your test

1096
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:05,806
and you want something affordable
to buy and insure,

1097
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:08,837
ignore everything we've just said
and get a Corsa.

1098
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:10,717
Exactly. Correct.

1099
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:14,536
And that's it for the show
and the series. What?!

1100
00:58:14,537 --> 00:58:16,916
Well, don't worry,
because we'll be back very soon

1101
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:19,116
with a bonus Christmas episode.

1102
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:21,046
Ho-ho-hope to see you then!

1103
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:22,526
A little Christmas gag.

1104
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:24,407
Thanks for watching. Goodnight!
