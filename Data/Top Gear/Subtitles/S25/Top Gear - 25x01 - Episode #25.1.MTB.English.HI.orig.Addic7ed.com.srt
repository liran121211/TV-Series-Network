00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
Thank you! Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
And thank YOU in particular, yes.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,040
All right, we are back

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,080
and we have been busy driving
a whole lot of cars.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,880
Here's what we've got coming up
for you in this series.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,480
Who says we don't do
serious car reviews?

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,720
Here!

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
Noooo!

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Whoohoo! How good is that?!

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,160
- Scare me! - Scare you?!

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,040
- Scare me! - I'm trying!

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,960
That's what I'm talking about!

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,880
Yahoo!

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,040
That, my friend, is panache.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,760
CAR ALARM WAILS

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,960
Imola!

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Incoming car.

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,840
Come on!

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,320
All that to look forward to
over the next six weeks, OK?

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,560
But first up,

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,720
you ask any car lover what their
favourite noise in the world is,

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,480
and they will immediately say...

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,880
The V8 engine.

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,080
Exactly.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,960
And with this year being,
as you all know,

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,040
the 116th anniversary
of the V8 car...

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,200
The big 116!

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
..we decided it was time
for a little celebration.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,560
Yeah, so the producers told us three
each to pick a new V8 sports car

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
that could do anything.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,960
And head to America's Wild West
for a mystery road trip.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,720
The United States -

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
spiritual home of the V8 and land
of the great American road trip.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,200
Ours would begin
at a remote location in Utah,

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,960
where we'd been told to show up
with the best all-around sports car

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,840
we could find, powered by that most
iconic of all engines.

40
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
ENGINE PURRS

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
Yeah, baby.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,880
And since I had the home advantage,

43
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,320
I took the producer's brief and...
well, I nailed it.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,920
The Ford Mustang.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,160
The original American V8
performance icon, huh?

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,080
And this isn't just any
Ford Mustang -

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,920
no, no, no, no, no, no.

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,200
This is the raciest Mustang Ford
makes, the GT350R.

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,760
Carbon fibre wheels, a 5.2-litre V8
motor that makes 520 horsepower.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,680
Only this one...doesn't.

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,600
Because in the finest Mustang
tradition of taking a fast thing

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
and making it even faster,

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,120
this particular GT350R

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,920
has been lightly enhanced
by a man from Texas.

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
A man called Mr Hennessey.

56
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
DISTANT ENGINE
Oh. Ssh, ssh. OK, here we go.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,320
And while I had embraced the V8
brief and used my imagination...

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,080
Oh, yeah! That's right.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,320
..it appeared Rory...hadn't.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,960
The Jaguar F-Type SVR.

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,520
- Yeah. - Yeah, isn't this great?

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,720
I mean, you brought a V8 muscle car,
I brought a V8 muscle car.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,160
No, no. No.

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,000
No, I brought a V8 muscle car,
you brought...

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
..a Jaguar.

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,840
Well, this is Britain's answer
to the muscle car.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
We had a look at your rough sketch
and we refined it.

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
This is muscle car 2.0.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
How much power does it make?

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,280
575 horsepower.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,520
Wow, impressive! Yeah. Wow!

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
How about yours?

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,760
I don't know, really.
I don't know. Mustang...

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,920
What do you mean you don't know?

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
This is a supercharged version.

76
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Wait a minute -
is this the Hennessey?

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,120
- Is it? - This thing makes
850 horsepower!

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,360
Does it?!

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Ooh!

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
Lucky me!

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,560
Then along came Chris...

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,840
Well, well, well.

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,640
..with HIS idea of a
great all-rounder.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,800
Absolute shambles.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,720
4 million miles of paved road
in America,

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,920
and they tell us to meet
in a pit full of rocks.

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,120
Worse still, it sounded like
a 1980s arcade.

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,720
DOOR CHIMES

89
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,480
Gentlemen! Behold the McLaren 570GT.

90
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
How's the, er, ground clearance?

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
Absolutely terrible.

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
When they said "road trip,"

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,960
I thought it might involve
actual roads.

94
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,400
Chris, this is the Wild West.

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,440
You've got to be prepared
for anything!

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
Well, I suppose I am,

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
because this is basically two cars
for the price of one, isn't it?

98
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,400
On the one hand, it is still
a proper supercar, crazy fast.

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,120
But it's also a comfortable GT car.

100
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,720
In fact it's three cars -
check this out...

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,400
It's also an estate car!

102
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,440
Look at this!

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Wow. You could seriously fit
a couple of sheets of A4 in there.

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,000
And not that flimsy stuff,
I'm talking about the thick...

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,320
The stuff you use, like,
for a cover page, the good stuff?

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,600
We're supposed to be celebrating the
evolution, OK,

107
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
- of the V8 sports car. - Right.

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,640
You've brought a car that
desperately wants it to be 1965.

109
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
- Yeah. - And you've also brought a car

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,560
that desperately wants it
to be 1965.

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
- So...? - I'm in the present day,
you're in the past,

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,200
as is confirmed by your shirt.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Right. What are you laughing at?
Let's not get on shirts!

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
LAUGHTER
Let's not get on shirts!

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,440
I look good! You do look good.

116
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,520
- You look... You're on fire.
- I've never seen a label

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,760
riveted to a T-shirt before.

118
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,560
That's remarkable, that is.

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,880
But before we could get to the
bottom of who looked least awful,

120
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,000
a local turned up
in an old Ford pick-up.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
Ooh, that sounds a bit V8-y,
what's that?

122
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
They do burble nicely, V8s,
don't they?

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
Burble, burble.

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
- How are you? - Here you go.

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,200
Oh, thank you. Nice ride.

126
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,120
OK. "You and your V8 sports cars
will now drive

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,960
"to America's fastest race track
on the Nevada border.

128
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,400
"Along the way, you will undertake
a series of challenges

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
"to discover which of your V8s
is best."

130
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,000
So, with the Nevada border
a couple of days ahead of us,

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,360
we had some road to cover.

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,800
But, of course, first,
that meant finding it.

133
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,920
This is the quintessential American
V8 right here, the Mustang.

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,000
HE WHINNIES

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Oh, yeah!

136
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,600
Buying it is just the start.

137
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,160
Then you get busy giving it more
power, bigger brakes,

138
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,880
probably even more power.

139
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
It's the American way!

140
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,640
The 570GT is the most relaxed car
that McLaren makes, right?

141
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,240
It's got softer suspension
and it's quieter on the road -

142
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,440
or at least it would be
if I was on a road!

143
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,640
- CLATTER
- Oh!

144
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,160
Oh-ho-ho!

145
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,680
ENGINE ROARS

146
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,080
There is a very good reason
why I chose the Jaguar F-Type SVR.

147
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,000
I chose this because it has
all-wheel drive,

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,480
and that means it's ready
for anything.

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,120
It's unflappable.

150
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,280
Suave.

151
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
Like me.

152
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,160
But soon, it was time to find out

153
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,000
just how unflappable
our V8s really were...

154
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,760
..because getting out of this valley
would take a bit of a climb.

155
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,480
This looks like a very bad idea.

156
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,760
Dear Lord!

157
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,240
One mistake up here,
and you're looking at

158
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,320
a very, very painful accident.

159
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
Look at the remnants
of that car there!

160
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,640
But none of that seemed to trouble
the cowboy and his Mustang.

161
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,760
Careful, Matt,
what the hell are you doing?!

162
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
HE LAUGHS

163
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Coming round the top, boys!

164
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,520
Whoo!

165
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,920
Supposed to be a road trip!

166
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,160
God, look what we've just come up!

167
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,800
That would be a beautiful death!

168
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,760
With the valley behind us,
waiting at the top...

169
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,240
Hey, a paved road! Look at this!

170
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes!

171
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,080
Finally, our V8s
could stretch their legs.

172
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,200
This is where the real test begins.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Ho-ho!

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,840
Whoo!

175
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,240
ENGINE ROARS

176
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,920
HE LAUGHS

177
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,040
Do you hear that, boys?

178
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,600
That is the sound of
an American V8 in the wild -

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
the greatest noise in the world!

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,120
I don't mean to be pernickety here,

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,440
but that's not
an American V8, really,

182
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,800
is it, Matt? Because that's
a flat-plane V8 sound,

183
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,400
and most American V8s
are cross-plane V8s,

184
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,880
so what you've got there
is a European V8

185
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,560
in an American body shell.

186
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,760
That's about as American
as Silvio Berlusconi!

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Who is she?

188
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,680
HE LAUGHS

189
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
This is the coupe version of the car
that I drove from Coventry to Geneva

190
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
a couple of years ago.

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,840
At the time, I said that was
the fastest Jaguar ever,

192
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,320
but that's not quite true,

193
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
because THIS is
the fastest Jag ever.

194
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,040
This will do 200mph.

195
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,760
The fixed roof actually improves
top speed by 5mph.

196
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
It's the same reason Chris Harris
is so fast.

197
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
It's all down to his dome!

198
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,840
Most supercars, they're a pain
to live with, they really are.

199
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,560
But the 570GT, it just isn't.

200
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,800
This car is supple,
it's comfortable,

201
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,520
it's practical, and on this road...

202
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm in the firm suspension setting
now - if I go to comfort...

203
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

204
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Whoa!

205
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, that McLaren is quick!

206
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,080
Hey, Chris, what's the 0-60 on that?

207
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
About three and a half seconds.

208
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,080
About the same as mine.

209
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,680
Matt? Yeah, about three and a half
seconds maybe.

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,960
Maybe less, I don't know,

211
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,720
- right around there. - OK, OK -
how about a shoot-out?

212
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,760
- A what? - Take the next left.
Next left.

213
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
And suddenly we were off-road again.

214
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
Oh, you're going to love this.

215
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
There's nothing about this
I'm going to love.

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,200
Right, here's how
this is going to work.

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,840
Quickest on the draw,
like in those old cowboy films.

218
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,200
When I say go, you two head off,

219
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,680
opposite directions,
slow as you can,

220
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
but no touching the brakes.

221
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
When I come on the radio and say
draw,

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
spin around and head back.

223
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,760
First one across the line
is the winner.

224
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,000
This is completely childish.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,680
You don't have to play.

226
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
Oh, I'm going to play.

227
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah, I'm going to win as well.

228
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,040
Buffalo LeBlanc, you ready?

229
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,840
Ready.

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,520
Crazy Eyes Harris, are you ready?

231
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,000
Crazy Eyes, who has...?

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Stupid nicknames. Yeah, I'm ready!

233
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Three, two...

234
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,280
..one...

235
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,320
Go!

236
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
He's not even moving!

237
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,440
Two can play at that game, LeBlanc.

238
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,560
I saw brake lights, Harris.

239
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
No brakes.

240
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
A duel in the dirt -

241
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,840
this is basically what this car
was designed to do.

242
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
He's got a locking differential.

243
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
He can turn on a sixpence if he just
does a little half-doughnut,

244
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
whereas I can't.

245
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,240
Curse you, McLaren, and your lack
of locking differentials!

246
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,600
V8 muscle car is a tool, as good
or as bad as the man handling it.

247
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Remember that.

248
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,600
SPITTOON PINGS

249
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
Yeah.

250
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm going to get over
to one side now.

251
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,600
Wait for it.

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Wait for it.

253
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,640
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
say it, say it, say it!

254
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
Draw!

255
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
Ho-ho!

256
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

257
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
Yes, baby!

258
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,160
- Chris is the winner! - Ha-ha-ha!

259
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Damn it, he got me!

260
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,080
Oh!

261
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
- Oh! - Chris has taken it!

262
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,200
Chris, in the McLaren!

263
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Well done, mate.
HE COUGHS

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,400
Thanks for that! Cheers!

265
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,720
HE SPLUTTERS

266
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,280
So, with the Mustang
out of the game,

267
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,520
would the Jag be any quicker
on the draw?

268
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,360
OK, Crazy Eyes Harris,
are you ready?

269
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,800
- I'm ready. - Rory...

270
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,160
Odd Taste In Clothing -
are you ready?

271
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,400
Never been readier!

272
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Three, two, one...

273
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
Go!

274
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,520
OK, we're off.

275
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,480
Oh, he's had to creep away
faster than me.

276
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,840
Man, this is so counterintuitive.

277
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,120
I've got 570-odd horsepower

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,040
and I can only use
about three right now!

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Who will it be?

280
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Four-wheel drive, a massive
advantage for him

281
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,640
when it comes to heading
back towards the finish line.

282
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,840
But I'm not convinced that he can
turn as well as me,

283
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,720
cos I can spin turn, and he can't.

284
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,160
All right, come on, Reid, come on,
come on, come on.

285
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,520
- He's moving to one side...
- Get ready, get ready, get ready.

286
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,680
And draw!

287
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Come on! Come on, baby!

288
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,600
Made it!

289
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,760
Oh-ho-ho!

290
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,240
Whoo! Come on!

291
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,160
Oh, I think I got duffed up there.

292
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,840
Rory by a mile!

293
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,520
I think, yes, an actual mile!

294
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,160
- Oh! - Ha-ha!

295
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,800
That, gentlemen, is what you call
a spectacular win.

296
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,960
- Here it comes. - I just beat
a McLaren, in a Jag!

297
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,160
I didn't stand a chance.

298
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,560
All-wheel drive Jag -
wasn't going to beat that.

299
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,680
You were gone.

300
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,960
HE LAUGHS

301
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,640
Are you doing the dance IN the car?

302
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,960
Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.

303
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,760
Just to confirm, er,
I'm not done winning.

304
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,800
Right.

305
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,280
So, as Rory took winning the
challenge he'd just made up

306
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,160
with his typical good grace...

307
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,560
Oh, it feels good to be a winner!

308
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
..we got back on the road.

309
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,840
The Jaguar F-Type.

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,640
Know what that says about you, Rory?

311
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,160
What does it say about me?

312
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,200
- It says you couldn't afford
an Aston Martin. - Oh!

313
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,920
HE CHUCKLES

314
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,000
Soon, we were told to head to
a mystery location

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
for our first proper tribute
to the V8.

316
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
What is this place?

317
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,240
I don't know.
But it looks kind of creepy.

318
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,800
- Who's he? - It appears to be
a challenge, gentlemen.

319
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,760
Thank you. It says here,

320
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,560
"The V8 sports car can trace its
roots back to the prohibition era,

321
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,400
"when moonshine runners needed speed
and performance to evade the police.

322
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,080
"To prove the speed and performance
of your V8s,

323
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,400
"you will now each run a crate of
moonshine to the state line."

324
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,680
So, this tribute to the V8 moonshine
runners of old

325
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,920
would be a chase through
a sprawling industrial complex,

326
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,280
finishing at a hastily knocked
together...

327
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,960
..border post.

328
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,160
"PS - get a move on.

329
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,920
"As soon as Officer Block finishes
his doughnut,

330
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,320
"he'll be in hot pursuit."

331
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Officer Block?

332
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,240
Ken Block?!

333
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Yes. Because no chase would be
complete without a bit of company,

334
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,000
we'd be pursued by legendary
Sheriff of the Slide,

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,360
Ken Block.

336
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,640
My buddy!

337
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,520
Me and Ken, we go way back!
Yeah! K-Dog! K-Money! Big-K...

338
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
Special-K is what I call him.

339
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
Very heart-warming story, Matt,

340
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,520
but Officer Block appears to have
turned to the dark side.

341
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,280
He's a member of the law now. Let's
load up and get out of here, OK?

342
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
- Copy that. - Shine time!

343
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,920
Go, go, go, go, go!

344
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,120
- Are you ready? - Hit it! Go!

345
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,440
POLICE SIREN

346
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,280
Which way are we going?

347
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,320
This is sketchy.

348
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,440
He's coming!

349
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,200
He's right behind you, Rory!

350
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,880
With the pursuit gathering momentum,

351
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,200
it seemed like a good opportunity
to assess our cars' handling.

352
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,480
Ah, this four-wheel drive
is perfect for this!

353
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
This thing just grips!

354
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,880
I can throw it into a corner,
get on the power super early...

355
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,640
..and it just goes!

356
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,160
God, this thing is so fast.

357
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,440
But it's small and it's nimble.

358
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,680
That's what McLaren is all
about, it's about handling.

359
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,440
I've got handling to spare here.

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,160
One-handage!
One-handed shine escape!

361
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

362
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,720
BOTTLES CLINK

363
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
It's got so much grip!

364
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,080
And the steering is like a razor.

365
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,640
So aggressive.

366
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,040
OK...

367
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,480
I mean, I don't like running
from the law, but...

368
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
..this is awesome!

369
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
Whoa!

370
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,680
- Go, Chris - go, go, go!
- He's right behind me!

371
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,480
SIREN WAILS

372
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,840
Man, this guy really
wants my moonshine!

373
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,680
All right, we've got to lose him,
you guys.

374
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,880
We need to split up. Rory,
you go right, we'll go left.

375
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,400
- Go right, go right.
- Good idea, good idea.

376
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,000
No, no, no, no.
Bad idea, bad idea!

377
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,280
How do I get out, how do I get out?

378
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,960
Argh!

379
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Hey, Ken.

380
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,400
You know what rhymes with block?
C...

381
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,680
- Oh-ho-ho...
- Harris, where are you going?

382
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
SIREN WAILS

383
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,240
Relentless.

384
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,320
REVERSE ALARM BEEPING

385
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

386
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Hey, buddy!

387
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,680
Whoa!

388
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,880
That's not friendly at all.

389
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,040
How far have I got to go?
Where is he?

390
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Oh, my Lord.

391
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,680
He's so much quicker than me.
He can go across the grass, I can't.

392
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Oh, my God!

393
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,840
Oh, ho-ho!

394
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,160
I can see a border!

395
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,200
Oh, it's sketchy,
the tyres are going.

396
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Get through the border,
get through the border...

397
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,720
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

398
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

399
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
OK, we'll pick that up
later in the show.

400
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,480
But now it's time to put
a star in our reasonably fast car.

401
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,680
He's one of Britain's
best loved comedians,

402
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,240
he's had a number one hit single,

403
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,800
and, most impressively,

404
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,040
once owned a Mitsubishi Carisma.

405
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,960
And earlier today, he got some
training out on the track

406
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
with Mr Charisma himself,

407
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
Chris Harris.

408
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,000
- Yeah, I've missed you.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

409
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
please welcome to the sofa
Rob Brydon.

410
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Hello. Hello.

411
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,120
- Nice to see you. - Hello.
- How are you, buddy?

412
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,000
Nice to see you, Rob.
Great to meet you. Welcome, welcome.

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,160
Cheers. Thank you. Thank you.

414
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,360
All right. Now you've driven round
the track here before,

415
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
how did you like the new GT 86?

416
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Before we say anything else,

417
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,880
it's soaking wet.

418
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,600
It is wetter than the worst day

419
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,400
of Noah and Mrs Noah
when they're saying,

420
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,880
"Have we got enough wood?" That is
so wet. It was wet, wasn't it?

421
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,200
- It was wet. - So, the time
is not going to be great, Matt.

422
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,120
So you're saying it's wet.

423
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,640
It was moist!

424
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,400
OK. And how was Chris as a teacher?

425
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,240
He's, yeah, I mean,
an acquired taste, you know.

426
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,760
You know that saying?
Oh, you don't have to tell me!

427
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,280
Yeah. No, he was good. He was good.

428
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,720
Right. OK. Well, let's take
a look at how the training went,

429
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,200
what do you think?

430
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,440
I've never noticed before,
at the start...

431
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,080
- Yeah? - You see the ambulance
and the fire thing.

432
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,200
We always keep those there just to
remind you

433
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,040
- of the importance of your own
safety. - All right, count me down.

434
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,800
OK. Three, two, one, go.

435
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,120
It's a great launch.

436
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,160
And we're going to the left of those
tyres. Left, left, left, left.

437
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,240
- What? Oh, BLEEP. - Left of those tyres
there. - What? LEFT of those tyres?

438
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, right now, right now,
right now.

439
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,560
- What are you talking about?
- Right! Go right there. - Where?

440
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,920
- Right there. - There?!
- Yeah, turn... - What, by the...?

441
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,400
- By the aeroplanes?
- No, no, before the aeroplanes.

442
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,360
Did you do the medical
before you came on?

443
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
- Shut up. - Left here now, left here.

444
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,440
- There's, there's your two white
lines. And then to the right. - Oh!

445
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
- Now it's coming back.
- Now it's flowing.

446
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,280
Oh, Lord Almighty, we're fast.

447
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
OK, left here, left here.

448
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,360
Oh, oh, oh!
HE CHUCKLES

449
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,400
Fourth. Fourth, fourth, fourth.

450
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,320
- Fourth. - That's sixth. That's sixth.
- Really, you want to be fourth here?

451
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,920
- That's sixth, that's sixth,
that's sixth. - Oh. - That's second.

452
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,560
- LAUGHTER
- That's fourth!

453
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,280
- We've got to fourth. - That's good,
you've got some feel for this now,

454
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,840
- haven't you? - Oh, lordy.
- But can you feel... - Whoa!

455
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,400
I'm not sure you know how
close you are

456
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,240
- to a massive accident.
- ROB LAUGHS

457
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,960
- But let's just go through here...
- Oh, sugary!

458
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,760
Oh. I don't like that.

459
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,640
That is scary.

460
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,280
Full beans, full beans,
over the line.

461
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,200
- Over the line!
- That is so frustrating.

462
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,680
I want your honest opinion...

463
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,840
- Yeah... - ..on the level of support
you've received

464
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,000
- during your training.
- Very poor. Very poor.

465
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,920
I would say my coach is more
interested in himself

466
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,240
than in his young...

467
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,120
his young apprentice.

468
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,160
Well, I don't know.

469
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,800
Looks like you did pretty good
considering it's a lake out there.

470
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,680
But cars are in your blood,
your dad sold cars?

471
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,280
Yeah, my dad was a car salesman.
So when I grew up in south Wales,

472
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,560
in Port Talbot, he'd often bring
different cars back every day.

473
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,480
So I got used to seeing these
different ones

474
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,920
coming back and forth to the house.

475
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,840
And then years later,
he worked for Mitsubishi.

476
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,280
Hence the Carisma.

477
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,400
- Ah, there it is. - Is that known
as being a very bad car, then?

478
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,360
- Oh, it's terrible. - Is it?

479
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,640
- Yeah. - Oh, is that it?

480
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,400
- That's it right there. - Look at the
way the indicator on the left

481
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,480
isn't flush with the headlight,
but the one on the right is.

482
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,440
You see? I mean,
they couldn't even be bothered

483
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,000
to get a good one
for the press photo.

484
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,120
I think, I think what you're
encountering here

485
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,360
for the first time, Chris,

486
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,040
is called perspective.

487
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,440
Ah!

488
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,600
You know how on the left side,
it looks bigger?

489
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
Yeah, it's just closer.

490
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,640
OK. And what do you drive now?

491
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,800
At the moment, I have a Jaguar XJ,
and a Land Rover Discovery.

492
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,360
- Oh, dear. - The new one?
- Oh, dear. - Yeah, what's the problem?

493
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,680
What have I done now?!
The new Discovery?

494
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,120
- Yeah. - So you've seen it? - Oh, boy.

495
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
- You've seen it from the outside?
- Oh, you're talking...?

496
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,960
- I know, I noticed. - You've opened
a can of worms... - The back of it.

497
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,080
I'm talking about all of it.
Let's start with the sides.

498
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,920
- We'll leave the worst bit till last.
- The sides are OK.

499
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,040
- What's wrong with that?
- Look how much metal there is

500
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,720
- above the rear wheel. Look at it.
- Is that an issue for normal people?

501
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,920
- It is!
- LAUGHTER

502
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,440
Let's move round to the back.

503
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,560
Now, look at the lack
of symmetry here.

504
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,280
- Yeah, I agree. - So, they designed
the whole thing,

505
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,840
at the last minute
someone's run in and gone,

506
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,600
"We've got to put the
number plate somewhere!"

507
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,680
So they've just slapped it there.

508
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,040
And the design inspiration for it,
here we go.

509
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,640
LAUGHTER

510
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,160
It's designed as an homage
to Geoffrey Boycott's mouth.

511
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,000
It... It is curious, but sometimes
innovation startles us at first.

512
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,600
- It does, it does.
- Where do you stand?

513
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,520
Er... Well, I think it's hideous.

514
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,520
- The Trip. Let's talk about The Trip.
- Yes. Yeah. Tell us about The Trip.

515
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,840
Oh, I'm a huge fan.
Who's a fan of The Trip here?

516
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

517
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,880
- It's fantastic.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

518
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,400
- Very funny. - We drove...
- Does that bring back good memories?

519
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,080
Yeah, that was The Trip To Italy,
which was the second one.

520
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,640
Why choose a Mini Cooper
convertible?

521
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,880
Oh! The Mini was... That was lovely.

522
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,400
Especially, you know, you had
a lot of windy country roads,

523
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,800
especially on the Amalfi coast.

524
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,560
It was lovely to drive.
In fact, I liked it so much,

525
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
I actually bought one
when we came back.

526
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,600
- Ooh. What?! - What's wrong with that?

527
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,800
Why would you do that? Cos it was...
It was a really nice drive.

528
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Was it like that rose you have
when you go on holiday?

529
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
You know, the four euro rose.

530
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,840
And it's great when you're there...

531
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,640
And you crack a bottle open
three weeks later back in the UK,

532
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,400
- and it tastes like vinegar.
- It's not... It's not quite the same

533
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
driving it around Twickenham,

534
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,920
or, you know, as it was
on the Amalfi coast,

535
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,840
- but no, look, I'm going to...
It was a lovely car. - One question.

536
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,280
- Do you still own it? - No.

537
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,800
How long did you own it for?

538
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,280
I don't know, I had it for a year
and a bit, something like that.

539
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
Why so long?

540
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,640
LAUGHTER

541
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,440
I think it's time to see your lap.

542
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,360
Ah. Let's move on to that.

543
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,120
Can I... Did I mention it was wet?
You did mention it was wet.

544
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,520
- But you had fun? - Oh...

545
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,680
It's a blast, right?
It's fantastic. It's really fun.

546
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,040
OK, let's take a look.

547
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,800
Hey, you know what, why don't
you commentate on it?

548
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,200
OK, all right. Here we go.

549
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,960
Well, perfect conditions
for the youthful Rob Brydon.

550
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,200
It's a nice start.

551
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,680
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

552
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,000
Something is flashing
on the dashboard.

553
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,320
I don't know what it means.

554
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,280
That classic Roman profile gripping
the wheel with assuredness

555
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,440
and a strange sensuality.

556
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,640
And he takes that corner with ease.

557
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,800
Look at the way he's going.

558
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,280
And have you noticed it's wet?

559
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,720
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...

560
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,040
Difficult corner, difficult corner,

561
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,200
difficult to see
the white lines there,

562
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,240
but he's done it beautifully.

563
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,920
The inquest heard that although
he took the corner smoothly,

564
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,480
Brydon hadn't anticipated the...

565
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,640
..group of nuns visiting
the aerodrome.

566
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,840
He took out six of them.

567
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,080
Thoughts with the families.

568
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,640
Yes, you don't want to hear
the word "inquest" in your head

569
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,280
when you're doing this lap.

570
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,640
I have to say, Gav, it's a lot
quicker than the Picasso.

571
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,720
This bit, now, I think I got speed
up here, and look at that.

572
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,280
That's not bad, is it?

573
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,120
This looks narrower...

574
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,040
..every time you go through it!

575
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,840
BLEEP!

576
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,520
Oh, bloody hell. That was scary.

577
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,600
Oh, Robert! There's no need
for that sort of language,

578
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
- you - BLEEP - idiot.

579
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,440
Oh, you...! Damn it.

580
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,000
And he comes now to his jinx,
his nemesis, this penultimate...

581
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,720
Oh, no, he didn't. That was the end!

582
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
CHEERING

583
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,160
That shows you how well
I know the course, right?

584
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,200
- That's wet. - Ah.

585
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,320
I've never seen it that wet.

586
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,240
That's monsoon conditions.

587
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,640
I've never seen it that wet.

588
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,800
Well, there we are, then,
whatever the time was...

589
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,640
- Well, I have it right here. - Ah.

590
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,080
- What do you think? - I just want
to beat Tinie Tempah, really.

591
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
- You do? - I just feel
in the world of rap,

592
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,720
I feel Tinie is always, you know,

593
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,000
threatening my territory.

594
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,280
So, I just want to let him know.
I'm a big rap star in this country,

595
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,400
you wouldn't know this, Matt,
but, er, I want to beat him.

596
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,200
It was definitely wetter for you
than it was for Tinie.

597
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
I think we're going to call
your time, not just with a W,

598
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,240
we're going to put a VW.

599
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,880
VW, thank you. Very wet, yeah.

600
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,480
Thank you. OK, Rob Brydon,
are you ready?

601
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,920
Mmm-hmm. You went around the track
in one minute...

602
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,960
..50...

603
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, for heaven's sake, so I'm
already down the bottom section.

604
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,920
..point...five.

605
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:19,160
- So I'm just...!
- Oh! It's tough! Sorry, boss.

606
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,640
- Great effort. - Yeah, well, I tried.
It was very wet.

607
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,360
I tried. It was very, very wet.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Brydon.

608
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

609
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,120
- Fantastic, thanks so much. - Ah...

610
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,640
Earlier on, you remember we were
celebrating the V8 engine

611
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,800
with a classic American road trip.

612
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,360
We'd escaped from a big pit,

613
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,040
staged a good old-fashioned
Wild West shoot out

614
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,640
and had a run-in with the law.
Standard road trip stuff.

615
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,920
Now it's time to head back to Utah
and pick up the story.

616
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,640
The next morning,
we were back on the road again.

617
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,760
And heading towards our destination
on the Nevada border,

618
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,160
we had time to reflect on what we
were really here to celebrate.

619
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,000
There's a personality about the V8

620
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,920
that no other engine configuration
can match, OK?

621
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,800
A V12 is the most exotic
engine configuration.

622
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,040
If you say I've got a V12,

623
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,080
you think of the most expensive,
exotic Italian supercars.

624
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,960
If you think, got a V6,
you're better than ordinary,

625
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,000
but ultimately you're
not the really fast model.

626
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,760
If you say your car's got a V8

627
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,400
it automatically makes it sound like
it's... It's the one you want.

628
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,680
Petrol engines are dying out,
there's no debate about that.

629
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,480
And I can see pros and cons to that.

630
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,360
But it really would be a shame
to lose the V8.

631
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,000
For me...

632
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
..the V8 is sacred.

633
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,040
I remember when I was a kid,
I was 16 and a half, and my cousin,

634
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,360
he had saved up his money
to buy a car.

635
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,760
And he bought a 1968 Chevy Camaro
with a 327 V8 in it.

636
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,320
So I had my license before him,

637
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,680
and he really wanted to drive
the car but he couldn't.

638
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,280
So I talked him into,
"Well, let's take the car out.

639
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,960
"I'll drive."

640
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,640
It was like my first
experience with a V8.

641
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
That thing was great.

642
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,440
By the time he got his licence,
the transmission needed a rebuild

643
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,760
- cos I beat the - BLEEP - out of it.

644
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,520
You're welcome.

645
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,480
Eager to continue
our V8 celebration,

646
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,560
we were told to head
to a local racetrack.

647
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,680
Rocky Mountain Raceways.

648
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,600
An oval circuit,
which could only mean one thing...

649
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,120
..Nascar.

650
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,360
Wow! You know where we are?

651
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,400
- Where? - It was 1957,

652
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,640
the final race of the Nascar season.

653
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,240
Bubba Passwater's got to finish
third to secure the title.

654
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,400
OK, on the last lap, he's third
coming out of the final corner,

655
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,920
right over there. As he gets onto
the straightaway, he gets tapped,

656
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,840
he corrects, clips the wall - boom!

657
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,440
The car goes up in a ball of flames.

658
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,560
He is out of control.
He spins across the line backwards,

659
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,400
takes the title by a single point.

660
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,640
Really? No, I have no idea
where we are.

661
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,520
Luckily, a local man
on a golf buggy did.

662
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,800
Here we go.

663
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,600
- Hello. - Hello. - Hello.

664
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,520
- There you go. - Thank you very much.

665
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,480
ENGINE STRUGGLING

666
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Ooh... Ooh!

667
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,360
It's a challenge. "In a tribute
to America's favourite motorsport,

668
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,640
"you will each attempt to set the
fastest time over five flying laps."

669
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,720
And we'd each get some help
from the real deal.

670
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
Born back in the '40s,

671
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,640
when moonshine runners
took their outlaw V8s

672
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,040
and started to race them...

673
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
..70 years on,

674
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,520
Nascar remains America's
most popular V8 motor sport.

675
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,440
Big on noise...

676
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,680
..if a little short on variety.

677
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,320
Wait, wait, so let me
get this straight.

678
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
We just go up there, take a left...

679
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
There. And then what, it's a left?
Over there.

680
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,800
- Rory... - And then left...
- ..these are simple people, OK?

681
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,440
- You've met Matt. Let's go.
Come on. - He's right.

682
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
That's cold.

683
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,840
For this Nascar-inspired test,

684
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,080
we would each be timed over
five laps of the track.

685
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,480
For the first two laps,

686
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,840
we would pick up some extra speed
by slipstreaming the pace car

687
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,800
before overtaking for a three-lap
sprint to the finish.

688
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,720
I'll try and explain it.

689
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,200
The car in front is bashing
a great big hole in the air, OK?

690
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,760
So you nudge in behind that car,
you get the benefit of that hole.

691
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,800
So you've got less air resistance,
ergo, you travel faster.

692
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,720
That's quick. That's loud.
THEY LAUGH

693
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I've got to judge when to duck out
to get my maximum aero advantage.

694
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,520
Time it right,
and it's called the slingshot.

695
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
I'm going!

696
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,920
It's quite physical.

697
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,880
You have to really brace yourself.

698
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,520
Whoa!

699
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,960
That...is tiring.

700
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,800
So, with Chris having demonstrated
the theory...

701
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,240
..Rory was up next.

702
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,080
I'm following a Nascar.

703
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,720
Dear Lord.

704
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,240
When Jaguar developed
the F-type SVR,

705
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,600
do you think they thought about
bringing it to an oval in Utah?

706
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,120
Probably not.

707
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,320
Wait for it, wait for it,
wait for it, wait for it.

708
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,160
- And once he cleared the pace
car... - NOW!

709
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
..Rory found driving round
in circles

710
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,680
much more difficult than he thought.

711
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,560
OK, late apex, late apex.

712
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,840
That's got to be the secret, right?

713
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Oh, that's too high.

714
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
Turn it in, turn it in, turn it in.

715
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,400
He's just added about a quarter
of a mile to his lap there.

716
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
But what he lacked in technique...

717
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,520
Bravery, bravery, bravery.

718
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,080
..he made up for in recklessness.

719
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,920
That is close to the wall!
That is close to the wall.

720
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,440
Whoa!

721
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
Yes!

722
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,560
Oh, my God!

723
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,640
Now I'm no mind-reader,

724
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,360
but it seemed like he was pleased
with his run.

725
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
That was quite
a proficient doughnut.

726
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Finally, it was time to unleash
the 850-horsepower beast.

727
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,720
Which was a bit of a handful.

728
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,840
The thing has got so much power
that I don't dare pin it

729
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,480
until I get it straightened out.

730
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
All right, here he goes, I'm going.

731
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,800
- That sounds fantastic. - Mega.

732
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,400
The grip in the front end
of this thing is awesome.

733
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
It's like King Kong.

734
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,520
- Well, it sounded good. - It did.

735
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,920
I mean, look at him.
He's just been following a Nascar,

736
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,320
he's in a hopped-up Mustang,
in Utah, on a short oval -

737
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,520
he's basically in American heaven,
isn't he?

738
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Give that man a foot-long wiener
and he's complete.

739
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,320
Ah, this must be the times!

740
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,000
- Here we go. - Bring it.

741
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,560
Thank you. Yeah, go back that way,
it's easier.

742
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,240
"Matt LeBlanc.
You did it in one minute...

743
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,960
"30.6.

744
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,120
"Rory. You did it in one minute...
30...

745
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,520
"..one..."

746
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,080
It might get better. "..point four."

747
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,840
- So, it doesn't.
- You got closer to him.

748
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,640
- I gotcha. - But you did have 200 more
horsepower than me, but well done.

749
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,560
Oh, God, here we go, here we go.

750
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,280
- Yeah, yeah. "Chris Harris." - Come on.

751
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,960
- "You did it..." - Come on.

752
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,440
"..in one minute..."

753
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,000
- Come on. - What do you want
to do for dinner? - Just...!

754
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
"Chris Harris, you did it
in one minute..."

755
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,120
Yep, next word, next word.

756
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,800
- "..20..." - Yes! - "..8.1."

757
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,480
- Congratulations. - Yes! - Way to go.

758
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,600
- You see? - Mr McLaren.
- Upholding Woking's honour.

759
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,840
Said no-one ever.

760
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,680
THEY LAUGH

761
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,120
- Well done, well done. - Thank you.

762
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,360
- Congratulations. - I'm pleased with
that. - Now... "Your prize

763
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,680
"is to take part in one of America's
most exciting race events..."

764
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,960
Do I get to drive that?

765
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,520
"..chain car figure of eight
racing."

766
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,880
- What? - What? - Chain car figure
of eight racing.

767
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,960
Says it right there. What's that?
How do I know?

768
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,600
Let me see those times.
I don't want to do it.

769
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,840
- But you have to. - I don't want to.

770
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,320
- But you have to.
- Well, I don't want to.

771
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,640
- But you have to. - So I have to...
I don't HAVE to do anything!

772
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm sitting in a 1977 Pontiac

773
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,280
wondering why on earth I tried
to win that last challenge,

774
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
cos this is not a prize,
this is a punishment.

775
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,600
Yes! Figure of eight racing -

776
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,920
the greatest motorsport
we'd just heard of.

777
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,760
Three cars chained together

778
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,840
racing around a track
shaped like the number eight.

779
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,400
Which, of course, means a crossover
in the middle.

780
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,640
Better still,
with Harris in the rear car,

781
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,080
only controlling the brakes,

782
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,600
and the middle car
just an empty shell,

783
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,720
the driver in the front car would be
in charge of both the steering

784
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,440
and the acceleration.

785
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,120
So, it was essential that Chris
had a responsible,

786
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,640
safety-conscious team-mate.

787
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,880
SABINE: Hey, buddy!

788
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,880
- Oh, God, no. - Let's smash some stuff!

789
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,880
No, let's not smash some stuff,
Sabine!

790
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,440
Lining up on the grid,

791
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,480
and with Chris still adjusting
to his new role...

792
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,800
Brake, Harris! Yeah.

793
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,920
- Oh, boom. - Sorry.

794
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,760
..Team Top Gear would be
starting at the back of the field.

795
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,960
This is ridiculous, it really is.

796
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,040
One of those cars is a hearse!

797
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,880
Perfect.
SHE LAUGHS

798
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,240
She just sounds demented.

799
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,160
- Woohoo! - It's on!

800
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,640
Go, go, go, go!

801
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,080
Apparently it would be
a six-lap race,

802
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,320
assuming, that is,
they'd last that long.

803
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,640
Whoa, Harris!

804
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,880
What's she doing?

805
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,840
Oh, my God!

806
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,040
- Whoo! - I've been in a car
with Sabine,

807
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,400
and it was one of the scariest
things I've ever done,

808
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
but I think this tops it.

809
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,560
Oh! Ow! Ow!

810
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,960
Nevertheless, by the end of
the first lap,

811
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,840
Sabine had somehow dragged them
up to fifth place.

812
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,960
- Yeah! - You're all right, Chris,
hang in there.

813
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,200
It looks like she knows
what she's doing.

814
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,080
- No, we don't know. - We don't.

815
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,400
But then...

816
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,600
- Oh, my...
- SABINE SCREAMS

817
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,480
Ow!

818
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,680
Whoa!

819
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,120
Scheisse!

820
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,480
Snared up by another chain car,

821
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,000
the rest of the field
started to pull away.

822
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And by the time Sabine
broke them free...

823
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,280
Yeah!

824
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,240
Nice move, Sabine, way to go!

825
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,560
..the rest of the pack
were half a lap ahead.

826
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,000
Which, in figure of eight racing,
is a bit of a problem.

827
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,240
Ow!

828
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,000
Whoo!

829
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,760
Ow! Oh, my God.

830
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,560
This is the worst thing
I've ever done.

831
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,560
Unfortunately for Chris, though,

832
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,360
Sabine is no quitter.

833
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,520
Brake, Harris.

834
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,200
Whoo! Yeah! We got them!

835
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,120
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

836
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,720
Ow! Oh, my God!

837
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,760
And by now, the competition were
having problems of their own.

838
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,840
- Oh! There's a wreck up there.
- Whoa, Harris!

839
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,120
I can't see anything.

840
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,120
This is terrifying.

841
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,400
THEY LAUGH

842
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,680
With two laps to go, Sabine had
clawed them back up to fourth.

843
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,400
But things were about to get uglier.

844
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,160
- Ow! - Chris, where are you?

845
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,800
BLEEP!

846
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,840
Oh, not again.

847
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Ow! This is carnage.

848
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,840
This is awesome!

849
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,360
Entering the final lap,
Sabine could sense a podium finish.

850
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,600
Yeah! I do! I do! I do!

851
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,440
And with just the final corner left,

852
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,040
she'd go through
the hearse to get it.

853
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,080
- On three! - Not through there, Sabine!

854
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,880
Not through there!

855
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
Whoo! Yes!

856
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,840
Push, push, push!

857
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,520
- Yeah! Way to go! Way to go! - Whoo!

858
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,720
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

859
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,640
Yeah! Woohoo!

860
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,240
Chequered flag. You're in third.
Way to go! Way to go! Way to go!

861
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,680
Woohoo! Yee-ha!

862
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,400
SHE LAUGHS

863
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,880
CHRIS GROANS

864
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,000
Chris, good job!
Are you still there?

865
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,560
Just.

866
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,920
You total lunatic.

867
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,440
SHE LAUGHS

868
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,880
With Chris choosing
not to stick around

869
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,960
to see what the prize
for third place was,

870
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,680
we got back on the road.

871
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,440
I think the greatest thing America
has given to planet Earth

872
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,800
is chain car racing. That was great.

873
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
It's one of our proudest moments,
really.

874
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,120
Sensing Chris didn't wholly agree,

875
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,480
and I hate seeing
the little guy upset,

876
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,400
I had an idea to cheer him up.

877
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,480
Hey, you know what?
I've got a game we could play.

878
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,880
It's called Nascar or Nas-can't.

879
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,560
So, I'm going to say a name and you
tell me if it's a real Nascar driver

880
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,840
or just someone that I've made up.

881
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,720
OK?

882
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,560
OK.

883
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,800
How about Lake Speed?

884
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,600
That sounds more like a place
than a person.

885
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,520
That's a real Nascar driver.

886
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,480
Lake Speed is Nascar driver?

887
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,360
Yes, it is. How about Dick Trickle?

888
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,200
THAT'S a real Nascar driver.

889
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,440
He's real, yeah.
OK, here's another one.

890
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,080
- Patty Grossman.
- Yeah, he sounds very Nascar.

891
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,600
That's my mother!

892
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,480
LAUGHTER

893
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,000
With Harris feeling better,
soon we all had a reason to smile.

894
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,600
Because our goal
at the Nevada border...

895
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,480
..was finally within reach.

896
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,400
Oh, I know where we're going.

897
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,360
I think I know where
we're going too.

898
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Yeah...

899
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,240
Where are we going?

900
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,680
I think we're headed to Bonneville.

901
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,160
America's fastest race track.

902
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,360
For over a century,
pilgrims of extreme speed

903
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,400
have been drawn here
from all over the world...

904
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,280
..to 46 square miles of pristine
unbroken salt flats.

905
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,480
This is where the 300,
the 400, the 500,

906
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,560
even the 600mph land speed
barriers were broken.

907
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,160
This...is Bonneville.

908
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,120
I can't believe I'm here.

909
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,280
As we pulled onto the salt, though,

910
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,200
the dry lake bed
did have a bit of a problem.

911
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,880
Oh, no.

912
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,600
Well, this is...moist.

913
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,200
Freak rain had blown in,
flooding the flats

914
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,240
and washing away any chance
of a top speed run.

915
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,000
What the hell?

916
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,080
I'm absolutely gutted.

917
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,240
I've waited 30-odd years
to come to the Mecca of speed

918
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,920
and when I finally get here

919
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,160
it's a lake.

920
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,120
What are we going to do?

921
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,880
Hi.

922
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,920
- How are you? - Good. - Thank you.

923
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,240
- Sorry. - Hey, it's not your fault.

924
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,560
Or is it?

925
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,560
- No, no. - OK. "Chin up.

926
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,280
"Your celebration of V8s
isn't over yet.

927
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,000
"Just up the road is a race track

928
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,320
"where your new final challenge
awaits."

929
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,040
But it's not Bonneville, is it?

930
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,120
Well, yeah, but it's a racetrack, so
at least we'll be able to go fast.

931
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,480
Well, it's got to be
better than this.

932
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,080
Yeah. Come on.

933
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,760
Really? So that was Bonneville?

934
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,760
35 years waiting, and I stand
in front of a puddle and go again.

935
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,280
Well, you can get in if you want.

936
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,520
Gutted.

937
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,600
I suppose I've now got

938
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,560
one of the worst Bonneville stories
of anyone I know.

939
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,880
Rory, how are you feeling about it?

940
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,680
Yeah, I wanted to smash through
that 200mph barrier in this thing,

941
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,440
- but it wasn't to be. - What is
the top speed of that car, Rory?

942
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,920
Just over 200.

943
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
- How about you? - What is it exactly?

944
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,200
200.

945
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,400
So, how exactly were you going to
"smash through" the 200mph barrier?

946
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,640
I was hoping for a bit
of a tailwind.

947
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,880
Good answer.

948
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,560
But then, just up the road...

949
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at this.

950
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,320
..Chris spotted an opportunity.

951
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,320
I'm turning in here.
Follow me in here. Come on.

952
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Dude, the sign says
"no trespassing."

953
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,160
An open gate is an invitation,

954
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,560
and I have an itch to scratch.

955
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,760
Oh, yeah.

956
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,720
We'd stumbled across a very quiet,
very long runway.

957
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,240
This looks great.

958
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,160
All right, so what are we thinking?

959
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,920
- Drag race? - Yes, please!

960
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,760
It's time to let the big dog eat.

961
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,600
Here we go. Here we go.

962
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,680
How much power have you got again?

963
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,560
850 horsepower.

964
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,560
You may have 850, but I want to know
how much you can use in the first

965
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,080
- three gears. - What are you saying?

966
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,640
You can use more of your power
than I can use of mine?

967
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,800
I can use all of my power
in the first three gears.

968
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,760
I don't think you can use
even a small percentage of yours,

969
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,880
and hopefully by the time you get
going, I'm gone.

970
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,120
I'll tell you what, Chris,

971
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,040
you pull out yours and I'll pull out
just enough to beat you.

972
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,760
HE LAUGHS

973
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,480
All right, are we doing this,
or what?

974
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,960
OK, I'll call it. We go on "go."

975
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,320
Three, two...

976
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
..one, go.

977
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,560
Oh, the Jag is gone!

978
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm winning! I'm winning!

979
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,440
Whoo! I'm winning!

980
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,480
OK, no, I'm not.

981
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,960
Bye-bye, Mr Reid.

982
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,400
Where's the yellow car?

983
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,560
That's the one that's worrying me.

984
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,880
There's the red one.

985
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,160
Oh!

986
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,000
OK, 160.

987
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,680
I still can't see the yellow car.

988
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,480
170.

989
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,400
Come on! Hya! Hya! Hya!

990
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,680
199. 201. 203 over the line.

991
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,520
Damn it!

992
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,760
This is the baby McLaren.

993
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,920
This is the Ford Fiesta
of the McLaren range

994
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,960
and it just did 203 and smoked
an 850-horsepower Mustang.

995
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,920
Boy, that McLaren is fast.

996
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,680
So, as we hurried on our way again,

997
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,320
our impromptu drag race
had taught us

998
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,880
that naturally my McLaren
is devastatingly quick,

999
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,240
that Matt's Mustang can't actually
use 850 horsepower,

1000
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,880
and that Rory had his own
unique take on the result.

1001
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,120
Chris and Matt, do you know what
the speed limit is in the UK?

1002
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,160
- Yes. - It's 70mph,

1003
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,360
and I'd like to point out
that in that drag race up to 90mph

1004
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,800
the F-Type SVR was in the lead,

1005
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,880
therefore, in real-world situations,

1006
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,800
this car is quicker than the McLaren

1007
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,240
and an 850-horsepower Mustang.

1008
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,400
Even by your standards, Rory, you're
fumbling around for a false glory.

1009
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,080
No, no, no, no, no. I'm about
300 kilos heavier than that McLaren,

1010
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,520
and about the same thing as that
giant fridge on wheels

1011
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,320
that you're driving. But I think
I acquitted myself pretty well.

1012
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,160
This is a great all-round car.

1013
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,560
Yeah, I think I drove by you

1014
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,880
like you forgot where
the accelerator was.

1015
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,600
Listen, guys, come on, I think this
car did surprise you a little bit.

1016
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,280
You might look at
this car and think,

1017
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,560
it's no McLaren, it's no Hennessy,
but it's hanging in there.

1018
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,960
I wasn't thinking that, no.

1019
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,480
THEY LAUGH

1020
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,960
And before Rory could come up with
more ways

1021
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,320
in which his Jag wasn't as quick,

1022
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,160
we reached our V8s'
new final playground.

1023
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,440
I see flags. I see flags.

1024
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,400
Yeah, I see grandstands.
I see grandstands.

1025
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,920
Could this be the scene of another
McLaren victory? I hear you ask.

1026
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,960
Could this be the scene of another
McLaren victory? I hear you...

1027
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,360
Now we're talking.

1028
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Whoo!

1029
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,440
Look at the view.

1030
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,120
Oh, yeah, look at that!

1031
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,800
That is a GT40.

1032
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,840
- Yeah. - That is beautiful.

1033
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,160
Yes, the GT40.

1034
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,000
1960s icon,

1035
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,560
and ground-breaking,
Ferrari-beating,

1036
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,040
Le Mans-winning masterpiece.

1037
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,120
That is a legendary V8, right there.

1038
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,360
Hey, how are you? Oh, cool.
Right on, thank you.

1039
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,200
"For your final challenge,
you will now take on

1040
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,920
"one of the greatest V8s
of all time." That's true.

1041
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,400
That is really true. Which won't
be a problem, I don't think,

1042
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,520
because we've got more power,
better brakes, better...

1043
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,680
Uh-oh. That changes things.

1044
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,960
Does he have the correct visa?

1045
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,560
Is he allowed to be here?

1046
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,680
Unfortunately, he was.

1047
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,920
That is a magnificent sound.

1048
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,960
Wow.

1049
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,760
The Stig would set a time
for six laps of the circuit,

1050
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,240
a time which we would have to
then beat as a team.

1051
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,320
Pros and cons.

1052
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,880
We have more power,
more modern tyres and brakes.

1053
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,520
- Cons... - He has him. - Yeah.

1054
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,800
And all too soon,
Stig's six laps were up.

1055
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,520
10 minutes 11.4.

1056
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,960
OK, that's the combined time
to beat.

1057
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,680
So, to pit our V8s against the GT40

1058
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,240
we'd be running a relay
of two laps each.

1059
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,320
And with a standing start
for the first leg,

1060
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,280
we needed the best car for
pure off-the-line acceleration.

1061
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,120
All right, Rory, are you ready?

1062
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,840
Never been readier.

1063
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,000
Three, two...

1064
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,920
..one, go!

1065
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,880
Whoo!

1066
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,840
Sounds quick.

1067
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,880
All-wheel drive...

1068
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,440
..for the win.

1069
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,800
Spot your apex, Reid.
Spot your apex.

1070
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,640
There she is.

1071
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,480
On that power. Oh, that's good.

1072
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,680
So good.

1073
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,920
The engine is still making noise.

1074
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,640
- That's a good sign. - This means
that he's not rolled it.

1075
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,320
Yes! Yes!

1076
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,360
Oh, that's messy, Reid.
Come on, tidier, tidier.

1077
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,320
All right, so, I need
a 1:42 average lap time.

1078
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,320
- Yeah, he's kind of missed that one.
- He's overcooked that one.

1079
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,920
Oh, no, this is looking like a 1:45.

1080
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,960
Argh!

1081
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,160
- Focus, Rory. Focus. Focus. Focus.
- I'm focusing! I'm focusing!

1082
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,760
Come on, Rory. Here he comes.

1083
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,600
You should get in the car, maybe.

1084
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,320
- Oh. - I don't know if this
is good enough.

1085
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,720
I don't know.

1086
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,160
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

1087
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,200
- Here we go. - Come on.

1088
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,800
Go, go, go, go, go!

1089
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,880
Push, Harris! Push!

1090
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,920
Two laps down,
and Rory's run in the Jag

1091
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,880
had left us six seconds
off the pace.

1092
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,960
To beat the GT40...

1093
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,760
Smooth, Chris. Smooth!

1094
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,000
..Chris and his McLaren
needed their A-game.

1095
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,960
This is a car that was doing 200mph
in a straight line

1096
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,640
but it's now agile and fast here.

1097
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh, good line through there. Nice.

1098
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,640
Nice! Nice!

1099
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,840
Just floor it.

1100
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,160
Push, push, push!

1101
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,840
OK, that's a 1:38.

1102
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,160
- We've got a shot here.
- OK, that's good.

1103
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,120
I'm buying us some time now.

1104
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,120
Now just three seconds behind...

1105
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,680
All right, Chris, one more clean
one. One more clean one.

1106
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,840
..we were back in the hunt.

1107
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,840
OK, we're at 5:58, 5:59,
six minutes.

1108
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,720
Chris, come on. Push, push, push!

1109
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,400
Let's do it for America.
Don't let me down, girl.

1110
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,240
Go on, Matt. Go on, Matt.

1111
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,080
Come on, Matt. Launch it!

1112
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,640
All right, here we go. Here we go.

1113
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,800
This was it, the last leg.

1114
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,960
And however this tribute to the
greatest of all engines would end...

1115
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,280
..at least one thing was certain.

1116
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,240
That's it. That's the stuff.

1117
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:38,040
The V8 engine is a fighter, and one
that still packs a serious punch.

1118
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,800
- Where are we at? - 7:30. 7:30.

1119
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,320
- Are we ahead of time, or..?
- We're on the edge.

1120
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,960
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1121
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,080
Come on.

1122
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,320
Oh, it's got so much freaking power.

1123
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,520
Come on!

1124
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,480
All right, last lap.

1125
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,440
He's got to do the lap of his life.

1126
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,760
Come on, Mustang!

1127
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,440
Come on, LeBlanc, give it your best.
I want your best.

1128
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,000
Come on, Matt. Push!

1129
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,400
There we go. Come on.

1130
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,480
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1131
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,720
OK, here we go.

1132
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,880
Come on!

1133
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1134
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,840
So, the big question -

1135
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,640
did our exquisite array of
state-of-the-art V8 sports cars

1136
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,360
open up a can of whupass
on the old days?

1137
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,000
Well, we'll never know.
OK, on next week's show...

1138
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,440
- Hold on, Matthew. - What? What?

1139
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,400
- What? - You've got to give them
the answer.

1140
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,360
No, I don't got to give them
the answer.

1141
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,040
That's why they're here.
They want to know the times.

1142
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,440
Come on! Yes.

1143
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,040
OK, fine.

1144
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,440
We were two seconds slower.

1145
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,360
And I'm very disappointed
in you, Chris.

1146
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,120
- I was quicker than him. - Yeah, but
I don't expect anything from him.

1147
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,160
What?! OK, that's fair.

1148
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,760
- Fine. - Yeah. - But what
we're telling the viewers

1149
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,040
is that the best V8 sports car
money can buy

1150
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,560
is a 50-year-old V8 sports car
that's not actually for sale?

1151
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,120
Exactly, yeah.

1152
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,840
And on that essential piece
of consumer advice

1153
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,080
we must end the show.

1154
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,200
- See you next week. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
