1
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello and welcome to a Top Gear special.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,720
That is Resolute, the most northerly town in Canada, in the Arctic Circle.

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,400
We're here to have a race.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,560
400 miles over mostly frozen ocean in that direction to the North Pole.

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,320
I shall be travelling using husky dogs, sledge and skis.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm gonna try and beat him in a car.

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,480
That's never been done before.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,120
No-one has ever tried to drive to the North Pole.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,760
Here's why.

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,400
On the way, he would encounter ice boulders as big as cathedrals.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Polar bears the size of hatchbacks, temperatures that would freeze the fuel in his tank,

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
and, if Al Gore is to be believed,

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,320
open water into which he would sink.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,960
Victory, then, would be mine.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,360
Time to meet my team.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,240
The engines powering me to the Pole would be ten husky dogs.

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,520
Where the car would crash through the thin ice,

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,720
they'd be fine.

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,600
Driving them would be Matty McNair, one of the world's leading sled dog explorers and racers.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,720
The dogs have been living here for 4,000 years.

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,280
They can go through anything - cold, blizzard.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,240
I have a lead dog that can go through hard packed ice.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
He figures out a good route.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
So that's terrain, weather - they're made for it.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,120
I've just been weed on!

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Did they have to wee on me?!

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
They're fast!

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,280
To beat the human lamppost, I would be using, a Toyota pickup truck.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,400
It's a tough old bird this

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,960
but for the trip to the Pole, it had been sent to Iceland,

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,880
for a few modifications.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,120
The biggest change, apart from the gun, obviously,

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,200
are the enormous wheels - Cuban wheels, I like to call them.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,960
They give it extra height.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,040
The tyres are hand-made - cost Â£2,500 each.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,800
They are so vast that the front suspension has been moved forwards

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,520
otherwise you wouldn't be able to open the door.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,040
Other changes - it's got heavy-duty diffs, heavy-duty suspension,

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,800
it's got a sump guard about that thick in case we hit a pretty much solid piece of ice.

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,840
At the front, I insisted it was fitted with these spotlamps,

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,480
although that might have been unnecessary, since it's currently 11.30pm

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
and this is as dark as it ever gets.

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,680
Inside, there was marine satellite navigation

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,760
and underneath, a long-range fuel tank filled with a freeze-resistant mixture of diesel and avgas.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,920
All I need to complete the picture is a guide and a navigator.

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,120
Richard Hammond has been given Matty McNair, one of the world's leading Arctic experts.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,240
Me. I've been given him.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,240
Can I make it clear now that I'm only here because the producer said I had to be. I don't like snow.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,080
I hate being cold. I hate outdoor pursuits.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
I hate the idea that I've got to "push my body to find the limit."

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,880
I can't stand this stupid clothing that makes this rustling noise.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,000
I hate the zips and the toggles and all the pockets and that.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,280
- And I hate your stupid truck. 
- Listen, if we make it,

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,000
you will be the first person to go to the North Pole who DIDN'T want to be there.

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
DOGS BARK

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,320
We have the right tools for the job, which just left us.

57
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
We're not what you'd call polar explorers.

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,920
So earlier in the year, we'd been sent to a cold-weather training camp in the Austrian Alps.

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,880
We were put in the hands of some Arctic experts who showed us what salami was and

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,320
how to put an anorak on.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,600
To be honest, our minds kept wandering.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,080
- There WAS a man who ate a car once. 
- Was it that bloke who hate everything?

63
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,720
Then, a doctor snapped us to attention.

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,480
- Your foreskin has been frostbitten. 
- Right.

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,880
Shall we go straight to the frozen penis?

66
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
ALL: Aarrghh!

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,960
- He'd been walking with it hanging out of his trousers.
- With your willy hanging out?
- Why?

68
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,160
- It comes down to organisation.
- Good job he didn't do it on the London Underground. He'd be arrested.

69
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
On public transport with it out...

70
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,160
The doctor moved on to how we'd do our number twos.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,440
You've got to be quick.

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,440
- We've nearly missed entire programmes...
- Sometimes, Top Gear is delayed by an hour.

73
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,280
I get the runs, especially if I go abroad, which the North Pole is.

74
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,080
- Doctors say better out than in. 
- That's not true of your penis in minus 50.

75
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,680
Essentials for the Arctic crap.

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,760
- Take your bog roll and your gun with you.
- Take your gun with you?
- To the loo?
- Absolutely

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,600
Bears love to creep up on you when you're taking a crap.

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,880
That's not sporting of them.

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,600
The next day, it was time for outdoor training. To be honest, it was freezing

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,680
so we went for a coffee instead.

81
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,040
If it's like this when we get to the Pole...

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,160
We should cross that bridge when we get to it.

83
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,240
How can you practise being cold?

84
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Snow is snow. There's no point going out there catching our death.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,360
You wouldn't be able to go - you'd have a cold.

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,560
Eventually, though, the weather cleared,

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
and I gave May and Hammond their first ever skiing lesson.

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,440
I can't go because of the wind...

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,560
Richard, in particular, would spend a lot of time skiing beside his dogs.

90
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Aarghh!

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,920
- Keep them so that the tips are like that...
- Aargh! 
- Don't worry about him.

92
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,760
You need to go more downhill or level your skis out.

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,400
- If I go more downhill, I'll slip! 
- James wasn't much better.

94
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,720
Just put them on. I'm coming down here otherwise I'll fall over.

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,640
It's the same here as it is there.

96
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,440
Push off and kick this arse out of the skis with your heel.

97
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,360
- Don't cross them.
- Aarghh! Thanks a bunch!

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,480
- It's taken me 20 minutes to get there!
- We can go together.
- I've got only one ski on.

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,880
Progress was painfully slow.

100
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
It's not on.

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,640
Aarrghh!

102
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,480
Oh, God! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

103
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,680
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

104
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,720
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
Sorry!

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
Right.

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,240
We've done... See where we've come from?

108
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Yeah.

109
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,520
- 30, 40 yards and you've got 400 miles to ski.
- Jeremy...

110
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,640
We were then taught how to erect a tent.

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,360
Our instructor was a former special forces soldier who arrived with a pixelated face.

112
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
He was very bossy.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,680
We can do it now or four o'clock in the morning.

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,560
The only good thing is it can't possibly be colder in the Arctic.

115
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,120
You have to push it. You've got it stuck in here. You have to get out...

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,320
- I didn't break it. 
- Who broke the elastic then?

117
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,280
The man with the funny face was getting more and more irritated.

118
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I've just had a brilliant idea. Why don't we just tow a caravan?

119
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,200
James, feed it through.

120
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,840
Put your foot on that.

121
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,280
Put your foot on there.

122
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,680
If this blows away, it's game over.

123
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,160
There's no, "We'll just get another tent."

124
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,240
It's a case of this tent is it.

125
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Go on, catch it.

126
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,000
You haven't got that end put in.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
These are packed with ice.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,040
HE LAUGHS

129
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,560
Take it back to where we're putting the tent up.

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,640
Finally, quite a bit later, the tent was up.

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,400
- It's...
- I think you can sleep in it.

132
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,240
WIND HOWLS

133
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
Sadly, our ordeal was not yet over.

134
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,320
The man with the ruined face was going to show us how it would feel

135
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
to fall through the polar ice.

136
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,240
In your own time, I want all three of you to jump in.

137
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,560
- What's the problem?
- Hang on.

138
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,760
At the Pole, we'd all three be standing with safety harnesses on...

139
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,840
It's a silly test. I'm not doing it.

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,800
The point of this is that you have to be able to take your clothes off and put more clothes on again.

141
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,960
I can practise that in the hotel room.

142
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,600
You've got a tingling down your arm...

143
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Pull yourself out. Come on, put some effort in!

144
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,360
You don't want to stay in there all day. Drop the pole.

145
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,960
- How dare you... 
- Hands above your head!

146
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,840
Hands above your head!

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,960
OK, roll in the snow, roll in the snow.

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,440
- Roll in the snow! 
- Roll in the snow, Jeremy.

149
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,400
That'll make it much better, rather than a big, pink, fluffy towel.

150
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,120
- That looked awful.
- I'm staggered.

151
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,280
Do you know what, though?

152
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,880
I like to think of us as a unit on Top Gear,

153
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
and as a unit, we've done that test.

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,520
'Our instructors were not impressed with that theory,

155
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,240
'and decided we needed our heads banging together.

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,600
'So they drafted in the legendary Arctic explorer, Sir Ranulph Fiennes.'

157
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,400
The problem we have

158
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,880
is that we can't really get into our heads

159
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,840
that this is a particularly dangerous place to go.

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
But you think it is.

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,600
I don't think it is, I know that it can be

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,280
because of what's happened to me in that area over the last 36 years.

163
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,080
You will have the polar bear problem,

164
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,440
you will have the ignorance problem,

165
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,680
cos you lot are apparently ignorant,

166
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,920
and thirdly,

167
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,840
the fact that you will all start hating each other

168
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,360
because of the extreme cold having an effect...

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,840
The hatred is very real.

170
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,120
You don't want to laugh about it.

171
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,280
'Then we moved on to frostbite.

172
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,600
'He showed us what had happened to his hand

173
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,400
'after it had been immersed in polar water for just a few moments.

174
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,320
Have a look at that - that's my left hand.

175
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
So, eventually,

176
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,040
all those red areas were amputated.

177
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,680
That is... If you look at the proper hand there,

178
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,600
you can see how much is missing and froze off.

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,520
That was a three-minute mistake.

180
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,680
If we were in the car, say, went through a hole into the ice

181
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,440
and you fell in the water at that temperature,

182
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,200
what are the chances of survival?

183
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,040
If your whole body fell in

184
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,720
and the car had gone in and your tent had gone in,

185
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,280
cos you presumably stow that in the car,

186
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,480
you could probably survive for, if there was no wind, hours.

187
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,960
But I'd prefer in those circumstances

188
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,280
to go quickly rather than slowly, really.

189
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,880
Back in Resolute, I was glad I'd had the talk from Ranulph,

190
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,240
but not so glad that I'd had a skiing lesson from Clarkson.

191
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,560
- What?
- You're not very good.

192
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,520
Because you taught me the wrong kind of skiing!

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,640
You may as well have taught me to play the banjo!

194
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,640
DOGS BARK 'And as zero hour approached,

195
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,960
'I was also struggling to bond with the dogs.'

196
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,760
Ah, there's a pile of poo there!

197
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,720
Mind you, Clarkson wasn't doing much better with his snow driving.

198
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,840
Er...

199
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,720
'And James was rubbish with a shotgun.'

200
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,280
Woah!

201
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,720
And then, to make matters worse, we met the local weatherman.

202
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,080
My colleague here is convinced we're going to fall through the ice.

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
Have you seen on the map...?

204
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,120
- You're going to this island.
- OK.

205
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,320
Now, that's all frozen to a depth of nine feet.

206
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,960
- Not all of it is frozen. 
- There you go!

207
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,800
The problem is,

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,840
we know only so much about that region,

209
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,040
and you are exploring that region at an incredible speed.

210
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
How safe is it up there?

211
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,200
With a car it's a total unknown.

212
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,840
There's all kinds of dangers waiting for you,

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,840
and you don't see that the ice is just a few centimetres thick.

214
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,440
- It wouldn't look any different from the top.
- Yes.

215
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
That's what gets most people.

216
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,160
I just wanted Richard to see it.

217
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,000
This was a man who attempted to go to the North Pole on a sledge.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,440
People go to the Pole all the time on sledges, don't they?

219
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,440
- And he's being eaten. 
- He's giving him a cuddle.

220
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,520
Zero hour, and even though our talent was small

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,440
and the dangers ahead were plainly immense,

222
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
we were looking forward to the off.

223
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
Well, two of us were.

224
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,920
- Look at that awful expanse of misery.
- Are you cold?

225
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,320
- No.
- Are we falling through the ice?
- Not yet.

226
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,240
- Well, cheer up.
- How far have we gone?
- We haven't set off.

227
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,280
Quite.

228
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
WHIP CRACKS

229
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
DOGS BARK

230
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,480
- Who do you think's gonna win? 
- We're all gonna die.

231
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,480
GUNSHOT

232
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
- Let's go to the Pole.
- Go!

233
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
I can't believe it.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm going to the Pole with a dog team.

235
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,400
HE LAUGHS

236
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
- Hang on, stop.
- What?

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,560
Stop.

238
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh, and they're stuck. They're stuck.

239
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Forgot the gloves.

240
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,760
Give me strength.

241
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,000
I knew he was gonna be bad on this trip.

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,120
I didn't know he'd be THIS bad.

243
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,320
Hurry up!

244
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,760
Don't go in now. Here we go.

245
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,360
- CAR HORN HONKS 
- Yeah!

246
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,920
JEREMY LAUGHS

247
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,880
You're such a pikey.

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
Gently.

249
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,800
No gently.

250
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,840
There's no time for gently now cos you forgot your gloves.

251
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
HONKS HORN

252
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,400
So here we are going further north than any car had been before.

253
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,480
Riding on a thin crust of ice over an ocean 1,500 feet deep.

254
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,960
Just us - a film crew, two Icelandic mechanics and a soldier.

255
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,560
An insignificant nine-man blot

256
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,280
in the pristine white vastness.

257
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
- How far have we gone? 
- Three kilometres.
- Three?
- Yes.

258
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,480
And it's taken us three minutes? See, James,

259
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,400
I said we'd be there in no time.

260
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
This won't last, this sunny sky,

261
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
smooth snow.

262
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,520
- Yes, it will.
- It won't. 
- It will.
- It won't.

263
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,120
Ow!

264
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,960
But it did last.

265
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,920
The sky stayed blue, the ice stayed smooth

266
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,560
and we opened up a huge lead over Team Dog.

267
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,280
It's the third time, I've told Matty...

268
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,200
This is only the third time I've had skis on my feet.

269
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,240
It's really hard.

270
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,560
I know lots of people ski these days but I grew up on Birmingham.

271
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,480
The car had disappeared into the distance,

272
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,000
but Matty told me the hare

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,880
would be unstuck by ice that was too thick or drowned

274
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,520
by ice that was too thin

275
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,320
and that the tortoise would then take the lead. I wasn't so sure.

276
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,360
Oh hell!

277
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,960
BLEEP!

278
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
HE GROANS

279
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,000
With things going so well for us,

280
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,760
I tried to get James to buy into our expedition.

281
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,960
I admire Hammond for doing what he's doing, I admire Arctic explorers,

282
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,360
but I think the time has come to say, let's see how easily we could get to the top of Everest.

283
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Let's see how easily we could get to the North Pole.

284
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,680
I think we could forge a career as the world's worst explorers.

285
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,360
Surprisingly, James was ahead of me on that one.

286
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,400
- What would make it nice is a gin and tonic. Don't you think?
- Yes.

287
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,080
I'd like a gin and tonic.

288
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,120
- I can't have one because we're in the Arctic Ocean.
- I'll make one.

289
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
What?

290
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,160
HE LAUGHS

291
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,120
- You've got gin!
- I have.

292
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,000
And we're in international waters so there are no drink-driving laws.

293
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,160
Have you got the ice?

294
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,400
That's a stupid question, isn't it?

295
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,240
Will you slow down while I slice the lemon for the gin and tonic?

296
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,720
Now THIS is Arctic exploration.

297
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,320
CAR HORN HONKS

298
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,440
Please don't write to us about drinking and driving because I am not driving, I am sailored.

299
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,480
Cheers.

300
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,920
HMS G&T ploughed on

301
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,560
and although we occasionally got stuck,

302
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,440
our Icelandic mechanic showed me a neat trick

303
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,360
for getting going again.

304
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,800
So you rock it gently

305
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,920
and scoop a tiny bit of snow with each rock.

306
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,880
Woah! Woah, woah, woah!

307
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,680
Good boy.

308
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,920
Our target was five to six miles an hour but on the first day

309
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,680
we hadn't done anything like that.

310
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Been on the go ten hours.

311
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,880
We've done 36 miles. Not good.

312
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,280
Not good news.

313
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,120
The problem is, we're standing on sea ice.

314
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,320
It means it has salt in it so it's incredibly grippy.

315
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,920
The sledge can hardly move.

316
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,720
I've been skiing for nine and a half hours of those ten.

317
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm broken.

318
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,880
James and I had problems too.

319
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
We couldn't kip in the car

320
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,200
in case it fell through the ice while we fell asleep.

321
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,680
So we had to build a tent.

322
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,120
Everything about tenting is designed to make your life

323
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,600
just a bit more difficult than it need be. I would dearly like

324
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,160
to meet the man who designed this and took it to his boss

325
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,920
and said, "Sir, I've made a bed!"

326
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,480
Because...you take this piece of elastic off...

327
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,080
It just isn't a bed.

328
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,160
It's just half a mattress, look.

329
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,880
You roll it out like that...

330
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,920
..and then...you've got to go back and get the other one.

331
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,280
I mean, why didn't his boss just say to him,

332
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,440
"Jenkins, you imbecile, it's not a bed, it's rubbish!"

333
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,200
Everything's crap!

334
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,440
DOGS HOWL

335
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
Morning.

336
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,800
This is what I wake up to every morning.

337
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,920
Frost.

338
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,160
All over my sleeping bag, it's frozen.

339
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,880
I took my balaclava off cos it had frozen all round

340
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,880
where I was breathing through it in my tent with the floor made of snow.

341
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,800
With us, of course, things were more civilised.

342
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,680
As you know, what I'm trying to do with this mission

343
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,280
is prove that Arctic exploration needn't be tough.

344
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,000
Which brings me onto the delicate question of number twos.

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
You see, what a traditional polar explorer would do

346
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,800
is simply go out there and squat down...like an animal.

347
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,600
What I've done though is fitted this bumper dumper

348
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,960
into the tow bar attachment and now I will try it out.

349
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,800
Ooh-wooh! That's nippy.

350
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,200
James, meanwhile, was on guard duty.

351
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,640
HE COCKS GUN

352
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,360
James, are you showing off or are you actually looking for bears?

353
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,720
Cos I can't run.

354
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,280
Oh, Bartlett, not on the ropes!

355
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
- Matty?
- Yeah?

356
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,920
How many poos a day do these dogs need to have?

357
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,840
SHE LAUGHS I'd say two.

358
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
It's ten.

359
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,480
It's ten each at least.

360
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,560
Sometimes I'd look forward to the sledge bogging down

361
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,280
so I could get out of the poo stream and run alongside.

362
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,800
Take it up.

363
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
Meanwhile, James was breaking out the elevenses.

364
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,040
Chocolate bars.

365
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,560
Ooh, chocolate, yes.

366
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,080
Look, that one is called Big.

367
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,720
- I'll have one.
- Have a Big.

368
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,840
We should say, if you're watching this, this is not gluttony.

369
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,680
We have genuinely been told by our experts that if you are trekking

370
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,480
across the Arctic, you need 5,000 calories a day

371
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,480
so we're only too happy to shove that much in.

372
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm not certain

373
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,560
when they told us we needed 5,000 calories a day

374
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,840
that we weren't in a slightly warm car sitting down

375
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,280
but better to be safe.

376
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,160
After our morning snack,

377
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,960
James found my Jesus.

378
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,920
Why have you brought Jesus?

379
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,920
- What?
- Why have you brought Jesus?

380
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,720
The Jesus, I thought, could sit in the car

381
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,600
and guide us in our hours of need if we ever have one.

382
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,080
- It's a Jesus action figure.
- Yes.

383
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,600
- There's a map on the back to guide us.
- To Galilee?

384
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,040
I was now back on the skis and starting to get

385
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,520
the hang of it.

386
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,240
Today, Richard,

387
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,320
- you've got to learn how to pee on the move.
- Pee on the move?
- Yeah.

388
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,160
Watch out.

389
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,080
I'm not on. Matty!

390
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,000
We, meanwhile, had reached the vast, uninhabited wilderness of Bathurst Island

391
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,760
and we were going, if anything, even faster.

392
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,080
Our lead over Hammond kept getting bigger and bigger.

393
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,280
He's the plucky Brit, and like all plucky Brits, he'll come in second.

394
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,080
But at this point, he had other things on his mind.

395
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,480
Around in this area,

396
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,120
seals make little houses, known locally as aglus,

397
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,320
and they raise their pups in there all warm and safe.

398
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,280
Unless a polar bear smashes its way in

399
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,720
which is what's happened here...obviously.

400
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,640
Oh look,

401
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
there's its jaw bone

402
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
with some teeth in it

403
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
and that's, er, the rest of the bits of seal

404
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,240
the polar bear didn't fancy that day.

405
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,880
Maybe it was full.

406
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,920
I hope it still is.

407
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,520
On Bathurst, we got bogged down in the deepest snow we'd encountered so far.

408
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,760
But it wasn't a problem because the Icelandics had another trick up their sleeves.

409
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,160
They told us to let nearly all the air out of the tyres.

410
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,600
- How's that?
- Brilliant.

411
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,880
We should explain. Four pounds per square inch in the tyres,

412
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,400
we'd normally run with 28 or 30 in the normal road car.

413
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,120
Four makes the tyres almost nearly flat so we're more flobbery,

414
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,400
you have a wider area touching the, um...snow and ice. That's the plan.

415
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,360
Once on firmer ground, we had to put air back in the tyres.

416
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,520
But that was OK because the car had an onboard pump.

417
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,360
If only we'd had a pump for our stupid tent.

418
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,680
- How
- BLEEP
- monstrous is this?

419
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,280
It's beyond... It's not normal.

420
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,120
I was now over 50 miles behind, but Matty had come up with a plan.

421
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,360
We know we haven't got the edge on speed, so we need to use tactics.

422
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,120
This is what we're going to do. It's now about 8pm.

423
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,600
We've run all day. We've made brilliant progress.

424
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,680
We'll put these guys to bed, we've chained them up. They'll have a sleep.

425
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,840
They'll only do so for about three hours,

426
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,080
then we'll get up again and then we can run at night.

427
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,400
The dogs prefer it. They love the colder temperatures, cos they can run faster.

428
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,040
And so, in the early hours of the morning,

429
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,280
when the temperature had dropped to minus 35,

430
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,400
we roused the dogs and ran.

431
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,600
The silence is beautiful.

432
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,240
'Then, suddenly...'

433
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
Oh! Oh, no!

434
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,320
DOGS BARK

435
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,480
I think it caught our scent earlier on in the day,

436
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,640
followed our tracks, but whether or not it's just hanging around,

437
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,800
and picked up the scent now as it comes downwind.

438
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,640
As I was pinned down by the bear, Team G&T were getting away.

439
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,600
Clarkson!

440
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,840
I know it's you, you insufferable oaf!

441
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm on the bloody throne!

442
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
We ate up the miles...

443
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,600
..and discussed how we'd celebrate when we made the Pole.

444
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,680
So, of all the things you could have brought,

445
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,000
champagne, whatever it might be,

446
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
you've brought a tin of Spam?

447
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
Yes.

448
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,760
And then we, too, encountered a bear.

449
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,520
Oh, it's got babies!

450
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,800
Sweet!

451
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,400
Not being Attenborough,

452
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,120
I couldn't think of anything else to say!

453
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,680
BEAR GROWLS

454
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,480
So we set off and, with a bit of divine guidance...

455
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,920
'I am the vine, you are the branches.

456
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,840
'If a man remains in me, and I in him,

457
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,000
'he will bear much fruit.'

458
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,960
We made it uneaten to the other side of the island.

459
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,160
I mean, look at that.

460
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,840
That's not bad, is it?

461
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,720
Absolutely astonishing.

462
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,280
Can I spoil it for you by...?

463
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,680
I've been running all day, all night,

464
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,960
and now it's day, or night,

465
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,600
and I've got to sleep.

466
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm confused.

467
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,800
My body clock's broken.

468
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,120
Our progress was so good, I decided to find out

469
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,280
what Hammond was making such a fuss about.

470
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,000
# Round, round, get around I get around

471
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
- # Get around 
- Whoo-hoo

472
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
# I get around

473
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
- # I get around 
- Get around, round, round... #

474
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,400
This is brilliant!

475
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,720
# ..I get around... #

476
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,080
Yeah!

477
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,640
- MUSIC STOPS 
- Oh, hang on...

478
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Guys!

479
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,680
Can you bring a car to tow us out?

480
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,000
First time at the wheel, James has managed to put it, basically, into the sea!

481
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,520
That is seawater.

482
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,160
If this car goes through, it's game over.

483
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,200
The car was sinking...

484
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,240
but luckily the Icelandics had another trick up their sleeve -

485
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,720
a bungee rope.

486
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,240
The tow car would set off at a huge speed,

487
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,080
building energy in the elasticated rope,

488
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,680
which would then pull our stricken car gently but firmly out of the slush.

489
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,360
- OK, Hal, are you ready?
- Yes!

490
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,280
ENGINE REVS

491
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,160
It was brilliant.

492
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,400
Thank God for that!

493
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,120
We were free, but for the first time, James and I had real problems.

494
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,600
We'd been warned before we set off

495
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,840
that constant tidal movement weakens the ice where it meets the shore.

496
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,800
They told us not to drive near the coast,

497
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,160
but how do you avoid them

498
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,960
when you're in a fjord?

499
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Look how narrow it is here. It can't be more than a mile, if that.

500
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,400
They say don't go near the coasts...

501
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,200
- And we can't NOT go near the coasts. 
- We can't not go near the coasts.

502
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,760
To make things worse, the ice here was perilously thin.

503
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,880
LOUD CRUNCHING

504
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,160
Look, it's just completely covered in cracks.

505
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,520
We're facing a problem.

506
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,920
There is no other way through here.

507
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,960
- I mean, that's a cliff. 
- It's a sheer cliff that way.

508
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,840
We cannot go on the land.

509
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,600
If we go back,

510
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,680
the only way we can go is all the way back to Resolute, giving up.

511
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,200
Based on no knowledge at all, we decided to push on

512
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,880
in our three-tonne truck.

513
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,520
- It's blue.
- I know.

514
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,320
- Looking at the ocean.
- I know.

515
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,520
If we went through the ice, our only chance of escape

516
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,280
would be to smash the glass.

517
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,920
- See, I don't like the look of that bit.
- I don't either, but if we go...

518
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,800
CRUNCHING

519
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,960
BLEEP

520
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,080
- This is
- BLEEP
- scary.

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,680
As it dawned on us

522
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,240
the nearest hospital was 1,500 miles away,

523
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,880
and the nearest rescue helicopter even further than that,

524
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,600
we began to understand the danger of where we were

525
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
and what we were doing.

526
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,080
- If we go in here, we're dead, aren't we?
- Yep.

527
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
I mean, dead.

528
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,240
It went on like this for mile after mile.

529
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,560
We just drove over here and the whole thing's collapsed.

530
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,960
That's nothing.

531
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,400
Look.

532
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,800
Mercifully, though, the ice eventually thickened.

533
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,040
But we were still in all kinds of trouble,

534
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,960
because we knew from pilots who'd flown overhead

535
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,880
we were about to enter a massive ice boulder field,

536
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,400
and we'd been told we wouldn't have a hope of getting through it.

537
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,480
That night, for once, it was James trying to cheer me up.

538
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,200
- Tomorrow, we hit the boulder field, OK?
- Quail's egg?

539
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,440
Ooh, lovely. Got any celery salt?

540
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
So we've got a choice.

541
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,880
We can go west, where it's new ice, which is likely to be jaggedy,

542
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,200
- or we can go straight on or east, which will be old ice, which is terrifying.
- Yes.

543
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,400
- We'll be down to two miles a DAY going through that way. 
- Pate de foie gras?

544
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,880
I know it's cruel, but I really do like it.

545
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,040
So, which do you prefer?

546
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,240
Or this is a 24-month-old Parmigiano. Stravecchio, in fact.

547
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,840
That should be superb.

548
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,160
- Anyway, go on, the ice?
- We're likely to be down to two miles a DAY.

549
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,160
We have to make this decision. Tomorrow, we should leave fairly early.

550
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,560
What would those salmon eggs go really well with?

551
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,000
Well...

552
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,440
a crisp white,

553
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,840
but we can dream...

554
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,240
Like a Chablis, really.

555
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,480
Yes. So, do we get...

556
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,960
NO!

557
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,160
No! James!

558
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,200
JEREMY GASPS

559
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,560
Look what he's got - wine!

560
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,160
I haven't had any for days!

561
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,920
I knew you'd like that.

562
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,520
A week in Resolute and three days on the ice, and just surviving on only gin!

563
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,200
WIND HOWLS

564
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,080
Over at Team Dog, we were covering good ground

565
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,320
with the night-time running.

566
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,880
But I was getting knackered.

567
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,040
It's weird the way being very tired affects you.

568
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,640
Today, privately, whilst being towed along by the sledge,

569
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
I had a little weep.

570
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,400
I haven't done that for years.

571
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
And, out here,

572
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,560
the tears cause moisture in your ski goggles,

573
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,440
and it froze on the inside,

574
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,920
so I couldn't see.

575
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,480
So then I had something to cry about!

576
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,040
After just two hours' sleep, though, the dogs were raring to go.

577
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,680
DOGS BARK LOUDLY

578
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,600
Out, Tamar!

579
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,520
Get out!

580
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,680
Don't touch him. If he's scared, he'll bite anybody.

581
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,520
Today, it would be a killer getting over the mountains,

582
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,640
and Matty's never-ending bonhomie was starting to grate.

583
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,480
Nothing like a couple of hours' sleep to bring your morale up. Hup, hup!

584
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,680

585
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Oh, God, what's he doing?

586
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,960
Ohh.

587
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,000
Where's my tea, Clarkson?

588
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,400
That's from trying to defrost our foie gras.

589
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,240
I put it on the fire and the tin all went manky.

590
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,440
Can you open the fire-lighters?

591
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,040
OK, I'll race you.

592
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,920
STOVE SQUEAKS

593
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,760
I knew we were in for a tough day and was impatient to get going.

594
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,280
Very unfunny!

595
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,920
Idiot!

596
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,400
My iPod has stopped working. My little camera doesn't work.

597
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,800
My radio transmitter for my microphone outside the car doesn't work.

598
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,120
Everything is being ruined by the cold,

599
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,840
and yet the car and everything on it is still working fine.

600
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,080
It's...

601
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,320
It is remarkable.

602
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,840
Which was good, because soon it came face to face with this...

603
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,520
This is what we'd been warned about -

604
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,960
a massive boulder field, full of smashed-up blocks of ice,

605
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,160
some the size of houses.

606
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,960
How the hell did nature come up with that?

607
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,760
This is the absolute definition of the chaos theory.

608
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,400
However, as we were 90 miles ahead of Hammond,

609
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,400
and we had no idea about the horrors that lay ahead,

610
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,160
we entered in good spirits.

611
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,280
Look at it! Look at that!

612
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,080
It's all those Star Trek scenes,

613
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,120
you know, in Star Trek, when they land on a hostile planet.

614
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,000
- And that's some other...
- It's that!

615
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,160
Get up, get up, get up!

616
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
Whoa!

617
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,320
Pick it up.

618
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,680
Ho-hup!

619
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,680
THEY GASP

620
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,800
The boulder field immediately started to bog us down.

621
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,800
We couldn't drive over the ice blocks.

622
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,840
That's impossible.

623
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,600
And between them were snow drifts 15 feet deep.

624
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,720
Each time we spin the wheels, we sink a little bit more.

625
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,120
Even the Icelandic rocking trick stopped working.

626
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,160
ENGINE REVS

627
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,720
Honestly, James, I can't see the bloody...

628
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,000
- This is interesting.
- Hold it there! Hold it!

629
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,000
God Almighty!

630
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,320
It's very hard work, and very cold, and quite lonely out here.

631
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,440
The boulder field was also a maze. We'd spent hours picking a route...

632
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,680
- That way.
- What?
- That way.

633
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,640
Then hit a complete dead end.

634
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,120
There has to be another way through here.

635
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
Down there, down there.

636
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,920
Then it got even worse.

637
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,000
ENGINE SPLUTTERS AND CUTS OUT

638
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,280
God!

639
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,560
This is a lump of solid ice,

640
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,800
and another one at the back. The car's sunk in between them.

641
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,120
There's no help, either, because the other two cars are...

642
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,680
I can just see one, the other one's miles away,

643
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,480
and they're both stuck, as well,

644
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,040
so we have to get this out, somehow.

645
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,240
And with each passing minute, Hammond's getting closer.

646
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,240
- No, James, it won't do it. 
- It's not going to work.

647
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,360
Oh, that's ice, as well!

648
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,320
It took us three hours to chop ourselves free.

649
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,960
Try that!

ENGINE REVS

651
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,080
This has just crippled us. We've been in here nearly a day.

652
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,560
As we got more and more lost in the ice maze,

653
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,600
we lost all sense of time and distance.

654
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,560
It's four o'clock in the morning. It's a nightmare.

655
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,520
We're just covering inches per hour, literally.

656
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,960
By the time we pitched camp,

657
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,880
we'd been in the boulder field for 20 hours,

658
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,800
and we were only one mile nearer to the Pole.

659
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,840
Come on!

660
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,000
In the meantime, we'd cleared Bathurst Island,

661
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,240
but the brutal pace was starting to fray my temper.

662
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,440
- Did you manage to keep it fit?
- Yeah. 
- I do need a new lead dog, he's...

663
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,320
You can try, but there's nobody else here, and I have a shovel.

664
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,560
I wouldn't.

665
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:38,040
At one point today, I had to count the dog traces onto the carabina that holds them to the sled.

666
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,560
We untangle the leads, and put them back on.

667
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,680
There are ten, cos there's ten dogs.

668
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,440
It took me three attempts to count to ten.

669
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,880
After two hours' kip, we too were frazzled,

670
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,880
and starting to understand why no-one had ever taken a car to the Pole before.

671
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,520
Agh! Oh, no!

672
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,240
- Right...
- Look at that!
- I know.

673
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,600
That is on the horizon, and that is still a lump of ice.

674
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,600
That means there's bad ice right out there.

675
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,760
We're gonna be here forever.

00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,440
But we had to get out, because we had limited fuel, limited food,

678

and in here, absolutely no chance of rescue.

679
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,280
My dream of a luxury trip to the Pole was in tatters.

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,760
My hands are freezing, James.

00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,000
No, James, it won't do it.

682
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,600
When I got down to the bottom of that slope,

683
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,880
- we were back where we were... 
- I know.

684
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,160
- ..an hour and a half ago. 
- You don't have to remind me.

685
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,280
In eight hours, we went nowhere.

686
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,840
ENGINE REVS

687
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,560
- Can you turn the cameras off?
- Yeah.

688
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,680
We, meanwhile, were cruising up the fjord,

689
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,320
where May had gone through the ice, but we had no worries, sort of.

690
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,360
Oooh! Ooof! Agh!

691
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,840
..because Matty had unleashed her secret weapon.

692
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,760
Good boy! Good boy! Come on! Good boy!

693
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,280
It's a kite. Matty puts it up and skis with it,

694
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,400
that saves weight, motivates the dogs.

695
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,720
Yeah!

696
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,800
Now we're making progress! Now we are making progress! Ha ha!

697
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,640
CAR ENGINE REVS

698
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,400
After two days of going nowhere, Jeremy's patience had snapped.

699
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,680
- Uh-oh.
- Oh my God, what is that?

700
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,880
I think that's the auxiliary fuel tank.

701
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,600
- I'll tell you something else... 
- A whole fuel tank has dropped off.

702
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,160
- Tell you something else.
- What?

703
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,600
It smells remarkably like it might be leaking.

704
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,720
Oh, Christ, hang on a minute. James, James, James!

705
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,520
The propshaft is gouged to hell, and the fuel tank is gouged to hell.

706
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
How much is in the main tank now?

707
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,040
If we're losing fuel,

708
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,880
we've got to get as much as possible into the other tank.

709
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,360
The miles were tumbling.

710
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,000
We'd managed to pump some of the fuel into the good tank,

711
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,160
but then we hit another problem.

712
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,560
That's what the fuel tank did to the shock absorber when it came off,

713
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,000
so we've had to replace that as well,

714
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,400
and we've now ended up with one full tank,

715
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,840
the standard tank the car comes with, the other one is empty.

716
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,080
Er...crossed fingers, really.

717
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,680
The crash had also ripped a tyre off the rim,

718
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,240
but luckily, our Icelandics had yet another trick up their sleeves.

719
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,880
They filled the tyre with lighter fuel, and...

720
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,720
Great success!

721
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,760
However, we now had barely enough fuel to get to the Pole.

722
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,360
We were still stuck, and then came a call from Team Dog.

723
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,920
In the two days that we'd been trapped, he'd closed us down,

724
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,680
and was now in the boulder field, as well.

725
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,440
THEY SHOUT TO DOGS

726
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,400
The news caused a bit of a row.

727
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,680
Sometimes, James, you have to move fast...

728
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,720
Sometimes, Jeremy, you have to move slowly, for example,

729
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,080
going over the soft snow,

730
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,200
where we've been told there are huge lumps of immobile ice,

731
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,720
which is what's caused that.

732
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,280
We wished we'd paid more attention at the Alpine training camp.

733
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,200
We wished we were fitter. It really was starting to get tough.

734
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,600
And we were both absolutely worn out.

735
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,600
Oh, bloody hell!

736
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,640
We felt certain that Hammond was ahead,

737
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,640
but we had to stop and put the tent up,

738
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,480
and it was a nightmare.

739
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,200
It was minus 42, we were exhausted,

740
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,640
and Reynolds' prediction about falling out was starting to ring true.

741
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,280
- Hang on, hang on.
- Are you in?
- No.

742
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,640
- Just
- BLEEP
- put it in!

743
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,440
- Just...please, James...
- Look, I am so unspeakably outraged with you.

744
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,520
Be quick, for once!

745
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,160
You're not even doing this intelligently.

746
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,560
You have to push it through until it goes in the other end.

747
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,120
- James, I am dying here. 
- You cannot build a tent by shouting.

748
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,440
- Oh,
- BLEEP!

749
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,000
That, frankly, is a pathetic effort.

750
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,600
The dogs were also fighting, and Matty dispensed swift discipline.

751
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,280
Get out! Out!

752
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,240
Out! Out! Out! Out!

753
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,640
SHE CONTINUES TO SHOUT

754
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,200
I need to run 'em for a bit, this is crazy.

755
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,160
They mean the world to her,

756
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,040
but they're not domestic pets.

757
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,360
They're pack animals, and sometimes, she has to remind them who's boss.

758
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,560
With order restored, they blitzed the boulder field,

759
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,120
and soon we were clear.

760
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,720
Look ahead! Look! We've done it! We are out!

761
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,160
Whoo! Come on, guys, let's go!

762
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,080
Meanwhile, we were beginning a third day stuck in the same frozen hell.

763
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,880
SAW WHIRRS

764
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. James, James...

765
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,680
- What?
- You're standing on, like, an ice bridge!

766
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,280
- Yeah, what's wrong with that? 
- You'll cut your
- BLEEP
- arm off!

767
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,160
To try and speed things up,

768
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,240
we'd broken out a chainsaw to cut away the bigger boulders,

769
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,760
and some snow ladders to cross the deeper ravines.

770
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,640
- Where I've sawn it off square... 
- James?
- What?

771
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:48,120
This bolt's stuck to my lips. Oh, Christ. This bolt's stuck there.

772
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,200
- Oh,
- BLEEP!
- James, hurry up. 
- Put some coffee in your mouth.

773
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,040
- It
- BLEEP
- hurts, man.

774
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,640
Oh, God. Agh!

775
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,240
- Agh, it's hot!
- Put it in there, put it in there.

776
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,480
- Shove your face in it. 
- Oh, thank God for that!

777
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,200
Bloody hell!

778
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,200
- That's just gonna fall down. 
- It's not, cos I'll dig it in.

779
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,800
OK!

780
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,720
- James...
- Oh,
- BLEEP!

781
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,840
Right, better hand me down, Matty, we are in a race.

782
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,440
We need to make good speed on the flat we've got.

783
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,720
Do you know, over the last two days, two and a half days,

784
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,760
our average speed was less than a mile.

785
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,840
I have, um...

786
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,800
- Oh! Ow!
- Do you know what I was about to say?

787
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,800
- Do you know what I was about to say?
- What?
- I think we're coming to the end of the boulder field.

788
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,040
Look about. What can you NOT see?

789
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,560
I think we have actually got to the edge of the good ice, haven't we?

790
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,800
That's very flat over there.

791
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,320
James, we're out.

792
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,560
We've made i-i-i-i-it!

793
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,920
It's flat!

794
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,440
It's so smooth!

795
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,480
No more going up and down!

796
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,200
Oh!

797
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,920
It had taken three days of almost non-stop driving,

798
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,400
but this incredible machine had breached what the experts had said

799
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,760
would be an impregnable wall.

800
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,400
It had taken on the impossible... and it had won.

801
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,560
- 75 miles to the Pole.
- I know.

802
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,200
And my celebratory tin of Spam.

803
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,520
What if I ate your Spam?

804
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,000
You're not eating my Spam,

805
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,720
unless you want to go home to your wife and children

806
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,840
with the hatchet buried in your head.

807
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,560
We knew that with just 75 miles to go on flat ice,

808
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,120
we could easily overhaul Hammond.

809
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,000
So we decided to treat ourselves to a spot of tenting.

810
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,520
I am never, ever, ever, ever going to complain ever again

811
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,480
about the quality of a hotel,

812
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,280
as long as I get to a hotel and I don't have to actually build it.

813
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,720
"Ah!

814
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,800
"Do you want a room, sir? Certainly.

815
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,280
"Here's some bricks, some mortar, a lavatory seat, some wood, some nails, a hammer,

816
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,120
"some carpet, some glass..." What?

817
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,720
Seat the pole.

818
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,800
'We too knew that the car would reel us in.

819
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,480
'So we kept on going.'

820
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,920
Oh-h! I know I need to get off.

821
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,040
After 90 minutes' sleep,

822
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,600
we pulled down the tent for what would be the last time.

823
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,200
This is what I have to put up with at night -

824
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,680
sleeping next to a six foot sinus

825
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,960
that then wees in a bottle and leaves it for me to clear up.

826
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,000
'A spot of revenge was in order.'

827
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,680
GUN COCKS

828
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,400
Result.

829
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,400
There was another result as well.

830
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,360
We figured out that we must have retaken the lead from Team Dog.

831
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,040
BARKING

832
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,680
As they struggled on, we tried to rekindle

833
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,200
some of the fun that seemed to have gone missing from our journey.

834
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,920
I spy,

835
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,880
with my little eye, something beginning with...

836
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,800
S.

837
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,600
- Snow.
- Yes.

838
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,560
I spy, with my little eye, something beginning with...S.

839
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,680
- Sky.
- Yes.

840
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,880
I spy, with my little eye...

841
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,200
If it begins with S, I'm going to kill you.

842
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,400
'But then, amazingly, we spotted something beginning with P.'

843
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,280
- It's a DC-3.
- It is.

844
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,560
- Or a C-47, strictly.
- What, because it's the military one?

845
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,400
Exactly.

846
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,080
Imagine surviving that plane crash

847
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,720
and then finding yourself here.

848
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,520
That's a bad deal.

849
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,560
We'd run for 15 hours straight.

850
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,440
Even so, I knew we were going to lose.

851
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,320
Um...

852
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,080
You know, we are now the most northern people in the world.

853
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,840
Apart from Michael Parkinson, obviously.

854
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,760
With the Pole just ten miles away,

855
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,040
it really did look like we'd win the race

856
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,320
and be the first people ever to drive there. But then...

857
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,720
- It can't be. It can be.
- It is, mate.

858
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,920
It couldn't be more than a few miles deep, but it didn't need to be,

859
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,920
because if Hammond was anywhere near, we were history.

860
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,440
Come on!

861
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,440
Which way?

862
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,480
- James, is it stuck in the snow? 
- It's working.
- We're side-slipping.

863
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,400
Drive!

864
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,600
Oh, this is just unreal!

865
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,640
'It took us three hours to do a mile.'

866
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,760
Hold it!

867
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,840
'And then the car beached itself on a block of ice.

868
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,520
'We were desperate.'

869
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,720
Ho over! Gee, gee over. Gee, gee!

870
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,800
Right, Matty, let's make this camp.

871
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,880
POWER TOOLS BUZZ

872
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,360
Right, let's go!

873
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,200
Stop!

874
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,240
- By that boulder.
- We can't lose this!

875
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,800
Try that.

876
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,120
'Even though we were on fumes, I threw caution to the wind and went for it.'

877
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,600
Ooh, gosh!

878
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,600
- You're gonna bust it.
- I'm not.

879
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,080
Come on. Come on.

880
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,520
I will not be beaten by a dog.

881
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,960
'At last we were clear.'

882
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,400
James, we're gonna do it!

883
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:01,560
'All we had to do now was match the known bearings of the Pole with the readout on our satnav.'

884
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,840
Left, left, left.

885
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,440
Where are you?

886
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,200
I expected a sort of shining beam of light coming from the Earth's core.

887
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,120
- I'll go in this direction...
- Yeah.

888
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,600
Are you ready for it? Ready, ready, ready...

889
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,800
- Yes!
- That's it!

890
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,400
It's here!

891
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,560
It's here!

892
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,960
Hammo-o-ond!

893
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,640
PHONE RINGS

894
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,840
Ooh, bugger!

895
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,440
- Matty, I'm off!
- Where are you?

896
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,320
Hammond!

897
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,880
Yes?

898
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,920
We're at the North Pole.

899
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,920
- You've done it? 
- We've done it. We're here.

900
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,600
- The truck got there?
- Yeah, the truck didn't fall through the ice.

901
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,520
- Presumably you're not very far away.
- No. No...

902
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,960
Sorry, mate, wait. James wants a word. Hang on a sec.

903
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,640
Oh, righto.

904
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,480
- Hammond?
- Yes, mate.

905
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,760
Mate, bad luck.

906
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,560
That was it, really.

907
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,120
Oh...

908
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,880
Can't be far.

909
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,040
'As James tucked into his ruined Spam,

910
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,600
'we thought a little bit about what we'd actually achieved.'

911
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,640
I'd set out to prove that Polar exploration could be easy.

912
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,440
But it isn't. It's brutal and savage.

913
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,680
The fact is, though,

914
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,640
that two middle-aged men, deeply unfit and mostly drunk,

915
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,200
had made it,

916
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,320
thanks entirely to the incredible machine that took us there.

917
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,600
They'd said we'd never get to the Pole, because of the damage the car has already done to the ice cap.

918
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,720
Perhaps, then, that's what we'd proved most of all, really -

919
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,960
the inconvenient truth is it doesn't appear to have even scratched the surface.

920
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,920
