2
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:15,036
Tonight, Richard
drives a muscle car,

3
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,989
I wear some unusual trousers

4
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:21,040
and there's a wizard in
our reasonably priced car.

5
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:27,040
APPLAUSE

6
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:32,060
Hello, thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody.

7
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,005
Thank you.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,092
Now, in the past, if you
were a successful businessman

9
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:40,611
and you wanted a large
four-door saloon car,

10
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:44,061
you had a choice of
Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Audi.

11
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:49,076
Now, though, you could have an Aston
Martin or a Maserati or a Porsche.

12
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:51,009
And that should, at least,

13
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:55,024
make the world's financial
districts sound a lot better.

14
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:16,068
These are the cars in question and
it's our job to decide which is best...

15
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:23,028
The 4.7 litre Maserati
Quattroporte GTS,

16
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:26,993
the six-litre Aston Martin Rapide

17
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:32,028
or the extremely ugly
Porsche Panamera Turbo.

18
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:36,064
This isn't just hideous
compared to the other two -

19
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:39,052
it's hideous compared to a...
genital wart.

20
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:44,012
By contrast, looks is where the
Aston gets off to a flying start,

21
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:47,563
cos it doesn't really
look like a saloon at all.

22
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:51,045
More like a DB9 that's...
taken a bit of Viagra.

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,024
In fact, you have to stare at it for
a while before you can see it's got

24
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,021
four doors at all.

25
00:01:57,056 --> 00:02:01,057
The Quattroporte has now
been with us for six years

26
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:05,052
but if anything, over that time, I
think it's got even better looking.

27
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,981
Ooh, it has. You're not joking.

28
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:10,048
When this first came out, I thought
it looked like a Vauxhall Cresta.

29
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:15,064
Yes, you did. But now, it's just
spectacularly well balanced.

30
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,965
It's just cool, though,
as well, isn't it?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
When you see someone getting
out of these, passers by go...

32
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,973
It is like a Mafia hit man.

33
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:26,028
I like these. Oh, those are...
They work for me.

34
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,045
When you sum up the looks of these,

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,016
you've got the ballet dancer, the
hit man and someone who's been...

36
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,060
Found at the bottom of a
lake after two weeks. Yes.

37
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:37,064
And this is the man who
threw him in there.

38
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:42,506
Having examined the
outside of the cars,

39
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,008
we thought we'd take
a look at the inside,

40
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,061
where there were some issues.

41
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:52,032
In the Aston Martin, you need fingers like
cocktail sticks to operate any of the
buttons.

42
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:57,060
And in the Porsche, you need to be a
rocket scientist to understand anything.

43
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:00,969
But worst of all is
the Quattroporte.

44
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:05,002
This is always going to be a bit of a
problem for a small car maker because...

45
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, Mercedes-Benz, they've probably
got 1,000 people employed just to decide

46
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:12,059
where the buttons go on the
satnav, but with the Maserati,

47
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:15,084
you get the feeling a man
turns up on Tuesday and goes,

48
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,993
"Here is OK."

49
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:23,004
That's why it's blindingly difficult to
operate everything in here, as we shall now
demonstrate.

50
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,056
Chaps, give me a straightforward task.
I'll give you a task.

51
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:28,056
Adjust the clock. OK.

52
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:37,092
While James is doing that, Hammond and I
have noticed that we've got these straps
here.

53
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:40,053
These are fitted for you
to be handcuffed to.

54
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:45,000
"Don't take me to the warehouse.
I can't find the money!

55
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,021
"Please!" "Just tell me
where my children are. "

56
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:51,036
Ah, ah, ah! "Set time and date.
" Go on, then. Right, right.

57
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:54,094
Manual? Semi-automatic?

58
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,096
Oh, these are the weapons.

59
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:58,001
THEY CHUCKLE

60
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:01,021
I'm quite good at this sort
of thing but that's rubbish.

61
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:05,556
At this point, we decided to take
a typical businessman's drive

62
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,056
from here in central London to
a business park in Hampshire.

63
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:14,076
I wanted to drive the Maserati.

64
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,005
Toodle-oo.

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,017
Well, I'm not driving the
Porsche. I'm just not.

66
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:23,076
'Unfortunately, while I was telling
Jeremy I wouldn't drive the Porsche...

67
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,032
'.. James drove off in the Aston. '

68
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:32,086
Oh God. Why did I have
to get stuck with this?

69
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:36,096
I grabbed the Aston,
expecting perfection.

70
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,993
But I didn't quite find it.

71
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,064
You pay 91,000 for the Maserati,

72
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,583
97,000 for the Porsche

73
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,811
and then 140,000 for this.

74
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,969
But I'm not exactly sure why.

75
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:54,024
For that sort of money, this thing
has to be absolutely brilliant

76
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,020
but I'm not entirely
convinced it is.

77
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,973
It's a bit jiggly.

78
00:04:58,008 --> 00:04:59,061
I know it's a sort of supercar,

79
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:03,012
but it's supposed to be luxurious
and comfortable as well.

80
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:09,036
When it comes to criticism, though, you
should have heard Mr Grumble-Trousers.

81
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:11,973
It's sort of massive
for one thing -

82
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm scared I might
knock over a building.

83
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,053
Oh God.

84
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,001
It's got a stop-start,

85
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:23,084
so the engine stops when you stop and
starts when you hit the pedal to move away.

86
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,589
What's...? To save petrol.

87
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,025
In a 4.7 litre V8 turbo.

88
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,080
That's like buying Buckingham Palace, then
living in the kitchen to save wearing the
carpets out.

89
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,029
Then there's the pricing.

90
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:41,029
Yes, at L97,000, this does look like
good value against the Aston Martin.

91
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:46,076
Then you discover you have to pay extra
for things like the rear windscreen wiper.

92
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,008
Don't be tight. 97 grand - chuck
in a windscreen wiper, eh?

93
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:54,969
Hammond. Yep?I don't
like looking at your car.

94
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:59,088
It's the only thing that brightens my day
knowing you have got to look at it and I
haven't.

95
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:03,000
No, there's its reflection!
God, it's hideous.

96
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,080
Up ahead, there was a chance for
the Porsche to redeem itself.

97
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:10,084
Ooh, hello. Tunnel.

98
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,096
There it is. Sport.

99
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:20,057
No noise at all.

100
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:23,090
On a 4.7 litre V8, and...

101
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,053
I can't hear anything.

102
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:30,056
'The Aston put on a better show. '

103
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,993
Not bad.

104
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,013
'But then came the Maserati. '

105
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:38,032
What I'm going to do now
is push the sport button.

106
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,044
ENGINE REVS LOUDLY

107
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:44,013
Oh, my God! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

108
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:50,032
What this button does is it
turns carbon dioxide into noise.

109
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,028
'However, like the other
two, I had complaints. '

110
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:59,013
The sports noise - that's good.

111
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:04,048
The trouble is they've also fitted it with
sports suspension and that's not good.

112
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:09,049
If you can afford L100,000
to spend on a car,

113
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:14,012
chances are you're a bit old, and old
people don't want to drive along like this.

114
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,557
That's not comfy.

115
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:17,033
'And there was more. '

116
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:21,060
I honestly thought James was
being stupid, but he isn't.

117
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:23,969
I can't fathom anything out.

118
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:27,056
There are buttons I've just found
on the back of the steering wheel -

119
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,056
six of them. No idea what they do.

120
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:38,548
'On the uneventful one-hour
cruise to the business park... '

121
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:43,060
HE SNIGGERS Do I care that I don't
knowwhat the buttons do? No.

122
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,029
'.. I worked out a way to describe

123
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:50,997
'the unhinged but
bewitching Quattroporte. '

124
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:53,969
Owning this car is like
owning a two-year-old child.

125
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:58,092
It's really annoying for a lot of the time
but if someone tried to take it away from
you...

126
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,033
You'd kill them. You'd kill!

127
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:05,060
'Then, since the park was closed, we
decided to turn it into a race track.

128
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:12,008
'And in the Maserati, Hammond
quickly got what I was on about. '

129
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,052
Oh, my word!

130
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:26,000
This is a four-door saloon car but
it sounds utterly magnificent.

131
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:27,045
It's just got so much style.

132
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,969
I don't care what the flaws are -

133
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:33,052
I don't care if it picks its nose and
farts in bed - I love this thing.

134
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:38,000
It's got such a sense of fun about it.
That is the whole point.

135
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,092
Even if you're trying
to keep that lid down.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,020
'Mind you, the Aston
wasn't bad either. '

137
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,092
Do you know what this is?
I'll tell you exactly what this is.

138
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,028
It is exciting.

139
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:57,092
There's a subtle, refined
rage to this car.

140
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:06,058
It is not as sharp as a
Vantage or DB9 or DBS,

141
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:11,032
but as a four-door saloon
car, it's spectacular.

142
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,973
'Here on the business park raceway,

143
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:19,056
'even the four-wheel drive Elephant
Man is making a case for itself. '

144
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,024
God above! This thing's great.

145
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,028
It feels big, but whoo!

146
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,060
Staggering.

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,969
I'm just amazed by this car.

148
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:40,032
Dynamically, it is as fabulous
as it is gopping to look at.

149
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:45,969
'Frankly, we could have fooled
about all day in these cars,

150
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:49,076
'but we decided to induce a bit
of science by laying out a course

151
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:52,072
'and then summoning the
head of accounts. '

152
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:03,032
Is he ready? Yes, believe so.
Of course he is - he's the Stig.

153
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,052
Three, two, one, go.

154
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,020
They sold 1,000... Ssh!

155
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,997
What were you going to say?

156
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,017
I was going to say that they sold 1,000
of those Maseratis over a five-year period

157
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:25,084
but over the save same five years,they sold
nearly 15,000 MercedesS Classes. He's
coming back!

158
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:34,064
You know the Ferrari F438?

159
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:36,036
What?!

160
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,028
He got a bit squirrely there.

161
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,076
I've had a crisis!

162
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,061
35.8.

163
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:49,044
'With the Maserati's
time on the board... '

164
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:53,052
'.. the Stig lined up the Aston. '

165
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:57,016
Three, two, one, and go.

166
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,064
I'm very angry!

167
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:11,004
But why is it so expensive?
Why is it 140 grand?

168
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,072
Did you find the Faberge egg in it?

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,036
I think they're charging
140,000 cos they can. Yeah.

170
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,056
Ooh! He is brave. Isn't he brave?

171
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,546
OK, the Aston Martin Rapide.

172
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:32,804
There's your Maserati, 35.81.

173
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,857
Rapide...

174
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,841
35.25. Ooh!

175
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,801
So 50 grand and you go

176
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:43,785
0.6 of a second faster round
Farnborough business park.

177
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,844
It is an important pieceof consumer advice.
I'd spend an extra 50 grand for that.

178
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,860
Right. It's time now...

179
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:52,804
for the Porsche.

180
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,856
Three, two, one, go.

181
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:00,793
Has it gone?

182
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,844
You two haven't given it the
full beans yet, have you?

183
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,824
No. It's absolutely astonishing.

184
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,848
I have to say, I like the
look ofit now. You can't...

185
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:16,840
No, it's behind that building.

186
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,800
It's back! I've got to look.

187
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,848
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

188
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,804
Right.

189
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,805
The Porsche did it in...

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,821
35.1, which is only a
tenth of a second faster,

191
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:48,853
but nevertheless, that thing, I
think, is astonishingly fast.

192
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:52,872
It is. That's all very well, but which would
you rather walk out to in the morning?

193
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:55,861
The Maserati or the Aston that'll
make your trousers go all hot,

194
00:12:55,896 --> 00:13:00,852
or the Porsche - they do! - which makes a
bit of sick come into your mouth when you
see it.

195
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,832
Which would you rather have?
That's the thing.

196
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,839
HE BLOWS A RASPBERRY

197
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,777
Nobody's watching.

198
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,888
Nobody is actually
in there, are they?

199
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,781
You've all come along and you...

200
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:16,836
The World Cup is on BBC One and ITV.
How many people do you think are watching?

201
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:19,892
We could just talk in a high-pitched squeak.
Eek, eek! It's just us.

202
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,801
Why don't you get naked?
Go on. LAUGHTER

203
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,892
Anyway, I have a theoryabout
those cars. Oh, God! Joy

204
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,861
It's one of my better
theories, this is.

205
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,884
If I were a businessman and I
were invited to go and do business

206
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,872
on a business park in
Hampshire, I'd use Skype.

207
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,825
Not go, yeah. I wouldn't go,

208
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,805
but if I had an Aston, a
Maserati or even the Porsche,

209
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,816
I would drive down there becausethey make...
Your day more special?

210
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:45,765
They make driving more special.
For that reason alone,

211
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,793
I like them more than the
established BMs and Mercs and Audis.

212
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,808
We haven't finished with them yet
there'll be more testing later,

213
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:55,820
sort of, but for now it's
the news. Yes, it is,

214
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:57,817
and talking about the
Porsche Panamera,

215
00:13:57,852 --> 00:14:02,884
you would think, would you not, that it's
impossible to make that car any uglier. Yes.

216
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,853
The ugliest thing in the world.
Well, it is.

217
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,860
There's a Swiss company called
Mansory and here is their creation.

218
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:12,860
It actually is uglier, isn't it?

219
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,805
I'm going to be sick.

220
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,845
That is... How much is it?

221
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,888
L133,000, they want
for that monstrosity!

222
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:21,896
I like the interior best of all.
Have a look.

223
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:26,824
It's like the set of a
children's television programme.

224
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:28,793
All it needs is a
ball pit down here,

225
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,821
and then they've pretty
much got it finished.

226
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:34,769
Anyone go to the Goodwood Festival
of Speed last weekend? Several.

227
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:38,324
I wasn't able to make it, but I'm told
they had a moving motor show there.

228
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:41,844
The idea was, unlike a normal motor
show, where the cars just sit still,

229
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,769
you can jump in and have a go,

230
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:48,812
which sounds like a great idea, unless
you're one of the four people who were run
over.

231
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,857
LAUGHTER

232
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:53,849
Seriously! I've got a picture here.
Somebody got in a Honda Civic.

233
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:58,844
Is there any danger that these Goodwood
people might take over the Farnborough Air
Show?

234
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:03,833
"Next seven for a go in
the Red Arrows. Come on. "

235
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:08,840
"Welcome to the Goodwood interactive zoo.
Now, who wants to do lion taming?" It
doesn't work.

236
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,861
The Goodwood Festival
of Live Ammunition.

237
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,888
"Are there actual bullets in these guns?
Is there a range?!"

238
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:16,828
"No, just help yourself.
That's fantastic!"

239
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:17,825
LAUGHTER

240
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,777
Couple of weeks ago, you may remember
we announced that Ferrari had broken

241
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:25,896
the lap record at the Nurburgring. They did
it in six minutes and 58 seconds. Great!

242
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:30,800
But already, Pagani have broken
that with this, the Zonda R,

243
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:32,845
and they've gone round
it in six minutes and 40.

244
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,868
We've got some footage of them
doing it here. Here we go.

245
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,777
Obviously, it's just
very, very fast.

246
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,352
Wait a minute. Is this a road car?Well, yes.
I mean, you can drive it on the road.

247
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:45,892
Well, the real point is this isa record...
Well, it's not a shopping car, obviously.

248
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:49,864
I see. So this road car with firecoming
out of the back... Well done, them.

249
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,349
Now, I'm going to tell you
something very important.

250
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:56,800
The European Union, which
is a big thing in Belgium...

251
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:57,769
LAUGHTER

252
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:00,845
It is! They've decided
that all car makers

253
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,866
must reach an average target
for their whole range of car.

254
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:09,362
So here's how it works, OK?
If BMW sell a V12 limousine,

255
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:13,824
they must then sell lots of
little Diesel 1 Series cars

256
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,859
to keep the average
of the CO2 down.

257
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,860
It's averaged across
the range of cars?

258
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,793
Now, Bugatti, it's not so bad,

259
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,825
because Bugatti's
owned by Volkswagen,

260
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,816
and Volkswagen also makes
the Polo, so that's fine.

261
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,821
But Aston Martin -
bit of a problem,

262
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,809
cos Aston Martin isn't owned
by VW or Ford, it's on its own.

263
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:35,857
And they only make big cars. Onlybig,
thirsty cars. They've got toget that
average down,

264
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:40,872
so they've had to make a small car, OK? And
we have a picture of it here. It's called
the Cygnet.

265
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:43,391
AUDIENCE GROAN This is
potentially disastrous,

266
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,841
because it risks ruining
their reputation.

267
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:48,845
What that is is a Toyota
iQ with a leather gear knob

268
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,825
and then Toyota crossed out and
Aston Martin written in in crayon.

269
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,816
That's what that is. Hang on a minute. If
they just need to bring their average CO2
down,

270
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,845
why don't they just
buy a bicycle factory?

271
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,805
Or they should do
Aston Martin flowers,

272
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,825
cos they suck in CO2 and put out oxygen,
and that would bring it crashing down!

273
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,804
I think it has to be a mode of transport -
you can't go to work on some flowers. A
horse?

274
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,808
Scissors. Have you ever tried
sitting on a pair of scissors?

275
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:18,845
LAUGHTER Not yet.

276
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,861
A cow. Ostriches.
They're quite exotic.

277
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:26,844
Another one I've just thought of isZonda.
What are Zonda going to do?Oh, that'll be
easy.

278
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,809
Well, they're Italian, aren't they?

279
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:31,785
They'll just lie -
that's what they'll do.

280
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,896
"Emissions is very important! Is it low
or high? Low? OK. My emissions is one!"

281
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,911
And that's it. They'll just lie.

282
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:38,857
Well, why don't
Aston Martin just...

283
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,809
Why not take a leaf out of
the European book and say,

284
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,853
"Yes, our cars don't really
produce carbon dioxide at all. "

285
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:49,852
If you say... The EU go and inspect a
Spanish fishing boat and go, "Have you been
fishing?"

286
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,832
"No. " "What's all that in
your boat?" "My lunch. "

287
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,837
"It's a lot of fish. Hungry!"

288
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,805
This is the answer. Don't make
that, Aston Martin. Just lie.

289
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,816
Anyway, I tell you what, you know
the American stunt driver Ken Block?

290
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,865
Yes. You know who I mean.
Excellent.

291
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,880
You went to see him in California.

292
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:08,821
Yes, I did.

293
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:12,816
Some footage here of Ken terrifying
the bejesus out of James, look.

294
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:16,825
So he dropped in on us last week,

295
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,884
and he called me a pussy for not
being able to drive a Reliant Robin.

296
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,793
You are.

297
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:25,872
You are a pussy. A big, irritating one.
You say that, but last week,

298
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:29,805
the Stig tried to drive the Reliant Robin.
He also rolled over.

299
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,828
Yeah. Yes, so are you stayingthe Stig's
a pussy? No. No. There you are, you see.

300
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,853
Well, let's have a look because Kenhad a go.
He looks good, doesn't he?

301
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:42,820
He won't be able to do it. He will. I'm
telling you, he will not be able to do it.

302
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,825
He has perfect car control.

303
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,861
He won't be able to do it.
And here he is.

304
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:50,496
The first corner, nice and smooth.
He's keeping the line wide,

305
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,424
using all the track.
It's a lovely...

306
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,421
That's not gone well, has it?
My case rests.

307
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:03,408
You can't drive one of those
things round a corner!

308
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,377
Right.

309
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:09,440
Now, it is time to put a Formula 1
star in our old, reasonably priced car.

310
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:14,221
My guest tonight is a Brazilian.

311
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:18,257
Not the triangular
topiary thing, obviously.

312
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:22,280
It is a genuine Brazilian.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rubens Barrichello!

313
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:25,276
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

314
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,165
Rubens!

315
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,226
How're you? Nice to see you.

316
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,252
Rubens is among us. Thank you.

317
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,232
Have a seat.

318
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:38,284
Have a seat!

319
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,213
I've got a question, if I may.

320
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:45,292
Why has your country
given its name to...

321
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,265
How can I put this?

322
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,204
.. triangular topiary?

323
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,225
LAUGHTER

324
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,758
I think it's a term
used in England,

325
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:55,256
because in Brazil we
call it "Hitlers".

326
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,277
A what?LAUGHTER

327
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,229
It's a little...

328
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,240
You're saying you'd have a Hitler?
A Hitler there.

329
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,224
Has anybody here got a Brazilian?

330
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:08,208
You have, sir? Er... LAUGHTER

331
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:10,261
HE MUTTERS Anyway...

332
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:14,236
Obviously, it was Silverstone this
afternoon. Well done for winning.

333
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:15,245
Thank you!

334
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,189
Nasty crash. Yeah. LAUGHTER

335
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:22,260
Should've covered it there.
I should explain it is now Wednesday,

336
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:23,249
and we have no idea...

337
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:26,276
I'm just thinking - that will be...
How many races is it

338
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:29,204
you will have done
by this evening, now?

339
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,233
297. 297.

340
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:35,216
Is that a record now? Have you set
the record for the most Grands Prix?

341
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,189
Yeah. When I raced
for the first time,

342
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:40,228
I never thought I would
race for such a long period,

343
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:43,257
but I'm enjoying
more than I used to.

344
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:46,217
Cos you must now
be, what, 78? Yeah!

345
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:49,268
Anyway, you're now driving for
one of the great teams, Williams.

346
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,217
Well, I tell you, it's...

347
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:55,204
Since a very young kid,
when I was driving go-karts,

348
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,173
I have interviews
when people ask me,

349
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,253
"Which team would you like to drive?
", and it was for Williams.

350
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:03,276
Why was that?I don't know. I just
hada great passion for Frank Williams,

351
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,165
and you can see it nowadays -

352
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,193
he is so passionate
about everything,

353
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,217
and I'm trying to lead the
team to a different area.

354
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:16,204
They are changing, and I think
the future is quite bright.

355
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,181
So, um, Ferrari - just
to go there, obviously.

356
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:23,216
You had that period where you were
there with His Schumacherness.

357
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:25,177
You must have known
when you got there

358
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:28,200
that you were going to be,
effectively, the whipping boy.

359
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,165
I did not. Really? You didn't...

360
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,253
That's the funny bit,
because people say,

361
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,248
"Shut up, Rubens. You knew you were
going to play second in the team. "

362
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:41,225
And when I signed,
I made sure to ask,

363
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,274
"Is it everything to him or
am I going to have a chance?"

364
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,288
And in my contract it was zero.
There was no mentioning

365
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:50,229
of becoming a second driver there.

366
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:54,256
So you were very surprised... It was
Austria, where you were winning, he was
behind you,

367
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:59,224
and then the call came through... "Would
you mind awfully getting out of his way?"

368
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,763
Was that a big surprise?
It was almost like that.

369
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,519
People ask me, "Why did
he do on the last corner?"

370
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,205
Because in my mind, I was
never going to do it.

371
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,204
It was eight laps. You know, it was
almost like the lawyer was sitting here

372
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:16,237
and people, you know,there was a
discussion going on. Back at the pit?

373
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:21,216
Yeah. And I could only say,"No, I'm not
going to do it. "Did you actually say that?

374
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:24,257
I said, "I'm not going to do
it," until the very final bit

375
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:27,261
when they were a bit more focused
on saying something that I...

376
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:32,200
Did they say, "We've got one of your
pets here. NOW will you move over

377
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:35,200
"and let him go by?
"It was almost like that, yeah.

378
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,201
Anyway, of course,
you came down here

379
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:16,249
because we have our Formula
1 board here, yes? Yes.

380
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:20,260
And you wanted to see where you'd
come in our old reasonably-priced car,

381
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:23,224
the old Liana, which has been
gathering dust somewhere.

382
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:24,777
Was it fun? It was fun.

383
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:26,261
Really? Yeah, it was.

384
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:29,221
Cos you think, you
know, I drive this car

385
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:33,734
with so much power and everything,
but it's a different challenge.

386
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:38,212
I mean, when you step on the
brakes, that back end, you know...

387
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:41,169
So smoothness is what...
Keep it quite smooth.

388
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:44,236
Well, I think the time has come.
I hope it was a good one.

389
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:47,236
Well, shall we find out?
Who wants to see the lap?

390
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:50,177
Yes! OK, let's play the tape.

391
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:53,236
It's nice to see the old girl back.

392
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,772
Now, concentrate. Remember that
I drive normally on that side.

393
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:03,264
Well, that's your fault for driving
on the wrong side of the road.

394
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,249
That's the Stig's
line through there.

395
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:09,290
All the other F1 drivers
come way further out.

396
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:12,296
Well, he talked me into that.
I thought it was...

397
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:15,225
You see? "Come on, horse. "

398
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,177
It's not a horse, but there we are.

399
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:22,220
What can I say? I'm not going to say,
"Oh, that's not very good," am I?

400
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:26,229
Very good down to the Hammerhead.
This is a difficult part.

401
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:30,248
It is. It normally makes the car
understeer there, but you've got it.

402
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:33,185
How come you can do that and
all our guests just can't?

403
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,228
RUBENS CHUCKLES I suppose that's cos
they're mostlyactors or comedians.

404
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,224
Wave to the camera?

405
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:40,253
HE GROANS

406
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:43,233
The gear! The gear just went "grr".

407
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:46,292
Well, it must be strange for you
to actually have to change...

408
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:49,189
When was the last
time you changed gear?

409
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:52,232
You know what, I started Formula 1
and it was already the automatic.

410
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:55,232
Yeah. And I bet your road car has...
What's your road car?

411
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:57,268
My road... I have a...

412
00:24:57,303 --> 00:25:00,177
An M5.

413
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,221
Flappy pedal. So you
haven't changed gear for...

414
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:06,236
Ooh! Look at that.
Lovely through the second to last.

415
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:10,216
And here we are now.
What's the time? Give me the time!

416
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,264
APPLAUSE There we are
crossed the line.

417
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,284
So we've got the Stig at 1:44.4.

418
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,217
Mansell 1:44.6,

419
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:26,762
and then Lewis did that
with a wet lap at 1:44.7,

420
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:30,522
which was fairly remarkable.
Impressive. Then Mark.

421
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:34,248
He flew around, actually.
Just decided not to bother.

422
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,249
So where do you reckon?

423
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,744
I don't know. My heart
is beating more than

424
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,204
at the start of the
Silverstone GP, I tell you.

425
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,228
This is obviously a
more popular show.

426
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,292
I have the time here. OK.

427
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:52,263
Rubens Barichello...

428
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:54,269
You did it in...

429
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,205
One minute...

430
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,185
Well, that's really...

431
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,284
.. forty... I'm on the page, then.
You're on the page!

432
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,240
.. four... AUDIENCE: Ooh!

433
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,241
.. point... Point?

434
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,288
.. three!CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

435
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:15,253
44.3! Wow!

436
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:20,204
The fastest man ever
to go round our track!

437
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,748
Fantastic!

438
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,229
Unbelievable.

439
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:26,248
Wow! That is fantastic.

440
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:28,237
I am so proud.

441
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:32,212
It's fantastic and
it's also staggering

442
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:34,245
that you should have beaten him.

443
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,748
We need to get you out of this
building in some careful way now.

444
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:43,181
Yeah. I can't imagine he's going
to be very pleased about this.

445
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:47,236
Especially cos if we get into a
fight, he never takes his helmet off!

446
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,276
There you go. You've finally
won something today.

447
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:52,240
LAUGHTER

448
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,746
You'll take a piece of that.
It was good 11 wins.

449
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,252
There we are. That is a
truly staggering thing.

450
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:02,257
I will ask for more
money from Frank now.

451
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:06,268
You can now say, "I am the fastest
Formula 1 driver in the world,

452
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:09,267
"and more than that, I'm
faster than the Stig. "

453
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:12,232
Fantastic. Ladies and
gentlemen, Rubens Barrichello.

454
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,224
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

455
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,233
Now...

456
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:29,266
There are a couple of
new muscle cars out

457
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:32,229
that we thought were
worth a look at.

458
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:36,212
And clearly the right man for
the job is someone who has owned

459
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:40,229
a Dodge Charger and a
Ford Mustang and a banjo.

460
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:45,244
Yep, it's our resident
redneck, the Duke of Hammond.

461
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:51,224
This is the first of
today's offerings.

462
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:57,264
A muscle car icon, reborn.

463
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,288
The Chevrolet Camaro.

464
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:04,237
Jeremy has a theory
about the Camaro.

465
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:07,201
He believes that all Camaros
are driven by murderers,

466
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:10,284
and you should never accept a lift in
one cos your head'll end up swinging

467
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,280
in the rear-view mirror
as an air freshener.

468
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,200
The thing is, there's a bit
more to this Camaro than that.

469
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:25,208
Now if you're under 12, then to you, this
car is Bumblebee from the Transformers
movies.

470
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:28,284
In a minute, it's going to stand up
and throw an oil tanker at my face.

471
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,256
But back in the '60s, its grandfather
was fighting the Cold War.

472
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:39,185
Not the big scary one with the
Russians, but the Detroit Cold War.

473
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:45,212
In 1964, Ford had launched the most
famous muscle car of all, the Mustang.

474
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:49,240
And two years later,
GM struck back.

475
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:55,200
Camaro! Fiery new
creation from Chevrolet!

476
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,264
It was one hell of a battle.

477
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:01,177
And the Camaro...

478
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:03,276
Well, it lost, actually.

479
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:04,245
Quite badly.

480
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,260
In its first full year, Ford sold
over half a million Mustangs.

481
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:11,260
In its first full
year with the Camaro,

482
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:15,169
GM didn't manage even half of that.

483
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:20,292
The other muscle cars - Mustangs, Chargers -
they went on to starring roles in Bullitt.

484
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:25,260
The Camaro did once have quite a
nice role in an episode of Lovejoy.

485
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:33,181
But this new boy is
coming back fighting.

486
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:39,236
This is the SS version - the most
powerful - with a 6.2 litre V8.

487
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:43,272
And at L40,000, it is a
lot of car for the money.

488
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:49,197
It also looks good

489
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:52,185
and unlike other muscle cars,

490
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,256
the suspension isn't made
from lampposts and logs.

491
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:01,225
Because underneath the Camaro

492
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,268
is the chassis from one our very
favouritest saloon cars, the Vauxhall VXR8.

493
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:09,208
It's made by the Australians.

494
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:16,204
Which means there's a lot of
multi-link cleverness going on.

495
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:25,208
So basically, the Americans had to go to the
Australians for a bit of sophistication.

496
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,233
That feels more like it!

497
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:32,189
A good effort all round
and on any other day,

498
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:35,272
the Camaro could claim to be
the muscle car of the moment.

499
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:42,738
However, it must now face this -

500
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:46,260
a muscle car, not from America...

501
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:52,296
.. the very German
Mercedes E63 AMG.

502
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,716
Listen to that!

503
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:00,189
ENGINE ROARS

504
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,296
It's the AMG dawn chorus.

505
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,389
It might look like a
businessman's express,

506
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:12,432
but when it comes to noise, the Benz
it blows the Camaro out of the water.

507
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:16,428
This thing sounds like Lynyrd
Skynyrd at a bullfight.

508
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:22,444
And when you take it
beyond 5,000rpm...

509
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:28,405
Ah-ha!

510
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,468
Although the Mercedes, like the
Camaro, has a 6.2 litre V8,

511
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:36,444
it's faster and more powerful.

512
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,432
0-60, 4.5 seconds.

513
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:51,373
Top speed, normally
limited to 155mph.

514
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:57,472
Or for L2,230, you can have
the limit raised to 186...

515
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:59,461
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

516
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:04,404
.. almost 40 more than
the Camaro will do.

517
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:17,448
There are, however, a couple
of chinks in the AMG's armour.

518
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:24,404
Where the Camaro costs
L40,000, this is 72,000.

519
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,940
A muscle car should also be a
car for simpletons, like me,

520
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:34,365
but there are more gizmos in
here than Bill Gates's kitchen.

521
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,440
The gearbox, for example, can be
operated from here or down here,

522
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:39,476
and then this dial splits it
into four different modes -

523
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:42,385
comfort, sport, sport
plus and so on.

524
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,452
This button adjusts the traction
control, lots of settings there.

525
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:49,413
This button is for the ride,
lots of different settings.

526
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:55,420
And that's a lot to think about if you're
the kind of person who goes to work in a
vest.

527
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:01,389
Thankfully, help is at hand.

528
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:05,381
It's this the fourth button
here, the AMG button.

529
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:10,408
Essentially, it takes all the other
settings from all the other buttons and
puts them in a thing,

530
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:14,428
and then when you hit this button, it
sets the car up exactly as you want it.

531
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,424
I like mine like this.

532
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,393
With the button in what
I call redneck setting,

533
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:35,484
the AMG can outslide, outturn and
outrun any muscle car on the planet.

534
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,496
I'm in a massive German
executive saloon.

535
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,484
Going sideways!

536
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,452
The Mercedes may be almost twice
the price of the Camaro...

537
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,448
.. but, the fact is,
it's twice the car.

538
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:20,460
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

539
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:25,421
The thing is...

540
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:27,421
The thing is I just...

541
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,389
I just love muscle cars as a breed, because
I love the idea you take an ordinary, basic
car

542
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:37,476
and then you keep adding more and more and
more and more and more power until it's
just about unusable,

543
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:41,440
and then you put it on
sale and people buy it.

544
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:44,389
And you'd have the Mercedes? Nope.

545
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:46,389
I know I said the
Merc is twice the car.

546
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:49,452
I'd have the Camaro, it's just got
much more soul. It's a stupid car!

547
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,425
It's a brilliant car...

548
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,445
OK, things you'll never
hear as somebody gets in.

549
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,404
"I'd just like to thank the Nobel
Academy and now I'm going home. "

550
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:02,432
Or how about this one?
"No, really, let me, Your Majesty. "

551
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,365
There's nobody intelligent...

552
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,429
"Bishop Tutu, can I have a go?
Thank you, I will. "

553
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:13,468
It is a car for a type of person, I love it!
It's a stupid, childish...

554
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:16,393
I'll tell you what, though,
no, one interesting thing.

555
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:21,440
When this thing goes on sale next year in
Britain, it will make the job of the police
much easier.

556
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:24,456
Let's pull these over and go, "Open
the boot... whose head's this?"

557
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:30,476
But nevertheless, we must find out how
fast these cars go round our track,

558
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:34,492
and that of course means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

559
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:39,448
Some say that if you hold
him in the wrong way,

560
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:41,412
he doesn't work properly.

561
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:49,480
And that, just very recently, he developed
an irrational hatred of Rubens Barrichello.

562
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,408
All we know is he's
called the Stig.

563
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,429
And they're off,

564
00:35:57,464 --> 00:36:01,393
and what a racket, the E63
drowning out the Chevy.

565
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:05,440
You can, of course, get the
fantastic AMG V8 in many Mercs,

566
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:08,429
and, personally, I wouldn't
have it in this one.

567
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:12,404
It's just too ugly - and, in
this, case slightly brown.

568
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,365
Round the first corner...

569
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,916
There we are, vuvuzelas
on all three channels now.

570
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:19,397
Stig hopefully will get
bored in the next week.

571
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,484
The Camaro does have a
certain distinctive presence,

572
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,409
which is peace of mind
for the murder squad.

573
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:29,484
Up to the Hammerhead, both
getting a little bit sideways,

574
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,409
but only the Camaro fills the Stig

575
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:34,492
with a sudden urge to
murder his postman.

576
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,484
Actually, he did that in 2004.

577
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:45,440
Follow-through and now, both...
Yep, going through there nicely.

578
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:48,480
And yep, kicking up
dust through the tyres.

579
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:51,467
Two corners remain,
let's have a look.

580
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,385
Oh, the Camaro getting
it very crossed up.

581
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,424
The Merc is running away
now, just Gambon left,

582
00:36:57,459 --> 00:37:00,428
and they are now through
that and across the line.

583
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,492
Right, now... I've got the times.

584
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:05,389
Yes.

585
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,453
These are the times.

586
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:14,393
So the Mercedes did it in
1:24.9, which puts it there.

587
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:18,400
That's unbelievable, that's the
same as that Supersports Bentley.

588
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:19,461
It is, yes, and the
Camaro did it in...

589
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:26,437
1:27.9, which is just...
keep going down, it's down there.

590
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:30,448
So it's even slower than the pick-up
truck of the car on which it's based?

591
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,461
Yeah, yeah, it is that, yeah,
but I'd still have this.

592
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:36,429
It was probably weighed down by
all the body parts in the boot.

593
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:40,472
Anyway, it's now time to put another
star in our reasonably priced car,

594
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:43,373
though of course this
time the brand-new one.

595
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,934
Now, my guest tonight played
a character in Harry Potter

596
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:48,460
who, in olden times, would
have been burned at the stake.

597
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:51,496
Not for being a wizard
but because he's ginger.

598
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,492
Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Grint!

599
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:55,432
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

600
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:59,408
How are you?Yeah, good.
Really good.

601
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,464
Rupert!

602
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,488
Have a seat! Brilliant!

603
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:15,424
Now, first of all, forgive me,
why do gingers get so much stick?

604
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:19,449
Says a man with pubic hair!

605
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:21,453
Saying that, I didn't get
much abuse at school.

606
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:25,432
People used to call me Luke,
actually... for Lucozade.

607
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:28,369
Oh, Lucozade.
Quite a clever nickname.

608
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:31,452
Is there anyone here who thinks they
might be ginger? What about you?

609
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:34,416
I'm not natural!
What, you dyed it ginger?!

610
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:36,441
LAUGHTER

611
00:38:36,476 --> 00:38:39,409
That's nice to hear, yeah!
That is the future right there.

612
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:44,456
Obviously, we have to talk about Harry
Potter, and you're probably fed up to the
back teeth with it.

613
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:50,400
Well, I don't know, it has been my whole
life, basically, it's been 11 years.

614
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:52,413
I've had children who've
been growing up in that time,

615
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:56,468
so I've spent a lot of my time reading
them Harry Potter bedtime stories.

616
00:38:56,503 --> 00:39:01,440
What on earth is it about?
I mean, really...

617
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:04,377
Basically, we win in the end so...

618
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:06,476
Michael Gambon came here.
Yeah. A bit older than you,

619
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,421
and I did ask him, "Do
you understand it?"

620
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:12,437
And of course he was Dumbledore,
and he said, "Well, sort of. "

621
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:16,964
But does he give the impression of
knowing what he's doing on the set or...?

622
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:21,421
The performance is ama... He does get
a bit confused sometimes, I think.

623
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:27,448
One question I had from my children, if you
don't mind my asking, is do you fancy Emily
Watson in real life?

624
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,456
Well... No, don't do that face.
That man just did that, "Mmm... "

625
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:35,445
But do you actually
fancy her in real life?

626
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,476
Well, it's weird, because I actually
had to kiss her in this last one,

627
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,436
because our characters
kind of get together.

628
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:43,496
Yeah, yeah.

629
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:48,472
And it's like a brother-sister
kind of relationship we've got.

630
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:53,420
So you weren't nursing a semi.
Oh, my God!

631
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,404
I wasn't, I wasn't, no.

632
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:07,413
So what does the future hold, now that
the big ten years of Potter is over?

633
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:11,456
I don't know, it's weird to come out of
something that you've been a part of for...

634
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,397
most of your life.

635
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:16,418
But I've done other
films, kind of in between,

636
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:19,369
and hopefully I can kind
of continue doing that.

637
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:23,914
One of the things that I was thinking...
I've been reading up on you, before you
came on,

638
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:28,424
is that you could work with cars,because th
ey do seem to bea strong love for you. Yeah.

639
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,425
Because what you actually own is...

640
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,456
let's think, a Range Rooney, an
ice-cream van and a hovercraft.

641
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,433
Yeah.

642
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:41,496
Let's start with the Range
Rover, shall we? The Wayne Rover.

643
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:43,397
Yeah. What colour's that?

644
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:45,472
It's... orange, it's bright orange.

645
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,445
LAUGHTER

646
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,408
Yeah. It's ginger, it's
basically a ginger car.

647
00:40:52,443 --> 00:40:54,421
So that works well or...?

648
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:57,405
I didn't make that connection
when I was picking the colour.

649
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,476
I just thought it looked really cool. It's
got black wheels, and it does look really
cool.

650
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,385
An orange Range Rover
in black wheels?

651
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,442
Yeah! Oh, dear, we're fightinga
lost cause here with you.

652
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:09,464
Bringing it back down to
earth again. Ice-cream van?

653
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:11,949
Yep... I've had that for a while.

654
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,365
It's something I've always wanted.

655
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,444
As a child, it was kind
of a dream, really.

656
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:18,488
It's a '74 Bedford.

657
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:19,977
It's pink.

658
00:41:20,012 --> 00:41:21,397
LAUGHTER

659
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:27,456
It's not the most practical car, because
it's got one seat and it's basically a
kitchen on wheels.

660
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,421
You do get people queuing
up on the side of a road.

661
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:35,492
And then they're mildly surprisedwhen they
see who's actually sittingin it, I should
imagine. Yeah.

662
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:41,463
And then obviously I have to ask, the
hovercraft. Yeah. I am a huge fan of
hovercrafts,

663
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:45,977
because they are the most funyou can have
with an engine,I'm convinced. Yeah,
definitely.

664
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:50,456
I was told the first time I ever went on
one - and you must have experienced this -

665
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:54,369
if you actually see an obstacle,if y
ou can see it,you will hit it. Yeah.

666
00:41:54,404 --> 00:42:01,424
At some point between seeing it, and then
it could be an hour or so, it doesn't
matter what you do...

667
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,449
They're amazing, you've
got no control at all.

668
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:07,428
Have you ever actually hit anything?
Oh, yeah! I've hit a few things.

669
00:42:07,463 --> 00:42:10,381
And so are you a good driver?

670
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,444
Well, I like to think so. I used to do
a bit of karting when I was younger.

671
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:16,416
Did you now?
So, competitive karting?

672
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,461
Well, yeah, with my brother.

673
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:30,205
Yeah, because interestingly,
and I'm actually not joking,

674
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,204
we've had this from Kia, the makers of a
reasonably priced car, to say that they're
recalling the Cee'd.

675
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:39,237
No way!

676
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:47,212
They've identified that Cee'd models could
suffer from insufficient brake force from
the master cylinder.

677
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:51,280
So what they're actuallysaying there in
long wordsis the brakes don't work. No way!

678
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,261
Did nobody tell you that?

679
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:55,173
No, I didn't realise...

680
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:58,260
Nobody from our production team
told that that car's been recalled?

681
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:01,197
No, I didn't realise that.
It felt all right.

682
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:06,256
No, apparently only 468 models have been
affected, and we don't know that it's ours
yet, it's possible.

683
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,185
Anyway, you didn't die!
I didn't die.

684
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:15,220
No, you made it, and who herewould
like to see Rupert's lap? Yes!

685
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:17,253
Let's have a look.

686
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:19,746
There we go. Look at it!

687
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:22,204
A symphony in brown.

688
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,177
Come on, mmm!

689
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:27,221
Looking determined.

690
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:33,256
Not lost there, no, well done, you
remembered to go left, that's important.

691
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,275
That's looking very
neat and tidy. Yeah?

692
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,260
Well, neat and tidy
is the key, really.

693
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,177
Come on.

694
00:43:40,212 --> 00:43:44,240
No, it won't go any faster, that
really is as fast as it goes.

695
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:46,257
You see, this is the important
thing - if you look slow,

696
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:52,296
chances are you're going not as slowly as
you think. Oh, no, a bit of a wobble into
the Hammerhead.

697
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:54,177
Do you stay in the lines?

698
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:57,205
Yes, even more in the lines.
It does understeer, this, did you notice?

699
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,240
It does, yeah, yeah, I was really shocked
by that. Oh, you see, you know...

700
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:05,292
Fourth... Are you a
manthat prefers oversteer?

701
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:08,249
I don't really
understand oversteer.

702
00:44:08,284 --> 00:44:12,244
Well, this car, when you turn the
steering wheel, it sort of pushes on.

703
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:14,221
Yeah.

704
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:16,249
Brake... now!

705
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:21,260
Yes, that was a beautiful line
through that, absolutely perfect.

706
00:44:21,295 --> 00:44:23,169
That's understeer! Right.

707
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:28,200
You almost turned right over, butthere we
are, look, across the line!CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE

708
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:38,165
Come on, youth, where do
you think you are on that?

709
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,288
Obviously not the wet ones, but 1:45.9
is Peter Jones, the fastest man.

710
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:45,288
I don't think I got
to the top but...

711
00:44:45,323 --> 00:44:47,185
Well, mmm...

712
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,236
I shall just have a look on here and see if
I can see where you came, hang on a minute.

713
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,248
Is this like being back at school?

714
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:55,248
You got a B minus!

715
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:03,292
So, Rupert Grint, you did it in... one
minute, you'll be relieved to hear... 40...

716
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,790
5.5!

717
00:45:08,825 --> 00:45:11,257
Oh, yes!

718
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:17,780
He's the fastest! He's the fastest!

719
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:24,233
The second time!
The second time! Wow.

720
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:29,212
It's just something in the airtoday.
Because Rubens has goneand bust that one.
Yes, I saw!

721
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:31,213
And now you've bust that one.
Oh, that's good.

722
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:36,284
We know that Peter Jones was quick
in the old car, the tall Dragon man,

723
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,280
so we thought, "Well, that
time will take some beating. "

724
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:42,237
He has, by the way,
just committed suicide.

725
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:46,240
He honestly left the other day saying,
"Well, no-one will beat that in a hurry!"

726
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:50,228
And it's actually taken precisely
two weeks for his time to be beaten.

727
00:45:50,263 --> 00:45:52,261
I don't think that's going to
get knocked off for a while.

728
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:57,232
Wow, I'm impressed with that. So thank you
so much for coming,thank you for busting it.

729
00:45:57,267 --> 00:46:00,288
Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Grint.
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

730
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,197
Right!

731
00:46:10,232 --> 00:46:16,244
Earlier on, we tested the new Aston Martin
Rapide, which we liked, despite the price,

732
00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:20,237
the Porsche Panamera, which we
liked, despite the hideous body,

733
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:26,272
and the Maserati Quattroporte, which we
liked, despite... pretty much everything,
really.

734
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:31,288
Now, though, it is time to see how
good these are as four-door saloons.

735
00:46:38,204 --> 00:46:44,232
To do that, the producers said we
must spend the day as chauffeurs.

736
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:47,269
Guys? I know all
about chauffeuring.

737
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,237
Go on. You've got to wear a hat,

738
00:46:50,272 --> 00:46:56,296
and you have to remember, when you open the
back door for a girl to get in, not to look
up her skirt.

739
00:46:56,331 --> 00:46:59,200
Right.

740
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,245
On the way, we changed
into our suits, and then

741
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,264
we arrived at a hotel to meet
the people we'd be chauffeuring.

742
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:10,200
OK. Where's your suit trousers?

743
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:12,221
I've lost them. Lost them?

744
00:47:12,256 --> 00:47:17,248
Honestly, I've searched the housetop to
bottom. So we'll have, what do you reckon,
one person each or...?

745
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:19,185
I think it's probably a conference.

746
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,254
We'll go to different places and
it'll be who get to his place first.

747
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:27,288
Chauffeur race. Exactly, different
places, it's who gets there first.

748
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:28,787
What? It's a wedding.

749
00:47:28,822 --> 00:47:30,217
What's a wedding?

750
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:33,296
It's a wedding, we're doing a wedding,
we're the car service for a wedding.

751
00:47:33,331 --> 00:47:36,291
Mate, you can't do
a wedding in jeans.

752
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:39,252
You can't, actually,
that's going too far.

753
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:41,181
I can mend this.

754
00:47:41,216 --> 00:47:43,245
A real wedding? Yes.
What, an actual wedding?

755
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,241
Yes. We have to drive to
the church, the reception.

756
00:47:46,276 --> 00:47:51,224
We are the drivers for the day to see
how big the backs of these cars are.

757
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:53,165
And I've got to mend my trousers.

758
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,208
Who is there at a wedding? A bride,
a groom... Bride, groom, vicar...

759
00:47:57,243 --> 00:47:59,272
Bride's mother, parents,
they all have to go.

760
00:47:59,307 --> 00:48:01,213
The Maserati's the biggest.

761
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:03,201
The bride should
go in the Maserati.

762
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:07,221
The bride's the mostimportant person at
a wedding. So put the bride in the...

763
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:11,292
Put the bride in the Maserati. I should
drive her, because I haven't driven the
Maserati.

764
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:15,228
You're welcome, I'm not driving
a bride to her wedding, no way!

765
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:17,267
Listen, everything we
ever do is a disaster.

766
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:19,237
Well, including what
you're doing there.

767
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:25,272
They'll be black in a minute,trust me. So
bride in the Maserati. Yeah. You drive
that. Yeah.

768
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:29,232
Groom is going to want
to go in the Aston.

769
00:48:29,267 --> 00:48:30,249
I'll take him in the Aston.

770
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:33,240
I'll do the bride's
mother in the Porsche.

771
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:36,221
I wouldn't... Oh, I see!

772
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:41,200
She'll be emotional, and I'm just what
she needs on her daughter's wedding day.

773
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:44,165
Hammond set off to get the groom,

774
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,296
leaving me in a spot of
bother with my new trousers.

775
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:49,257
Oh, no.

776
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,272
My legs have stuck together.

777
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,241
I do apologise for this.

778
00:48:56,276 --> 00:49:00,758
Worse still, chauffeur duties had made
James even more pedantic than usual.

779
00:49:00,793 --> 00:49:04,538
Because I want my Maserati here for
the bride, I think it's more grand.

780
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:08,428
Yes, you go and get your Maserati.
Can you move out of the way, then?Yep.

781
00:49:08,463 --> 00:49:12,249
But hang on, I can't do this until
you've gone, otherwise it's in the way.

782
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:17,268
What? I can't put the Maserati there before
you've gone, or they'd have to walk round
it. That's not right.

783
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:19,213
What are you talking about?

784
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:23,264
I can't put the Maserati in position until
you've left with the bride's mother. Why?

785
00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:25,257
Otherwise she'll come out
and get in the Maserati...

786
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:28,280
She won't, because we'll say,
"Don't get in the Maserati. "

787
00:49:28,315 --> 00:49:31,268
Then she has to walk around it,
and it's not right, trust me.

788
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,288
Meanwhile, I'd arrived
at the groom's house.

789
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:37,197
This is it.

790
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:41,296
But having never chauffeured before, I
didn't know whether to get him or wait in
the car.

791
00:49:41,331 --> 00:49:43,272
He wants to get
ready, take his time.

792
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,795
I'll, erm...

793
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,284
I'll hover here.

794
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:54,221
You've got half an hour to get
there, you've got to be...

795
00:49:54,256 --> 00:49:58,228
I've got to be late, yes. Yes, but a
tiny bit late, not your usual late.

796
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:00,193
No, no, I understand
the difference.

797
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:07,200
Whilst James was still deciding where to
put his car, the wedding party emerged.

798
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:09,241
I was going to back it
up and do it properly.

799
00:50:09,276 --> 00:50:13,288
Do you want to go in and come out while I
back it up? James,will you concentrate on
your job?

800
00:50:13,323 --> 00:50:17,264
This way, please. Don't look up her
skirt, don't look up her skirt.

801
00:50:21,204 --> 00:50:26,284
No, no, no! I'm in!
Thank you for averting your gaze.

802
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,177
Come on. Where is he?

803
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:32,288
Oh, you're already in! Sorry!

804
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:33,292
He's already in.

805
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,240
Good afternoon, everyone.

806
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:38,173
Oh, good afternoon.

807
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,185
I'm James, I shall be your driver.

808
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,268
This is the Maserati Quattroporte. Not the
original model, which had a slightly ropey
gearbox.

809
00:50:44,303 --> 00:50:48,212
This is the GTS, much
improved, as you shall see.

810
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:50,216
The key's stuck.

811
00:50:52,224 --> 00:50:56,185
Jeremy, meanwhile, was being
his usual charming self.

812
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:01,224
If I've got whiffy pits, I apologise, but
it is from wearing slightly hot trousers.

813
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:16,224
Come on, we're late, we're late!That's the
groom, that's the groom. He is the groom.

814
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:19,280
You're Steve? Yeah. Hi, Steve.
Sorry, mate, sorry.

815
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:21,275
And you're Sam, the best man?

816
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,236
Hiya. Hi, nice to see you.

817
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:29,221
Are we not going right to
the church? Yeah, you...

818
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:32,252
As we are a bit early, and obviously
you don't want to arrive early,

819
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:35,253
I thought we'd take a slightly
longer route, slightly scenic,

820
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:41,228
so that you can arrive at an appropriate
time and also enjoy the car a little bit on
the journey.

821
00:51:41,263 --> 00:51:45,236
Unfortunately, the bride's
father had never seen Top Gear.

822
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:48,173
That sounds really good, yeah.

823
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:53,200
Still, at least James
was driving sensibly.

824
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,268
Sport, sport plus.

825
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:59,209
I WILL get you to
the church on time.

826
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:03,252
As it turned out, my
passengers loved fast driving.

827
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,280
Wow!

828
00:52:07,228 --> 00:52:09,229
So a marriage, whoo!

829
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:11,278
It's a big 'un. It's the big day.

830
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:13,292
Think what you're taking on, man.

831
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:16,220
Life changes today. Today.

832
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,249
Yeah. For real.

833
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:19,201
It's amazing, isn't it, marriage?

834
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:23,220
You have the big day, the big
celebration, it's all exciting,

835
00:52:23,255 --> 00:52:27,208
and then one day it just
settles down into the norm,

836
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:29,217
day to day,

837
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:34,268
just every day...
after day... after day...

838
00:52:38,224 --> 00:52:42,216
You'll never get it to sound like this.
It's to do with the crank angle and
cylinders.

839
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:46,257
I never thought I'd be learning about
crank angles on the way to my wedding.

840
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:50,264
Sorry, I think I've taken the wrong exit
off that roundabout. Hang on a minute.

841
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:54,193
I guess we're going to check
out the road holding or...

842
00:52:54,228 --> 00:52:58,260
No, no, this isn't a test, I'm just...
Because I've done this loop, I'm not
absolutely sure...

843
00:52:58,295 --> 00:53:01,248
It must be the next one.

844
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:07,256
You're not getting nervous
now, are you? I am now.

845
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:09,228
I was feeling pretty relaxed but...

846
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:11,253
I'll help you with some music.

847
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:14,272
There you go... Oh, look,
it's not as easy as I'd hoped.

848
00:53:18,212 --> 00:53:20,237
We really have to get a move on.

849
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:25,181
Yeah, but I just want to find out,
can I drive the iPod from the stereo?

850
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:30,204
Oh, this is the most complicated thing I've
ever tried to do. Oh, no, that's just
impossible.

851
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,264
Hang on, I think I've got it.

852
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:35,742
# I'm not in love

853
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:39,185
# So don't forget it

854
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,256
# It's just a silly phase... #

855
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:44,276
Here we go! Power!

856
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,244
In the back, Jenson and Lewis
wanted even more from the Porsche.

857
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:52,261
Can't we go somewhere we
can go really fast? Yeah.

858
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:56,294
I have to say... Up to the airfield?
Oh, is there an airfield near here?

859
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:00,292
Yeah! Pull in there, do a circuit,
and then we don't mind being late.

860
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:02,309
Is she a calm bride?

861
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:04,257
She's been SO calm.

862
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:11,212
Because James May can drive somebody to
the edge of reason after three minutes.

863
00:54:12,224 --> 00:54:16,244
I'll turn round in the garden centre.
Sorry about that.

864
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:24,213
As the clock struck one, I
pulled up at the church.

865
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:29,284
I almost lost my dress then!
We made it, we made it, we made it.

866
00:54:33,276 --> 00:54:38,232
The bride's mother and chief bridesmaid
seemed very happy with my chauffeuring
skills.

867
00:54:38,267 --> 00:54:40,249
However, in Claire Rayner's car...

868
00:54:40,284 --> 00:54:43,780
# Whoo-hoo, no, baby,
please don't go... #

869
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:47,276
I mean it's like your
life, it's for life!

870
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:49,241
It is for life.

871
00:54:49,276 --> 00:54:53,264
Just stretching out
in front of you.

872
00:54:53,299 --> 00:54:55,261
Forever.

873
00:54:55,296 --> 00:54:57,248
Just going on... and on.

874
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,272
Amazingly, though, when Captain
Cheerful eventually arrived,

875
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:08,249
the groom was more
bothered about my trousers.

876
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:13,197
What are you wearing?
! I'm fine, nothing to see here.

877
00:55:13,232 --> 00:55:18,236
More worryingly, there was nothing
to see in terms of the bride either.

878
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,181
The relations are
starting to get angsty.

879
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:26,276
I can just feel eyes burrowing
into the back of my head.

880
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,204
I did look at the map
before I started off.

881
00:55:42,236 --> 00:55:43,288
Right, nearly there.

882
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:54,248
What hymns have you chosen?
The King Of Love My Shepherd Is.

883
00:55:54,283 --> 00:55:57,213
Very good.

884
00:55:57,248 --> 00:56:00,256
JAMES SINGS THE TUNE

885
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,284
CHURCH BELLS RING

886
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:09,240
Half one, half an hour
late now for the wedding.

887
00:56:10,268 --> 00:56:12,750
Look, there it is. Hmm?

888
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:15,197
The church was that way.

889
00:56:15,232 --> 00:56:18,252
Are you sure it was that way?
Yes. Yeah.

890
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:21,204
Completely, 100% sure.

891
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:26,201
We're now into something to two o'clock.
We're now nearer two o'clock...

892
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:30,209
We're nearer the next hour than the one
when they were supposed to be getting
married.

893
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:36,248
This would have been your last car journey
before you became a married woman, I hope
it was a good one.

894
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,257
That man, he is the
most colossal...

895
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:50,248
Where have you been?
We took a slightly scenic route.

896
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:54,193
The wedding party
hurried into the church.

897
00:56:54,228 --> 00:57:01,220
Explain yourself. What? How come you've
arrived 35 minutes late? It's fashionable
for the bride...

898
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:04,229
Yeah, you've obviously made an
impression, because they're all leaving.

899
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:10,224
They're really happy to have had you
driving, look at their cheery faces as they
walk off dabbing their eyes.

900
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,253
Did they like the Maserati?

901
00:57:11,288 --> 00:57:15,220
Loved it! Did they? Yeah, absolutely.
Did you love it?

902
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:17,272
I love it, top five cars.
What do we do now?

903
00:57:17,307 --> 00:57:19,213
Now we wait for them.
That's boring.

904
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:24,252
Actually, no, I tell you what. The bride's
mother told me on the way over there's an
airfield near here.

905
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:27,769
So? Well, is this a
Catholic wedding or...?

906
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:31,252
They'll be doing Dear
Lord and Father of...

907
00:57:31,287 --> 00:57:34,240
Drag race. Bagsie go in this.

908
00:57:34,275 --> 00:57:36,256
Drag race. Drag race.

909
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:41,248
So as the congregation
began its first hymn...

910
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:43,261
ENGINES ROAR

911
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:50,256
.. we headed off to the airfield
and set up our drag race.

912
00:57:51,264 --> 00:57:55,208
I'm sure most wedding
car drivers do this.

913
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:58,256
I wonder if they've done
the exhortations yet.

914
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:04,200
Go!

915
00:58:08,248 --> 00:58:10,232
Yes!

916
00:58:12,232 --> 00:58:15,197
Look at this go!

917
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:18,252
80, level-pegging with the Ast...
Oh, no, I'm not.

918
00:58:19,264 --> 00:58:23,260
Maserati sitting in my door
mirror here like an oil painting.

919
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:26,216
Come on, come on!

920
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:36,193
Even with James at the wheel,
that Porsche easily won.

921
00:58:36,228 --> 00:58:40,260
Since the race was over so quickly, I
decided there was time for another game.

922
00:58:40,295 --> 00:58:46,276
I bet I can do a longer powerslide
in that than you two can in these.

923
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:47,257
Good game?

924
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:50,288
Come on, it's a beautiful day,
we've got crash helmets on.

925
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,208
The back's coming out nicely,
and now bin it there!

926
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,261
Too much grip.

927
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:08,256
Our new game was excellent fun!

928
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:11,228
BELLS RING

929
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:15,225
TYRES SQUEAL

930
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,240
That's a good one!
What do you think of that, Hammond?

931
00:59:20,228 --> 00:59:24,248
And another championship-winning entry
from Hammond in the Maserati. Yeah.

932
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:34,228
Oh, yeah! Feeling
sick but looking good!

933
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:37,236
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

934
00:59:44,236 --> 00:59:49,256
I know... I know a lot of you will have
been looking at that and thinking it was
all a set-up,

935
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:50,257
they were actors.

936
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:54,237
Well, it really wasn't,
they really were a couple,

937
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:58,268
they really did get married that
day, and they really are here.

938
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,252
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steve and Ellie!

939
01:00:00,287 --> 01:00:01,221
APPLAUSE

940
01:00:01,256 --> 01:00:05,221
Congratulations!
Sorry! Really sorry.

941
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:10,185
Sorry we weren't there
when you came out.

942
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,240
Sorry about my mood on the day, it was
inappropriate, as it turned out. We're
sorry.

943
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:19,251
By way of an apology and as a token
of our appreciation, we've brought

944
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:24,228
you this memento so you can remember
the day every time you have a dump.

945
01:00:24,263 --> 01:00:25,296
LAUGHTER Congratulations!

946
01:00:27,296 --> 01:00:31,280
Congratulations. Thank you.

947
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:34,177
Excellent, excellent.

948
01:00:34,212 --> 01:00:38,228
We clubbed together to buy that,just so you
know. Ourselves. Your eternal happiness.

949
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:42,236
Anyway, it is now time for us to
decide which of these cars is best.

950
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:46,201
Quite easy for me, the
Maserati is idiotic, OK?

951
01:00:46,236 --> 01:00:50,260
After five minutes it would drive you mad,
and after five weeks it would fall to
pieces.

952
01:00:50,295 --> 01:00:53,268
But for me, by a country mile,
it's the one I'd have. Me too.

953
01:00:53,303 --> 01:00:56,229
Yeah, and me, by a long, long way.

954
01:00:56,264 --> 01:00:58,288
Yeah, so there we are, we
all agree on something.

955
01:00:58,323 --> 01:01:01,169
The worst car is the best.

956
01:01:01,204 --> 01:01:04,225
And on both those bombshell,
it's now time to end.

957
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:09,292
Thank you for watching. Not that you were,
because you were watching the football, but
there we are.

958
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:11,296
See you next week, though.
Take care, good night!

959
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,248
