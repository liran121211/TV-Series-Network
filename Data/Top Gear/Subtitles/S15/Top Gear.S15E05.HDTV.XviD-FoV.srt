1
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:15,580
Tonight, Cameron Diaz in
our reasonably priced car.

2
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,588
I repeat, Cameron Diaz in
our reasonably priced car.

3
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:23,069
Sorry, Stig, totally
BLEEPing it up!

4
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:26,516
And she's brought Tom Cruise along!

5
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:35,064
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

6
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,833
Hello and welcome!

7
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,568
That is later.

8
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,050
That is later.

9
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,473
But now...

10
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:45,517
we start once again with a letter.

11
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:49,544
It's from some Swedish youths
and it says, "Dear Top Gear,

12
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,489
"we are some Swedish youths,

13
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:55,576
"and we've been given the
run of a whole ski resort

14
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,489
"for a weekend.

15
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,564
"Do you a race fancy having?"

16
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:04,560
Plainly this was a job
for Richard Herring.

17
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:10,525
This is Riksgransen,

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,042
the world's
northernmost ski resort.

19
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:17,489
120 miles INSIDE the Arctic Circle.

20
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:22,520
It's so far north that the ski season
doesn't finish here until June,

21
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:25,469
when the rest of us
are on the beach.

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm here to defend the honour of the
car against some extreme snowmobilers

23
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:32,561
who are so extreme they're...
still in bed.

24
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:36,536
Still, meanwhile, let's meet the car
I've chosen to take them on with.

25
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:43,517
It's the Volkswagen Touareg.

26
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:48,564
A big off-roader that for many
years we've... absolutely hated.

27
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,564
We tested it when it first
came out, seven years ago.

28
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,509
And we didn't like a
lot of things about it.

29
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:59,552
The ride, the gearbox, the fact
you couldn't see out of the back.

30
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,537
We didn't like the
ridiculous thirst,

31
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,540
and we didn't like that
some of the design felt like

32
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,596
they'd done the most
un-German thing possible.

33
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,556
A half-arsed job.

34
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:15,505
But this is the brand new Touareg.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,524
And already I can report
many improvements.

36
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:21,508
You can, for instance,
see out of the back.

37
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,517
The ride is much smoother.

38
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:28,540
The gearbox, the old one changed
according to a geological timescale.

39
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:30,552
This new eight-speed affair

40
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:31,596
is a big improvement.

41
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,592
The Touareg also looks more
Golf-like than the old one.

42
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:41,505
And besides the full
off-road hardware,

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,540
standard kit includes sat-nav,
electric leather seats,

44
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:50,512
climate control, and a
ten-speaker stereo system.

45
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,561
But we've come here to race

46
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:56,564
so none of that is
important right now.

47
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,575
What is important is
that the new Touareg

48
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,552
weighs 200 kilograms
less than the old one.

49
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,540
Which makes it altogether
more sprightly.

50
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:10,548
This is a 3.5 litre
V6 turbo diesel.

51
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,533
Cost, L37,000,

52
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,477
0 to 60 in 7.8 seconds,

53
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,548
so it's faster than the old one.

54
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,557
Top speed, 136 mph.

55
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:21,500
So you're better off there, too.

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,596
All in all, I think this is the
machine to take the snowmobilers on

57
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,549
in our big race.

58
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,544
Which, as they're still in
bed playing computer games,

59
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,588
will happen tomorrow.

60
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,545
So, race day.

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,524
And I'll confess, I
went to bed last night

62
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,525
full of confidence.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,564
And then, in the middle of the night,
I sort of got cold feet about it.

64
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,580
So I got up, got dressed, came
downstairs, and I made... this.

65
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,465
It's still a Touareg.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,528
But one built to take
on the infamous Dakar.

67
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:04,481
The toughest rally in the world.

68
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:08,046
With a carbon fibre
body, bionic suspension,

69
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,330
and a twin-turbo, 300
horsepower, diesel engine,

70
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,950
it can do 130 mph over
just about any terrain.

71
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:20,786
It's also the first diesel
ever to win the Dakar.

72
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:24,588
Which is odd, given that I
built it only last night.

73
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:29,572
But no matter, I think this
is probably the better tool

74
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,524
to see off those snowmobilers,

75
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,532
who have finally emerged.

76
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,564
They are Daniel Bodin and Dan Lang.

77
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:40,549
Local snowmobile legends

78
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:45,552
whose racing skills have won them
silver medals at the X-Games.

79
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,592
Best let them get it
out of their system.

80
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,524
'Eventually the teenagers
calm down long enough

81
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,544
'for me to explain the race route

82
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,477
'across the ski resort. '

83
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,481
Right, we're going
to start from here.

84
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,588
Then we're going to move around
here, sweep around there,

85
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:07,592
down there, then
eventually we'll finish

86
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:10,091
with a sprint across the ice lake,

87
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,556
end up, finish line,
at the ski shop.

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,580
So, that's 12 gruelling
miles down ski slopes,

89
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,552
through forests, and
across frozen water.

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,521
Yeah? Happy?

91
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,060
Yeah. Fine with that. OK. Good.

92
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:28,564
Um... where is here, exactly?

93
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,536
It's up there.

94
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:39,556
Oooh. Yeah!

95
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,529
ENGINES REV

96
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:43,508
All right. Fair enough.

97
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,516
Ooh, erm, I guess, 3...
2... 1... go?

98
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,540
Right, come on.

99
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,493
0 to 60 in this, about six seconds.

100
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:10,528
This thing has more torque
than a Lamborghini Gallardo.

101
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:11,572
Have they got that? No!

102
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,544
'We plunged out of the
clouds neck and neck. '

103
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:25,504
I have taken the precaution of
fitting it with studded snow tyres.

104
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,596
Obviously I did that.

105
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,524
Come on! Find grip!

106
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,516
Blimey! Where have they...?

107
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,549
'The snowmobilers promptly vanished

108
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:45,584
'because whilst I had to
stick to the ski runs,

109
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,556
'they didn't. '

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,568
Come on, you've crossed the
desert, you can do this.

111
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:12,576
'As it turned out, the
Dakar was as fast on snow

112
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,568
'as it would be on sand. '

113
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,528
Oh, yes! That worked!

114
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,465
I thank you!

115
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,538
'So when I hit the lower slopes,

116
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,576
'we were still neck and neck. '

117
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,576
'I then decided to
take a short cut.

118
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:35,500
'Which went well. '

119
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,500
Oh! Oh!

120
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,584
This is going to cost me time!

121
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,572
Move, move, move!

122
00:07:55,556 --> 00:08:01,524
'Despite my cock-up, I was just ahead
as we entered the forest stage. '

123
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:02,517
Yee-hah-hah!

124
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,556
Keep up with that, then, boys!

125
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:10,552
'But the teenagers were able to
whizz off between the trees. '

126
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,564
Come on! Where the hell are they?

127
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:24,508
'Which meant they had the lead as we
reached the final part of the race,

128
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:28,544
'a six-mile dash across
the frozen lake. '

129
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,553
Ooh, tree.

130
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:33,588
Come on, come on!

131
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:38,541
Yes, finally!

132
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:42,500
I've got the top speed
of best part of 130 mph.

133
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:45,508
This is where I have the advantage.

134
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,580
'But up ahead, the snowmobilers
could still hit 90 mph.

135
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:54,580
'So I'd have to give it
everything to close the gap. '

136
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:01,520
This is where the
race is won or lost.

137
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:02,568
This thing's got some grip!

138
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,576
I'm just floating over this stuff.

139
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:17,056
'With less than four miles to go

140
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,520
'the snowmobilers
were still ahead. '

141
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:20,540
Where are they?!

142
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:27,536
'But then, joy of joys, the snow
on the ice started to thin out. '

143
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,545
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

144
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,540
Their machines will
have problems on this

145
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,557
because the belts
themselves overheat

146
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:38,544
running on straight ice, so
they can't give it everything.

147
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,564
'And sure enough, they
started slowing down. '

148
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,596
I'm going to catch them!

149
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:52,473
That's them! That's them! Oh, yes!

150
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,564
Oh, yes! What do you think of that?
Yee-hah-hah-hah!

151
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:02,541
'The snow on the
lake thickened again,

152
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:05,528
'and the snowmobilers
were back in the game.

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,481
'But now the Touareg
had the edge. '

154
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,050
That, I think, is the
finish line. That's it!

155
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,549
This thing has conquered
sand and desert,

156
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:20,524
now it's conquered snow,
mountains and frozen lakes.

157
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,552
I'm going to win!

158
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:26,560
Yes! Yes!

159
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:29,489
Ha-ha!

160
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:33,560
I did it! It's won through!

161
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:34,596
What a machine!

162
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,508
You've got to be...!

163
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,548
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

164
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:48,528
I could've done that.
I could've done that.

165
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,529
What?!

166
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,529
Did you... did you win that?

167
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:57,500
Yes. Yes, I did. I'll admit they
did finish with a bit more of a...

168
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:58,520
flourish, thing, there,

169
00:10:58,555 --> 00:10:59,517
but I won.

170
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:02,489
I'm not really interested
in whether you won or not,

171
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:05,528
I'm interested in that bit where
they said that their tracks,

172
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,537
on their snowmobiles, got hot,

173
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:09,477
cos they were running on ice.

174
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:12,500
Yes. And they told you that?
Yeah, it's the friction.

175
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:13,572
Ice generates a lot of friction,

176
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,549
so they heat up.

177
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,588
If you slide over
ice in your clothes,

178
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,481
they'll actually burn off you.

179
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:21,588
Do they also tell you things
like, Jimi Hendrix was in Abba?

180
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,589
No! It's... Did theysay
that a Volvo 244

181
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:27,521
holds the lap record
at the Nurburgring?

182
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:31,552
No, stop, it's true, and you know
full well it is. Let's do the news.

183
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:35,509
No. What I'm going to do is put
a piece of ice down the front

184
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:39,530
of your trousers, to see if it sets
fire to your gentleman's sausage.

185
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,516
No! I'm not saying ice is hot, just,
it can create a lot of friction!

186
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:47,544
This is science, and you
don't understand that.

187
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,512
So leave it, it's true.
OK? Yes. Yeah.

188
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:51,513
Anyway, let's do the news.

189
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:55,465
Oh, now, hey. This is an
important piece of news.

190
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,532
A lot of people imagine the most
dangerous time of year to drive

191
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,536
is... November, or
perhaps February,

192
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,497
dark nights, fog, ice.

193
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:06,504
But we were talking about this and
we think THE most dangerous time

194
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,561
to drive a car, is roundabout now.

195
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:12,588
Sunny skies, light breezes,
girls wearing short skirts.

196
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:15,485
Dangerous. Very dangerous.

197
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,596
Cos the thing is, you can't notlook.
No. You actually can't.

198
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:20,113
You can't physically not look.
You have no choice.

199
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:22,561
There are other things
you can choose not to do.

200
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:27,580
It's easy not to use your mobile while
driving, easy not to drive after 18 pints
of lager,

201
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:30,585
but you're driving along and, "
There's a girl, mustn't look...

202
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,556
"I'm looking, I'm looking, I've
crashed, I'm still looking!"

203
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:36,473
Do you have any idea
what we're on about?

204
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:39,525
I drove through Soho the
other night, honestly,

205
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,544
you know Linda Blair in the Exorcist?
My head was just...

206
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,580
spinning around! 180 degrees!
Crashing into lampposts,

207
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:46,560
letterboxes, and other cars!

208
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:48,557
It's impossible not to!

209
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,561
The thing is, we know
that Germaine Greer

210
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:53,512
is actually an avid
viewer of Top Gear, and...

211
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,576
Is she? No, she really is.
In your mind.

212
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:56,561
No, she is!

213
00:12:56,596 --> 00:13:00,550
Anyway, she will be annoyed
about this but the fact is,

214
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:04,469
what we're trying to say is we
can't help it, it's natural,

215
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,520
I mean, in the last three days I've
nearly had two quite serious accidents...

216
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:10,465
Even James May is
susceptible to it! Even me!

217
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,556
That's proof! Yeah, but it was
roadworkers he was looking at! Ha-ha!

218
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:18,481
Actually, do you not think there
is here a case for the burka?

219
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:22,500
Aaah. Because the problem goes away...
The burka? No. No, honestly.

220
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,521
The burka doesn't work.

221
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:27,529
Cos I was in a cab in
Piccadilly the other day, OK?

222
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:31,489
A woman in a full burka crossing
the road in front of the cab,

223
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:35,520
tripped over the pavement, went head
over heels... Base over apex. Yeah.

224
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:39,540
And up it came, red
G-string, stockings...

225
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:42,540
Mate, that did NOT happen!

226
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:44,549
I promise! I promise!

227
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:49,564
No! It did! Did you see
thisincident on DVD or pay per view?

228
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,544
The taxi driver will back
me up on that. He will.

229
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,469
He was in the cinema with you?

230
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,521
That never happened.
It did! Never happened.

231
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:04,508
Next week, Jeremy visits a hospital,
and a nurses top falls off.

232
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,545
In Jeremy's mind.

233
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,556
Now, normally, OK, normally
I wouldn't bring this up.

234
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:14,532
But Citroen UK has appointed
a new sales director, OK?

235
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,520
And his name is Charles Peugeot.

236
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,561
No, it isn't!

237
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:23,489
I have photographic
proof, from Citroen,

238
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:26,561
"Charles Peugeot".
It is! What were they thinking?!

239
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:30,588
What's his e-mail address going
to be, charles. peugeot@citroen?

240
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,477
So stupid!

241
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:35,568
Hang on, hang on, what if
there are lots of people

242
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,548
called Charles Peugeot
working at Citroen?

243
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,528
So he ends up being charles...

244
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,548
.. charles. peugeot405.

245
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:48,046
Sorry, it wasn't worth it.

246
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:51,493
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH

247
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:57,485
Hey, now, as we know, there's a
lot of chat around at the moment

248
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,505
about cars that can run on biofuels
or on electricity or on hydrogen.

249
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,580
But we wondering, "I wonder if it would be
possible to make a car that ran on cheese
and onion crisps?"

250
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,509
LAUGHTER

251
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,465
Corn beef salad.

252
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,544
And do you know what? We found a
Porsche, or rather, Hammond has,

253
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:17,553
that can.

254
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:21,508
This is it. And the first thing
you'll notice is it's covered

255
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:25,497
in this space-age foil stuff.

256
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:29,576
Back here, there's this massive
wing, all very traditional Porsche,

257
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:32,513
but, under here, nothing.

258
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:36,580
Because this is the
first mid-engine 911.

259
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,524
And what an engine it is.

260
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:54,521
So right now it's
running on Frosties

261
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:58,030
and one of those
chocolatey croissant things

262
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:01,469
and a cup of coffee.
But it could equally run on

263
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:04,552
fish and chips I had last
night or a big bag of Quavers.

264
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:07,564
Really anything that
the driver can eat.

265
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,485
OK, first corner coming up.

266
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,521
The good thing about
this, of course,

267
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,540
plenty of time to be
precise about your lines.

268
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,469
CHEERING

269
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:22,481
It's amazing!

270
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:23,568
It's absolutely superb.

271
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,477
Fabulous.

272
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:31,532
It is a completely convincing 911,really,
isn't it?It is. It was made in Austria -

273
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,541
sadly, it is a one-off.
It lives in a museum now.

274
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,516
But it's fabulous and I
did do a whole lap in it.

275
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,533
What was your time?
Well, I did it in...

276
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:43,548
18 minutes... and 37 seconds!
Yeah! LAUGHTER

277
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,520
CHEERING

278
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,528
It's down here. It's down here.

279
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:55,552
But I'm proud.

280
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:58,568
Well done.

281
00:16:58,603 --> 00:16:59,545
Thank you.

282
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,477
Since we're on the
subject of the lap board,

283
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:07,524
we thought we would take a moment to share
some happy memories of an old friend.

284
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:18,584
If you look back at all the amazing things
we've done with the Bugatti Veyron...

285
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,541
HE LAUGHS

286
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:25,500
.. you could be forgiven for thinking
it's the fastest car on the planet.

287
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:30,533
The fact is, though,
it isn't, you see,

288
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:34,473
because this car will
do 253 miles per hour,

289
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:37,580
but there's now a car in America
called the Shelby Ultimate Aero...

290
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:44,088
.. that will do 256 miles per hour.
So that, officially,

291
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:48,588
is the world's fastest production
car, not this old knocker.

292
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,532
The Germans are not pleased.

293
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,552
So, behind closed doors,
in the Bugatti skunk works,

294
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,500
they've created this...

295
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:10,493
It's called the Super Sport.

296
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:14,552
It's the Veyron's last hurrah and it's
been built with just one purpose...

297
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:21,524
To be the undisputed fastest
production car ever made.

298
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,532
On this car, the 0-60 time is the same
as it is on the standard Bugatti Veyron -

299
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:36,053
2.5 seconds. But after that,
all is utterly changed.

300
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:40,505
0-100 miles per hour now
takes just 4.5 seconds,

301
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,473
which is the same as the 0-60
time of a Porsche 911 GT3.

302
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:53,504
And this will go on to an alleged
top speed of 258 miles per hour.

303
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:00,596
Naturally, that means the
Super Sport has more power.

304
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:06,550
The standard Veyron famously
has 1,000 horsepower.

305
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:10,509
The Super Sport's version
has 1, 200 horsepower.

306
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:14,584
So why, you might wonder, does
it need the power of a Golf GTI

307
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:18,556
added to it, just to do
another five miles per hour?

308
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,489
Well, the reasons are
quite complicated

309
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,576
and I've been barred by the producer
from explaining them properly.

310
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:29,504
So here instead is the
primary school explanation.

311
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:40,532
Well, the issue is the air, which has
genuine substance once you're trying to
move through it.

312
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,050
The faster you go, the thicker
the air effectively becomes.

313
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,549
At 100 miles per hour, it's
like aerosol whipped cream,

314
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:55,504
but at 200 miles per hour, it's
more like a very thick treacle.

315
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,021
And at 250 miles per
hour, it's like...

316
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:00,504
trying to drive
through a fruitcake.

317
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:09,556
And cutting through the fruitcake
requires more than just brute force,

318
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:14,512
which is why this Veyron has
a new super slippery body.

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,541
And a new super high price.

320
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:24,536
Up from L1 million to L1.6 million.

321
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:30,501
Anyway, big, fast Shelby
American car thingy,

322
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:35,544
your gauntlet has now been picked up
by the one they call de langsamer -

323
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,592
the Slow One. Captain Slow, to you.

324
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:45,572
The setting for this judgement day run
is Volkswagen's top-secret test track...

325
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,517
at Ehra-Lessien - a massive complex

326
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:54,552
built in a former Cold War no-fly
zone near the old East German border.

327
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:59,553
At its heart is this
13-mile oval-shaped track,

328
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:05,517
which includes this 5.5-mile
arrow-straight straight.

329
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:11,544
It's one of very few places on earth where
you can actually max a Bugatti Veyron.

330
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,558
Nothing was left to chance
by the Bugatti boffins.

331
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,537
We even had to wait until
the middle of the day

332
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:29,536
when the air was at its thinnest before I
was finally given the all-clear to run.

333
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,501
There's one thing making
me slightly apprehensive.

334
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:36,513
I said, "How long do the tyres
last at 258 miles per hour?"

335
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:41,580
And they said, "Well, we know how long they
last at 248 miles per hour - it's 37 miles.
"

336
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:45,493
I said, "Yeah, but what
about 258 miles per hour?"

337
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:50,572
What they actually said to me was, "Ask an
admiral how deep his submarines can really
go.

338
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,532
"He doesn't know
until they try it. "

339
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:03,528
As I ventured onto the track, I was quite
glad that they aren't ordinary tyres,

340
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:07,477
but ones that cost L20,000 a set.

341
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:11,512
I do feel a nervousness about
that extra five miles per hour.

342
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:19,004
It takes me beyond the known
borders of car performance.

343
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,504
I'm hanging my ass over the
ragged edge like Chuck Yeager.

344
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,516
Anyway, concentrate.

345
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:31,493
'The super-accurate
speedo read in kilometres

346
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:36,545
'so the magic number we'd be looking
for is 414 kilometres per hour. '

347
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,572
If I reach maximum speed, I'll be drinking
fuel at the rate of 1.7 gallons a minute.

348
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:46,572
The radiators will be sucking
through four tonnes of air an hour.

349
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:51,065
Just before the 5.5-mile
straight is some steep banking,

350
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,524
which I'd have to enter at
exactly 125 miles per hour.

351
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,520
Then I have to change down as
I pass a series of bollards,

352
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:04,500
ready to give it the beans
as I come out the other end.

353
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,520
Here we go. Here's the banking.

354
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:11,524
Here comes the first bollard.

355
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:14,536
Change down one.

356
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:19,520
Here's a bollard. Change down two.

357
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:24,528
Here's a bollard.
Change down three times.

358
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:27,536
Godspeed, Captain Slow!

359
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,473
Whoa!

360
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:33,572
Bloody hell, look at
the speed of that!

361
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,544
Doing 258... 260.. I'm going
faster than I can speak! 300!

362
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,560
320!

363
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:47,524
That is amazing! It's so stable.
I'm already up to 340.

364
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:51,592
Bloody Nora!

365
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:57,548
It's unbelievable! Look how
fast everything's going past!

366
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,465
There's 400.

367
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,516
'In Queen's English, that's
248 miles per hour. '

368
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:09,548
Come on, come on, come on!

369
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,505
I'm past my old record.

370
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,548
'Now we were into the unknown. '

371
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,588
Slightly twitchy.

372
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:30,524
Come on! Come on!

373
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:35,588
Yes! I think I may
have whupped your ass.

374
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:38,533
Whoo-hoo!

375
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,568
'And the speedo kept climbing. '

376
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,572
417!

377
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:00,588
HE LAUGHS

378
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,544
HE LAUGHS

379
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:08,564
Whoo-hoo!

380
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:12,532
Bloody hell, that was exciting.

381
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,485
CHEERING

382
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,516
Hang on. No, no, wait!

383
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:25,536
No!

384
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:27,545
I'm sorry...

385
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,596
Are you seriously suggesting that now we
open the Guinness Book of World Records

386
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:37,536
and it says, "Fastest man
on earth - James May?"

387
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:40,489
LAUGHTER Not exactly.

388
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:44,493
What do you mean, not exactly?
Well, after I'd done my run,

389
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:48,524
Bugatti sent a test driver out, because
they thought he'd like a crack at it,

390
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,564
and this is what happened.

391
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,513
So there he goes.

392
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,564
He's got to do a run in each
direction and take an average.

393
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,572
There's my old record already gone.

394
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,536
As we can see, the
speedo is still climbing.

395
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:03,541
There's him celebrating.

396
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:06,556
I added my congratulations
soon afterwards.

397
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:08,516
Damn him!

398
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,540
So he obviously did it both w
ays,which you have to do. Yup.

399
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:20,512
What was his average, then?
431 kilometres per hour.

400
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:25,528
What's that in Church
of England?267...

401
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:26,497
Oooh.

402
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:29,532
In a car with windscreen wipers?
And a CD player!

403
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,561
In a road car? That's staggering.

404
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:36,504
We ought to find out, really, how
fast this goes round the track.

405
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,560
Anybody want to see that?

406
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,505
Yes!

407
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,544
OK, that, of course, means handing
over to our racing driver.

408
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:47,548
Some say the Scottish released
him a little bit too soon.

409
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,560
LAUGHTER

410
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:54,548
And that he spent all
week pushing an effigy

411
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:58,500
of Rubens Barrichello
through his desk fan.

412
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,529
LAUGHTER

413
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:02,548
What we know is,
he's called the Stig!

414
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:09,544
And he's off and just look how fast
that thing fires off the line -

415
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,505
smoking all four tyres.

416
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,500
OK, first corner. Simply flies into
those, almost cartoonishly fast.

417
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,501
Just sensational.

418
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,500
"Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees

419
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:25,520
And in the midst of
this ferocious speed

420
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:27,517
still has a stereo to listen to.

421
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:30,537
Takes it gently round Chicago,
now popping off the limiter,

422
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:35,520
Hammerhead, air brake goes vertical
generating 0.7G of braking -

423
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:38,469
same as the actual
brakes of a Fiesta.

424
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:42,532
50 kilos lighter than the original
Veyron but still a heavy car.

425
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,541
# Staying alive, staying alive... #

426
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:48,580
Your brain honestly can barely
take in how fast this thing is.

427
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:52,548
What's really weird is it
hardly makes any noise. Listen!

428
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,489
Just staggering. Two corners to go.

429
00:27:55,524 --> 00:28:00,465
Here we go. Using all the
grip of those 20 grand tyres.

430
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,552
This is the Stig on maximum attack
and there he is, across the line!

431
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:05,577
CHEERING

432
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:07,568
So...

433
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:15,545
Here's the old Veyron 1.18.3.

434
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,572
We're expecting this to bea
little bit faster. Yup.

435
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:21,529
But is it fast enough...
? Well, look at these.

436
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:25,500
These are the ones - 17s.
The Gumpert, the Ascari and so on.

437
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:27,596
Well, this one, the Super
Sport, did it in 1...

438
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:31,036
.. 16.8.

439
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:32,489
Oh!

440
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,040
Fastest car ever...

441
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:35,521
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

442
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:38,497
.. ever... to go round our track.

443
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:44,512
Now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

444
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:46,540
We had a bit of a
problem, if we're honest,

445
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,536
because we had Jedward booked.

446
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:50,473
LAUGHTER

447
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:54,500
At the last minute, they pulled out.
So we rang Cameron Diaz...

448
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:55,521
LAUGHTER

449
00:28:55,556 --> 00:29:00,500
We did. We said, "Would you mind awfully
coming on the show?" She said, "Sure. Love
to.

450
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:02,500
"But only if I can
bring Tom Cruise. "

451
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:03,553
LAUGHTER

452
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:07,066
So, ladies and gentlemen,
here on this...

453
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:10,544
pokey motoring show
on BBC Two... LAUGHTER

454
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:11,596
Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise!

455
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:14,500
CHEERING

456
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:21,544
How are you? Fine, yourself?
How are you?

457
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,540
CHEERING DROWNS SPEECH

458
00:29:28,552 --> 00:29:30,556
Do have a seat.

459
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,552
Thank you. That's a bitof a reaction!
I know! It was a lot of fun.

460
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:40,501
Can I just say, what
staggers me is, sitting here,

461
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:45,588
it's almost like I've been joined by the
genetic blueprint for the human race with
these two.

462
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,525
What do you think?LAUGHTER

463
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,513
In design, in evolution, we'll reach
a point where they look like this.

464
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:57,524
Cos how do you know...? You embark on
acting when you're in your late teens.

465
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,543
How do you know that
later on in life

466
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:03,528
you aren't going to become, well...

467
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:07,564
For instance, Tom, why
don't you have ear hair?

468
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,517
Next time I come on the
show I'll be like this.

469
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:13,564
And then it'll go at the back...
Curling it and trimming it.

470
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,541
Cos it's not like either of you
have taken care of yourself.

471
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:22,512
You've broken every bonein your body over
the years. I've broken my nose a couple of
times

472
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:27,532
and fingers and my
leg and toes, ribs.

473
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:29,537
And you do your own stunts.

474
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:34,568
You are proud of the fact that youdo a lot
of jumping up and downand falling off
things. Yeah,

475
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,087
I do most of them.

476
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:37,572
Do they hurt? Yeah.

477
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,493
LAUGHTER

478
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:42,477
Yes, some of them REALLY hurt.

479
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:46,596
And you would have thought you would
have looked in a mirror and thought,

480
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:49,545
"I'm quite good looking, I'd
better take care of this. "

481
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,596
How many times have you broken yournose?
Well, it started very early, I was 11.

482
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:57,520
I broke my nose four
times since I was 11.

483
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,536
Four? Yes. Four times. Four times.

484
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:02,520
BLEEP finds my face.

485
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:05,548
It just does. Can you say
thaton television here?

486
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,596
OK.

487
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:20,030
Now, the new movie, Knight And Day,

488
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:22,477
my kind of film, I have to say.

489
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:26,500
Everything explodes, lots
of close-ups of Cameron,

490
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:27,477
and you're funny.

491
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:32,524
Is this comedy, is this a new...
Obviously not for you. She was so funny.

492
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,473
I've done a few comedies.

493
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:38,540
You had the gentleman juicein
your hair. Yes, I did.

494
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:40,521
One of the great comedy
moments of our time.

495
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:43,592
It didn't take very long
for it to get there either.

496
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:46,560
It just was a very quick...
LAUGHTER

497
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:51,541
What I meant was... No...

498
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:56,528
This is why I love Cameron, I have to tell
you. It's so much fun working with her.

499
00:31:56,563 --> 00:32:00,481
Yeah. No, but I love comedy.
The comedy stuff...

500
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:04,580
I started with Risky Business and I've
always had comedic elements in different
characters.

501
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:09,561
I've had some intense films over the years
and I really want to do some comedy now.

502
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:14,580
I was excited to do this film because of
the comedy and the adventure and working
with Cameron.

503
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,497
I love doing comedy.

504
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:21,508
We've put a trailer together. OK.
So let's have a look at that.

505
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:16,045
I want to talk about this guy.

506
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,548
He was some sort of secret agent.

507
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,533
Oh, no, no, no...
Hi, June. Who are you?

508
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,528
This is the guy. I'm the guy.
It's the guy. I'm the guy!

509
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,549
For your own safety,
please stay in the booth.

510
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:33,584
What are you talking... Stay there,
or I kill myself and then her.

511
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,504
Rodney... Rodney!

512
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:39,540
Shot you through and through, Nowhere
near the femoral artery. It's all good.

513
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:42,500
Might even get a promotion. Good?

514
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,588
On your own, your life
expectancy is like here.

515
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:52,592
With me, it's here.
With me, without me.

516
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,592
On three. Ready? Uh-huh. One...

517
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:09,544
Sorry, I panicked.
What numberwould you like? Three.

518
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,572
Let's just stick with three.
It's good. OK.

519
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,544
CHEERING

520
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:19,576
Um...

521
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:26,504
I'm sorry about this.
You look great in it but the thing is,

522
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,584
in the movie, you restore
muscle cars for a living.

523
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:32,596
This is pornography. What?

524
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,485
What is it you have to
check in at the airport?

525
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,473
Triple Deuce. A carburetor.
A Triple Deuce carburetor.

526
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:48,568
Do you find this as well?When girls start
talking about... About cars and engines.

527
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:50,536
Ohhhhhh...!

528
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,520
Could you say a six-barrel
carburettor for a '66 Vette?

529
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:58,572
A six-barrel carburetor
for a '66 Vette.

530
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:04,532
I'm actually having a crisis.

531
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,509
Do you put a lot of effort into
choosing the cars you use in movies?

532
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:16,544
For example, in this movie, was there a lot
of effort went into the cars that were used?

533
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:20,501
It's fun. We all sit around
and talk about which cars

534
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:26,541
and motorcycles. We look at the train
and we line up a bunch of bikes

535
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:31,584
and we look at the stunts that we're going
to develop, if there's going to be a lot of
jumps.

536
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,595
We used the Ducati on this one.

537
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,537
You were on cobbled streets...

538
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:40,552
We needed a lighter motorcycle, we needed
something I could hold Cameron around.

539
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:44,500
That's a stunt I've been wanting
to do for many, many years.

540
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:45,549
LAUGHTER

541
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,580
Have Cameron, you know...
It's not just you in this,

542
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:51,497
you were doing your own
stuntsas well. Yes.

543
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:55,524
There's this great scene where the
GTO, the daddy of muscle cars,

544
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,481
and you're flicking it around allover
the place. It's a lot of fun.

545
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:04,512
One of the things was, you often see actors
coming on, saying, "Yeah, I did my own
stunts",

546
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:09,508
so I thought it would be a good ideato say,
"Come on, Cameron,take me out on the track.
" Yeah.

547
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:13,576
Anybody want to see... I do. AUDIENCE: Yeah.
Let's have a look at this.

548
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:20,532
This is just about as
good as life gets, really.

549
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:25,500
It's going. You've got it.

550
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:33,552
CHEERING

551
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,584
Thank you, Jeremy.

552
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,513
See? You see?

553
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:41,596
All you've got to do is go
like this and "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

554
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:43,477
Yeah.

555
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,584
How much fun is that?
I was vomiting.

556
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:51,584
What cars do you drive to the shops in?
What are you everyday cars?

557
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,568
Right now, I mostly... I drive
a lot of motorcycles right now.

558
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:58,057
Bikes? Recently, a lot
ofmotorcycles. He does.

559
00:35:58,092 --> 00:36:01,308
So what have you got?
Let's run through them.

560
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:03,967
I have a '34 Indian.
1934, that my wife bought me

561
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:06,592
that used to belong to Steve
McQueen. There you go.

562
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:08,557
That's actually it, is it? Yep.

563
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:12,529
That was Steve McQueen's old Indian? Yeah.
What I'm interested in,

564
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:18,528
this Virus, it looks the mostincredible
bike I've ever seen. It is incredible.

565
00:36:18,563 --> 00:36:21,577
That bike is beautiful.
Where's it made? Italy.

566
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,557
And you have to be measuredfor
this, do you? Yes.

567
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:28,504
They do your measurements and
build it to your specifications,

568
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:30,512
my height and weight
and how I like to ride.

569
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:31,557
So it's a tailored bike.

570
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:34,465
Yeah, that's a tailored bike.

571
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,028
Do you like bikes, Cameron?No, I don't.
I ride on the back of them very well.

572
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:43,556
It's a good way of dealing withthe
paparazzi if you've got... The helmet on.

573
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:46,588
I wear a helmet when I drive
my Prius You've got a Prius?!

574
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:51,493
I love the PriusLAUGHTER

575
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:55,580
So what cars... I thought it wasyour
favourite car. It IS my favourite car.

576
00:36:55,615 --> 00:36:58,588
Is that what you drive in and
out of town? We expect it.

577
00:36:58,623 --> 00:37:00,560
I'm married to my Prius.

578
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,596
Love it.

579
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,501
I discovered you had a Mustang
Celine, the tuned Mustang.

580
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:15,532
The other Mustang that I'm
interested in of yours is your P-51,

581
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,047
which is a WWll fighter
rather than a car.

582
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:22,493
I just love... I grew up
and we travelled a lot

583
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:26,505
and every time we travelled I had a
picture of a Spitfire and a P-51.

584
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,576
As a little boy I'd fall asleep looking
at the pictures of airplanes on my wall

585
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,537
and I always wanted to fly it.

586
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:39,513
Years later I got my licence
and started flying aerobatics

587
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,469
just to train on taildraggers so
that one day I could fly a P-51.

588
00:37:43,504 --> 00:37:48,540
Have you ever been in those fast jets that
you flew in Top Gun? Yes. You flew in the
F-... 15, yeah.

589
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,549
I flew in the F-14. The Navy one.

590
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:55,497
I flew also in the F-16 in Korea.
Can I just ask...

591
00:37:55,532 --> 00:38:00,576
This is really embarrassing, because
it's Tom Cruise... Did you puke?

592
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:02,556
Yes, I did.

593
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:07,485
I had three flights in one day.

594
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,526
Actually, when you see the film,
some of the shots are in the airplane

595
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:15,532
and we were doing heavy air combat
manoeuvres. My pilot's name was Bozo

596
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:20,508
and I had the bag right there,
so I leaned down to fill the bag

597
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:25,465
and as I leaned down, he
pulled up, went right up.

598
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,504
My head was on the floor and I'm
trying to hit the mic and I'm going

599
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:35,548
"Mother! Mother!
" My head is banging on the floor,

600
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,481
pulling up...

601
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:41,040
I finally came up and I
said, "What are you doing?"

602
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:44,564
He says, "Well they don't
call me Bozo for nothing. "

603
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,525
Anyway, obviously, you came here

604
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,580
to see how fast you could driveour
reasonably priced cararound our track.
Absolutely.

605
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:58,560
You're 33 films, you're 30, I think
this is the peak of your career now.

606
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,560
I'm thinking of maybe
Cameron's lap first of all.

607
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:08,584
Yeah? Ladies first?
Good idea?AUDIENCE: Yes!

608
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,508
OK, let's have a look.

609
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:16,524
So we're off, and
that's a good start.

610
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,576
That's a good look.

611
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:19,481
Here we go.

612
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:21,561
How do you manage to suit a helmet?

613
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:25,540
Nobody looks good in a helmet.
She looks good in a helmet.

614
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:31,500
That's perfect.

615
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:35,548
Ugh, that's fifth.

616
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:38,548
These BLEEP English gears.

617
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:44,588
They're Korean, actually.
To be honest, they're Korean gears.

618
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:50,512
Sorry, Stig, totally BLEEP it up.

619
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:55,564
He's never heard that word.
No?He doesn't know it exists.

620
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,520
Now, did you keep it in the lines?

621
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,596
Poetry, in essence.

622
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,532
BLEEP me!

623
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,592
Corner.

624
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,512
BLEEP

625
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,500
Some of this is broadcastable.

626
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:17,561
Was that flat out through there?

627
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:21,537
Are you flat out?
You didn'tlift off? It's flat out.

628
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:25,540
Flat out, and then that's a
beautiful line through there.

629
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:31,520
The traditional cee'd understeer
and there we are, across the line.

630
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,532
APPLAUSE

631
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:35,528
Very good.

632
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:42,465
What is it? What is it?
What is it? What is it?

633
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,508
Tell me, tell me, what is my time? I think
we'll look at Tom's lapfirst, shall we?

634
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:54,512
Who wants to see Tom's lap?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

635
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,040
TYRES SQUEAL

636
00:40:58,075 --> 00:41:00,500
Nice start.

637
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,536
And coming up now
to the first corner.

638
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,544
That's a serious looking face.

639
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:09,576
I'm going, "Is this third gear?
"That's what I kept doing.

640
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:12,493
That's quite an interesting
line through there.

641
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:16,516
The Formula 1 drivers come out really
wide but Stig thinks that's right.

642
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:18,512
See if I can get
this to turn right.

643
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:22,544
Let's have a look. Ooh, that's...

644
00:41:23,536 --> 00:41:25,541
That's a lesson in how to do it.

645
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:28,556
Now Hammerhead. This is the
hardest corner of the lot.

646
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:31,561
Did you stay in the
lines like Cameron did?

647
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:34,532
No. You see, Cameron,
you can grin there.

648
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,576
Now, we're flat out here
all the way to the end.

649
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,512
Nice gearbox

650
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:46,564
Flat through there.

651
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,580
Yeah, and flat
through the next bit.

652
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:54,524
That's so much fun. It is good.
This one's really fun too.

653
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,572
And then...

654
00:41:56,592 --> 00:41:59,576
This is awesome.
You got it right that time.

655
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:11,592
We could have killed you!

656
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:13,548
CHEERING

657
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,545
What if we'd actually killed you?

658
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,576
I felt the wind come underneath.
I was feathering like a kite.

659
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:26,517
"I'm on two wheels!"

660
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:30,524
Thank God you managed to get it backon
all four wheels again. It was great fun.

661
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,465
So what do we think? Fastest man's
a wizard, Rupert Grint at 1:45.5

662
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,504
Slowest in the dry laps is Nick
Robinson, Political Editor for the BBC.

663
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:44,023
He did it it 1:49.9.
So, Cameron, ladies first.

664
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:47,508
This is the piece of paper
with the times on it.

665
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:49,568
Good luck. Thanks, buddy.

666
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,572
Cameron Diaz, you did it in one...

667
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:55,588
forty...

668
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,548
five...

669
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:07,528
two. CHEERING

670
00:43:17,576 --> 00:43:19,068
Wow!

671
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:20,560
Yes!

672
00:43:23,564 --> 00:43:25,512
Well done, you.

673
00:43:33,576 --> 00:43:35,489
Yes!

674
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:41,536
Now, that's a magnanimous face but, let's
be honest, you're quietly crapping yourself.

675
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:46,576
Oh, my God. 1:45.2, I doubt.

676
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,473
Oh, just give it over.

677
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:56,544
Give it over! Give it to him!
Even Tom Cruise leans forward.

678
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,536
"I'm not interested.
I'm not interested. "

679
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:03,508
Tom Cruise, you did it in one...

680
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:06,568
forty... OK.

681
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,588
SHE WHISPERS

682
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:12,576
four. AUDIENCE WHOOPS

683
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:16,524
CHEERING

684
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:22,553
You Americans.

685
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:26,500
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH

686
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,552
When I was on two wheels, I thought,
"I don't know what's going to happen. "

687
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:46,524
Two wheels is obviously
the fastest way...

688
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,532
You are a man who likes
racing, but that's quick.

689
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:52,513
When the two wheels
were going through...

690
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:55,520
I'm not going to come off and
they said, "This is it. "

691
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:57,560
So I was thinking, "If I
go through on the side,

692
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,508
does the time still count?"

693
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:00,477
LAUGHTER

694
00:45:00,512 --> 00:45:02,549
It was... That was a
breathtaking thing.

695
00:45:02,584 --> 00:45:05,572
My whole day has just been...
It's been just... Wow.

696
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:07,517
Such an honour to meet you, Tom.

697
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:11,512
This was the best day. Cameron, thank
youvery much for making me sick.

698
00:45:11,547 --> 00:45:14,527
What's that? Thank youfor
making me feel sick.

699
00:45:14,562 --> 00:45:17,473
Oh, you are so welcome
Ladies and gentlemen...

700
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:20,536
Thank you so much. Thank you all.
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

702
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,544
Thank you so much.
That was so much fun.

703
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,505
Came to see a show about cars

704
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,524
and you get to see Tom
Cruise and Cameron Diaz.

705
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,580
They're great. Staggering.

706
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:45,521
Anyway, anyway...
slight change of mood.

707
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:49,536
Had he lived, Ayrton Senna
would have celebrated

708
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:52,489
his 50th birthday
earlier this year.

709
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:55,560
The weird thing is, I was talking
about this to my 14-year-old son,

710
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:58,596
and he went, "Oh yeah, was he that
racing driver that got killed?"

711
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,525
That makes me feel really old.

712
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,501
I know, it's awful, but the
thing is, I said to him,

713
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:08,580
"If you'd seen his funeral, you'd
know he was a bit more than that. "

714
00:46:10,544 --> 00:46:13,584
'One of the world's greatest motor
racing drivers, Ayrton Senna,

715
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,521
'has died after a crash... '

716
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:17,560
'Senna, three times
a world champion,

717
00:46:17,595 --> 00:46:19,564
'suffered massive

GERMAN COMMENTARY

719
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:24,465
'A million people lined the
streets of his home city...

720
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,544
'The Brazilian government has called
in full military officers... '

721
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,552
'His home country has declared
three days of mourning. '

722
00:46:32,596 --> 00:46:36,548
I think I was nine years old
and I was racing that weekend

723
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:40,552
and I just came in from a
heat or a practise session

724
00:46:40,587 --> 00:46:43,477
and my dad was working
away on the car

725
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:46,572
and I remember him telling me. I remember
going round to the back of the car

726
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:50,509
and just... balled my eyes out.
At nine years...

727
00:46:50,544 --> 00:46:53,588
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Exactly where I was, what spot.

728
00:46:53,623 --> 00:46:55,560
I could take you there right now.

729
00:46:56,556 --> 00:47:00,036
In Brazil, they remember
Ayrton Senna as a sporting hero

730
00:47:00,071 --> 00:47:03,481
who gave a way millions to
help underprivileged children.

731
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:07,568
Elsewhere in the world, though,
we remember him best for this...

732
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:16,512
'And Senna goes through. '

733
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:19,564
'Senna goes through again!'

734
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,493
Ayrton Senna did race in Formula 1

735
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:42,544
from 1984- to his death
at Imola in 1994.

736
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:45,525
'Ayrton Senna wins at Monaco. '

737
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,536
In that time, he won the world
championship three times.

738
00:47:52,512 --> 00:47:56,500
The figures suggest that
Schumacher and Fangio were better,

739
00:47:56,535 --> 00:48:01,504
but the people who know,
they tell a different story.

740
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:05,568
I think, Senna, I would
put him in number one.

741
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:08,063
For me, Senna is number one.

742
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,489
For me, he was number one.

743
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:12,561
I would Ayrton Senna as number one.

744
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:16,078
For me, Ayrton Senna
undoubtedly was the number one.

745
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:19,560
I would put him number one.
He was the greatest driver.

746
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:23,465
If you ask me, I put Senna
as well in number one.

747
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,576
Martin Brundle, who races against
the Brazilian for 11 years,

748
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:29,552
is well qualified
to explain why Senna

749
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:31,561
was the ultimate drivers driver.

750
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:36,582
He had a God given talent that I
haven't witnessed anywhere else.

751
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:41,080
I sixth sense of where the grip was
before he turned into a corner.

752
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:45,544
If you look at this Lotus, even
when it's going in a straight line,

753
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:49,513
it is dancing.
Absolutely. And there.

754
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:52,552
You look at these and you
think, I can't do that.

755
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:55,485
I think Senna has the ability

756
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,517
to be able to drive
completely on the limit.

757
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:04,508
Some of the laps he did, we
know were, were unbelievable.

758
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:12,517
And this is just...
This is manic. Look at this.

759
00:49:12,552 --> 00:49:15,568
How he reads those two guys,
he's absolutely on it, isn't he?

760
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:17,465
This is... Look at that.

761
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,553
'Senna was so good at banzai
last minute qualifying laps

762
00:49:20,588 --> 00:49:26,572
'that in his Formula 1 career, he
won an incredible 65 poll positions.

763
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:29,520
Had had this gift to
just go and find...

764
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:31,493
We could all find a tenth or two,

765
00:49:31,528 --> 00:49:34,532
the really great drivers could
go and find half a second

766
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,500
or three quarters of a second.

767
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:37,549
'Ayrton Senna... '

768
00:49:37,584 --> 00:49:40,545
However, Senna could do
even better than that.

769
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:46,536
In Monaco in 1988, he out qualified
his teammate, the great Alain Prost,

770
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,560
by a scarcely believable
one and a half seconds.

771
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,544
Nobody, in the end, wanted
to spoil Senna's poll lap.

772
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,525
When you saw the day-glow McLaren

773
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,537
and the very bright
helmet of Ayrton Senna,

774
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:20,552
he would come through and we
literally jumped out of the way.

775
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:23,532
You didn't want to be the one
they talked about as having

776
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:26,584
blown the lap that the whole
of the Grand Prix venue

777
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:28,477
was looking forward to.

778
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:32,524
'But it wasn't just out and out
speed that made Senna special. '

779
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:40,552
He was so good because he was
working so hard on details.

780
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:42,580
I brought the car
also there and there,

781
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:45,071
but he went in the fine details.

782
00:50:45,106 --> 00:50:47,493
That's why he was fantastic.

783
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:50,548
The worst is here.
The worst is the second chicane.

784
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,557
Beneath the first chicane.

785
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:56,550
But it is because the asphalt goes
like this in the third chicane

786
00:50:56,585 --> 00:51:01,508
and it's like this. In the second
chicane it's, you're coming bumpy.

787
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:03,552
If I think back to when
I was his test driver

788
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:05,497
at the beginning of the '94 season,

789
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:09,024
after the second day he had a small
incident and tweaked his neck

790
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,295
and that was it. The test was
over as far as he was concerned.

791
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,532
Er, I came in the following day
and he was there! I thought,

792
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,549
"OK, "he must have made
a miraculous recovery,"

793
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:21,042
but in fact he was just there to
listen to what I was saying to

794
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:24,500
the engineers, to work out whether
he could trust my feedback.

795
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:26,553
When I compare that being
Nigel Mansell's test driver,

796
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:30,536
he would set a lap time and then he
would bugger off to the golf course.

797
00:51:32,568 --> 00:51:36,558
Another weapon in Senna's armoury
was his utter ruthlessness.

798
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,548
'Prost having a look, Senna
driving him into the pit wall. '

799
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,061
'Schumacher trying
to take Ayrton Senna.

800
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:45,540
'Let's see if the
Brazilian moves across.

801
00:51:45,575 --> 00:51:47,485
'Indeed he did. '

802
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,560
He often used to put us in a position, erm,
that you were going to have an accident

803
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:54,595
and he would leave it
up to you to decide

804
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,561
whether to have that
accident or not.

805
00:51:56,596 --> 00:52:01,524
Martin experienced this
psychological warfare first of all

806
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,509
when racing against
Senna in Formula 3.

807
00:52:04,544 --> 00:52:07,592
Look, I've got a great big lead
here and he launches in from nowhere

808
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:12,525
and then... parks on my shoulder.

809
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,550
I couldn't get out of the car until
they lifted his car off the top of mine.

810
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:20,540
When he wanted to overtake, he'd go on
the inside and put the car in a place...

811
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:23,477
If you tried to take the corner,
you're going to hit him. Yes.

812
00:52:23,512 --> 00:52:27,532
He would put you in a compromising position
and leave you to make that decision.

813
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:31,517
And if you didn't run into to him,
psychologically you're buried and finished.

814
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:35,580
He would then know that every time after
that it showed your wheel, you'll jump out
of the way.

815
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:39,580
'He's got Mansell all over him.
He has no reason to stay out... '

816
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:44,513
'Even the giants from Senna's
era respected his toughness. '

817
00:52:44,548 --> 00:52:48,588
I don't think there was any qualifying
session or any race he went into the wasn't
prepared

818
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,529
to put it on the line.

819
00:52:50,564 --> 00:52:55,034
'All over the back, he's having a
look and he's inside Mansell. '

820
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:59,504
He was the toughest driver and
the most ferocious driver to, um,

821
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:01,561
protect his area or space.

822
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:04,469
'Senna - all his skills involved.

823
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:09,508
'He's got a much, much slower car
and clapped out tires on his car.

824
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:13,067
'Mansell's got fresh rubber on.
All the grip in the world.

825
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:16,557
'Blocking away and sliding a lot.
Senna's knocking it down. '

826
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:22,532
'Mansell weaving this way and that
way, but Senna won't let him past.

827
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,489
'He's got the racing line
and he's going to keep it. '

828
00:53:25,524 --> 00:53:30,580
This will to win reached it's peak
at the Japanese Grand Prix in 1990.

829
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:34,512
Here, Senna would be world
champion providing his arch rival,

830
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:37,541
Alain Prost, now at
Ferrari, failed to finish.

831
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:42,524
So, at the first corner, he made
sure Prost failed to finish.

832
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,513
'Alain Prost has
taken the advantage,

833
00:53:44,548 --> 00:53:47,066
'Senna is trying to go
through on the inside,

834
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:49,584
'and it's happened immediately!
This is amazing!

835
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:52,489
'Senna goes off at
the first corner. '

836
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,572
'Yes, and that makes Ayrton Senna
world champion this year. '

837
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,533
He doesn't even try to break?
No, no, no. At that point...

838
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:03,500
when they are back there, Senna,
if he wanted to stay in the race,

839
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:06,520
you'd have seen two puffs of
blue smoke from his front tires.

840
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:09,059
That gap was always
going to disappear.

841
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:11,529
He was driving into a
disappearing wedge.

842
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:16,048
After the crash, he showed
absolutely no contrition.

843
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:20,497
When there is a gap, you
either commit yourself,

844
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:24,564
as a professional racing driver
that is designed to win races,

845
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,505
or you come second or you
come third or you come fifth.

846
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,500
I am not designed to come third,
fourth or fifth. I race to win.

847
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,568
If you no longer go
for a gap that exists,

848
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:36,596
you're no longer a racing driver.

849
00:54:38,524 --> 00:54:41,465
Strangely, Senna had a big heart.

850
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,516
He was a devote Christian capable
of extraordinary compassion.

851
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:51,521
When fellow racing driver
Erik Comas crashed in 1992,

852
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:56,552
Senna stopped and risked his own life
running across the track to help.

853
00:54:57,572 --> 00:55:00,544
That's the paradox of
Ayrton Senna, isn't it.

854
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:03,481
In that he was clearly a
fantastic human being.

855
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:08,469
And he cared about people in Brazil,
he cared about racing drivers.

856
00:55:08,504 --> 00:55:14,521
I mean he was mortally hurt when
Ratzenberger died the day before he died.

857
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:20,504
But then he would crash Alain Prost off the
race track and put both their lives at risk.

858
00:55:21,532 --> 00:55:25,465
As a man, Ayrton Senna
was hard to fathom,

859
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,524
but when it rained it was easy
to spot his talents as a driver.

860
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,576
'And Senna is a wet
weather master!'

861
00:55:37,532 --> 00:55:40,477
This is Donnington in 1993.

862
00:55:40,512 --> 00:55:45,512
The track is wet and Senna, in an inferior
McLaren, is in trouble at the start.

863
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:48,548
'Coming up well Senna is crowded
out and down to fifth position.

864
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:51,537
'Wendliger is up into third
place ahead of Schumacher

865
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:57,497
'Prost leads, Hill second, and Ayrton Senna
is up to fourth position ahead of
Schumacher.

866
00:55:57,532 --> 00:56:02,588
'Challenging Wendliger as they go round the
right-hander into the old hairpin. Senna is
up to third.

867
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,561
'A quite brilliant couple
of corners by Ayrton Senna.

868
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:09,568
'Tremendous stuff. He muscled his way
back into the contention at Redgate.

869
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:14,085
'He's going inside Damon Hill and
Senna into second place already. '

870
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,568
'So, two retirements already...
and Senna goes through into the lead!

871
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:21,536
'He's past Alain Prost so...
' And that was it.

872
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:24,513
One lap, fifth to first. Yeah.

873
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:29,500
If you want to have 40 seconds of, what is
Ayrton Senna the racing driver all about?

874
00:56:29,535 --> 00:56:31,505
There it is in a nutshell. Yeah.

875
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,485
After the race, though,
he was completely calm.

876
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,544
Driving with slicks in damp
and really slippery conditions

877
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:41,537
was... was tremendous.

878
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:47,584
Conditions like this is gambling and
it's taking chances that pays off

879
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:50,516
and I think we gambled good.

880
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,524
Of course you have to remember that
Senna was doing his gambling in cars

881
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,520
that were like wild
ferocious animals.

882
00:57:02,524 --> 00:57:06,481
This McLaren MP44, in
which he won eight races

883
00:57:06,516 --> 00:57:10,560
and his first world championship,
had very little down force,

884
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:15,500
a manual gear box and
1,200 horse power.

885
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:18,525
450 more than the F1 cars of today.

886
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,542
It is the last of the
turbo charged monsters.

887
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:26,524
One of the greatest
racing cars ever made.

888
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,031
And today, it's going
to rumble again

889
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:33,504
in the hands of Senna's
number one fan.

890
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:35,540
I'm nervous.

891
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,588
There it is. Wooooo!

892
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,548
I can't believe that, um...
Oh, jeez...

893
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,549
LEWIS GIGGLES

894
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:50,542
You've just got back from the Canadian
Grand Prix this morning? Yeah.

895
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:54,500
I couldn't sleep. Really?
I slept like an hour or so on the flight.

896
00:57:54,535 --> 00:57:57,540
I couldn't get to sleep...
Cos you get to drive Senna's MP4?

897
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:01,059
I just can't imagine what
it's going to be like.

898
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:04,509
I just have this...
I have this sound in my head

899
00:58:04,544 --> 00:58:08,516
of the car roaring and going through
Monaco streets when he's one handed.

900
00:58:10,584 --> 00:58:14,532
I'm going to go one handed and see what
it's like round one of the corners.

901
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:16,508
Let's go, let's go. Can I go?

902
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,036
ENGINE ROARS

903
00:58:20,071 --> 00:58:22,512
LAUGHS GLEEFULLY

904
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:26,564
Ooh, it's BLEEP.

905
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,584
LAUGHS EXCITEDLY

906
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,576
Woo-hoo-hoo!

907
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,485
Oh, yeah! Whoa-ho-ho-ho, my God!

908
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,538
The racing back in the mid '80s
was, I mean there's an incredible

909
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:51,556
scene with Nelson Pike overtaking
Senna on full opposite lock.

910
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:54,485
Very little in the way of safety,

911
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,548
very little in the way
of aerodynamic grip.

912
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:01,533
Manual gearboxes,
1,200 horse power.

913
00:59:01,568 --> 00:59:05,570
Yeah, and the cockpit, you
could almost punch through it.

914
00:59:05,605 --> 00:59:09,537
So you think, jeez, you're
driving around at those speeds,

915
00:59:09,572 --> 00:59:13,552
your wheel falls off, the mechanic
makes a mistake, you're dead.

916
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:16,061
It's phenomenal and I
can't even contemplate

917
00:59:16,096 --> 00:59:18,501
what it would have
been like, but, er...

918
00:59:18,536 --> 00:59:22,540
So that's why I think you have even more
respect for the guys that did it back then.

919
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:28,544
You had to be, back
in the '80s... Crazy.

920
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:38,469
You know, you've got your
Mansells, Pikes, Prost...

921
00:59:38,504 --> 00:59:42,548
The drivers were... It's justthe right
time... incredible and you think that
shining out

922
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:45,549
from all of those drivers
in that great era...

923
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:48,516
Yep... Senna rose to the top.
Senna rose to the top.

924
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:53,588
I don't want to go in.
Let's do another lap!

925
00:59:55,552 --> 00:59:59,588
I loved the fact that he would fight
for what he truly believed in.

926
00:59:59,623 --> 01:00:03,588
It's just everything! He puts
everything into getting that lap

927
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:07,548
and he had no fear.
That's what I loved about it.

928
01:00:11,516 --> 01:00:13,528
I love this car!

929
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:15,055
I love it.

930
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,513
Come on.

931
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:18,477
LEWIS SIGHS That's amazing.

932
01:00:18,512 --> 01:00:23,465
Oh, it' so much... It's nothing
like the car I drive nowadays.

933
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,544
But just to know the commitment and
to get used to driving this car

934
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:31,528
on the limit, I just...
I just couldn't imagine it, man.

935
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:37,548
It's one of the best
days of my life.

936
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,545
I just feel so blessed, you know.

937
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,592
I dreamed my whole life
of driving that car.

938
01:00:42,627 --> 01:00:44,552
My whole, my whole life.

939
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,504
I just, er, just ticked
off one of my dreams.

940
01:00:57,596 --> 01:01:03,524
I'll be honest with you,
I was never a Senna fan.

941
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,481
I always thought Gilles Villeneuve

942
01:01:05,516 --> 01:01:07,561
was the greatest racing
driver of them all, but...

943
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:11,561
to make this film, I've watched
hours and hours and hours of footage

944
01:01:11,596 --> 01:01:18,592
and the thing is, Villeneuve was
spectacular on a number of occasions...

945
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:25,580
Senna, he was spectacular every
single time he got in a car.

946
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:47,042
There's an amazing film
coming out in the next year

947
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:50,500
and I urge you all to go and see it.
It's fantastic.

948
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:51,584
But for now, goodnight.
