TOP GEAR - SEASON 15 - EPISODE 01

00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,524
Subtitled by : Agent

1
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:16,024
Tonight, A new series Top Gear.
James catches fire.

2
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,037
Richard knocks something over.

3
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:21,048
And I crash a Reliant
Robin into to a lamppost.

4
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:29,045
Hello!

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,096
Hello, we're back! We're back!

6
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,008
We're back and we are...

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,001
.. more sensible than ever.

8
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:42,044
But, we're starting
sensibly anyway, with this,

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,993
the Bentley Continental GT.

10
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:46,057
It's not my cup of
tea, if I'm honest,

11
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:51,576
but if you live in Cheshire and
you have to travel great distances

12
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:57,060
at high speed in drinks globe luxury
it really is in a class of one.

13
00:00:57,095 --> 00:01:01,064
Now, however, there's a new
version which is a bit different.

14
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:16,012
It's called the Continental
Supersports, and this is it.

15
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:17,041
The fastest,

16
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:23,056
most outlandish car
Bentley has ever made.

17
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:25,989
First of all, it's been lightened.

18
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:30,061
The rear seat has been
replaced with air.

19
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:37,088
The sofas up front are now racing buckets
trimmed in the Duke of Westminster's
smoking jacket.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,052
And there is carbon fibre on
the dash rather than walnut.

21
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:52,068
The result is dramatic because that car
weighs just two and a quarter tons,

22
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:56,024
about the same as a three
bedroom terraced house.

23
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:03,052
Still, it's not like there isn't
enough power to deal with the bulk.

24
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:09,040
It has the same engine as before,
a 6 litre twin turbo W12,

25
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:15,008
but now it produces
621 horsepowers.

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,024
The result is 0 to
60 in 3.7 seconds.

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,052
God, that is 167, 168
and it's still pulling!

28
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:52,973
Flat out, it will do
204 miles an hour,

29
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:57,048
even if you fill the tank
with Jerusalem artichokes.

30
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:11,024
That engine has been designed to run on
something called bioethanol, fuel made from
plants.

31
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:15,559
And if you use that rather than
petrol the power output remains

32
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:20,060
the same, but you get fewer carbon
dioxides coming out of the back.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,012
Sounds wonderful, if you believe
in this carbon malarkey,

34
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,036
but there are a
couple of drawbacks.

35
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:40,064
First of all, there are 8,850 petrol
stations in Britain, but only 20 of them
sell bioethanol.

36
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:47,000
And, secondly, when you're running on
maize it's not what you'd call economical.

37
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:54,056
Honestly, it gets through veg
faster than Paul McCartney's ex.

38
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:59,969
The Supersports, then, it's
all much as you'd expect,

39
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:05,060
very fast, very heavy and at speed
about six miles to the gallon.

40
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:11,076
But don't be fooled
by the headlines.

41
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:16,013
This is spooky.

42
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,064
I've got an automatic gearbox and air
conditioning, satellite navigation and it's
very quiet.

43
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:28,068
It's just like a normal Bentley, but
look at the way it changes direction.

44
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:42,040
This car is like an elephant with
the reflexes of a water boatman.

45
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:45,579
And if you're watching in
Poland and you don't know what

46
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:49,049
a water boatman is, it's
like an Evo X, it really is.

47
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:54,016
And if you're watching in Ethiopia
and you don't know what an Evo X is,

48
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:59,020
what I mean is it does things
rather well. No, not well!

49
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:01,068
Why did I say "well"? Oh, God.

50
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:09,000
Then you have the brakes
which can tear your face off.

51
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,048
Ready, now!

52
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:24,033
To make the Bentley a race track
screamer it's been fitted with

53
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:30,096
carbon ceramic discs, new suspension
bushes and different anti roll bars.

54
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:34,004
Though when I say different
I mean, of course, enormous.

55
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,004
They've also reprogrammed the four wheel
drive system so that now most of the power
goes to the back.

56
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:52,036
Imagine then that if you mash the throttle
into the carpets halfway around a corner

57
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:58,048
it will spin up its rear wheels and
hang its tail out like a small dog.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,072
Sorry, but was a dreadful
simile, dogs don't have wheels.

59
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:05,056
Unless they'd been in an accident.

60
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:10,041
But here's the
extraordinary thing, OK?

61
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:15,000
It doesn't! Coming up to the
Hammerhead going the wrong way,

62
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,072
halfway round, foot hard down...

63
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:27,076
.. it doesn't! It just grips.

64
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:37,012
Of course, you can make it misbehave if you
go way too fast and poke it with a stick.

65
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,013
But even if you do that
the computer steps in,

66
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:53,020
sends power to the front wheels
and, bang, everything is sorted out!

67
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,044
It is uncanny.

68
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,076
It is a very impressive car, this.

69
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,973
But I don't like it.

70
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,981
What they've tried to do here

71
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:08,084
is turn an ocean liner
into a speedboat.

72
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:15,973
And, yes, they have
sort of pulled it off,

73
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:22,084
but it still feels very big
and very heavy. Oh dear!

74
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:36,044
Whoa!

75
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:48,008
So big and so heavy in fact that I believe
it has just shredded its rear tyres.

76
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,061
Oh ho!

77
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:55,088
Oh dear! Now, I don't think
that's legal any more,

78
00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:57,092
or safe.

79
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,973
The upshot then is simple.

80
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:10,993
If I wanted to spend
L163,000 on a speedboat

81
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:16,000
I'd buy something that was designed
to be a speedboat in the first place.

82
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:23,004
In short, I'd buy
an Aston Martin DBS.

83
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:41,084
Thank you very much.

84
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:48,000
Really? You would have the Aston?

85
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:48,973
Oh, yeah.

86
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,060
No, it's more nimble,
it's got two more seats,

87
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:53,017
it doesn't weigh the same as a church.

88
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:57,008
- Doesn't eat its own shoes. 
- No, this is the best car in the world.
- No, it isn't.


89
00:08:57,043 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes, it is. Anyway, we
must now find out how fast

90
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,017
the Wilmslow Express
goes round our track

91
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:07,064
and that, of course, means handing
it over to our tame racing driver.

92
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:12,092
Some say that his
discharge is luminous...

94
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,546
.. and that even as we speak he
is appearing on the main stage

95
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:24,064
at Glastonbury performing his
most famous hit, Superstition.

97
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:30,024
All we know is he's
called The Stig.

98
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,080
He's off! Note the flags there, Stig
displaying his support for the Norwegian
football team.

99
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:41,080
I tried to explain they aren't actually in
the World Cup, but this made him very angry.

100
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:45,056
Here he is, first
corner, looking nice.

101
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:47,008
Yes!

102
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:52,058
Interestingly, he's the
only person in the world who

103
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:55,558
likes the sound of the vuvuzela,
because, of course, he invented it!

104
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:59,024
There he is, round Chicago,
very tidy for a big car.

105
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,088
Now, Hammerhead.
This should be astonishing.

106
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:06,080
Oh no, it's exploded!
It's rolled end over end!

107
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:09,569
This is incredible!
But Stig's out of the wreckage!

108
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:13,024
He's dodging the naked waitresses
and even though he's... he's on fire!

109
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,045
He's now coming up to Gambon.

110
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,058
No, no! He's taking his helmet off!

111
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:20,001
It's her! Right round the tiger!

112
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:25,033
He's just a shaken hands with Elvis
and there he is, across the line!

113
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:32,024
I don't believe that, the most exciting
thing I've ever seen and some idiot at
Television Centre

114
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,017
cut to an advertisement for a
stupid little Korean hatchback.

115
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:40,056
It's a good job ITV didn't cover
the moon landings. 10 foot. BEEP.

116
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,021
Five foot. BEEP.

117
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:45,076
# If you like a lot of
chocolate on your biscuit... #

118
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,017
Anyway, I have the time

119
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:52,558
and it did it in 1:24.9,
which puts it there.

120
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:57,029
And that's not bad,
really, for a small moon.

121
00:10:57,064 --> 00:11:02,064
Anyway, now we must turn our attention to
the Icelandic volcano because although it
went on

122
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:07,553
to become global news, the actual
eruption itself started out quite

123
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:13,008
small and that got us wondering how
close could you get to it in a car.

124
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:17,080
Now, obviously, this was a job for
a rugged, outdoorsy sort of chap.

125
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:20,060
Unfortunately, Jeremy
was on holiday,

126
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,040
so James went.

127
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:33,000
It's very hard to drive across
Iceland at the best of times.

128
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:38,061
But luckily I had just
the vehicle for the job.

129
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:45,040
This looks exactly like the
Toyota that Jeremy and I

130
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,033
drove to the North Pole.

131
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:50,044
More to the point, this has
been to the North Pole with us,

132
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,048
but you never saw it and it
never got any of the glory

133
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,017
because it was the one
driven by the camera crew.

134
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:05,060
After we got back from the Pole our car
went off to a museum whereas this one was
just left to rot.

135
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:10,028
Today, though, I'm going to bring it back
to life and give it one more mission.

136
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:19,080
Wow, I never actually thought I'd be
so pleased to see one of these again.

137
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,029
This really brings it all back,

138
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:27,048
the ice going on and on forever, the
boulder field going on and on forever.

139
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,076
I can hear Jeremy going
on and on forever.

140
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,044
Oh, God...

141
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:40,056
No matter, my job is to turn this into
the world's first volcano-proof car,

142
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,989
which means a visit to Emil,

143
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:48,025
the 4x4 genius who built
it in the first place.

144
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,001
I mean, what are the unique
risks to volcano driving,

145
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,088
apart from obviously being consumed
by molten lava and burnt to a crisp?

146
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,057
It depends on how
close you want to get.

147
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:59,981
Very close. As far as I can work
out no-one's ever actually driven

148
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:04,088
right up to the mouth of an active volcano
in a car, so it's another Top Gear first if
we can do it.

149
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,017
Yeah.

150
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:10,068
Some people claim you can walk on
hot coals if you wet the bottom

151
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:14,049
of your feet and I was just
wondering, if there was some system

152
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:20,032
of continuously wetting the tyres would it
be possible to drive across the hot lava?

153
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:24,056
If you don't fall through,
possibly, yeah, if you drive fast.

154
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:29,044
Emile didn't look very confident,

155
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:33,036
but we set to work anyway...

156
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:39,060
.. and by the next morning
the volcano-buster was ready.

157
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:48,080
I know I look a bit like a petty thief on
my way home from some corrugated roof
robbery

158
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:52,012
at the allotment, but there's a
very good reason for all of this.

159
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,985
Their lava occasionally goes
over an area of water and that

160
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,025
causes an explosion throwing bits
of lava and rock up into the air,

161
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:06,000
so that's there to stop those lumps coming
down and breaking the windscreen, or my
head.

162
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:12,985
We've also fitted our new and
pioneering tyre cooling system.

163
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,036
There's an oil drum on the back full of
water and pipes feed the water to the tyres.

164
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:20,981
Now, obviously, there's a risk of it
freezing and we can't put antifreeze

165
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:26,016
in the water because that pollutes the
glacier, so we've added a dash of vodka.

166
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:33,021
As I drove on to the glacier,
I stopped to hook up with

167
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:38,064
a volcanologist who couldn't get to
the volcano because of the weather.

168
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:47,997
And it's fantastically windy.
I've never seen or felt a wind like it.

169
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:53,084
Because of this storm that has been raging
for the last few days, we haven't really
been able to visit

170
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:56,037
the area to see
what's going on there.

171
00:14:56,072 --> 00:15:00,032
So at the moment, with this
weather, in this white-out,

172
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,012
really nobody knows
what's happening.

173
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:05,045
Exactly. Nobody can see.

174
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,989
As night fell, the
storm became worse.

175
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:13,076
It was so bad that by morning, it
had taken the lives of two locals.

176
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,048
This is what we're seeing, or what
we're not seeing, I should say.

177
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,993
Visibility is probably
less than 10m.

178
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:33,060
We reckoned that as long as we could follow
the car carrying Emil and the camera crew,
we'd be OK.

179
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,088
- There it is.
- There he is.

180
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,080
But we weren't.

181
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,044
Oh, I've lost the tail lights.

182
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,096
Wow, that's dark.

183
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,989
Soon, we were completely lost.

184
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:53,024
- Can you see any red lights?
- I don't see anything.

185
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,028
Oh, cock.

186
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:02,001
Right, we are now, effectively,
driving on instruments.

187
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:05,036
Outside the window is just...
it's a complete sheet of white.

188
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:07,029
There's a blizzard going.

189
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,064
The windscreen itself
is freezing up.

190
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:11,064
The windscreen wipers
have frozen up.

191
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,057
It's quite unnerving.

192
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:18,020
Eventually, I had to get
out to unjam the wipers.

193
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:21,048
Ah! Oh, my God.

194
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,071
Blinding.

195
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,060
Look at that.

196
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:40,080
- Good job.
- Argh!

197
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,045
Argh.

198
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,985
God, I've never known
anything like that.

199
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,048
I hadn't realised how strong
that was, being in here.

200
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,997
I could hardly stand up.

201
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:56,028
We ploughed onwards
until, at last, salvation.

202
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,024
- Lights! Look, lights! There they are.
- Thank God.

203
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,981
Eventually, the storm
cleared and we arrived at

204
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:12,028
our overnight stop, where we were
greeted by a spectacular sight.

205
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,096
Wow, look at that! Beautiful.

206
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,029
How far away is that?

207
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:21,024
About one and a half kilometres.

208
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,529
I can hear it, as well.

209
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,000
It's like cannon fire.

210
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:28,036
That's fantastic.

211
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:35,021
Wow!

212
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:42,088
The next morning, still with no idea how
big this eruption would become, I dropped
off the professor...

213
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:44,013
Thanks for a ride.

214
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:51,056
.. and headed on alone, until at last I
got my first close-up look at the volcano.

215
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:03,044
God in heaven, look at that.

216
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:12,033
Lava was spewing out at a temperature
of 1,200 degrees centigrade,

217
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:18,012
and right in front of my eyes, a brand-new
part of the world was being created.

218
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,025
It was now my job to test our
volcano car by driving up to

219
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,032
the crater and scooping up a fresh
piece of landscape as a souvenir.

220
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:30,084
And to help me with that, they've
given me a garden trowel,

221
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,096
on an extending pole, held
on with sticky tape, and...

222
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,993
.. a bucket.

223
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:40,969
And of course, I have
my corrugated roof

224
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:45,028
and I'm in the best off-road
vehicle I've ever driven.

225
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,092
So, piece of cake, really.
Here we go.

226
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,040
Does look quite angry.

227
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:07,021
Oh, God, look at that.

228
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:10,997
Even though I was driving on
lava that had fallen days ago,

229
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:17,036
it was still red hot, and the Top Gear
vodka tyre cooling system was working
overtime.

230
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:21,028
Right, what I need is for a
piece to land quite near me,

231
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:25,088
and then I can reach out
of the window and grab it.

232
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,080
Ooh!

233
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:33,052
Bravely, I decided
that was far enough.

234
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,061
Oh, my word.

235
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:39,056
I don't know if you can see this
but it's raining red-hot lumps.

236
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:42,047
It's quite...

237
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,969
God, that's hot.

238
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:48,072
It was time to break
out the lava scoop.

239
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,546
Whoa! Bloody hellfire.

240
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:56,045
Look at the size of that!

241
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,000
A piece of that would do nicely.

242
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:02,522
Whoa!

243
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,965
Yes! Yes!

244
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's still glowing slightly.

245
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:09,041
Yay-hey!

246
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:13,008
God, that's hot.

247
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,012
Whoa!

248
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:20,021
Oh, that's getting a bit frisky.

249
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:25,004
In the excitement of bagging a souvenir,
I'd stayed still for too long.

250
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,004
We're on fire. Right, I'm off.

251
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:40,008
With the tyres steaming, I beat
a retreat from the volcano,

252
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:44,043
clutching my brand-new
piece of planet Earth.

253
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:48,044
I claim you for Queen
Elizabeth and Top Gear.

254
00:20:53,088 --> 00:21:00,068
And best of all, the unsung hero finally
got the recognition it deserves.

255
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,524
And...

256
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,012
Here is...

257
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:27,061
- Is that it? What a souvenir!
- The piece of lava I brought backfor you. 

258
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:32,061
Do you know, it was quite interesting. I
asked a volcanologist the other day what
caused that

259
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:37,574
small eruption we saw in the film there to
become so massive, to shut down all of
Europe's airspace.

260
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:43,052
And he said there must have been a trigger
of some kind, a disturbance near the actual
crater itself.

261
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:47,969
Yes, something to do with weight, he said.
It would need about two tonnes.

262
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:52,040
- If it was in the right place, it could
trigger all of that.
- That's not strictly true, is it?

263
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:57,052
James, have you been working recently
on any oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico?

264
00:21:57,087 --> 00:22:03,041
- Let's do the news.
- Just before we do, I don't know if you've heard...

265
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:09,008
Barack Obama's been prattling on about
British Petroleum and "this is 9/11 X
1,000," this oil spill...

266
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:12,096
Did you hear how the English football fans
responded during the America game the other
day?

267
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:17,060
They were actually singing,
"You're not swimming any more!"

269
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:22,496
- That is classic.
- Right, let's really do the news.

270
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:23,965
Yes, the news.

271
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,060
Ferrari has broken the lap record of the
Nurburgring for production cars with this,
the 599XX.

272
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:33,009
It did it in six
minutes, 58 seconds.

273
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:37,088
Nurburgring? That's faster than than
Clay Regazzoni's lap record in an F1 car.

274
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:43,036
I know the track's a bit shorter now, but
that is almost unbelievably fast. For a
road car.

275
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,977
For a production car.
That's incredible.

276
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:50,008
It does have a six-litre
V12 and 772 horsepower,

277
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:55,969
and it costs L1.2 million.

278
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:58,969
And, you can't actually have it.

279
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,009
Well, unless you've got
L1.2 million, obviously.

280
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:06,084
No, you can buy it, and you own it,
but then they don't let you have it,

281
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,029
but they do let you drive it
occasionally, if they feel like it.

282
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:13,032
Can I just say, this was the actual
photograph that Ferrari sent to us

283
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,041
to show what the car looked
like at the Nurburgring.

284
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:19,028
Now, I'm not sure it's particularly
brilliant. If we look at the graffiti on
the track...

285
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:27,053
That's not a map of the Nurburgring,
is it? No. I... They didn't see that?

286
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:31,981
You've seen it now. Too late. And I have
to say, the man who's responsible for this

287
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:36,032
piece of graffiti has also been at work in
Russia on a drawbridge. I've got a picture
here.

288
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:42,546
We're supposed to be being serious. Yeah,
we are. According to the newspapers...

289
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:46,965
- Haven't we just shown two crudely-drawn
images of a man's private parts?
- Yes.

290
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,021
That's not serious, is it? According to the
newspapers,Top Gear has become serious.

291
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:58,012
Yes. So, here we go. Gentlemen, tell me,
since we were last here, what is the best
car you've driven?

292
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,029
Good question, glad you asked it.

293
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,016
It would be this, the
Lamborghini Gallardo.

294
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:03,965
This is the Superleggera,
the new one.

295
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,005
570. It's magnificent. Lightest, faster.
570 brake horsepower. Really?

296
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:15,012
I haven't actually driven it as such, but
I've looked at that picture of it and I'm
desperate to drive it..

297
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:19,012
- 570, 570. That's very interesting. 
- Because the standard carhas 560, doesn't it?
- Yep.

298
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:23,535
And then Ferrari brought out the
458, which has got, I think, 562.

299
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,024
- Yes, two more.
- And then, mysteriously,Lamborghini
came back with 570.

300
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,981
We all know why it is.

301
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:36,052
It's because Lamborghini are owned by Audi,
so the Germans do the actual building of
the cars, and then they

302
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:40,004
let the Italians do the brochure,
so they just fill in the numbers.

303
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,004
It's got a million horsepower, yes!

304
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,559
100,000. It's invisible.

305
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:45,045
And it's got cannons!

306
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,580
- What about you, then? Come on.
- I have actually driven an

307
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:52,045
AMG SLS. It is a mental.
We've got a picture of it here.

308
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,012
Honestly, it is insanely fast. The only
thing I don't like about it, really, are
the doors.

309
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:01,973
It's got gull-wings, so I'll
probably wait for the convertible.

310
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:06,044
How can you have gull-wing doors on
a convertible? They'd be all floppy.

311
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,032
Idiot. You'd have normal doors on a
convertable and then it would be fantastic.

312
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,037
No, that was awesome.
So, James, you?

313
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:17,056
Well, to be honest, I think it's got to be
the new Boxster Spider, which I'm driving
next week, actually.

314
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:20,041
- So you haven't driven that either?
- No... He means... 
- I've driven it, but...

315
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:26,052
Oh, we're showing it on the programme next
week. Through the magic of television, we
recorded it.

316
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,965
Now, have a look at this.
This is a device.

317
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,092
It fits on the exhaust pipe of your car and
as you drive along, it cooks a burger for
you.

318
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,057
- It's brilliant.
- What, in the exhaust fumes?

319
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:41,072
No, no, no. The exhaust
fumes don't cook the burger.

320
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,017
It's like, you know, like
a toasted-sandwich maker?

321
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:48,048
Your hot gas from the exhaust heats it up
and then it griddles the burger in between
the two bits.

322
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,005
It's a bit close to the whole
exhaust process for food.

323
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,060
Your testes are close to your bottom but
you still play with them all the time.

324
00:25:56,095 --> 00:26:01,008
- Hammond.
- Yes, a normal Nissan GTR costs,
what, 60 grand? - 60 grand.

325
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:05,008
OK. Well, this is the new one.
It's the Spec V. V Spec GTR.

326
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:09,005
That is L125,000, all of a sudden.

327
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,005
- Yeah.
- Why is it L125,000.
- You know, it's difficult to tell.

328
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,056
It doesn't have more power than the normal
car that I can see, but it does have something

329
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:18,029
called a boost-control device.
Basically, it's a button.

330
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:24,064
When you press it, it spools up both the
turbos and releases a sudden burst of more
power!

331
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,069
I just hope that button is
mounted on top of the gear lever

332
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:30,005
under like a little cage and
you lift it and go, "Ohhh!"

333
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,056
And then you've got to know the code word.
And maybe two keys in the dash have to be
turned simultaneously...

334
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:39,079
- Like on a nuclear submarine?
- Yes,that's what I'm thinking! You turn...

335
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:43,068
A mission from the president. It's a go.
I want it, just for that button.

336
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,997
I'm going to point out, because this
is sensible Top Gear, I will say

337
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:49,052
it also comes with a verycompetitive
three-year warranty. Yeah.

338
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:52,064
Now, are there any
girls here? Good.

339
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:55,989
Don't ever faint in Holland.

340
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:58,061
That would be my Top Gear
top tip for the night.

341
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:01,017
We've got some footage here,
explains what I'm on about.

342
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:05,024
Start of a race. There's the grid girl.
Oh, she's gone a bit wobbly.

343
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,000
And she's fainted. There you go.

344
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:13,044
So you're thinking, "Poor girl. " You're
thinking, "Ooh, no - now she's lying on the
track. "

345
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,028
So, as we can see, men in high-visibility
jackets have come over to make sure she's
OK.

346
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:19,061
Or are they making sure she's OK?

347
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,001
How do you...? Oh, put
your hand on her bottom.

348
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:25,076
That's the ticket. That's what he'sdone.
Checking for her pulse.

349
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,076
Now let's hear what the
driver's got to say.

350
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,025
Get the girl off!

351
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,032
That's a racing driver,
isn't it? All over.

352
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:42,048
Everybody, good news.

354
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,068
No, wait. It's better
than you think.

355
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:48,064
The new Dacia... Duster...

357
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:53,024
IS coming to the UK.

358
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,092
OK! That's great.

360
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,076
- That's great. Good.
- Now, for this new series of Top Gear,
we have the new reasonably-priced car.

361
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:08,068
I know, exciting.
But it gave us a dilemma -

362
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,084
what to do with the old one.

363
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:15,965
Every year in Britain,

364
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,001
over two million cars
go to their deaths.

365
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:22,076
And frankly, it's a pretty
cold and clinical affair.

366
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:25,969
Tyres are made into
carpet underlay.

367
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,037
Dashboards are melted down
to make garden furniture.

368
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:34,542
The once-sleek bodywork gets
reincarnated as a washing machine.

369
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:41,012
All in all, a lot of eco-worthiness
but absolutely no emotion.

370
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:46,029
And that's quite sad
when you think about it.

371
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:51,060
Because the car doesn't just carry people.
It carries memories.

372
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,017
Take this one, for example.

373
00:28:55,052 --> 00:29:00,092
It's an ancient Mazda 323 that will
never go up the hill at Goodwood

374
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:03,041
or turn on a plinth
at a motor show.

375
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:09,024
But it's been with the Lister
family of Maidenhead for 23 years.

376
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,092
It took Mum to and from hospital
when the kids were born.

377
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,973
It did years of school runs.

378
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:21,032
And when Daniel and Rachel turned
17, they learned to drive in it.

379
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:26,060
And then adopted it as their
passport to teenage freedom.

380
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:30,093
Sadly, the Listers' 323
is soon to be scrapped.

381
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:34,096
And it makes you realise
that when a car dies,

382
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:38,064
it should be treated like
a death in the family.

383
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:43,045
And today we find ourselves
in that very position.

384
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,064
Because it's time to say goodbye to a
special member of the Top Gear family.

385
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:52,060
Our old reasonably priced car.

386
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:54,993
The Chevrolet Lacetti.

387
00:29:55,028 --> 00:30:00,080
As a machine, it was never destined
to set the automotive world alight.

388
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:03,985
But it's certainly
got some memories.

389
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Think of the real fear and exhilaration
experienced by real-life celebrities in
this car.

390
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:17,064
The celebrity sweat from
celebrity bums in this seat.

391
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:20,004
What a life it's been.

392
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:43,041
But now, The Chevie is
at the end of its useful life,

393
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:48,028
and because it's been such a hard
life, we're not allowed to sell it.

394
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:52,033
So with regret, the
Lacetti must die.

395
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:56,041
But the thought of it being
crushed and recycled...

396
00:30:56,076 --> 00:31:03,004
and these tyres - Michael Gambon's tyres
being turned into carpet underlay...

397
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,053
I'm sorry, no.

398
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:10,048
So instead, we've decided
to give it a Viking burial.

399
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:15,040
These magnificent chimneys
were built in 1969.

400
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:17,053
They're 550 ft high,

401
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:22,080
and they weigh 7,185 tonnes each.

402
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:31,016
Except today, they weigh a little bit more
because each has been stuffed with 25
kilograms of nitroglycerine.

403
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:36,013
In a few minutes, that'll go boom,
and these will come crashing down.

404
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:43,052
And in the process, they'll create a
fitting tomb for our heroic little car.

405
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:46,009
I can see already this
is the right thing to do.

406
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:51,060
If I were a reasonably priced car that had
been driven round a television show's test
track

407
00:31:51,095 --> 00:31:56,076
hundreds of times by celebrities from all
over the world, that is the way I would
want to go.

408
00:31:56,111 --> 00:32:00,000
I've never thought about it,
but that is how I'd want to go.

409
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:06,072
With the assembled mourners looking
resplendent in high-visibility jackets,

410
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:09,044
the funeral service
was about to begin.

411
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,025
And there we are.

412
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,072
A dignified Viking burial.

413
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:48,028
Nearly!

414
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:56,048
You know, I can just see the nose of the
car sticking out, which is pretty shoddy.

415
00:32:58,032 --> 00:33:03,000
You're supposed to cover the whole body,
that's the basics, you don't walk away with
an arm

416
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:06,016
sticking out of the ground
and say, that's that done!

417
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,012
You cover it all up.

418
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:13,040
Oh, my God.

419
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:18,037
You idiot!

420
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:20,040
What? How was I to know?

421
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:26,060
"I nearly buried it"?
Nobody "nearly buries" anything!

422
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:30,032
Anyway, we are very sad to
say goodbye to the Lacetti...

423
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:33,013
No, we're not, actually,
we never really liked it.

424
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:37,032
It was rubbish, to be honest.
Now it's time to unveil its replacement.

425
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:39,985
And here it is. Anybody want
to guess what's under here?

426
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,052
A Lamborghini, no, it isn't, it's the same
height as him, so it can't be a Lamborghini.

427
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:48,052
They just haven't got this at all,
have they? Shall I just reveal?

428
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:52,008
Are we ready? Here we go!
This is the big moment!

429
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,012
It's a Kia!

430
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,072
Specifically...

431
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,567
the Kia...

432
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,993
the Kia cee'd,

433
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:13,052
- the only car in the world that actually has
an apostrophe in its name.
- And what a machine it is.

434
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:21,088
It has a 1.6 litre engine, which means it
can go from 0-60 in a dazzling 10.4 seconds.

435
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:27,000
And it'll go on to a mind-boggling
top speed of 119 miles an hour.

436
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:32,527
Engineered in Korea, built in Slovakia.
Finished in brown.

437
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:36,809
It is on sale to you for an
incredibly reasonable L14,000.

438
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:41,021
- That's amazingly reasonable.
- It is incredibly reasonable.

439
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:47,004
It is Astonishing. But there is one more issue,
because new car means we've got a new lap
time board.

440
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,028
We couldn't just invite a celebrity
tonight, and ask them, "So!

441
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:51,981
"Where do you think you
came on the board?"

442
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:57,020
because there's no other names on it. So
we've thought of a way of getting lots of
names on it all at once

443
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:04,036
by inviting lots of celebrities to an
all-star celebrity summer barbecue festival
event.

444
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:09,053
Since it was going to be
a celebrity-packed day,

445
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:13,032
we arrived at the track good and
early to sort out the catering.

446
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:16,033
I've got 32 sausages.
That's going to be enough.

447
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:18,965
I've got a cauliflower for
if a vegetarian comes.

448
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,088
With the barbecue lit, we turned
our minds to the guest list.

449
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:25,085
Well, I know.. I've invited
Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp...

450
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,013
- Oh, you invited Johnny as well?
- I invited Johnny Depp.

451
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:32,024
He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.
I've invited her again.

452
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:34,013
Look, if you invite
Angelina, she won't come.

453
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:38,513
- She will.
- No, she won't.
- We're bigger than ever. She will.

454
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:48,084
By 9am our spread was ready and we'd laid
out a selection of toys to keep our
A-listers entertained.

455
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:50,033
I can't give Harrison Ford this.

456
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:53,076
Do you think she saw when we
went to Vietnam on those bikes?

457
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:56,040
No. She isn't coming.

458
00:35:57,092 --> 00:36:00,981
- And she wasn't.
- Who's that? That's not Angelina.

459
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:05,048
I know who that is.
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor.

460
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,037
- I knew that.
- Nick.
- Jeremy. How are you?

461
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:11,068
Nick was looking forward to driving
our new reasonably priced car.

462
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:15,004
Over there, in
brown, the Kia cee'd.

463
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,029
Now that is my sort of car.

464
00:36:17,064 --> 00:36:23,076
Dull, slow. But the Political Editor's
start was far from slow.

466
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:30,544
Ooh, I like the smell of burning rubber.
God, it's addictive!

467
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:34,056
It would've been polite to
show an interest in Nick's lap.

468
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,045
Here we go! Don't brake!

469
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,004
But we got distracted by our
next guest - Al Murray...

470
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,053
- Hi. Pickled cucumber?
- .. who is my kind of guy.

471
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:51,076
My favourite medium tank of the war,
T-34-85 with the larger calibre gun that
could take on a tiger.

472
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:55,008
As Nick was on his hot lap,
we should've paid attention.

473
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:56,973
Not fifth, you BLEEP!

474
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,052
But sadly, we got distracted again.

475
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,969
Oh, I love it!

476
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:14,052
Just give me a news conference now.
I tell you what, no politician is safe!

477
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:17,072
It was time to put the first
ever result on the new board.

478
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:21,005
Here it is.

479
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,020
Nick Robinson, 1.499. First!

480
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:26,965
You're the first! Amazing!

481
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The fastest man ever to go
round this track in that car.

482
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,981
As Al Murray roared off...

483
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:39,028
Turn, turn, turn,
turn, you doughnut.

484
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:44,017
.. tall Dragon Peter Jones arrived.

485
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:49,080
My day just immediately takes
a downturn. No offence.

486
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:54,004
With the hellos over, Peter unleashed
his killer instinct to win.

487
00:37:56,064 --> 00:38:00,076
Wait a minute! You're supposed
to let the other person...

488
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,049
How competitive.
He's actually playing himself!

489
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:07,052
With the game over, we should've
turned our attention to Al.

490
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:12,977
- Oh, yes!
- But at that moment a Page 3 girl arrived.

491
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:16,032
- Peta, 23, from Essex.
- Hello, Jeremy Clarkson from Tops Gear.

492
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,072
- Tops Gear?! How are you?
- Very well. Thank you.

493
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:20,965
- Come along. You're not Jewish, are you?
- I'm not, no.

494
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,008
Good. So we've got sausages and
we've got bacon and everything.

495
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:31,016
Peta didn't fancy Hammond's
sausages, or my vegetarian option.

496
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:33,096
So at last we turned
our thoughts to Al...

497
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:38,000
.. just as he crossed
the finishing line.

498
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:39,029
One...

499
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:41,080
Yes. Thank goodness it's a one.

500
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:43,081
40... Yes.

501
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:45,013
Ballpark.

502
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:48,066
Eight... point one.

503
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:51,049
You, sir, the fastest.

504
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,973
A fact that Al was keen to
point out to Nick Robinson.

505
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:57,033
Whenever I see you on TV now I'm
going to think, "Quicker than him".

506
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:02,076
Whatever your Downing Street analysis
might be, you might know more about

507
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:07,097
the inner workings of the
coalition, but I'm quicker than you.

508
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:12,084
As the competitive Dragon pounded
round, we decided to spy on him.

509
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,589
He doesn't know we can see him.

510
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,060
# Come on baby, light my fire. #

511
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:22,040
Next to arrive was Johnny Vaughan.

512
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:24,037
- Vaughany!
- All right, Clarky.

513
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:29,016
Who as a former star in the car was keen
to gen up on the cee apostrophe dee.

514
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,080
We're talking 124
brake horse power.

515
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:34,079
What was the last one?

516
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:36,009
The last one was 119.

517
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:38,040
OK. So we're packing
five more here.

518
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,092
Five more horses in the stable.

519
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:46,040
The competitive Dragon had
finished his whole lap.

520
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:48,997
Whoo-hoo! Please tell
me that was quick.

521
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:53,029
Now we would find out the difference
between our old Chevy and the new Kia.

522
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:59,004
This is where all of South Korea is sitting
and going, "Do we make a fast car than
Chevrolet?"

523
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:05,016
Seriously, can we go toe-to-toe with
the North across the bamboo curtain?

524
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:08,068
Where were you in
the old car? 1.469.

525
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:11,020
You did it in one minute...

526
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:13,024
Oh, Jeremy.

527
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,088
45.9. Yes!

528
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:23,072
That's going to take some strangling, that.
That's a second faster.

529
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:30,048
- As Peta, 23, from Essex hitthe track...
- I cannot change gear.

530
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:34,033
.. Hammond's dreams
finally came true.

531
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:38,088
- Make-up does a lot.
- No, you might gain a few pounds
on the telly, but it doesn't do that.

532
00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:39,985
It does. It does. Get off!

533
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,004
Cos when Angelina comes, if you've bent the
badge, she'll be cross. You can't have it!

534
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,535
Out on the track, it was
starting to get wet and slippery.

535
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,997
And the chaps were desperately
concerned for Peta's welfare.

536
00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:57,076
- When does a gazebo become a tent?
- All right. This is not even a tent, is it? - It is.

537
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,981
- It's a gazebo.
- No, it's not. It's not even that.

538
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:07,080
Despite the rain, Peta
matched Nick Robinson's time.

539
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:09,096
Then Johnny Vaughan set off.

540
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:11,037
Ignore the weather.

541
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:14,076
To an inspiring
soundtrack from Angelina.

542
00:41:19,032 --> 00:41:21,009
Don't lose your bottle,
don't lose your bottle.

543
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:24,076
Keep your foot down, keep your
foot down, keep your foot down.

544
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,985
The weather got worse and worse.

545
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,068
- Whoa!
- Someone left a cake out in the rain.

546
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:40,028
This is where you've got to have balls.
This is where it counts.

547
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:43,041
Meanwhile, I'd spotted
our next guest.

548
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:47,012
Someone I'd first encountered
on The Jonathan Ross Show.

549
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,001
Oh, my God!

550
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:50,981
- It's Angelina Jolie.
- No. Hammond, I've just remembered.

551
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:56,080
- It's June 10th, isn't it?
- Er, yes, it is.
- My wife's birthday.

552
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:58,989
- What, today?
- Yeah.
- You idiot.

553
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:03,032
- I'm going to, no, seriously, I'm going
to go now, this second.
- What, now?!

554
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:07,061
This second and I'm going to
get her a birthday present.

555
00:42:07,096 --> 00:42:10,578
Next guest is here. He's
brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

556
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:14,025
Real man's man, you know?
I'll be back, I'll be back.

557
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,088
- So I'm looking after the...
- Yes, yes.
- What's he called? - Louie.

558
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:20,041
Where's Jeremy going?

559
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:24,060
- Oh, hello. All right?
- Hello. I'm Bill. Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Louie. You all right?

560
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:26,033
Louie seemed very friendly.

561
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:30,028
Oh, mind. You're getting dribbled
there, darling. Just dribbling on you.

562
00:42:30,063 --> 00:42:32,072
Yeah, it's dribbling on you.

563
00:42:33,076 --> 00:42:35,057
Johnny was still out driving.

564
00:42:35,092 --> 00:42:37,997
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

565
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:43,048
Bill went bird watching and that left
me all alone with my new best friend.

566
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,060
- I'll be over here.
- I'm just having a little stretch just
before I get in there. Try it.

567
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:57,075
- Do what?
- Flat back over and just
stretch out your hamstrings.

568
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,056
- I'm, I've got a war wound from fighting
a rugby player.
- No, no, no.

569
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:03,053
No, honestly, you'll be surprised.

570
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:11,008
With Jeremy still not back the celebrities
were getting more and more unruly.

571
00:43:11,043 --> 00:43:13,977
Bill, get off the track!
What the BLEEP are you doing, Bill?

572
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:17,048
- The race track is no place for snacks or
fancy cakes. 
- Do you want something to eat?

573
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,005
All right. Custard
cream if you're asking.

574
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,981
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

575
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:28,526
And side, two, three, four, catch,
take it down, walk around, walk around.

576
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:33,036
Flip ball change, flip ball change,
step turn, step turn, in and look.

577
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:41,985
Mercifully, I had to go and put Johnny's
time on the lap board, but even that was
stressful.

578
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,088
We knock five seconds off, or we add five
seconds for a wet lap in our mind, so it's
five seconds gone.

579
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:51,041
- what is the point??...
- Look at the numbers...

580
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:53,037
That's how it works!

581
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:55,564
'Worse, Johnny started
giving advice to Louie. '

582
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,021
Watch your big end as you
slide through Hammerhead.

583
00:43:58,056 --> 00:44:02,044
Your back end will slide out if you
don't get the purchase up there.

584
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,064
Also, watch your helmet
against the steel bar.

585
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,041
'Clarkson finally got back. '

586
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:11,001
- Hammond! 
- 'Just as the fire was being put out. '

587
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:13,993
- Don't put the fire barbecue out!
- I wanted one of those sausages.

588
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:18,056
Louie, what have you done with the fireman
who was in that jacket and helmet?

589
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:21,028
Have things not been going
smoothly since I just...

590
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:23,553
- Yeah, yeah. It's gone well.
- Has it?

591
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:26,009
As Angelina wrestled
with the Kia...

592
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:31,048
Turn! Turn... We get out of the turn with
speed, yes, because speed is our friend.

593
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,033
.. our next guest arrived.

594
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:39,092
Amy Williams, Britain's only gold
medallist at the Winter Olympics.

595
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:41,013
What is it that's worrying you?

596
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:46,068
I'm quite scared and I'm worried that I'm
just going to skid off course by trying to
be too quick.

597
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:48,981
Wait a minute.
You earned your notoriety

598
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:55,052
- from, let's be honest, skidding down a
mountain at extremely high speed.
- Sophisticated skidding!

599
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:01,005
I think that was... Was it a crow?
Or was it a raven?

600
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,092
In the celebrity gymnasium, I too was
enjoying a spot of bird watching.

601
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:09,080
Take your arms up to the side.

602
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:15,049
Squats. Meanwhile, Richard
Hammond is with Louie Spence.

603
00:45:15,084 --> 00:45:20,056
And you go flat out through there,
and you come to a tight left here.

604
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:22,973
Right. Quite a wide bit
of the track there.

605
00:45:23,008 --> 00:45:27,040
So I can just go back to the flat out
but up here, this tight bit here?

606
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:32,016
You just go flat out through there,
and then flat out round there.

607
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:34,084
So, why am I so tight
up to the edge here?

608
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,981
As Jeremy tried to impress Amy...

609
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:41,965
I'm extremely fit. I don't think
a lot of people realise that.

610
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,060
.. Angelina was finishing her lap,
confident that she'd beaten Johnny Vaughan.

611
00:45:46,095 --> 00:45:47,993
Ha ha ha ha ha!

612
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:53,026
He was 1:53.3.
You did it in 1:50.8.

613
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:58,024
Oh ho ho! Now that... That's good.

614
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,025
.. when Louie out on the track.

615
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,001
BLEEP! Where's that corner gone?
There it is.

616
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:12,020
I wanted to say hello to Amy, but
unfortunately she was still being
monopolised.

617
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:16,032
I can do Congratulations,
are you ready?

618
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:17,084
Yeah.

619
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,030
Despite a few pirouettes... BLEEP!

620
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:31,000
.. Louie finally banged in a lap.

621
00:46:33,012 --> 00:46:37,516
You did it in 1:53.69.

622
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:41,985
Louie was very unhappy.

623
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,076
I gave a better show than Johnny.

624
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:45,061
I mean he took no chances.

625
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:49,060
- No chances at all!
- So I left him and Hammond 
to say a tender goodbye...

626
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:52,067
Can I have my helmet back now?

627
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,005
.. and escorted Amy to the car.

628
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,080
OK, so, skeleton run, here we go.
But in a car.

629
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:03,080
I was looking forward
to watching her lap.

630
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:05,583
But Hammond kept shouting at me.

631
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:08,017
I've been running all of his.

632
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:10,564
I've been in charge of
everything you see here.

633
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,041
This whole operation takes
a lot of looking after.

634
00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:17,048
I've been back for hours. Standing on
wobbling machine with a sports girl.

635
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:21,020
Why can't I look after the girl?
You can, but I'd like to have talked to her.

636
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:24,000
Maybe you could have talked to
Louie for a couple of minutes?

637
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:26,001
I did! I said goodbye.

638
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:30,036
Out on the track, Amy was
displaying all of the raw skill...

639
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:35,092
.. that had won her a gold medal.
In my mind, she was brilliant.

640
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:42,068
- Whoa! 
- Watch, watch, watch.

641
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:49,969
- Clap.
- No.

642
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:52,993
Amy, you did it in...

643
00:47:53,028 --> 00:47:58,040
Now, bear in mind we've got
a 1:53.7, and a 1:50.8.

644
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,020
These are the wet times. Yeah.

645
00:48:00,055 --> 00:48:03,080
You did it in 1:50.9.

646
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:08,009
- So, you're there.
- I'm just disappointed about that.

647
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:11,060
I think I do have to come back
and practise a little bit more.

648
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:14,053
I'd be delighted if you came back.
Absolutely thrilled.

649
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:17,012
- When it's not raining.
- Maybe use a faster car?

650
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:19,013
Come back any time. Move in.
Practise constantly. Why not?..

651
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:25,080
With Amy gone, Jeremy decided
there was no reason to stay.

652
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:34,000
So, I sat down to wait
for the real Angelina.

653
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:35,052
Just give it another hour.

654
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:45,056
- She was so stunning. She is.
- Louie is a nice guy.

655
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:49,052
-Let me ask, let me ask.
Did she turn up?
- Yep! - Really?!

656
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:52,001
- No.
- No, I didn't think she would.

657
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:56,041
Anyway, I'd now like you to
have a look at this motorcycle.

658
00:48:56,076 --> 00:49:01,076
Now, I know it's not a motorcycle, OK?
But the Government says it is.

659
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:06,012
They say that because it only has
three wheels, it's not a car.

660
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:10,037
And as a result, you save
L55 a year on your tax disc.

661
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,993
Now obviously, the best way
of exploiting this loophole

662
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:17,080
is to take a wheel off your car and
drive round on the other three,

663
00:49:17,115 --> 00:49:19,101
but we don't recommend that.

664
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:21,088
So is there another way?

665
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,004
This is a Reliant Robin.

666
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:39,977
And on the face of it, it's hard
to see how it ever caught on.

667
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:46,092
And emk/gven though it was made from plastic rather
than steel, it cost more when it was new
than a Mini.

668
00:49:49,036 --> 00:49:50,061
Catch on it did, though.

669
00:49:50,096 --> 00:49:54,076
The American Embassy in London
ran three as diplomatic cars.

670
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:56,001
Princess Anne had one.

671
00:49:56,036 --> 00:50:01,024
Here in the North of England, it was
such a hit that by the middle of

672
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:06,012
the 1970s, Reliant was the largest
consumer of glass fibre in Europe.

673
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:09,053
Even to this day, this
remains the second best

674
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:15,000
selling plastic car in history,
after the Chevrolet Corvette.

675
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:22,088
Unlike other three-wheelers, the Reliant's
single wheel was at the front rather than
the back.

676
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:27,000
I've always been rather worried that
this might have a profound effect

677
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:28,096
on the handling.

678
00:50:32,024 --> 00:50:36,045
That's why I'm so scared about the
challenge which has been set for me today.

679
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:45,068
Because I have to drive that car all the way
from here, on the outskirts of Sheffield, to a
pigeon loft here,

680
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:47,033
in Rotherham.

681
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:51,024
That's a distance of 14 miles.

682
00:50:53,072 --> 00:50:57,048
On the way, there will be many
perils such as roundabouts,

683
00:50:57,083 --> 00:51:03,076
pedestrian crossings,
pedestrians and traffic lights.

684
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:07,993
That's why I'm wearing a helmet.

685
00:51:08,028 --> 00:51:10,045
It's also why I insisted the car
was fitted with a four-point

686
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:18,000
safety harness, because I really genuinely
believe that what I'm about to do is as
dangerous as...

687
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:22,072
Inviting you mum round for an
evening on Chat Roulette. Why?

688
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:29,068
Here we go. Reliant Robin.

689
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:41,036
Oh, no. I've crashed it.
I've crashed it almost immediately.

690
00:51:41,071 --> 00:51:43,545
I mean, literally, 20 feet.

691
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,020
I can't get out, obviously.

692
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:48,045
I'm completely stuck.

693
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,052
Luckily, people in the North of England
are friendly and keen to help out.

694
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:56,036
Excuse me!

695
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:00,053
Excuse me...

696
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:03,544
Oh heavens, look who it is!
It's Phil Oakey.

697
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,000
Do you think you can push
me back on my wheels?

698
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:09,028
- Yeah, certainly.
- Thanks very much.

699
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,008
Thank you, so much.

700
00:52:16,044 --> 00:52:20,084
- Thank you very much, Phil Oakey,
out of the Human League!
- Pleasure.

701
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:27,036
I suppose as a Sheffield boy, Phil
Oakey spent a lot of his youth

702
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:30,965
putting Robin Reliants
back on their wheels.

703
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,060
When he wasn't rescuing
waitresses from cocktail...

704
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:38,053
Oh! Help!

705
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,977
Again! Help!

706
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:46,020
Where's Martin Fry out
of ABC when you need him?

707
00:52:50,044 --> 00:52:53,060
That's a... useful feature.

708
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:04,036
In the early days, the
Robin had a 750cc engine.

709
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:13,032
With 32 brake horse power on tap,
0-50 took 22 seconds. 0-60...

710
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:14,997
wasn't really possible.

711
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:21,068
In 1975 though, Reliant
fitted an 850cc engine.

712
00:53:21,103 --> 00:53:24,551
This improved the
acceleration enormously.

713
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:28,000
But the consequences
were catastrophic...

714
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,029
The lamppost!

715
00:53:37,064 --> 00:53:43,068
The big engine increase the top
speed too... It would now do 85.

716
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:47,008
That was catastrophic as well.

717
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:52,037
Not again!

718
00:53:52,072 --> 00:53:58,009
Oh no! I'm 50 years old.

719
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:01,056
I'm on the side of a
street in Sheffield.

720
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,040
Oh, is that the sound of somebody?

721
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:11,040
Hello? Peter Stringfellow!

722
00:54:14,008 --> 00:54:17,068
Were you just walking by, or...

723
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:19,055
Nearly!

724
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,973
Yes!

725
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,032
Thank you so much, Peter Stringfellow
out of lap dancing clubs.

726
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:27,048
- My pleasure.
- Really, I can't thank you enough.

727
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:37,044
To try and understand why the Robin was so
popular up north, I pulled over to chat to
some enthusiasts.

728
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,044
- How do you drive a Reliant?
- Straight lines.

729
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,013
You don't go round roundabouts.

730
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:52,092
You get to it and you see where you're
coming off, and you go straight across.

731
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:55,037
Try to avoid t'hill in t'middle.

732
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:58,033
- Cement on the passenger seat.
- Cement?

733
00:54:58,068 --> 00:55:01,080
Yeah, sack of cement on t'passenger
seat belt, helps the balance.

734
00:55:01,115 --> 00:55:05,040
Why do you think Reliant
owners have big tool boxes?

735
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:07,025
To weigh it down.
I was going to say...

736
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,088
Your teeth, did you lose
these in a Reliant accident?

737
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:12,017
You did, didn't you?

738
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:16,037
Why do you think, everybody,
Reliants were so popular in t'North.

739
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:21,033
- The miners used them.
- But why? Because they were
more expensive than Minis.

740
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:27,060
No, because a lot of miners originally started
with motorbikes, and they didn't have a
full driving licence.

741
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:32,061
So to get out of t'weather in winter
when it were absolutely siling it down,

742
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:37,028
they bought a Reliant. So it was just
because miners didn't have a driving licence?

743
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:40,076
Some of them. But other ones, also
in t'winter, with them being light,

744
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:46,060
you'd get your normal car
stuck in t'snow or whatever.

745
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:48,080
These just simply glide over top.

746
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,981
Until you get to a corner!

747
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:54,040
Well, long as you live somewhere
with a straight line to t'pit.

748
00:55:58,076 --> 00:56:02,001
Soon, I was back on
my perilous journey.

749
00:56:02,036 --> 00:56:08,048
In this, it feels like I'm driving through
South Yorkshire in the 1970s, again.

750
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:14,096
I grew up not far from here, so
did James May, for that matter.

751
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:20,068
When I were a lad round 'ere,
all t'rich people, them as could

752
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:24,021
afford four wheels on the
car, they all had Ladas.

753
00:56:24,056 --> 00:56:29,000
Lah-de-dahs we called them.
You didn't want to hit one of them,

754
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:32,024
I'll tell you that for nowt,
they were built like tanks.

755
00:56:34,072 --> 00:56:37,096
One of the best ways to protect
your Robin was to lavish it with

756
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:42,581
an exotic paint job, such as
this Starsky And Hutch homage.

757
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:48,032
The idea was that having spent
many hours with the spray cans

758
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:51,016
and the masking tape, you'd
drive more carefully.

759
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:54,008
But this didn't always work.

760
00:57:01,056 --> 00:57:06,048
It really is a wonder how anyone
in the North survived the 1970s.

761
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:09,029
Of course, a lot didn't.

762
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:15,084
In 1971, the population
of Sheffield was 573,000.

763
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:21,053
Since then, it's dropped
to just 513,000.

764
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:27,965
Some of the lost 60,000
moved down south, of course.

765
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,096
But many, many, many more were
wiped out by their three-wheelers.

766
00:57:38,052 --> 00:57:45,040
Today, of course, most of the Robins are
gone and people up here drive Kias and
Hyundais instead.

767
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:49,012
This means the local TV news
channel has to think of things

768
00:57:49,047 --> 00:57:53,012
other than Reliant crashes
to put in its bulletins.

769
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:06,008
To Braithwell in South Yorkshire and a
blooming mystery that's baffling its
green-fingered residents.

770
00:58:06,043 --> 00:58:08,088
Harry is there for us.
Harry, what's going on?

771
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:10,025
Welcome to the beautiful Braithwell.

772
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,009
You can see the sun exploding
on a kaleidoscope of colour.

773
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:18,080
I have to say, there has been a real area
of controversy here, because over the last
few days... My God!

774
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:27,064
Are you all right, sir?
I'm getting used to it now, thanks.

775
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,025
Thanks, very much.

776
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,024
If you could just pop
me back on the wheels.

777
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:36,013
Thank you, so much.

778
00:58:36,048 --> 00:58:39,096
- Thank you, Harry Grayson,
out of Look North.
- Pleasure.

779
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:41,048
Thank you, so much.

780
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:58,981
The Reliant three-wheeler
soldiered on until 2001,

781
00:58:59,016 --> 00:59:03,024
but then with the mines gone,
the customer base dried up.

782
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,025
And it was gone too.

783
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:12,088
I don't know why Jasper Carrot ever thought
that this could be the basis for a joke.

784
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:18,008
I don't know why we all laughed at Del
Boy's Reliant, because it wasn't funny.

785
00:59:18,043 --> 00:59:20,076
It was a complete menace.

786
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:30,536
Oh, God!

787
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,965
Oh, dear.

788
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,009
Oh, dear. Look at the pitch.

789
00:59:35,044 --> 00:59:39,020
I'm very glad I've put
these safety things in.

790
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:44,005
That's marvellous, thank you.
Oh yes, that's comfortable.

791
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:49,092
Thank you, very much. That's Dickie Bird
MBE out of cricket umpiring here, he's not
pleased.

792
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,028
It's a cricket match on here!

793
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:06,036
After this latest accident, I
decided to see if there was

794
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:10,051
some way of correcting
the car's flawed design.

795
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:14,032
I therefore found a
workshop and cued the music.

796
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,024
Oh, God, I've driven
into the inspection pit.

797
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:26,008
Soon though, the car was
out, and we set to work.

798
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:38,045
What staggers me most of all is that
the Reliant was engineered and built

799
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:44,072
in Tamworth in Staffordshire, and Tamworth
over the years has produced many, many
brilliant men.

800
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:50,064
It was a Tamworth man who captured one of
the Enigma coding machines from the Germans
in the war.

801
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:55,088
It's a Tamworth man who
fronts The Teardrop Explodes.

802
01:00:55,123 --> 01:00:57,969
I mean, how many more do you want?

803
01:00:58,004 --> 01:01:03,040
So, how come no one in this town
of excellence was able to see

804
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:07,044
that the Reliant could
be fixed in a trifle?

805
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:14,977
How brilliant is this?

806
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:16,977
It's still a three-wheeler.

807
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:20,016
You still only pay
motorcycle tax, but now,

808
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,549
thanks to these stabilisers...

809
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:25,048
it can't roll over any more.

810
01:01:32,096 --> 01:01:35,021
I only had six miles
of the journey left.

811
01:01:35,056 --> 01:01:38,064
But with my new anti-capsize
solution in place,

812
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:41,068
I knew nothing could go wrong.

813
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:45,064
And I knew that right
up to the moment...

814
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:46,597
when it did.

815
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:48,356
Oh, my God!

816
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:50,080
Oh, no!

818
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,088
Neck broken, and drowned.

820
01:02:08,596 --> 01:02:10,965
So...

821
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,032
You can save L55 off your
annual motoring costs?

822
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:16,001
Yes, you can.

823
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:18,004
But you will be killed doing it?

824
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:18,981
Yes, you will.

825
01:02:19,016 --> 01:02:23,084
And on that bombshell, it is time to end
what I think has been a very serious show.

826
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,044
I think we should congratulate
ourselves on that.

827
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,037
Very good work, well done.

828
01:02:27,072 --> 01:02:30,045
We'll see you next week for
more sensible buying advice.

829
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:35,048
Thank you so much for watching and
do please remember, drive safely. Good night. 

830
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:57,076
