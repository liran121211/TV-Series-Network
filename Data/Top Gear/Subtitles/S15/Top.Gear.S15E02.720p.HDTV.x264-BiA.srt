1
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:15,016
Tonight, James gets wet.

2
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:18,024
An actual or spin
doctor on our track.

3
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,056
And the Stig laps a Reliant Robin.

4
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:30,056
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hello.

5
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,088
Hello. Good evening. Hello.

6
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:35,033
Now...

7
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, as we know, as we know, track
days these days are very popular.

8
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:45,032
The idea is that you drive
your own car to a race circuit,

9
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:47,096
wearing some horrible
branded shirt...

10
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,041
LAUGHTER

11
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:51,017
Like, for example, this one.

12
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:57,036
And then you drive around as fast as
possible all day and then you go home.

13
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,997
Today, track days are
such big business

14
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:04,012
you can even buy specialised track
day cars like this KTM Crossbow.

15
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:08,057
Thing is, this costs
L45,000, which is a lot,

16
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,989
especially as you can't exactly
take the kids to school in it.

17
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:18,018
No, so, to address this, the producers gave
us each a budget of L5,000, and they told
us to buy

18
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:24,012
four-door saloons that could be used every
day but that would also be good on a track
day.

19
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:28,053
And because the challenges they
had in mind were quite serious,

20
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,060
they told us to meet up in the
world's the least amusing city.

21
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:41,076
Yup, it was Berlin.

22
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:49,068
I was the first to arrive
and as you would imagine,

23
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:51,579
I had done everything properly.

24
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:54,021
This is a Mercedes 190 Cosworth

25
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:58,061
and Martin Brundle, the
former Formula One driver,

26
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:03,068
said that this car had one of the best
chassis ever fitted to a four-door saloon.

27
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:07,088
It is, if you like, the
thinking man's BMW M3.

28
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:09,044
Talking of which...

29
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,028
Hammond. Oh, yeah. Take a look.

30
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:18,049
Yes. BMW M3, 3.2 litres.

31
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,973
So you've bought the wrong one.

32
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,048
No, I haven't, because the original
one is now considered a classic.

33
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,029
So you can't get a good
one for less than 15,000.

34
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:32,008
This, the series two of the M3,
is bigger, faster and better.

35
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:36,025
So this is the famous
Mercedes 190. It is. 2.3.

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,048
Cosworth. Known for being the
slowest performance car of all time.

37
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:46,036
At that moment we were interrupted
by the arrival of Clarkson.

38
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,060
Predictable, predictable...

39
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:50,005
For good reason.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,025
The only reason you two didn't buy a Ford
Sierra Sapphire Cosworth is cos you forgot
about it.

41
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,016
No. It's because when you think of
high-performance four-door saloons you
naturally think of Germany.

42
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,000
It's what they do here. Exactly.

43
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:06,033
And where was yours made?

44
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:11,012
Well, it was designed by a man
called Uwe Bahnsen, who is German.

45
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:13,025
And where was it built? Belgium.

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,076
Ah, Belgium, the meccafor the
performance motorist. Yeah.

47
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:19,057
Belgium is home to everything.
Tennis players, chips...

48
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:23,068
It's not the first place you think of
going for a performance saloon car!

49
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,060
You two are going to lose his and
you will end up in ze cooler...

50
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:28,096
'At that moment, a
challenge arrived. '

51
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:31,001
Oh, hello. Thank you.

52
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:35,021
"You will now leave Berlin, and head
down an unrestricted autobahn. " Good.

53
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:43,028
"Points will be awarded for every mph more
than 130 that you can or, should we say,
dare achieve. "

54
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:46,056
Still won't be out of second
gear when they're going down...

55
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,000
What's the top speed?
Top speed of that? Yeah.

56
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:51,009
151.

57
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,029
Mine had to be LIMITED to 155.

58
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,017
This is when they
introduced limiting.

59
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,045
They realised it's too fast.
It's a monster.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,036
Fair enough, becausethis had the six
cylinder engine,3.2 litre. It did.

61
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:05,040
James, I seem to remember
this was not that fast. No.

62
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,581
What was its top speed? 143. 143?!

63
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,053
So not really a performance car.

64
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:14,024
But I reckon mine will still do
that because it is a Mercedes...

65
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,985
What? Oh, my God!

66
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,013
Ah, the interior, yeah.

67
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,096
Have you seen the inside of his car?
Toffee and caramel, that interior is.

68
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:26,029
It's not! Oh, and he's gone
for the fake wood door-pull.

69
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:31,016
That's a quality touch.
Right,we've got to get out of Berlin. OK.

70
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,045
What's that?

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,993
I don't know.
Wasn't there this morning.

72
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,012
You don't think it fell out
of James' luggage, do you?

73
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:42,004
HE LAUGHS Fell out of my what?
I missed that.

74
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:51,052
Ooh, yes. Straight six.

75
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,072
That's a proper engine.

76
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:57,004
This is the Wall.

77
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:05,060
What this car has, that the other two cars
don't have, is a dog-leg first gear. I
should explain this.

78
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:09,016
Normally, first gear is
away from you and forwards

79
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,969
but here it is away
from you and backwards.

80
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:17,032
That means that second and third and then
fourth and fifth are in straight lines,

81
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,001
which is what you want for racing,

82
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:23,072
so that is a sign that this car
has a proper motor sport pedigree.

83
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,013
You have to remember that in
the late '80s, early '90s,

84
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:33,048
the Germans were all drunk, running around
celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall.

85
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,981
And that showed in the sloppiness
of the cars they were making.

86
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:42,052
The Belgians, on the other hand, they
never have anything to celebrate.

87
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:47,088
They just get up, go to work and
do a good job, as we can see here.

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,096
Those are his reversing lights.

89
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:58,973
Oh, BLEEP!

90
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,036
James, what was that?

91
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:02,013
Er, nothing.

92
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:06,024
Look, I've had 30 years of
it being left and forward.

93
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,016
It's a difficult
habit to get out of.

94
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,084
HE CHUCKLES

95
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:17,020
On the outskirts of Berlin, we pulled
over so our cars could be fitted

96
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:19,001
with super-accurate speedometers.

97
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:24,096
And then we hit the autobahn, to
see which one was the fastest.

98
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,060
Right, for Belgium!

99
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:34,052
Two-litre. 16 valve. Massive turbo.

100
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:37,973
5,000rpm.

101
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,080
5,500. Into fifth.

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,029
120.

103
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:45,052
Come on, come on!

104
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,069
125.

105
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,017
6, 7...

106
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:51,036
Ooh, it's pulling to the right.

107
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:53,565
Gone floaty.

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,025
128... 9.

109
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,016
Come on, let's have 130!

110
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,053
Traffic.

111
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,080
Lot of trucks. A lot of trucks.

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,096
117.

113
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,044
121.

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,044
Feeling good.

115
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,068
128...

116
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,068
132.

117
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,044
135. Traffic.

118
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,080
Oh, God!

119
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,060
Clocked now at 114.

120
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,028
Concentrate.

121
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:42,004
122. A bit of a weave.

122
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,064
Oh, bloody lorry.

123
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,061
Achtung! Schnell! Schnell!

124
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:53,092
It turned out that while you're allowed
to reach the top speed of your car

125
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:57,001
on the autobahn, it's not easy.

126
00:07:57,036 --> 00:08:01,017
You get these German trucks...
Yes, look, he's doing it. He's doing it.

127
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:06,024
You just get these East German trucks and
they just pull out when they want to pull
out.

128
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:10,000
Eventually, though,
the traffic did thin.

129
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:13,000
So we went for another run.

130
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,004
Here we go, again!

131
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,558
Don't pull out.

132
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,064
Do not pull out.

133
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:25,050
132...

134
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,582
3, 4, 5...

135
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:30,080
Go! Come on!

136
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,045
136.

137
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,064
Smelling pretty bad.

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,049
138... 9...

139
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:45,052
140 miles an hour!

140
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:50,041
Oh, yes!

141
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,068
Engine temperature's shooting up.

142
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:56,997
Well, that was 142mph.

143
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:01,052
'Not bad for a 21 year-old Ford. '

144
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:04,036
Woo!

145
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,060
135, yes!

146
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,092
Give me 140! Give me 140!

147
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,025
There it is.

148
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,048
'Just three more miles per hour and the
German Cosworth would beat the Belgian
Cosworth. '

149
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,032
Come on, come, come on.

150
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:29,096
It's not going to do it. Sorry.

151
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:31,060
I did my best.

152
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,036
'Now, watch and learn. '

153
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,004
Come on now, come
on now, come on now.

154
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,072
138.

155
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,040
144...

156
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,000

159
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,064
152!

160
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,037
Traffic. Slowing.

161
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:07,076
This thing will do 155 pretty easily
I've just hit traffic every time.

162
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,056
Yeah, yeah... This will do 180.

163
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,072
It will!

00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:54,016
If we do crash, it will
take some explaining.

172
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:00,000
Come on. I'm the
tallest thing here.

173
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:03,050
It's not as bad as
you'd think, actually.

174
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,588
I'm trying to bekilled
by lightning. What?

175
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,092
I'm trying to bekilled
by lightning. Sorry?

176
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,080
Are you deaf? Sorry?

177
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,997
In you go.

178
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:16,036
'Sadly, I wasn't killed by
lightning, so I went next. '

179
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:19,016
Oh... I might just move these.

180
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:24,008
It's my light reading over here.

OOMPAH BAND PLAYS

182
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:32,028
'Almost immediately, I realised that
there WAS enough space in the back

183
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:34,981
'and that the rear
suspension was coping fine.

184
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:39,052
'So, I decided to pull over
as quickly as possible... '

185
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:40,965
Kill me.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,068
'.. and handed the
band over to James. '

187
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,060
Ready, James? Ja.

188
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:48,037
Forwards!

189
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:51,000
Scheisse. HE LAUGHS

190
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:03,068
'After a while, it became apparent
James wasn't coming back. '

191
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:07,004
BAND CONTINUES PLAYING

192
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,017
Oh, hello.

193
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:15,028
This looks like trouble.

194
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,021
'While waiting for the
Mercedes to cool down,

195
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:24,048
'we asked the oompah band which car
they thought was the most spacious. '

196
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,021
Is it the Mercedes? No.

197
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:30,024
Definitely not the Mercedes.
What about the BMW?

198
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,025
It's the best.

199
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,020
Ha-ha! You see? You see?
It's our favourite.

200
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,533
Why?! It's smaller than the Ford.

201
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,977
It's coming from Bavaria, like us.

202
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:41,550
It isn't the test of
where are they from!

203
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:44,088
This is just racism
against the Belgians.

204
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:46,965
Listen, their decision is final.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,020
They decide it won the... What are
we calling it - the oompah test?

206
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:52,040
The oompah test.
It won fair and square.

207
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,049
Because it's Bavarian. It won!

208
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,024
OOMPAH BAND RESUMES PLAYING

209
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,076
Thank you for nothing.

210
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,064
Absolutely nothing.

211
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,084
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

212
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:10,989
That's ridiculous.

213
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,056
The judges' decision
is final. Saying...

214
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:19,080
Saying the BMW's the most spacious
because it was made in Bavaria...

215
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,559
that's like saying, "Who's the
tallest Top Gear presenter?"

216
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,969
"It's Richard Hammond cos he'sfrom
Birmingham. " No, it's not!

217
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:30,530
"Who's the fastest driver of the three?
It's James May because he's wearing his
mum's curtains. "

218
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:35,056
It really is the most spacious car. That's
a fact and that's the judges' decision.
Live with it.

219
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:38,017
Stop bleating, let us do the news.

220
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:44,054
Yeah. Actually, I want to starton a serious
note, if I may,with the news, because, as
we know,

221
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:50,056
for many years, we've been told that Wayne
Rooney is the light and the path to
righteousness,

222
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:54,084
and we must emulate his lifestyle, and
indeed the lifestyle of his lovely wife,
Coleen.

223
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:59,024
Now of course, we realise he is a
lazy, talentless jug-eared oaf.

224
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,969
AUDIENCE CHEERS

225
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:03,036
APPLAUSE Well, he is.

226
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,045
That's quite strong.
Strong but true.

227
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,088
I'm now hoping this means an end
to the Rooney-fication of Britain.

228
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:16,056
Exhibit A, the Range Rover, OK?
This was the old model.

229
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,989
Note the plain, sensible front end,

230
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,064
just some headlights to see where
you're going. Its noble. It's noble.

231
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:23,589
As dignified as a rolled umbrella.

232
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:25,045
Now look what they've done to it.

233
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Look at this. Honest.
This is the new one. What is it?

234
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:30,973
How much bling can you
get on the front...?

235
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:34,080
Look at all the fiddly headlamps
and all this business going on!

236
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:38,036
I'm surprised it doesn't
have studs in its ears, here.

237
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:41,017
They have literally ruined it.

238
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:45,046
Now, listen, I am aware, of course,
that there is a demand for a car

239
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:49,040
that looks like this, because I know
there's such a place as Cheshire.

240
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:54,064
And I don't mind if they make this...
Range Rover Rooney edition.

241
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:57,032
They could just call
it the Range Rooney.

242
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,029
No, no - the Wayne Wover.

243
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:03,544
LAUGHTER These are good names.
These are good names.

244
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,989
But all I'm asking is
please can everybody else,

245
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:11,004
ordinary decent people, have
the old one back, please?

246
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,033
I have to say I agree with you.

247
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,985
There needs to be a version
of the new Range Rover

248
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:22,016
that isn't for people who want to celebrate
the life and work of a potato-faced
shopping enthusiast.

249
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,021
We want the old one back.
We really do. We do.

250
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,985
Now, there aren't very many things
that we all agree on, except this.

251
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,000
We all think that the best small car that
you can buy at the moment is the Citroen
DS3.

252
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,017
Now, we're not joking about this.

253
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:39,008
That is a genuinely brilliant littlecar.
There's something about it.

254
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:42,525
It's like a Mini that smokes Gauloises.
It is. It's fantastic.

255
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,804
The weird thing is, it's got exactly
the same engine as the Mini,

256
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,048
the Mini Cooper. But it just feels better.
It does. It's great.

257
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,061
They're bringing out a
new hot version of this.

258
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:56,025
I've got the picture of it here.
It's called the Racing. OK? Yeah!

259
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,052
200 horsepower. The only think is Citroen
will not... They refuse to tell us how much
it's going to cost.

260
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:04,084
I'm just going to make it up.
50 quid. There you go.

261
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,033
It's L50. That's fantastic.

262
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:10,036
And the thing is, who in their
life wouldn't want orange wheels?

263
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:14,008
Seriously. Anyone with red hair,
I imagine. It would clash.

264
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:16,557
Red squirrels.
They'd look terrible.

265
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,037
The Duchess of York.
Anne Robinson. Yes.

266
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:22,092
The Pope. What's he called,th
e Pope bloke? Well, the Pope.

267
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,045
Silence, you two.

268
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,044
They're are only making 1,000 of them,
because they're French and therefore idle
Communists.

269
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,017
It's because nobody wants
orange wheels, obviously!

270
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:37,020
I can't wait to get a go in that. It looks
brilliant. And I do like the wheels.

271
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:40,977
Hey! Good news. LAUGHTER

272
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:48,056
I have secured some top-secret film taken
inside the factory of the new Dacia Duster
being made.

273
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,045
Ooh! Excellent.

274
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,062
Excellent. Anyway...

275
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:54,009
LAUGHTER The end of...

276
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,977
I'm sure you have. Thank you.

277
00:16:56,012 --> 00:17:00,016
At the end of last week's programme, this
appeared. This is called the end board.

278
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,559
This is what you see
every single week

279
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:03,068
at the end of every
single programme.

280
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,096
Except for Top Gear. Look -

281
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:07,033
MMXX.

282
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,001
That's 2020.

283
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:14,028
This is the only programme coming
from ten years in the future.

284
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:16,985
Anyway, the point is, OK,
there's a new car come out.

285
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,008
It's called the Night XV.
I've got a picture of it here. OK, now...

286
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:24,041
XV. What's that?

287
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,033
That's 207, in Roman numerals.

288
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:28,049
No... 93. Yeah,
something like that.

289
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:32,008
No, it's 207, definitely.
Let me talk you through it, OK?

290
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,028
L650,000.

291
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:43,060
For that you get internet connectivity,
you get DVD, TV, a cigar humidor...

292
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:48,056
And according to one report, it
can resist gunfire for 24 hours.

293
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:50,013
LAUGHTER

294
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:55,076
Do you know what? I think if I was shooting
at someone, I'd get sort of bored after
about four hours.

295
00:17:55,111 --> 00:18:00,052
I think the police would havearrived by
four hours, personally. But, forgive me, it
is a car.

296
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:02,005
You'd kind of drive
off before then.

297
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,020
After an hour, you'd think, "They're
not changing their minds. I'm going. "

298
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:07,021
He is still shooting at me.

299
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:10,076
And the other thing, as well,
is it's made in Canada.

300
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,080
Who in Canada could do...
? Are you Canadian?

301
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:15,041
Yeah! Yeah!

302
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:18,040
Whatever happens in Canada
that would cause somebody

303
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:21,033
to shoot at somebody
else for 24 hours?

304
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:25,080
The other thing as well is if you are
shooting at it, it's not likely you're
going to miss,

305
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:28,009
because here's a picture
of it next to a Hummer.

306
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:31,056
Look at the size of it! It is massive.
Absolutely unbelievable.

307
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:35,083
So that's Canada's answer
to the motor industry there.

308
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:39,076
Now, I don't know if any of
you were watching last week,

309
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:43,040
but I had several accidents
in a Reliant Robin.

310
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,985
Which has generated
a sizable postbag.

311
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,000
I've got some of the letters here. Lots of
them. Let me just read you this one, OK?

312
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:55,004
It says, "Dear Top Gear, the only reason
why Mr So-called Clarkson was killed

313
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,031
"is because he wasn't
driving it properly.

314
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:01,024
"I bet if the Stig drove
it, he'd be fine. "

315
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,060
Tell you what, let's find out.

316
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:08,096
I'm betting he rolls that over.
No, this is the Stig.

317
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:11,029
The only thing that's
ever defeated him was...

318
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:16,044
He will not be able to do a lap in that
car without rolling over. I guarantee it.

319
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,013
He'll use his special
Stiggy powers.

320
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:21,056
Coming up to the first corner now.
Perfect. Absolutely fine.

321
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:23,072
And... So he's made...

322
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:26,024
Oh no, he hasn't.

323
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:31,013
AUDIENCE GROANS

324
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,969
Told you. I told you.

325
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,025
There are more letters.
Here's one that caught my eye.

326
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,048
"Dear Top so-called Gear, why didn't
you use a Isetta Bubble Car instead?"

327
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,017
It's a good point. Why didn't you?

328
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:45,076
I've got one here - one wheel
at the back, two at the front.

329
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:48,024
It's a more stable
three-wheeler configuration.

330
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,977
Yeah. But this has another problem.

331
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:54,024
What problem? Well, why
don't you fire it up, mate?

332
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,973
The 300cc engine
bursting into life.

333
00:19:57,008 --> 00:20:01,052
Now, if you could drive into our imaginary
garage over here, that would be lovely.

334
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:04,056
Oh, look. He hasn't fallen over.
Still hasn't fallen over.

335
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:06,017
It's much better already.

336
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,037
Just wait, Hammond. Here we go.

337
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:11,068
OK, all the way into the garage,
please, mate. All the way in.

338
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:14,064
You've got a foot to go. Six inches.
There you go. Marvellous.

339
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,084
It hasn't fallen over.
It's much better.

340
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,060
OK. Now, if you'd
like to get out...

341
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,985
LAUGHTER

342
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,989
Oh, yeah. I see your point.
The door's at the front.

343
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:29,032
You'll have to back it up, mate. Yeah, go
on - reverse. OK. Where is reverse?

344
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,977
Hasn't got one.

345
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,014
LAUGHTER Really? No.

346
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,981
So how does he get out?

347
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:38,084
Well, this is the thing.
Honestly, if you think about it...

348
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,993
If you don't listen...

349
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:43,049
James, stop fingering the studio.

350
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:45,981
The thing is, OK, that if
you had one of these cars,

351
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:49,080
you got home like this, you got stuck
in your garage, there were two problems.

352
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:53,005
You couldn't call inside your
house for your wife or girlfriend

353
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,076
to come and rescue you, because it was the
1950s and the mobile telephone hadn't been
invented.

354
00:20:58,111 --> 00:21:04,020
And of course, if you had a car like this,
you wouldn't have a wife or a girlfriend.

355
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,057
Very funny. Could you
push me out now, please?

356
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:10,036
What? Would you give me a push?
Me push you out? Push you out...

357
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,045
Er... Can we...?

358
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,088
Sorry, what was the question? We could
either push him out or... Not do that. Not
do that.

359
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:19,993
Can we push him out? Ah...
I think no.

360
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,034
I'm coming down in favour
of no as well. Sorry, James.

361
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:26,040
It's a no, sorry. It's aunanimous no.
See you, mate. Sorry.

362
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:30,044
Right, well, let's
move it on, to this.

363
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,012
To that, actually, over there.

364
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:35,057
That is a Porsche 911.

365
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:39,592
And one way or another, that has
been with us for about 1,000 years.

366
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:44,092
Now, though, they've brought out
a sort of greatest hits version.

367
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:48,973
Here it is.

368
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,053
Porsche call is the Sport Classic.

369
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:57,092
But I prefer to think of it as "Now That's
What I Call The Best Of The 911...

370
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,977
"Volume One. "

371
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:06,054
These duck-tail spoiler was originally
a hit for the 1973 Carrera 2.7 RS.

372
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:12,096
The black headlamp surrounds were
first recorded by the 1974 Turbo RSR.

373
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:21,088
The Fuchs alloys are a cover version
of the ones first seen on the 1966911S.

374
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:26,008
And the wide-body rear arches
are from today's Carrera 4.

375
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:31,965
Anyway, that's enough
band analogies.

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,004
Let's see if this thing is as good as it
was before Peter Gabriel left Genesis.

377
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:40,068
Starting, if we must,
with how fast it will go.

378
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,012
You get 22 more horsepower than
you do in a standard Carrera S.

379
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:52,084
That means 0-60 in 4.6 seconds.

380
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,045
Top speed 188.

381
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,084
And I suppose that means
I've got to go and do it.

382
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,076
Argh!

383
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:25,528
So, it's very fast,
very good looking,

384
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:29,008
and surprisingly
soft and comfortable,

385
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,000
but there is a problem.

386
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,985
It's L140,000-

387
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,018
twice what a normal
Carrera S costs.

388
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,981
And they've only made 250 of them.

389
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:42,080
And you can't buy one, because
they've all been sold.

390
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:49,028
So let's move on to a
Porsche you can buy...

391
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:55,021
.. the new Boxster Spyder.

392
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:58,088
Porsche say this harks back
to the lightweight models

393
00:23:58,123 --> 00:24:00,061
James Dean was driving in the '50s.

394
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:05,000
But frankly, that's a bit
of marketing cobblers.

395
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:07,068
He was a rebel without an airbag.

396
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,028
This does have an airbag.

397
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:13,037
But that's about it.

398
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:19,012
It's 80kg lighter than the standard
Boxster, thanks to aluminium doors,

399
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:26,040
aluminium engine cover, super-light
wheels and carbon-fibre seats.

400
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,042
There's more, or rather, less.

401
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:34,049
There is no standard air-con.

402
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:38,029
The door handles have been replaced
by these little bits of rag

403
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:42,041
and they've even ditched the piece of
plastic that goes on top of the instruments.

404
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:49,020
What Porsche do is, they leave a lot of
things that you should get on a Boxster on
a shelf in the factory

405
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:53,016
and then they charge you more
for not giving them to you.

406
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,017
This car costs L46,000.

407
00:24:57,052 --> 00:25:00,048
That's 5,000 more
than the standard car

408
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,040
and you get less in return.

409
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:04,985
Or do you?

410
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:12,076
The 3.4 litre flat 6 now has 320
horsepower, 10 more than the standard
Boxsters.

411
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:20,056
And because it's lighter, 0-60
is done in just five seconds.

412
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:28,076
Top speed?

413
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,020
166.

414
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,012
I've owned the standard Boxster
S for the last four years

415
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:38,088
and I can promise
you, this is better.

416
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:44,997
It's more eager.

417
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:46,096
It's bloody excellent.

418
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,004
Hee-hee-hee!

419
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:58,013
But all this stripped back Spyder
stuff does have its drawbacks.

420
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:03,080
What if you're driving along with the roof
down and, suddenly, it starts to rain?

421
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:07,066
Exactly. What a
remarkable coincidence.

422
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:10,590
Oh no, I need to
erect the top tent.

423
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:14,045
What you do is, you open the boot.

424
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,070
You take out this piece, which
is called the sun shield.

425
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:22,060
You get in the car, you
attach it at the front first.

426
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:24,064
Ah!

427
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,993
Like that...

428
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:32,088
Then... You get
that bit behind you.

429
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,080
Hang on.

430
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,000
And then the other end of the same
wire goes on this special clamp

431
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:47,052
and then these two bits
clip on to there...

432
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,045
Oh, sh...

433
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,080
'It was a nightmare. But I got it
finished just as the "rain" stopped.

434
00:26:57,056 --> 00:27:01,057
Top speed is now
reduced from 166 to 126

435
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:06,024
because any faster than that
and the sky tent blows off.

436
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,973
Frankly, I couldn't care less.

437
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:13,060
Because the way this car feels is so
much more important than the top speed.

438
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:14,969
This is a really happy car.

439
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:17,049
It's full of vibrant
energy and enthusiasm.

440
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:20,044
It's a bit like one of
those really stupid dogs.

441
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,004
I bet if you threw a ball
it would chase after it.

442
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:27,060
And it's having a bit of an
effect on me because to be honest,

443
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:30,064
I have started behaving a bit
like the other two idiots.

444
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:39,004
The really amazing thing is, in a car
as lithe and nimble as this, I can.

445
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:49,044
I've said before that some cars give me a
strange fizzing sensation inside and this
one really does.

446
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,028
I'm fizzing massively here.

447
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:54,004
I'm fizzing fit to burst. Nurse!

448
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:59,032
That's actually a
spin, but never mind.

449
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,041
Never mind, indeed.

450
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:08,000
What Porsche has done is take one of the
most practical everyday sports cars you can
buy

451
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:10,096
and turned it into a
simple indulgence.

452
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:16,064
And by making it simple they've
made it simply brilliant.

453
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,060
APPLAUSE

454
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,017
He will be disappointed.

455
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:33,526
It is a shame James isn't here because I
didn't agree with everything he said then.

456
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:39,000
It's a shame he's not here to stand up,
but never mind, will carry on without him.

457
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,973
Start with this, the Sport Classic.

458
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:43,985
It's a fabulous looking thing.
It's a fabulous car, actually.

459
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,008
But the price! What I think happened here
is, they started off with a price and then
tried to justify it.

460
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:53,036
No, I'm sorry, it is a pretty
thing, but this is worse.

461
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,977
This really is worse.

462
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:58,001
An umbrella, no door handles.
Honestly.

463
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:02,076
So, I guess there's no point putting that
round the track because you can't buy it.

464
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:04,049
We'll just put this
stupid thing round.

465
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:08,548
I'll have to do the
commentary, obviously. Oi!

466
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:12,977
While it's driven by
our tame racing driver.

467
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:17,064
Some say there are 17 different
reasons why he's banned

468
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,028
from the Northampton
branch of Little Chef.

469
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:22,977
LAUGHTER

470
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:27,016
And that his favourite
airline pilot is Mark Webber.

471
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:28,053
LAUGHTER

472
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:32,052
Me too, actually. All we know,
of course, it's the Stig!

473
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:35,037
Oh no, he's facing
the wrong direction.

474
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:40,008
Of course, it's a Boxster -
both ends look exactly the same.

475
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:43,041
Off now, slowly, to
the first corner.

476
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:46,040
Just slowly driving
through it really,

477
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,981
in a not very interesting way.

478
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:51,008
Nothing interesting at
all to report there.

479
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:59,036
Stig, still enjoying his
new CD, Vuvuzela Moods.

480
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:00,989
I should add that
this is made possible

481
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:07,026
because Porsche has very kindly reinstated
the stereo they normally charge you L5,000
to remove.

482
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:13,028
Plodding through the Hammerhead now in the
manner of a car that only a complete idiot
would like.

483
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,064
Oh, dear. Bored.

484
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:25,004
Little known fact, this is also the noise
Stig makes when he wants to attract a mate.

485
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,997
Follow through, past some tyres.

486
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:33,068
Wish I'd brought a magazine to read while
waiting for this stupid thing to haul its
way round.

487
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:38,068
Not very interesting there, sort of
sliding there, and across the finish.

488
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,096
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

489
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:48,040
I don't mind that. don't like that.
I have the time here

490
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,073
for a Boxster Spyder
and it did it in

491
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:54,037
1:24.9 which actually
isn't bad at all.

492
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:58,076
That puts it right up there.
No, notinterested in that at all. Let's put

493
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:01,092
a star in our brand new
reasonably priced car.

494
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:04,021
Now, my guest tonight
began his career

495
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:08,566
writing pornographic stories
for a gentlemen's magazine.

496
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:13,041
He then went on to be communications
director for Tony Blair

497
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:18,072
and Gordon Brown, so he spent most
of his adult life working with...

498
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,577
penises.

499
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,013
LAUGHTER

500
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alastair Campbell!

501
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,056
How are you? All right.

502
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:32,041
BOOING

503
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:34,052
Go on then, go on then!

504
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:37,993
Two of the best people.

505
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:42,080
Well, you've come in to the den
oflions here. Yeah, they're all right!

506
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:46,000
You don't know yet.
It is tricky, I have to be honest,

507
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:49,032
thinking about how this
interview might go.

508
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:51,048
Me, you... Yeah... left, right.

509
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,044
Not necessarily right.

510
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,037
Wrong.

511
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,981
LAUGHTER The thing
is, I don't believe

512
00:31:57,016 --> 00:32:00,044
what I write any more than
you believe what you say.

513
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,001
So... LAUGHTER

514
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:05,048
.. interesting sitting here.
We've got to do this interview

515
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,072
and, at some point, we've
got to get to the lap

516
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:09,033
which is all cheery.

517
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:12,060
I prepared some questions that
I hope aren't too contentious.

518
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:14,061
OK, I thought you would.

519
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:16,076
A lot of work gone into these.

520
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:18,005
Good.

521
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,000
What is your favourite colour?

522
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:21,981
LAUGHTER

523
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,030
I've got two. Claret and blue.

524
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:28,044
Blue? I wasn't expecting blue.

525
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,969
Burnley Football Club.

526
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:34,008
Burnley? I'm fascinated by your
love of, erm, football. Mm-hm.

527
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:38,012
Because you're a Yorkshireman
but you support Burnley. Yup.

528
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,977
Isn't that a bit
like, I don't know,

529
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:43,080
going to an Oxbridge college and
then joining the Labour Party?

530
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:46,040
LAUGHTER AND GASPS

531
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:50,973
Lots did and lots have.

532
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:54,048
But Burnley back then were one
of the biggest and best teams

533
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,088
in the country and they were 20
miles away from where I lived.

534
00:32:57,123 --> 00:33:00,037
What star sign are you? Gemini.

535
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:03,088
I don't know anything about
Gemini, except my wife's one.

536
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:04,993
LAUGHTER

537
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:06,072
D'you want to marry me?

538
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:13,032
No?! No. I'm going to get
political now. Go on, then.

539
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:16,017
Here we go. So you
started out writing porn.

540
00:33:16,052 --> 00:33:19,041
I mean that was Forum magazine.
Was that right? Yeah.

541
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:23,024
And then you became Blair's.
You were communications director.

542
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,088
There was a gap.
There was a gap but eventually...

543
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:28,040
So you did something
noble and then ended up

544
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,033
sort of prostituting yourself

545
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:31,993
which I think is a weird way round.

546
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:36,000
I want to move on to Gordon Brown,
who lost the general election

547
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:37,088
and has now disappeared.

548
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:39,993
CHUCKLING

549
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:42,516
Two-part question,
and a serious one.

550
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,969
You were obviously in
charge of the image

551
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:47,025
and how the election was
presented to the people.

552
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,076
Two parts. Who was it that
told him that he had to smile,

553
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:53,084
and then why did no-one
tell him to stop?

554
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,049
LAUGHTER

555
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:58,076
Well, I wasn't in charge.
I would have been in charge if we won,

556
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:01,000
but we didn't win.
So I wasn't in charge at all.

557
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,053
LAUGHTER

558
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:05,032
I don't think you can
tell anybody to smile.

559
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:08,084
But I think it was
possibly his misfortune

560
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,965
that he followed a Prime Minister

561
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,080
who does smile a lot
very, very naturally.

562
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:15,009
Not like that. He did.

563
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:18,530
He's got nicer teeth than you,Jeremy.
He looks after them. Yes,

564
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:22,016
he probably used taxpayers'...
Did they go on expenses, his teeth?

565
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:26,037
No. No, they didn't.
Don't applaud. APPLAUSE

566
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:30,084
It just occurred to me...
Don't applaud that. If I may,

567
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,071
if I may, OK, I have
some footage here.

568
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:36,024
I just want to see
Gordon Brown here, OK?

569
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:38,072
Here he is. And ready, steady...

570
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:41,021
LAUGHTER

571
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:45,008
But look - he lightened up the
room, didn't he? That was nice.

572
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,092
Was it done with
electricity, or...?LAUGHTER

573
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,591
Fzzzzcrrkkk!

574
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:50,021
LAUGHTER

575
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,057
The thing is, you did
Tweet, I believe,

576
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:56,044
earlier this week saying, "How do I
handle Clarkson, any suggestions?"

577
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,041
I got a lot. Really? Yeah.
Murder, kill...

578
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:02,080
Some of those.
"Kick him in the nuts. "

579
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:05,049
Mm-hm. Yeah.
"Ask him how he voted. "

580
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:09,020
Do you know, I think it
is none of your business.

581
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:09,993
OK, fair enough.

582
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:12,032
INDISTINCT RESPONSE I'm
going to make a guess.

583
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,969
Go on then. Tory.

584
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:16,514
That would mean voting for
my next door neighbour.

585
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:19,280
Anyway, they didn't win.
Cameron? No, he did win.

586
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:21,977
Well, he didn't really.
Well, he's the Prime Minister.

587
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:25,076
He's the Prime Minister but he
needs little Cleggo, doesn't he?

588
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:27,028
He needs the tea boy, I agree.

589
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:28,561
LAUGHTER

590
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:30,334
HE SNORTS

591
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,037
I... I...

592
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:36,045
Anyway, when do we see the lap?
No, not yet, not yet

593
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,048
because I want to talk about
your books. Do you? Yeah. OK.

594
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,061
You say that you get
inspiration for writing them

595
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:48,028
when you are driving along.
Is that a distraction for your driver, or?

596
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,973
LAUGHTER

597
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:53,021
Honestly, in your book... OK.

598
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:59,058
.. Prelude to Power, which is your
diaries, pretty much in detail.

599
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:05,060
That's, how many pages?
744 pages and it only gets us up to 1997.

600
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,969
So, the actual "Prelude to Power".

601
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:10,088
That's five times longer
than War and Peace.

602
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:12,013
I write a diary every day. You do?

603
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:15,009
You really do write every day?
You will be in there tonight.

604
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:18,092
The chat we have outside about the
director general will be in there...

605
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:20,989
Oh, bloody hell! It was as well.

606
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:25,024
I do a diary. I said that he wasa
very well-endowed man. Yes, yes.

607
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:30,065
Now, there is a lot about Clause
Four, and all of the things

608
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,562
that were being changed prior
to His Tony-ness's appointment.

609
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:38,989
I couldn't find a single reference
to the most important thing

610
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:43,012
that happened when he became Prime
Minister which was the M4 bus lane.

611
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,033
Hmm.

612
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,965
Was that just a whim then?
Was it not planned?

613
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,064
No, the thing is, Jeremy, as you
rightly say, it goes up to 1997.

614
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,025
Mm-hm. Volume two

615
00:36:54,060 --> 00:37:00,096
is subtitled "The M4 bus lane.
In full. " I was terrified

616
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:03,969
that John Prescott had
walked in one day and gone,

617
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:07,068
"Hey, I tell you what, let's paint
outside lane on t'motorway red

618
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:08,595
"and make it a bus lane. " Aye.

619
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,053
And that's not what happened? No.

620
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:15,044
There was a thought that it might
alleviate some of the congestion

621
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,044
and, according to the
statistical analysis

622
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,045
thereafter, it kind of worked.

623
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,588
But YOU can't accept that
because you want to cover

624
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,096
the whole country in concrete
and drive in big cars.

625
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:26,591
Yeah. Yeah.

626
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:28,017
LAUGHTER

627
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:29,053
The other thing as well,

628
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:32,033
what did you think of our
new reasonably priced car?

629
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:36,054
Because you're the first person to
drive it in this proper situation.

630
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:40,040
I quite liked it. Once I'd got
into really kind of leathering it,

631
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,005
it didn't have a lot of oomph.

632
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,072
I think The Stig was really patient,
he really was. Top man. Really?

633
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:49,056
I was kind of half hoping
it would be a woman.

634
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:53,965
Some say he's
fanatically right wing.

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,072
No, he told me he's not.
Really? He says you are.

636
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,965
SCOFFS

637
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
See? You're just believing what
it says in the papers again.

638
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:06,088
No, I know you're a
reasonable, fair-minded chap.

639
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:08,009
No!

640
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:09,061
LAUGHTER

641
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:13,025
Anyway, who wants
to see the lap?I do.

642
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,088
You do. Let's play the tape.
Let's have a look.

643
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:17,973
WHEELSPIN SCREECH

644
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:20,060
'Here we are.
That wasn't me, was it?'

645
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:21,053
'Not bad. Was it all right?

646
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:25,028
'Dunno, actually.
'Come on, concentrate.

647
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:27,989
Remember everything he said.

648
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:32,012
'Let's have a look through the first corner.
I'm going to see this car...

649
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:34,965
'Well, going to see it going
all round the track. '

650
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,500
Nick Clegg should do this cos he
hasn't got an awful lot to do.

651
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:42,000
'Now, you've got to stay right here.
Oh, no, you've veered left.

652
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:43,028
'There's a surprise

653
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,049
'On your way down
to the hammerhead.

654
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:49,070
'It understeers more than
the old Chevrolet, this car.

655
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:52,056
'Doesn't look like it's going
as fast as I thought it was.

656
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,061
'Everyone says that.
But you keep... '

657
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,997
You ARE veering to the left!
Oh God, yeah.

658
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:59,048
'No, here we go. This is flat out.
Were you flat-out from your...?

659
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,577
'Felt flat-out, yeah. ' BLEEP!

660
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:04,037
'Are you competitive? Very. '

661
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:07,024
I just want to beat
Nick Robinson tonight.

662
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,024
'Yes, that's nicely done through
there, you cut the corner very well.

663
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,965
'I had real trouble down there.

664
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,004
'I kept going into 5th.
That's bang...

665
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,001
'Not quite fast enough.

666
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:20,528
'You were in 5th?
At one point, yeah. Wrong!

667
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:24,020
'And there we are.
And boing! Across the line!'

668
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:32,020
So...

669
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,025
So...

670
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,057
where do you think
you've come there?

671
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:42,036
I'm quite keen to beatNick Robinson.
There's a surprise,

672
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:43,068
the BBC political editor.

673
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:44,977
You did it,

674
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:48,056
Alastair Campbell, in one minute...

675
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:52,965
That's good... 40...

676
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,057
So bearing in mind he was at 49.9,

677
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,096
you would have a job squeaking
in after him. I'm doing well...

678
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,579
1:47 dead.

679
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:04,993
Oooh...

680
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,052
That puts you as
our second fastest.

681
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:09,047
CHEERING

682
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,973
That's OK.

683
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,508
Well done. No, that's very good.

684
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:16,008
My name fell down.
That's very good.

685
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:17,017
It fell down.

686
00:40:17,052 --> 00:40:19,040
Your name's fell down?

687
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:21,041
Yeah. LAUGHTER

688
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:22,973
Can we do that bit again?

689
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:26,092
It can stay there.
Why have you lost the magnetism?

690
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:29,028
Because we don't get
enough licence fee,

691
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,008
thanks to you lot. There you are.

692
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:32,977
So I beat Al Murray.

693
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:36,048
You're faster than Al Murray.
And aPage Three girl. Peta, 23, Essex.

694
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,965
And Nick Robinson. Nick Robinson.

695
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,061
Next time he interviews
you, you can go,

696
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:43,044
"I'm faster than you. I'm faster than you.
I'm faster than you. "

697
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,053
And then hit him. LAUGHTER

698
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:47,057
You're a huge sport
for coming down here.

699
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:51,020
Best of luck. I enjoyed it.
Alastair Campbell! Thank you.

700
00:40:51,055 --> 00:40:52,088
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

701
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:55,008
Marvellous.

702
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:06,542
Now, now, earlier on, we proved
that this BMW M3 is better

703
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:12,048
in pretty much every way than
this Mercedes and this Ford.

704
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,005
Because of racism...
Yeah, whatever.

705
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,064
Now it's time to go back
to Germany so that the BMW

706
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,969
can win all the
other tests as well.

707
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:23,064
We begin with Jeremy,
predictably, moaning.

708
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:30,032
This part of the world was ruined
first of all by Hitler then Stalin

709
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:34,004
and now Jonathan Porridge with
his windmills. I like 'em.

710
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,060
They're noisy, they're pointless.

711
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,037
Oh, hello. Right.

712
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,548
"Your cars will now
be tested for faults

713
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,024
"by ADAC, Germany's
equivalent of the AA."

714
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:51,028
We test them now, after we've maxed
them on the autobahn, brilliant

715
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:51,997
It won't hurt them.

716
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:57,048
Apparently "one of ADAC's mobile
patrols will arrive shortly".

717
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:59,061
So we're looking for a van.

718
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,016
It'll be a van of some sort.
That's all right.

719
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:03,061
'It was a van,

720
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:06,020
'but this being Germany... '

721
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:26,070
It's got a reception, look.
Look, it has.

722
00:42:26,105 --> 00:42:30,068
'The ADAC men took
charge of James's Merc. '

723
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:32,068
Guten tag, Klaus. Hi.

724
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:33,088
Fortschritt.

725
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:37,049
JEREMY CHUCKLES

726
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:39,033
What's wrong with the car?

727
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:41,969
His racing gearbox is going well.

728
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:45,084
'The equipment they had in
the van was extraordinary

729
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,969
'and the tests were very thorough.

730
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:50,092
'They used a computer to
measure the boiling point

731
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:52,001
'of the Merc's brake fluid

732
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:56,024
'and a gizmo to check the
roundness of its tyres. '

733
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:58,985
There's a laser and everything.

734
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,056
'It was doing quite
well, but then... '

735
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,008
Oh, dear.

736
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,989
Scheisse!

737
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:10,021
What a load of rubbish!

738
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:13,004
'After this, things got worse. '

739
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,061
CLUNKING JEREMY HOOTS

740
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:20,056
I did 140 miles an hour.
You did 140 miles an hour,

741
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:23,045
and your wheels... nicht gut.

742
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,049
.. Are very bad, you
have let them rust.

743
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:31,044
'It was time I put these German
chappies straight on a few things. '

744
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,041
Martin Brundle was
sehr gut uber dem auto.

745
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:36,044
What was that you just
said about Martin Brundle?

746
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,981
I was just saying

747
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,017
how Martin Brundle said

748
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:43,008
that this was the finest rear-drive
chassis he'd ever driven.

749
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:44,549
He never said any...

750
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:46,318
He did! He had one.

751
00:43:46,353 --> 00:43:48,017
He did not say...

752
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:52,088
Unluckily for you, mate, I
have Martin Brundle's number

753
00:43:52,123 --> 00:43:55,056
on my telephone.
He will confirm that he said that

754
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,041
and that he had one.

755
00:43:56,076 --> 00:44:00,028
This, he claimed, was the best?
! And famously said that.

756
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:01,037
'Hello?' Martin?

757
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:04,040
I'll talk to him. No, get off.
Martin? Let me talk to him.

758
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:09,004
Martin, morning, it's James
from Top Gear. Hi, how are you?

759
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,009
'Yeah, good, are you
somewhere exciting?'

760
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,985
I'm underneath a Mercedes
190 Cosworth, actually,

761
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,016
and the other two won't believe
me when I say that you said

762
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:19,059
quite categorically
that this was the finest

763
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:21,068
rear-drive chassis of
any car in the world

764
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,040
and the best you'd ever driven.

765
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:24,045
'When did I say that?

766
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,020
'I've had a few knocks on the head
but I don't remember saying that.

767
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:30,013
'It's not a bad engine

768
00:44:30,048 --> 00:44:32,544
'but, no, it's
really not that good.

769
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,005
'You need the M3 for
the best chassis

770
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,033
'from around that time,
I would have thought. '

771
00:44:37,068 --> 00:44:41,016
That was always my belief that
people believed the M3 was better

772
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:43,005
and it had got this
folkloric reputation

773
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,056
but anybody who knew what they
were talking about, ie you,

774
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,981
Ayrton Senna, knew that
actually the Mercedes

775
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:51,033
was the superior car.
'I don't remember Ayrton getting out

776
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:54,088
'and saying, "That is the best rear
drive chassis I've ever been in. "

777
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:56,973
'I think he got out and said,

778
00:44:57,008 --> 00:45:00,080
'"I'm pleased it thrashed Lauda
and Prost and all those guys. "'

779
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:04,028
Niki Lauda and Alain Prost as well?
I didn't know that.

780
00:45:04,063 --> 00:45:06,005
You don't need to speak to him...

781
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,985
I do need to speak to him.
Martin? You've turned it off.

782
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,044
He's catching an aeroplaneto his
second home. What did he say?

783
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,060
He confirmed everything I
said about him. He also said,

784
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,969
"The engine is excellent

785
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:23,040
"and the M3 was a mere shadow
of what this car was. "

786
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:24,989
Did he? That's what he said?
Yes he did.

787
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:29,060
That's what he said? Yes.
That'swhat he said? Right, lower the car.

788
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,044
'Next it was the turn
of my Cosworth. '

789
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,028
Mein auto ist die einzige mit...

TRANSLATION FROM GERMAN:

791
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:50,000
Mein auto ist designen
von eine Deutsche. Yah!

792
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:51,037
Good. OK.

793
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:52,041
Just making it plain.

794
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:55,570
I don't want him to mark it
down because it's Belgian.

795
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:59,064
As it happens the ADAC man
was impressed with my car.

796
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,997
Good?

797
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:02,993
All good! All good!

798
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,060
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

799
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,072
'But it would now be humiliated
by the much younger M3.'

800
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:12,033
I hate to say this

801
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:16,016
because it's verging on
complementing you but your car

802
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:18,084
is now quite cool and
collectible whereas that is

803
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,076
just something driven by...
Imbeciles.

804
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:25,076
TRANSLATED FROM GERMAN:

805
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:34,040
Best car? Sehr gut.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. It is.

806
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:37,973
'As it turned out, it wasn't. '

807
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:41,060
Crikey, look at that.
That's the anti-roll bar, isn't it?

808
00:46:41,095 --> 00:46:44,080
It had an accident... Kaput.

JEREMY CACKLES

810
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:50,072
That's why you got a
different shock absorber.

811
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,977
It's been botched together.

812
00:46:53,012 --> 00:46:55,530
It has clearly had
a crash, hasn't it?

813
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:58,048
'Soon it was time
to get our scores. '

814
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:01,049
And that's your Ford.

815
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,066
The Ford. And the BMW. Thank you.

816
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:05,554
What would be a good score on this?

817
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,973
A new car would
score, a good car...

818
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:11,000
150 points. I will go first
with my score. Are we ready?

819
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:14,096
58. 58? That's good.

820
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,087
...19.

821
00:47:16,122 --> 00:47:18,009
19?! Mmm.

822
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,032
That's not so good. No.

823
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:22,080
Hammond? Six.

824
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:26,084
He's not serious?! Six?

825
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:27,057
Six, yes.

826
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:30,056
Six?! That's right.

827
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:33,020
Bu...? The Ford!

828
00:47:34,024 --> 00:47:36,056
How have I only got six?

829
00:47:36,091 --> 00:47:38,088
The back is very bad. Yeah.

830
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:41,017
58- that's a pass.

831
00:47:41,052 --> 00:47:44,062
Six?! You might as
well have gotnought.

832
00:47:44,097 --> 00:47:47,072
Would you say the BMW
is dangerous?Yes.

833
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:53,008
This had a dramatic effect
on the way Hammond drove.

834
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,061
Six.

835
00:47:58,096 --> 00:48:01,001
I don't know how it
could score less.

836
00:48:01,036 --> 00:48:04,032
It would have to have,
like, wheels missing

837
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:06,024
or a tiger in it.

838
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:09,989
Tonight on First Gear,

839
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:15,048
Richard Hammond drives across
Germany in a death trap.

840
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:19,016
'Hammond's mood wasn't
improved when he found out

841
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:21,048
'where we'd be staying the night. '

842
00:48:25,024 --> 00:48:28,000
You've got to be kidding.

843
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:33,016
'Yup! Colditz is now a hotel. '

844
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:38,076
OK.

845
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:52,056
'The next morning, James
and Richard checked out

846
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,088
'in the traditional fashion. '

847
00:48:54,123 --> 00:48:58,092
"Colditz Theme"

848
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,997
Where have you two been?

849
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:19,052
How did you get out? I used
mycredit card at the reception desk.

850
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:21,005
I don't know why we
all didn't do that.

851
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
It wouldn't make for a
good TV series, would it?

852
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:24,053
It wouldn't have had 28 episodes.

853
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:28,040
Next, Major Pat Reid denies watching
the movie that was on his bill.

854
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:34,056
'To Richard's consternation, it
was then time for our track day.

855
00:49:34,064 --> 00:49:39,032
'The producers insisted we stuck
to track day etiquette by wearing

856
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:44,000
'clothing from the catalogues of
the companies that made our cars. '

857
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:46,049
Holy

858
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,548
Moly! Ooh, that's daddy's.

859
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,977
That's not a good look.

860
00:49:51,012 --> 00:49:53,033
It says a lot about people
who drive Mercedes Benz.

861
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:56,044
It does, and do you know, as
of Monday morning, I don't,

862
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,053
any more!

863
00:49:57,088 --> 00:50:02,028
If there was a fire around here,
imagine the melting...! Ah!

864
00:50:02,063 --> 00:50:04,045
Now, the most important challenge -

865
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,020
"Which of you has the
fastest track day car?

866
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,029
"To make sure this test is fair,

867
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:14,973
"each of your cars will be
drivenby the same driver. " Yes!

868
00:50:15,008 --> 00:50:18,064
I don't have to go out there in
the death trap... Oh, yes, you do.

869
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,037
"You will be in the passenger seat

870
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:23,060
"while the car is driven
by a tame racing driver. "

871
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:26,084
What, the Stig?
No, he's not the Stig.

872
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:30,064
He's the Stig's German cousin.

873
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:39,040
Looks like the Stig to me.
Still the Stig. Still the St...

874
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:41,079
It is the Stig! No, hang on.

875
00:50:41,114 --> 00:50:43,049
Oh, my giddy aunt. Mullet.

876
00:50:43,084 --> 00:50:46,076
I think it might be
Stiggy Ray Cyrus.

877
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:49,020
First up for Herr Stig

878
00:50:49,055 --> 00:50:50,076
was the Mercedes.

879
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:55,004
Go!

880
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,969
ROUGH ENGINE ROAR

881
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,024
That doesn't sound good.

882
00:51:04,052 --> 00:51:07,056
You've got to remember that in
the ADAC tests, they revealed

883
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:08,989
that the steering was a bit loose.

884
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,020
There's a lot of play in the rack,
so just don't overdo it, OK?

885
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,096
Bloody hell!

886
00:51:18,032 --> 00:51:21,032
'To compensate for the
Merc's lack of power,

887
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:23,052
'German Stig was on
maximum attack. '

888
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:30,989
So this is bigger than the
Nurburgring, right, this track?

889
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:35,068
Must be, cos of the amount of time
it's taken. Must be 35 miles. Yeah.

890
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:41,056
You can feel the multi-link,
Martin Brundle-approved,

891
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:46,040
rear suspension hunkering down...
Get a grip, man!

892
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:57,092
It's 2 mins 19.3, and we've
no idea what that means.

893
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:00,969
'But we'd soon find out,

894
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:04,056
'because it was time
to lap the Ford. '

895
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,068
And the muscles from
Brussels is under way!

896
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:12,081
The Jean-Claude Van Damme-anator!

897
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:15,060
That rear suspension is collapsed.

898
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:21,025
This is... pure track day magic.

899
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:27,032
1,250 kilograms, that's all
it weighs, the same as a Mini.

900
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:29,032
But it has 200 horsepower!

901
00:52:30,068 --> 00:52:32,009
So, this German Stig fella...

902
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:35,056
will he take well to Jeremy shouting
at him and stuff, do you think?

903
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:36,989
He didn't take any notice of me

904
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:40,004
when I told him which gearto
change into. Who would?

905
00:52:41,016 --> 00:52:43,029
This is the car which has won

906
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:45,969
the British Touring
Car Championship,

907
00:52:46,004 --> 00:52:50,072
the World Touring Car Championship,
the British Rally Championship!

908
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,056
Das Stig is a maniac!

909
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,080
Here he comes.

910
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:03,044
Wall, wall, wall.

911
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:05,088
This is going to be close.

912
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:09,028
12, 13, 14.

913
00:53:12,008 --> 00:53:13,021
Come on, let's have it.

914
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:17,068
Two... Yep. 14. Ooh-hoo-hoo!

915
00:53:17,103 --> 00:53:19,053
Five seconds faster!

916
00:53:19,088 --> 00:53:23,052
'All that remained was to lap
Hammond's crash-damaged death trap. '

917
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:26,064
There are quite a lot of right
hand turns, aren't there,

918
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:27,965
in that first bit? Yeah.

919
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,012
You're really putting a lot of
stress on the front left suspension.

920
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:34,033
Exactly. If your car had
had, let's say, an accident,

921
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:37,020
and had been mended cheaply
on the front left corner...

922
00:53:37,055 --> 00:53:39,008
Stop talking.

923
00:53:40,076 --> 00:53:44,048
Now, Herr Stig, there's one
important thing I have to tell you

924
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:46,056
about this car before we set off...

925
00:53:46,091 --> 00:53:49,001
No, I didn't mean set off!

926
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:52,004
I haven't told you the thing!
What about the thing?

927
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:56,052
Are you cold? No.

928
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,096
Go right. Go right.

929
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,001
D'you know what I'm
expecting to see? Er...

930
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:12,080
Just the front wheel coming across
the line in about two minutes' time.

931
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:20,037
I'm just waiting to hear

932
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:23,040
the unmistakable sound
of metal snapping.

933
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:29,084
And the... of arterial blood.

934
00:54:32,008 --> 00:54:33,072
Wall!

935
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:37,036
110 miles an hour in
a car that scored 6.

936
00:54:46,044 --> 00:54:48,568
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

937
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:51,092
The board. The points.

938
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:53,071
Here we go.

939
00:54:53,106 --> 00:54:54,981
Yes. What?

940
00:54:55,016 --> 00:54:58,096
Oh, come on, then, what was the time
for the BM, what was the lap time?

941
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,021
I've forgotten.

942
00:55:00,056 --> 00:55:02,064
The time, what was it, come on?

943
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,973
Seriously.

944
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:05,053
What did he do it in? 2.06.

945
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:08,001
Yes! Thank you very much,
I win that. So, yeah,

946
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:11,056
you get one point for every
second underneath three minutes,

947
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:12,057
so 2.06...

948
00:55:12,092 --> 00:55:15,080
54 points... Oh, yeah... for you.

949
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:17,016
Why is that 3.14?

950
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,029
What?

951
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,080
Well, I did the lap
in 2 minutes 14.

952
00:55:20,115 --> 00:55:22,096
But, you see, the
producer disagrees.

953
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:23,973
Why? Well,

954
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:28,012
it was that new producer we've
got, the one from Uruguay.

955
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:32,016
Sorry, mate, he's right, he
didn't see one of those minutes,

956
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:33,009
so you can't have it.

957
00:55:33,044 --> 00:55:36,096
It was on television!
That'sinadmissible. It doesn't count.

958
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:38,025
This is ridiculous. Bad luck.

959
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,004
Moving on. So that means my BMW
was the fastest on the autobahn,

960
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,025
it was the most
spacious in that test,

961
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,977
and then it put in the fastest lap.

962
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:49,032
Well, I will now garner
back some points,

963
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:50,985
because it's the YouTube section.

964
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,072
As we know, people
who go to track days,

965
00:55:54,107 --> 00:55:56,021
they put a camera on the dashboard,

966
00:55:56,056 --> 00:56:00,032
they record their lap, they
put that lap on YouTube.

967
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,973
And we were told to
do the same thing, OK?

968
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:07,032
And then there would be one
point for every hit we got.

969
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:11,056
James, I believe now we have a
clip from your Mercedes lap?

970
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:13,009
Let's have a look at that now.

971
00:56:13,044 --> 00:56:17,072
'And we're off. A little bit of
tramping from the axle there.

972
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,997
'Then I'm going to
select fourth as we come

973
00:56:20,032 --> 00:56:23,016
'up to the end of the straight,
and we go in to turn one.

974
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:25,068
'As we go round turn one... Oh...

975
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:27,981
'Oh, cock. As you can see,

976
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:30,973
'there are bollards on
the circuit, which is not

977
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:34,088
'what I was expecting, and must
mean I've gone the wrong way. '

978
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:39,012
How can you get lost on a
racetrack, mate? I don't...

979
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:39,989
I don't... It's one way.

980
00:56:40,024 --> 00:56:42,546
I know, I don't understan
d it,I'm sorry. All right.

981
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:45,068
Let's have a look at a
clip from Jeremy's video.

982
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:49,072
'Coming up now to the end of a lap.

983
00:56:49,107 --> 00:56:52,985
'I'm doing 195 miles an hour,

984
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:58,004
'200, 210 miles an hour now, 220...

985
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,037
'And I cross the line. '

986
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:03,045
What? You just lied and then
sped up the film. A bit.

987
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,004
A lot! A bit. Let's have a look
atyour lap in the death trap.

988
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:08,993
All right. Here we go.

989
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:11,005
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

990
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,056
And listen to that straight six!

991
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:15,017
Brvoom!

992
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:18,072
You didn't take it out.
No, I did, the camera broke.

993
00:57:18,107 --> 00:57:21,063
I did it properly...
Cluck! Cluck!Stop doing that.

994
00:57:21,098 --> 00:57:23,985
That's very annoying.
You chicken. No, I wasn't.

995
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,096
I did do a lap, the camera
broke, it just recorded sound.

996
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,997
OK, we've had those clips up

997
00:57:28,032 --> 00:57:31,080
for a week? Yeah. How many
hits did you get? I got...

998
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:34,005
71.

999
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,021
CHEERING

1000
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:39,021
Are you seriously suggesting

1001
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:42,997
71 people...? Why would
theydo that? Why would

1002
00:57:43,032 --> 00:57:47,036
71...? Why are people compelled
toput themselves on it? 71 points.

1003
00:57:47,071 --> 00:57:52,032
OK. I got 137. Wow!

1004
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:58,540
Hammond?

1005
00:57:58,575 --> 00:57:59,829
Seven.

1006
00:57:59,864 --> 00:58:01,049
LAUGHTER

1007
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:02,989
Seven? Seven, yeah.

1008
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:05,044
Seven. That was pathetic.
Thinking back,

1009
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:06,053
I should have misspelled M3

1010
00:58:06,088 --> 00:58:09,086
in the tag line bit on
the Internet. What, 3M?

1011
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:12,049
No, if I'd spelled it
"Angelina Jolie topless",

1012
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:16,076
I'd have got more hits than both
of you, but I didn't. Anyway,

1013
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:20,020
we then did an economy run,
from Germany into Poland.

1014
00:58:20,055 --> 00:58:23,069
Sadly there isn't time
tonight to show you that.

1015
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:26,084
The upshot was, though,
James ran out of petrol.

1016
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:33,004
Therefore, you get
minus 141.Hang on.

1017
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,045
What? I've got minus

1018
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,965
exactly what I already had. Yes.

1019
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,057
That's the rules - it
happened to him once. It did.

1020
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:45,028
That is the rules. You're minus 141,
so you're currently on... nought.

1021
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,045
Er... I get 10 for
that, because I won

1022
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,048
in the Ford, thanks to
its two-litre engine,

1023
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:55,008
and you get five for coming second.

1024
00:58:55,043 --> 00:58:55,985
Which means,

1025
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,040
we have just one final challenge,
something to do with price -

1026
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:00,965
I have it here.

1027
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,048
So it's a two-horse race.
Either you or me will win.

1028
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:05,009
He's out. Absolutely.

1029
00:59:05,044 --> 00:59:09,060
He is completely out. He's on nought.
OK. So, here we go.

1030
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:12,021
You get one point for every pound

1031
00:59:12,056 --> 00:59:15,057
your car was under
the L5,000 budget.

1032
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:21,040
So, hang on, mine cost L3,990,
so I get 1,010 points there!

1033
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:22,973
Look at that.

1034
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:24,037
I like that. Go on then,

1035
00:59:24,072 --> 00:59:30,024
how much did yours cost? 4,999.
So you get one point!

1036
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:32,005
Which means, clearly, I win that!

1037
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,088
Thank you very much. I may as
wellhave just bought a toy car.

1038
00:59:34,123 --> 00:59:37,096
I was going to get the prize.
I would have got...

1039
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:40,064
Those are the rules,
and I win! Thank you!

1040
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:43,064
Delighted. And rightly so. CHEERING

1041
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:44,989
No!

1042
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:48,977
I'm sorry.

1043
00:59:49,012 --> 00:59:53,012
If I may just take that from you
and ask you to stand to one side,

1044
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,993
because my car was L2,990,

1045
00:59:57,028 --> 01:00:02,056
meaning I have 2,010 points
straightaway there, which I think

1046
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:05,016
you will find makes me...

1047
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:07,053
the winner.

1048
01:00:07,088 --> 01:00:09,021
CHEERING

1049
01:00:09,056 --> 01:00:10,981
That's just silly.

1050
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:14,024
That's just ridiculous.

1051
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,993
Oi! Are we honestly going to say,

1052
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:21,993
on the world's biggest
motoring show,

1053
01:00:22,028 --> 01:00:25,096
to 350 million people,
that the best track day car

1054
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:27,577
is a slow, rusty,

1055
01:00:27,612 --> 01:00:29,989
wobbly wheeled,

1056
01:00:30,024 --> 01:00:34,021
small, uneconomical piece of junk?

1057
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:38,000
Yes. And on that bombshell, it's
time to say goodnight. Goodbye.

1058
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:39,052
Oh, this is just ridiculous!

1059
