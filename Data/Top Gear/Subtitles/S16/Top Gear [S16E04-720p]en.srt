1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,084
Tonight, a sausage gets burnt,

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,965
a sheep falls over,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,040
and our track is all wet.

4
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:29,053
CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUDS

5
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:33,072
Hello! Hello, everybody. Hello.

6
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:37,021
Thank you. Thank you so much.

7
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:40,570
Now, you may remember, a couple
of years ago, we were contacted

8
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:44,049
by a German car programme,
asking us to boost their ratings.

9
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:47,092
You mean "take us on in a series
of motoring-related challenges".

10
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:51,013
Yes, that. Anyway, we
did what he just said,

11
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:57,036
and we didn't just beat them - with a
little bit of cheating, we humiliated them.

12
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:59,977
Yeah, but despite the
futility of taking us on,

13
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:04,013
we've now had a letter from the
people who make Top Gear in Australia.

14
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:08,060
It's basically the same programmeas ours
but with silly accents. Yeah. I've got the
letter here.

15
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:13,016
It says, "Dear Top Gear UK, we're coming...
" Why am I doing this in a French accent?

16
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:18,057
"Dear Top Gear UK, we're coming
over to your stupid country soon,

17
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:23,064
"and we want to take you on in a
car-based Ashes, you Pommie bas... "

18
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:29,070
Ahem! Obviously, we picked up their
gauntlet, so welcome, everybody,

19
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:34,084
to Top Gear versus Australia Motoring
Jeux Sans Frontieres - Ashes.

20
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,969
"Land of Hope and Glory"

21
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:42,004
These are the cars we can call on -

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,000
the Aston Martin
DBS, the Jaguar XKR,

23
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,072
the Caterham Superlight,

24
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:53,041
the Aerial Atom,

25
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:57,072
the Bentley Continental,
the Range Rooney.

26
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:00,093
The list goes on and on.

27
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:03,045
"Waltzing Matilda"

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,028
And these are the
cars they can field -

29
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:09,989
the Holden Maloo pickup,

30
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:12,076
the Holden Commodore saloon...

31
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,028
And that's it.

32
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:23,020
So, we've got the cars, we've
got the place. Where are they?

33
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:26,016
Should have landed
over three hours ago.

34
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:33,020
You did book them a
taxi, didn't you?

35
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,004
Sort of.

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,004
I just thought it would be nice for them to
arrive back in the country the way their
ancestors left.

37
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,008
There's a pleasing circularity to it.
Exactly. That is thoughtful.

38
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:54,064
That is very thoughtful.

39
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,021
No, it is.

40
00:02:56,056 --> 00:03:00,036
So, let's meet the men
we'd be up against.

41
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,016
Guys! Ewen Page, who
does not have a beard...

42
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,069
.. Steve Pizzati, who does...

43
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,053
.. and Shane Jacobson, who is fat.

44
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:16,016
Strangely, none of them was very
happy about the prison lorry.

45
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:17,989
That gag was not funny in 1938.

46
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:23,076
It is here. You've had about 200years to
come up with a better gag,and that's it.
It's funny!

47
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,981
I want to apologise for cubicle one.
You ran out of paper.

48
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:32,016
To try and stop them whingeing, we
let them choose the first event.

49
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,545
OK, working man's
one-kilometre drag race.

50
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,005
We'll pit a typical
Aussie commercial vehicle

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,076
against a typical Pommie commercialvehicle
to see which is the fastest. Drag race, eh?

52
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:45,981
Yeah, what do you say? OK,

53
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:50,037
it's "a working man's
one-kilometre drag race".

54
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:54,056
This was a cunning move by
the Aussies, because it meant

55
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:58,040
they could go straight in to
bat with the Maloo pickup.

56
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,977
See that there?

57
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:03,045
A six-litre V8. 380 horsepower.

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,048
In America, they use the engine out
of this in the Corvette. Ah, yeah.

59
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:13,048
Sadly, we hadn't thought to
bring a commercial vehicle.

60
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:18,009
The bloke who just came and
painted my house did have a Jag.

61
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:21,981
Is that any good? It doesn't make it
a commercial vehicle. Not really, no.

62
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:26,064
I don't think we can really get away with
any of these as... They're justgoing to say
that we're cheating.

63
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,546
Luckily, Jeremy then remembered
he had a mate with a Transit,

64
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:37,072
so it was brought over, and a
pessimistic Hammond climbed aboard.

65
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:40,589
This is not a good start for us.

66
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:43,346
This exhaust is blowing badly.

67
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:46,033
That really suits you, that.

68
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,061
I can't imagine you in
anything else, Bruce.

69
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:52,080
It is just Bruce in a Brucemobile.
And look at Nigel over there.

70
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:56,064
Can we just stand back? Because
this is, I'm afraid, going to be...

71
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,051
.. a bloodbath. It is.
A bloodbath. Exactly.

72
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:04,004
Are you still sureyou
want to do this? Yes! Yes!

73
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,977
Why do I have to
do the first event?

74
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:10,985
And why does it have
to be in an old van?

75
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,072
All I've got to do is watch that
little green light and then win.

76
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:19,000
ENGINES REV

77
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,096
Whoa!

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,084
What the hell is in that van?

79
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:42,072
What is this thing? It's insane!

80
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:55,092
He's in the weeds! He's blown away!

81
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,074
Yes! Yes, a clear
win for the Nigels.

82
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:04,088
I'm sorry, Bruce, we take that one.

83
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:07,045
First blood to Nigel.

84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,560
Sorry, Bruce. Yeah, we forgot
about the traditional gesture.

85
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:14,005
That's not a van. It is a van!
It doesn't seem like a van.

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,052
It is a van. Did you see the look
on Nigel's face when it took off?

87
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,057
They don't believe it's a van!

88
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:24,024
Pretty impressive. I like your van.
And they're all like that. That's standard.

89
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:28,539
Look, I will prove to you thatit is a van.
Behold. What is that?

90
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:33,020
It even managed to beat you while
carrying an engine in the back.

91
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,571
Ready? Hang on.

92
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,053
It says "Jaguar"!

93
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,566
All right, this might be a bit...

94
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,009
Yes. And it's turbocharged, too!

95
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:47,060
It is slightly turbocharged. Actually, what
it is, if I'm honest, it's a Jaguar XJ220.

96
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:51,032
Ohhh! Did you say we weren't allowed
to bring a Jaguar-propelled van?

97
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,545
Well, no. Is it a van?
Is a van a commercial vehicle?

98
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,024
You could have warned me.
I got the shock of my life!

99
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:01,016
Honest to God!

100
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:08,060
After our first-innings victory, Jeremy
decided that for the second challenge,

101
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:13,008
we should re-run a race we'd
first tried against the Germans.

102
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:15,061
OK, guys, it is really
straightforward, OK?

103
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:20,001
The car on the bottom has the
accelerator, the gears and brake,

104
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:25,088
but no steering wheel, because the
steering is done by the car on the top.

105
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,021
You got that?

106
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,068
Right. You got it, then, Bruce?

107
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:31,085
Which one's ours, Nigel?

108
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,068
These are both ours. OK?

109
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,051
We have both these.

110
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,965
Yours are over here.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,977
But... But what? It's upside down!

112
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:44,068
Yes, but it won't be when you get home and
you watch it on TV there. It'll all be the
right way up.

113
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:48,021
We are racing against
the Flat Earth Society.

114
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:51,005
Do you feel kind of light-headed
now, being the right way up?

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,052
A lot of blood in your feet. I feel cheated.
I feellike someone's going to vomit.

116
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,060
You always think that they're
happy-go-lucky, the Australians.

117
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:01,009
It's just solid whingeing.
We were until we got here.

118
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:05,536
Sensitive, flighty, "Oh, no, I don't
want to go upside down in a racing car.

119
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:10,028
"I'll die with sick in my helmet.
" What's your problem? You've one here,

120
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,057
and you've got the other
two Toyotas over there.

121
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:16,064
Well, hang on, that's four seats.
There's only three of us.

122
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,973
Yes. We are in the same boat.

123
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,013
Obviously, we need four
people, so we've got...

124
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:24,032
Well, there's no other way of putting this.
We've got Jodie Kidd.

125
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:31,020
Yeah. Good for you. So, who've wegot?
Elle MacPherson. No. Kylie. No.

126
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:34,044
Dannii. No.
You've got Darren Lyons.

127
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,033
Right. What's his name again?

128
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:44,080
Darren Lyons. He's the ultimate
paparazzi photographer.

129
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:47,087
So he's famous here? Very.

130
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:50,060
And look at his hair. We are.

131
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,068
It was time to saddle up.
We should talk tactics.

132
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,056
What are the tactics?
Well, beat the Australians. OK.

133
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,569
What are you talking about
down there? Tactics.

134
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:07,013
Tactics! You're going
to have to really shout.

135
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:10,076
I can't hear you. It's all
right, he doesn't mind shouting.

136
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,021
Hammond? Yes?

137
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,985
One bang for faster,
two for slower.

138
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,004
Well, what if you bang for faster twice?
That's like slower.

139
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,041
I'll leave a pause.

140
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,004
Hey, look, they're being
lowered in, everybody.

141
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,037
I hope he doesn't vomit.

142
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,021
If he vomits, I'm going to vomit.

143
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:41,092
With the Aussies the right way
up, we were ready to begin.

144
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,969
What's the start? The klaxon thing?

145
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:47,048
KLAXON BLARES Oh, we're off!
Go, go, go!

146
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:52,032
Go on, Jez! Jesus!

147
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:57,008
Yes! Oh, see the power!

148
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:59,005
BLEEP!Go!

149
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,017
Already! Oh...

150
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:03,060
Oh, God, we're going to die.

151
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:08,981
Yee-ha! Jodie, you're a star!

152
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:15,068
At the back, Hammond and May werehaving
communication problems. Get them on the
inside, Hammond. Inside!

153
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:19,052
Going round the outside. Keep going,
steady away! Keeping my foot down...

154
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:23,973
Come on! Get out of the way!

155
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:27,040
Quite quickly, my colleagues
overtook the Aussies...

156
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,053
Here we go, here we go.

157
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:33,080
.. mainly because they were
still whingeing. Oh, God!

158
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,057
Where are we? I can't see!

159
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:40,056
I have no reference! And the
pap was plainly a bit nervous.

160
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:43,060
It's unbelievable!
I've got no hands!

161
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:50,037
Tell him to shut up and drive!

162
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:55,096
BLEEP! At this stage, it looked like
it was going to be a Brit one-two.

163
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,049
But then...

164
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:01,061
Hammond! Yes! Yes!

165
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:08,016
Ha! Whoa! This is civil war breakingout,
right here, right now. Get in!

166
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:13,045
That's a disaster.

167
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,061
While we were bickering...
Go! You've broken my window!

168
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:24,036
.. the Aussies caught up and engaged
us in a good-natured four-way duel.

169
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:26,008
Catch that Pommie bastard!

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,068
We've got them, we've got them, we've got
them, we've got them, we've got them! Oh,
no!

171
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:40,064
Even Darren got the bit between histeeth.
Come on, move! Out of my way!

172
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,057
This is Aussie driving!
Darren, slow down!

173
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:52,000
You're not a racing driver, you'rea
photographer! This is great!

174
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,044
No! An Australian's come through!

175
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,024
We're in the lead!

176
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,049
No!

177
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,969
That's a big one.

178
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:05,072
'By working together, we
eventually pulled out a lead.

179
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:09,044
'But soon, Jeremy got bored. '

180
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,068
Jodie, get his back wing.

181
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:21,000
No, we've stalled! Sorry, James, I
might have done that on purpose.

182
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:22,989
Come on, go, go, go! Go!

183
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:28,012
This made James and Richard very
angry, and so, on the last lap,

184
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,571
they exacted their revenge.

185
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:33,096
Oh, no! Oh, you stupid fool!

186
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,061
Good work, Hammond!

187
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:37,552
Right, we're in the lead!

188
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:39,793
We are so in the lead now!

189
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,000
This is ours for the winning!

190
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:46,033
Oh, they've won.

191
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:49,072
They've won, they've won.
Not good, not good.

192
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:52,041
With another victory in the bag,

193
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:56,012
things were looking
good for Top Gear UK.

194
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,045
You know what? It was turning out to be
like the real Ashes - complete whitewash.

195
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,985
For a sporting nation, they're quitebad at
sport, aren't they? It was quite
embarrassing.

196
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,052
It's like having a competition to see which
country's best at invading Poland, and
Germany coming last.

197
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:25,008
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on,
because first of all, let's do the news.

198
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:26,981
Yes, and first of all, last week,

199
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:33,024
we featured a motorcycle - a BMW, if I'm
not mistaken - a BMW, in your Aerial Atom
film,

200
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:39,032
and we've had a number of complaints that
we didn't give enough information about it.

201
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,001
So, James, would you
like to address that?

202
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:45,056
Yes, indeed, bikers, it has a
cable-operated anti-hopping clutch.

203
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,017
Lovely. Thank you very much.

204
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,044
There's a new Mini out, OK?
There's a picture of it here.

205
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,024
It's called the Countryman.

206
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,001
It's not a funny name!

207
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,016
This is the biggest car in the world, OK?
You might think this is a stubble field. It
isn't.

208
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,049
It's the Brazilian rainforest.
These are trees, in fact, here.

209
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:08,013
So that's a Mini in the same way
that you are a midget. Exactly.

210
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:13,526
You might think, "Well, I fancy a Mini. I
like the idea of a Mini. But I want more
space!"

211
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:18,969
But the ridiculous thing is... Well, the
one I drove the other day only had four
seats.

212
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:24,032
You're right - you'd think there'd be a
middle one in the back, but there's a sort
of "styling feature".

213
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:27,080
We've got a picture of it.
There's just two bars that run... Look.

214
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:31,041
What's the point of that?
It is a civic sculpture.

215
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:34,021
It's like trading up from a three-
to a four-bedroom house

216
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:38,036
and filling the fourth bedroom with
a waterfall. Why would you do that?

217
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,096
It's just stupid. It's the
stupidest car I've ever seen.

218
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,068
And it gave me crabs.

219
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:45,017
What? Crabs?

220
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,013
I meant cramp. Why did I say crabs?

221
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:51,552
How can a car give you crabs?
I don't know! Tell us!

222
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:55,056
Oh, I know what I want to talk about.
Really big news.

223
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:56,989
The new car from Pagani's out.

224
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:59,005
The Zonda's gone. This is the new
replacement for it from Pagani.

225
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,030
Look at that! It's an astonishing 730 brake
horsepower, six-litre AMG V12 specially
designed for the car.

226
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:13,020
It's got a carbotanium body, so that is
carbon fibre, but titanium woven in with
carbon fibre in it.

227
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:14,981
Yes, but can I interrupt?

228
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:20,036
What worries me, we liked the Zonda
because it was completely bonkers, yes?

229
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:21,965
Doesn't that look a bit sensible,

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,012
like Lady GaGa going, "No, no, no. I'm a
musician now, I want to start writing
opera. " A bit serious? Yes.

231
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:30,005
A bit grown-up? Yes. OK.

232
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,045
Here's the interior, look at that!

233
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,052
That's clearly not all
sensible and boring, is it?

234
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,009
I like the colour, actually.

235
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:41,076
Well if you want that colour, James, just
have a baby, get it eight times a day!

236
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:45,084
What's it called?
It's called the Hur-rurgh... It is!

237
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,040
It's spelled H-U-A-Y-R-A.

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,096
The... The Hur-rurgh? Exactly!

239
00:15:54,048 --> 00:16:01,040
It's written here, in case you forget. It's
the noise you make when you're sick in the
passenger seat.

240
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:08,064
If you're just going to mock, you won't
mind if I test it, will you? No, knock
yourself out!

241
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,985
OK. No, don't actually,

242
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,076
if you're driving fast...
I got that.

243
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:16,993
Oh, day in, day out, we
meet people who say to us

244
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:20,009
they don't like cars very much,
but they do watch Top Gear.

245
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:25,028
Well, if you're not interested
in cars, ta-da! A new Ford Focus.

246
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:28,981
Wow! There it is. You're not
saying it's bad, are you?

247
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:33,044
No. No. That is some car. I tell you
something about Ford Focus, right,

248
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,025
doing the figures this week on it,

249
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,012
275 people a day in Britain
alone buy a Ford Focus.

250
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,021
That is, what, about 12 an hour?

251
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:48,076
So who's waking up at 3am thinking,
"I'm going to get a Focus.

252
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:50,061
"I'm going to go out now.
" Who are they?

253
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:53,025
No! That's the most mangled bit
of statistics I've ever heard.

254
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,004
It doesn't mean that somebody has
to do it, on the hour, every hour.

255
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:02,024
Yes, but it's still 275 people a day.
How can we work it out?

256
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,997
We know Saabs are driven
by architects, yes?

257
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:09,025
We know Audis are driven
by people who play golf.

258
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,025
We know Land Rover Discoveries
are driven by murderers.

259
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,016
What? I'm going to have to pull you up on
that, as I think you'll find murderers
drive a Renault Espace.

260
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,547
Well, Kenneth Noye was a murderer,
he had a Land Rover Discovery.

261
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:28,009
So he may have done, but Harold
Shipman drove a Renault Espace,

262
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:33,088
Fred West drove a Renault Espace,
Peter Sutcliffe drove a Renault 16.

263
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:37,016
That's only because the Espace
hadn't been invented. Exactly.

264
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:39,977
This is a Top Gear top tip.

265
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:44,016
If you're a policeman and there's
been a murder in your area,

266
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:47,053
simply arrest anyone who
has a practical Renault.

267
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:50,021
That's fascinating.
I think that's very interesting.

268
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:56,012
Anyway, we got a bit off-topic, but there
you are, the new Ford Focus - ideal if you
just want some car.

269
00:17:56,047 --> 00:18:01,012
Chaps, listen, have you ever wanteda
Mexican sports car? Yes, I have!

270
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:06,004
Well, it's good news, because
there is one, and here it is,

271
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,977
and it's called the Tortilla.

272
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:11,993
It is not, it is not called the
Tortilla! What is it called?

273
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:16,048
I can't remember, it's somethinga bit...
You just made up the name?

274
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,993
Yes, I've forgotten.
Why would you want a Mexican car?

275
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:25,000
Cars reflect national characteristics, so
German cars are very well built, efficient.

276
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:29,032
Italian cars are a bit flamboyant and
quick, a Mexican car is just going

277
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,012
to be lazy, feckless,
flatulent, over-stuffed,

278
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:33,057
leaning against a fence asleep,

279
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:39,977
looking at a cactus, with a blanket
with a hole in the middle on, as a coat!

280
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:46,028
It is interesting, they can't do food, the
Mexicans, can they? It's all like sick with
cheese on it.

281
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:49,035
Refried sick! Yeah, refried sick.

282
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,973
How much is this
Mexican sports car?

283
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:57,020
The refried Mexican
sports car is L33,000.

284
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,017
That isn't enough.

285
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:04,048
It isn't enough. Somebody's paid for that
to be developed, it's got to be shipped
over.

286
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,033
That's 800 quid's worth of carthere.
You say that though,

287
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:10,088
but they do say, in their blurb,
it's got rack and pinion steering.

288
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,041
Wow, it's got steering.

289
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:16,004
I'm sorry, but just
imagine waking up

290
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,013
and remembering you're Mexican!

291
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:23,056
It would be brilliant. It'd be brilliant
because you could just go straight back to
sleep again.

292
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:25,977
Oh, I'm a Mexican.
That's all I'm going to do all day.

293
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:29,506
That's why we won't get complaints
about this - at the Mexican Embassy,

294
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,000
the ambassador will be sitting there
with the remote control, like this.

295
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,017
They won't complain, it's fine.

296
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:41,024
I tell you want, there's a radio station in
Germany, offered L20,000 worth of a Mini
Cooper as a prize,

297
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,551
to any listener who would do the
zaniest, craziest thing, OK?

298
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:50,044
The chap who won it, won it
because he had the word "Mini"

299
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,559
tattooed on his... Face?

300
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:55,005
No. Arse? Elbow? No. Ears?

301
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,989
No. Toes? No, on his
gentleman's sausage... Mini!

302
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:05,056
If you think about it, Mini isn't really
the first word you would think to have
tattooed on you're...

303
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:12,032
I'd rather have the word enormous, but in
tiny letters so the scale... it must be!

304
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,051
If it's going to be cars, though,
I would have Alfa Romeo...

305
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:18,001
No, I wouldn't have Alfa Romeo,
I'd only get Alf on mine.

306
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:20,989
I think, actually, having Alfa
Romeo tattooed on your old chap

307
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:27,068
is a bit of a leap of faith,given our
experience with Alfas. Oh, it's not working
again.

308
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:31,060
It's never happened before.
It's an Alfa Romeo - it has!

309
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,049
That's the end of the news.
Moving on now.

310
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:40,024
In Britain, we find it really rather
revolting to talk about how much money
somebody earns, but I couldn't

311
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:46,028
help but noticing the other day that a DJ,
I won't say which one, Radio 2, in the
morning, ginger,

312
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:52,052
spent L12 million on a car. You might
think that's ridiculous, but it isn't.

313
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:58,084
Because the car in question
is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO.

314
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:06,044
'The GTO Ferrari... '

315
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:16,033
In the eyes of many, the 250 GTO is the
greatest car Ferrari ever produced.

316
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:23,056
Certainly, it's the greatest road racer
from the ultimate decade of road racing.

317
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:28,044
And it is extremely rare
just 36 were made.

318
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:38,044
And because the aluminium body panels
were hand-beaten over pieces of wood,

319
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,033
none of them were quite the same.

320
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:44,088
On this particular example, for
instance, the driver's door

321
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:49,080
is a centimetre longer
than the passenger door.

322
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:55,088
The 3-litre V12 engines
were all different as well.

323
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:03,072
They were supposed to
produce 295 horsepower.

324
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:07,048
Some came up with less
than that, some more.

325
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:14,072
But all of these cars would
do 175 miles an hour,

326
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:19,072
at a time when your dishwasher
had a name... and ears.

327
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:29,036
I wish almost more than anything I could
get into this now and take it for a drive,

328
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:32,969
but even though Top Gear is made
by one of the world's largest

329
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:38,052
and richest broadcasting organisations,
we simply cannot afford the insurance.

330
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,080
I can, however, drive this...

331
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,088
the 288 GTO.

332
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:58,033
The mid-engine twin turbo-charged flame
thrower was also built to be a road racer,

333
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:05,016
but, sadly, the road-racing series it was
built to enter folded before it ever got
the chance.

334
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:15,000
And, because it has no competition
pedigree, it's now a bargain.

335
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:20,072
You can buy one for
as little as L400,000.

336
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:30,025
When the final 288 rolled off the
limited-run production line in 1987,

337
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:37,032
we all thought that, because road racing
was a thing of the past, we'd never see the
GTO name again,

338
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:40,024
but we were wrong.

339
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,004
It's back.

340
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,092
This is the 599 GTO
and it's not a racer -

341
00:23:56,127 --> 00:24:01,092
it's a L300,000 road car.

342
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:08,057
So they've used the GTO
name on a road car.

343
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:12,985
That's brave. That's like
calling your infant son Jesus.

344
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,036
You need to be fairly sure he's going
to grow up to be something special.

345
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:19,004
Not a burglar.

346
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,045
So, how has this turned out, then?

347
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,969
Well, it's pouring with rain,
and, as usual, when we're...

348
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:31,040
BEEPING .. down at the track, I've
turnedthe traction control off.

349
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:33,032
So, here we go.

350
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,068
Oh... argh...

351
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,021
Nearly.

352
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:45,012
Have I got it? No.

353
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,096
No!

354
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,012
Come on!

355
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:59,080
It squirrels under braking, it understeers
when you go into a corner... Ah!

356
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:03,024
Oh... BLEEP! Bloody hell!

357
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,981
This is not a car -
it's a wild animal.

358
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:14,068
Oh, actually, it's not evena
wild animal, just a BLEEP!

359
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,048
BLEEP!

360
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:28,008
Actually, what it is is the most
powerful road car Ferrari has ever built.

361
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,057
Its 6-litre V12
produces 661 horsepower.

362
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:39,033
And to make sure none of
those horse powers are wasted

363
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:45,064
lugging around unnecessary weight,
the glass in the windows is thin.

364
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:47,985
The body work is carbon fibre.

365
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,048
The floor is aluminium.
There are no carpets.

366
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,056
It doesn't even have a radio.

367
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:05,052
The result, when you understand all that
and you respect it and you leave the
traction control on,

368
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:07,020
is rather different.

369
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:11,032
The speed!

370
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:14,028
Speed!

371
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:18,068
And the noise of the speed!

372
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,068
0-60, 3.3 seconds.

373
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:25,056
Top speed, 208.

374
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:32,542
And then there's the braking.
OK, ready?

375
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:35,037
Now, I just hold this
left-hand paddle down,

376
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:41,044
and the down changes are done automatically
at precisely the right moment.

377
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,084
It's a laptop!

378
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:53,060
These days, automotive electronics are
used to make a car more economical,

379
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:58,024
more environmentally
friendly, more safe.

380
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:02,029
Not in this.

381
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:06,028
In this, the electronics
make you faster.

382
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:13,080
The car is learning all the time how
fast I can go round this corner.

383
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:18,068
It's taking constant
readings of tyre temperature,

384
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,965
engine temperature,
gear box temperature

385
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,036
to make sure that when I put my
foot down at the end of the corner,

386
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:31,000
the maximum amount of power
is sent to the rear wheels.

387
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:35,004
I'll put my foot down now.
No, it's not ready.

388
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,088
It's not ready! NOW it's ready.

389
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:46,080
It is all fantastically clever,
but, I'm afraid, there is a but.

390
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:56,566
Modern jet fighters are kept
in the air, not by the pilot,

391
00:27:56,601 --> 00:28:01,096
but by several million
gigabytes of hardcore software.

392
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:07,000
And this is just the same.
It's an F-22

393
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,064
with a tax disc.

394
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,029
And that's the problem, because...

395
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:15,036
I don't feel like I'm
driving this car -

396
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:18,053
I just feel like a big lump of meat

397
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:21,001
that's come along for the ride.

398
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:26,965
Of course, I can't turn the computers
off - well, I can, but I'm not going to,

399
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
because that would be like sitting on the
front of a roller coaster and trying to
steer it.

400
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:36,092
It's not my sort of car, this.

401
00:28:38,044 --> 00:28:40,088
And then there's the
problem with its name.

402
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,076
If they'd called it Matthew or Mark

403
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:51,009
or Typhoon or Herod, even,

404
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:56,052
that would have been fine, but
they didn't, they called it a GTO.

405
00:28:57,072 --> 00:29:03,001
But it was not designed for
racing, so it's not a GTO.

406
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:09,092
It's just a limited-edition tweaked
version of the car Gordon Ramsay drives.

407
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:17,064
APPLAUSE

408
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:22,025
So, it's not the Messiah.

409
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,993
It's just a very naughty boy!
That's what it is.

410
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:31,064
You know what, when you were driving with
the traction control off, it looked pretty
much undriveable.

411
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:35,020
It was. The thing is, though, after I
made that film, I went to Italy with it.

412
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:39,543
I drove it in the dry, and it was
a lot better, but, all the time,

413
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:44,032
you can sense it's plotting on new
and exciting ways of killing you.

414
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,985
You know Cato? What, from
the Pink Panther? Yeah.

415
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,029
That's my favourite comic character,pretty
much. It's like that. You go around the
corner.

416
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:55,064
You think "Yes, I've got this, I'm holding
this well. " Suddenly, it goes into a
massive tail slide.

417
00:29:55,099 --> 00:30:00,063
Not now, Cato. It is. You go back to a
hotel room at night thinking, "Is it in the
mini bar?

418
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:04,993
"Is it on top of the wardrobe?" You know
it's going to leap out and attack you at
any moment.

419
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:09,076
Maybe they shouldn't have called it the
Ferrari GTO, maybe they should have called
it the Ferrari Cato.

420
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,037
That would have been quite a
good name for it, the Cato.

421
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:17,068
But, anyway, we must now find out how fast
this Chinese psychopath goes round our
track.

422
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:21,024
That, of course, means handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

423
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,000
Some say that he doesn't
understand the word "envelope".

424
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:31,057
And that he is the
only woman in Britain

425
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:36,056
not to have slept with
Alan Johnson's policeman.

426
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:39,036
All we know is, he's
called the Stig.

427
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,997
And he's off.

428
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:45,068
And just listen to the
noise of that V12.

429
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:48,052
Actually, let's just listen.

430
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,033
SILENCE

431
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:54,024
Nope, can't hear it there.
So, first corner, coming in wide.

432
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,013
Is it going to bite?

433
00:30:55,048 --> 00:31:00,032
Ooh, a little bit,
but he's through.

434
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:07,049
No stereo in this car, of course,i
t's just got 12 cylinders. CAR REVS

435
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:13,037
God, that noise is amazing. Now,
Hammerhead, I should say the braking system
on this car is phenomenal.

436
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:20,072
Carbon ceramic, second generation, so the
Stig can brake very hard and very late, but
he's not braking now.

437
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:21,993
ENGINE PURRS

438
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:28,004
Oh, that noise is simply sensational.
It is spine-tingling!

439
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,989
It's like God treading
on a Lego brick!

440
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:39,548
Here he comes, second to
last corner. Into Gambon.

441
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:43,072
Is Cato going to attack?
No, he's across the line!

442
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:45,080
APPLAUSE

443
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,068
He did well.

444
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:51,021
OK.

445
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:55,000
It did it... it did it in...

446
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,037
1.19.8.

447
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:59,049
Which is there.

448
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,090
Look at this, it's 0.7

449
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,106
of a second slower

450
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:05,053
than the Ferrari 458.

451
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,973
Which costs about
half as much. Yes.

452
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:10,096
And you might be thinking how
well the Stig did on that lap, OK?

453
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:14,056
In one of his practice laps,
I should say, this happened.

454
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,060
There he is, going onto the straight.
Completely straight line.

455
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:21,036
No! Not now, Cato!

456
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,973
LAUGHTER

457
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,005
What a car! What an animal!
Anyway...

458
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,058
it is time now to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

459
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:33,041
Now, my guest tonight is quit
literally a tennis player.

460
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:40,020
He was able to win Wimbledon three times,
partly because of his immense strength,

461
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:41,973
partly because of his agility,

462
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:45,000
but mostly, I suspect,
because he isn't English.

463
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:47,044
Ladies and gentlemen, Boris Becker!

464
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,579
APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING

465
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:52,045
Hello. How are you?

466
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,040
Hello. Hello. Take a seat.

467
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:56,965
Thank you.

468
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,012
You're enormous.

469
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:03,037
As tall as you?
You're bigger than I thought.

470
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:09,088
A lot bigger than I thought you'd be. Now,
how does it feel to be the most popular
German in Britain?

471
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,985
I guess the list isn't very long.

472
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,046
No, you're right, actually,
it isn't very long.

473
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:19,037
But it is, you are a
very popular chap here.

474
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:23,981
Thank you very much. I think it has
a lot to do with Wimbledon, I guess.

475
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:30,052
Yeah. First, for the younger members of the
audience, you were the first German to win
it,

476
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:32,021
the first unseeded player to win it

477
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:36,064
and you're stillthe youngest to this
day to winthe men's single final. Yeah.

478
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,973
You were what - two?

479
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:42,044
I was a little older, but I was still
a teenager - I was 17 years old.

480
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,547
17! We've got a picture
of you here, actually.

481
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:47,016
And I do have a big
question - these shorts...

482
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:51,029
.. did they restrict movement?

483
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,037
Well, at the time, we're
talking '80s, at the time,

484
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:59,024
that was fashionable. I remember George
Michael had a pair similar to that in one
of his videos.

485
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,555
I think they were stretch -
able to stretch a little bit -

486
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,052
but, obviously, when you stretch
too far on an angle volley,

487
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,057
you might lose... something!

488
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:13,020
Now, of course, you've stopped playing
tennis, you are now a commentator.

489
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:16,060
You're going to be commentatingagain
at Wimbledon this year? Yes.

490
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,017
A small word of advice, if I may -

491
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:23,046
have no opinions about the
looksof the lineswomen. OK.

492
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:27,040
It is just a little tipI can give you.
Yeah, thank you.

493
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:28,973
Otherwise, you'll
find yourself sacked.

494
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:33,028
I was reading the papers the last
couple of days, I find it a bit harsh.

495
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:36,088
It is a bit weird. You're not
even on television and you get...

496
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:39,053
I mean, I'd be very sacked.
I mean, the guy...

497
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:45,072
Andy, you know, he shouldn't have said it,
it was dumb, it was stupid, you don't say
that.

498
00:34:45,107 --> 00:34:51,056
But then he wasn't really on air. It should
have been a penalty, give some money to
charity,

499
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:55,557
but for him to be fired and lose
his job, I think it's a bit harsh.

500
00:34:55,592 --> 00:35:00,024
No, I couldn't agree more.
Now, I want to get it on to cars, if I may.

501
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:02,551
Please. You are a car man.

502
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:05,009
I am crazy about cars, yeah.

503
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:11,068
We have to declare an interest fromthe off,
you actually have threeMercedes
dealerships. Correct, yes.

504
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:15,965
So what's the car you drive?
Let me think about it, it's a Mercedes.

505
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,016
Oh, really, that's a surprise!No, my
favourite car,when I'm alone, is the SLS.

506
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:26,004
You see. Yes, it's my favourite car.
You see. It's a fantastic car.

507
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,049
We proved - the other two agreed
with me, they're not here,

508
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:33,012
sadly, to back me up - but that is
the best car in the world, the SLS.

509
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,977
Did I see yours parkedoutside
today? Exactly.

510
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:38,977
I thought I'd come with my
best weapon to impress you.

511
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:43,024
Now, your first car that you
bought as a teenager was a...?

512
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,057
You're talking about
the Porsche 959.

513
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:48,041
Yeah? True. That, it really was.
I thought it can't be true.

514
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:52,989
No teenager goes, "Right, it's time to
buy my first car, I'll make it a 959."

515
00:35:53,024 --> 00:36:00,044
Cos the 959, let's be clear, it was built
for Group B rallying? Yeah. A ferociously
fast thing.

516
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,044
It wasn't a street car. A very
sophisticatedfour-wheel drive system on it.

517
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,025
Very sophisticated
and two turbos. Yeah.

518
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,053
You had the first one kick in at a
certain speed and the second one kick in,

519
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:15,004
and you were already flying all over the
place, and only 200 were sold or made for
the public.

520
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,049
How old were you when you got it?

521
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:20,005
19. Did you drive it
like a 19-year-old?

522
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,032
I drove it rather fast and I - you
know, knock on wood - I didn't have

523
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:30,024
an accident, but I wanted to show
that I'm a man, I'm not a teenager.

524
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,049
And I had to drive top speed.

525
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:36,044
So my best friend at the time, Patrick,
said, "Listen, let's together drive from
Frankfurt

526
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,009
"to Monte Carlo,

527
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:42,045
"and there's this highway from Milan down
to Geneva, three lanes, where we maybe give
it a go. "

528
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,056
That's exactly what happened. So I went 326
on a highway - three times the speed limit
allowed in Italy.

529
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:51,083
That's 200 miles an hour. Yeah.

530
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:53,041
That is 200 miles an hour in Italy.

531
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:57,021
Yeah. And you just said
that on television!

532
00:36:57,056 --> 00:37:01,013
But the Italian cars at the
time, they were too slow.

533
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:07,048
So by the time I went over and passed
them, they, you know, they let me go.

534
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,585
There is another reason
the Italian police,

535
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,053
who you must have
encountered over the years,

536
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:15,040
if you do 200 miles an hour,
theytend to just go... They like it!

537
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:16,989
They like it. Good point.

538
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:21,004
The other thing, of course, the Germans
are the best racing drivers as well.

539
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,037
You had Schumacher for years.

540
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:25,000
Do you know Schumacher?
Yeah, very well. A good mate?

541
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,981
Good mate. He's come good nowadays.

542
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:32,096
He in private is very different than on
camera, but when he's relaxed and
comfortable,

543
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:34,977
he's a cool guy and
has lots of humour,

544
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:38,053
but, obviously, when he speaks on
camera, it doesn't really show.

545
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:43,973
Have you met Vettel?Yeah. Sebastian, yeah.
He needs to address his hair.

546
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:49,029
Well... he's young, that's the look.
Those 21-year-olds wear it that way now.

547
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:54,044
I think he looks stupid. I mean, you were
wise, you addressed your hair, you realised,

548
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,088
"Hell, I'm ginger, I need to do
something about it. " Now you're not.

549
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:01,041
He needs to do the same thing!

550
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:04,558
But he doesn't worry.
He's got the helmet on when he works.

551
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:08,040
That's true. When he's working,
he does have his helmet on.

552
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,997
Now, your lap. Yeah, please.

553
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:18,008
It's raining, predictably today!It was
raining... heavy. I had to... I was really
struggling and...!

554
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:20,065
You're a competitive man?
Of course!

555
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,053
I was seriously
worried that I'm going

556
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:28,008
to be embarrassed by everybody, because
the steering wheel is on the right.

557
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:29,989
Yes, the right side of the car.

558
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:33,045
I'm driving on the left.
The wrong side of the car.

559
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,020
Yeah? So, when I first went into the car, I
couldn't find the clutch, I broke down the
engine.

560
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:43,076
I ruptured the first car also, because
I was braking wrong all of the time.

561
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:47,048
Thank God, the last couple of laps...
and because of Schtick.

562
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:51,029
Schtick told me the
whole secret about...

563
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:55,032
This is the worst racing
driver excuses I've...!

564
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,020
No, no, no. Schtick was good.

565
00:38:57,055 --> 00:38:58,973
Schtick?! Schtick!

566
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:05,017
Schtick! When you said Shtick,I
was thinking Michael Stich?No...

567
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:10,040
Now I'm with you. Stig. Stig.
You are the first German ever to try it.

568
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:13,033
OK. Cos Michael Schumacher didn't.
He just did it in his Ferrari.

569
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:17,052
You're the first personto do it... you
haven'tmentioned your broken foot. Well...

570
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:21,021
You don't like to make a fuss.
No. When did you break it?

571
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:28,064
Five weeks ago I had surgery. So, it's not
fully healed? No. So many things that went
wrong.

572
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:33,005
Yeah, but thank God, I didn't have to use
my right leg this time, more my left.

573
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,056
You know the pedals are the same whether
it's the left-hand drive... No, it's on the
wrong side. What?!

574
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:43,547
Is the accelerator pedal on the leftin
Germany? No, it's on the right. It's the
same for us! No!

575
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:49,303
It was confusing for me. Now, all of this
confusion did cause a few problems in your
practice...

576
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:55,024
Yeah... in that every time I looked out of
the window, you were facing backwards on
the grass.

577
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,567
Would anyone like to see that?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

578
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:00,076
It's a quite a high s
peed one,this one. OK.

579
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:08,004
And because you didn't know where the
brake was, it just kept going, really.

580
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,969
Anyway, who would like
to see Boris's lap?

581
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:14,060
Please! Please. AUDIENCE: Yeah!
Come on, let's have a look.

582
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:17,053
ENGINE ROARS, TYRES SQUEAL

583
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:19,977
That is an aggressive start.

584
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:23,004
That's a gear change.
Come on, baby.

585
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,076
Light my fire. Come on!

586
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:30,044
There we go. Ooh, several attempts
at getting into the first corner.

587
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:35,064
Almost got the back wheel
up there, which wasn't bad.

588
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,551
Good. Good. Good. Come on!

589
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:40,004
It's a good one. Looking good.

590
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,061
That's smooth.

591
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:45,088
That is, yes, very impressive.
Now, coming up to the Hammerhead.

592
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:49,004
HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN I'm
speaking German and English.

593
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,052
It's funny. Hey, hey! It's English.

594
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:54,064
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

595
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:55,981
Right.

596
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:58,005
Hard on the brakes.

597
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,096
That was quite slow but if it
looks slow it's normally fast.

598
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:04,977
That's what he told me.

599
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:08,076
It's true, the slower you
look, the faster you're going.

600
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:11,060
But you do need to change
gear better than that!

601
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,579
I show them. I'm not
only a tennis player,

602
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:16,064
I'm actually a hidden
Formula One driver!

603
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:23,080
Looking Formula One-ish through there,
apart from the car. Did you like the Kia?

604
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:26,032
Yeah, it's good fun to drive.
It isn't bad, actually.

605
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,989
Not bad at all.

606
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:30,017
So much faster driving
than it actually looks.

607
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:34,076
It's really not bad, that.
It is brown, but it's very nice.

608
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:36,017
There we go, Gambon.

609
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:39,020
Nicely controlled, and there
we are, across the line.

610
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:40,064
APPLAUSE

611
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:47,072
So... I should explain...

612
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:52,037
These are the wet times.

613
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:58,004
Realistically, you're not going to be at
the top of the board as it was pouring with
rain. A lot.

614
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,012
Pouring with rain... Stormy, windy.

615
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:03,049
Windy. Wrong side. Wrong side.

616
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:06,037
Pedals were somehow the
wrong way round, as well.

617
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:09,044
Only car in the world.
I can't think of anything else. Anyway,

618
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,016
these are the wet times, so where
do you think you've come there?

619
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:15,028
As long as I'm faster
than Angelina Jolie.

620
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:17,036
It wasn't actually Angelina,

621
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:20,045
it was Bill Bailey.

622
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,985
OK. He fooled US!

623
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,020
Anyway, I have the time.
You did it, Boris Becker...

624
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:31,012
What's the fastest wet? 1.49.9.

625
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:32,068
.. One...

626
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,997
forty-... OK.

627
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:38,013
He's leaning forward.

628
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:41,032
.. five! There you go. Wow!

629
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:48,058
I love it!

630
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:51,005
That's great.

631
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,024
Thank you. Impressive. Thank you.

632
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:56,017
Impressive.

633
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:59,076
APPLAUSE AND CHEERS OK. Thank you.

634
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,973
This new Stig must bea
very good teacher. Yeah.

635
00:43:05,008 --> 00:43:08,045
Because the first couple of laps
I was way over 150, I'm sure.

636
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:15,036
I made all of the mistakes in the book.
Sliding out, I didn't know how to
accelerate on the wrong side.

637
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,025
Only the last couple of laps,
I started to do better.

638
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,024
That is a very quick time.
So, it turns out you're not only

639
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,067
a brilliant tennis player,
a brilliant commentator,

640
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:27,041
but also a brilliant driver,
and an excellent guest.

641
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:31,036
Ladies and gentlemen - Boris Becker!
Thank you very much. Thank you.

642
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:33,084
APPLAUSE AND CHEERS

643
00:43:39,032 --> 00:43:46,016
Tonight we are engaged in a car-based
sporting challenge against our colleagues
from Top Gear Australia.

644
00:43:46,051 --> 00:43:49,000
Yes, it's like the Ashes for
people who don't like cricket.

645
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:51,041
Which is us, really. Yes, it is.

646
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:53,013
Anyway, here are the scores so far.

647
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:57,070
We won the drag race, giving
us ten points and them nothing.

648
00:43:57,105 --> 00:44:01,092
We also scored a remarkable one-two
in the double-decker racing,

649
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:03,997
giving us 30 and them 5.

650
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:09,021
So the totals so far are 40
to us and a dismal 5 to them.

651
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:14,080
Coming up now, though, is a challenge to
see which nation is best at synchronised
drifting.

652
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:21,072
Our new Stig said he'd use the
Aston Vantage for this one,

653
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:24,084
while Jeremy plumped
for a Jaguar XKR.

654
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:29,032
TYRES SQUEAL

655
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,985
Look at that!

656
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,041
Side by side in perfect
slithering harmony.

657
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:46,096
The Aussies could only spectate because
we'd explained to them that due to health
and safety rules,

658
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:51,008
the judging had to be done
by residents of the UK.

659
00:44:53,092 --> 00:44:56,072
It's Torvill and
Dean, really, here.

660
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:58,997
Nothing else to say.

661
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:01,981
'Our routine was going well. '

662
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:05,017
I think this is
looking very good now.

663
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:09,072
'But then, thanks to me,
it sort of went wrong. '

664
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,045
Oh, he's gone! That's got
to be points off for that.

665
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,084
The judges, however, who had a much
clearer view of the action, disagreed.

666
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:25,084
I'm assuming they're still there?

667
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,099
You're kidding!

668
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:29,080
They are very good.

669
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,096
What are you watching?
Where have you been looking?

670
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:44,000
Beat that, Bruce!

671
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,578
It was now the Aussies' turn.

672
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:50,041
So they unpacked their Stig

673
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:54,080
and then I introduced them to
the cars they would be driving.

674
00:45:58,096 --> 00:46:00,021
What NOW?

675
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:02,044
What happened to
the Holdens we had?

676
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,032
They ARE Holdens? No, they're not!

677
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:05,053
They are, nearly!

678
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:07,568
No, they're not, it's a Vauxhall.

679
00:46:07,603 --> 00:46:10,013
Exactly. Vauxhalls, they are...

680
00:46:10,048 --> 00:46:13,049
like Ferraris.
That's how we think of them.

681
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:17,096
They are four-door... They're
photocopier salesmen's cars.

682
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:20,029
Exactly, this is a V6.

683
00:46:20,064 --> 00:46:24,080
This is a 2 litre. Yes, I couldn't get two.
I couldn't get two.

684
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,005
You couldn't get two?
No, but it will be fine.

685
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,036
Now get your Stig out, turn him the
right way up and let's get cracking.

686
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:41,064
Despite the excellence of the mini cabs we
provided, the Aussies were, really rather
disappointing.

687
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:45,009
Get up there!

688
00:46:45,044 --> 00:46:48,040
And then they crashed.

689
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:49,068
It should be...

690
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,058
Oh! You... boxhead!

691
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:56,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

692
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,989
He hit the Stig. The Stig.

693
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:02,016
Very, very poor. I don't know about
you, but... I'm not impressed.

694
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:04,045
Same here.

695
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,041
Dismal, to be honest.

696
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:10,000
You've put 11 up, you idiot!

697
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,969
Hammond!

698
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:15,057
You gave them 11!

699
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:18,052
I thought it had a point on it.

700
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:21,029
I thought it said 1.1!

701
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:24,064
Does it count now I've voted?

702
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:33,004
It did. But our guests were still
losing badly. So, to cheer them up,

703
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,032
we decided to cook them
a typical Aussie lunch.

704
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,551
Ready, steady, check it out!

705
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:44,036
I think we've got enough there.

706
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:45,057
Hmm!

707
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:49,041
My grandfather was burnt less
than that when they cremated him.

708
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:54,020
Did you know that barbecue is an
ancient Aboriginal word for diarrhoea.

709
00:47:54,055 --> 00:47:56,009
Well, it will be after we eat this!

710
00:47:56,044 --> 00:47:59,540
Why do you eat outside?
Honestly, why do you eat outside?

711
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:03,036
The weather's conducive to it.
Do you have air-conditioning?

712
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,024
Yes, we do. Why don't you
sit in air-conditioning?

713
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:08,092
Because their houses
are disgusting!

714
00:48:08,127 --> 00:48:11,013
THEY ALL LAUGH

715
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:16,020
'At this stage our good-natured
bantering was interrupted

716
00:48:16,055 --> 00:48:19,052
'by an alarming update
from the producers. '

717
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:23,088
We've been accused of cheating.

718
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:25,973
By who? The Australians.

719
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:27,029
Their production team. What?!

720
00:48:27,064 --> 00:48:32,044
In the upside-down double-deckerracing
you remember we did... Hmm.

721
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,965
Who won it? We did.

722
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,044
But you were stationary
for an entire lap.

723
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,539
You therefore finished a lap down.

724
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:41,965
It's ridiculous, we weren't last.

725
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,040
We lapped you. You stayed still
forone entire lap. It's really simple.

726
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:47,049
You spun and were stationary.

727
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:52,052
I did not labour long and hard over
cooking that to be told by you...

728
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:54,084
Just pass them out the food.
This is what a fair man I am.

729
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,009
Have a celebratory sausage
that you didn't come last.

730
00:48:58,044 --> 00:49:02,060
They did, they've let themselves
down, they've let the BBC down,

731
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:04,989
they've let England down.

732
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:07,540
Happily, the updated score board

733
00:49:07,575 --> 00:49:10,021
revealed they were
still far behind,

734
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:14,020
but the next challenge was
right up their street.

735
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:16,965
Motorised sheep-herding.

736
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,032
OK. Guys, we've got you your bikes
,they are Australian. They're not.

737
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:23,553
Well, what are they, then?
Austrian.

738
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:26,005
Austrian, Australian, same thing!

739
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,056
We'll let the sheep out of the pen, you
ride around a bit and then herd them back
in again. OK?

740
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:33,985
No problem.

741
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,024
You do realise that we're not upset
that these are Austrian dirt bikes?

742
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:40,056
Why? Well, you made a
mistake, they're terrific.

743
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:42,045
These are the best bikes. Really?

744
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,012
What? So we've accidentally got
them good bikes. You idiots!

745
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,036
Right, if you're ready,
I shall release...

746
00:49:53,071 --> 00:49:56,009
the sheep! Go on!

747
00:49:56,044 --> 00:49:58,008
They're not scared of me!

748
00:49:58,043 --> 00:50:00,049
Go. Go. Go.

749
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:04,088
'To be honest, it wouldn't have made a
difference if we'd given them unicycles. '

750
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:08,096
Come on. Come on. Come on.
They're very good, this lot.

751
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,045
Shane, take them round.

752
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:15,092
He was popping a wheelie to
scare them off to the right.

753
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:17,017
See the way he's now

754
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:20,074
anticipating where
that sheep will go.

755
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:23,096
On the inside.
OK, get 'em, get 'em.

756
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:26,033
That's it. Let's get 'em.

757
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:30,005
I know, they've got
them all together.

758
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,530
Send him that way. Go together.
Come with me. Come with me.

759
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:37,020
I think when you're Australian,
you're born to do this.

760
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:39,029
It's instinctive.

761
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:42,088
Must eat, must breathe in
and out, must herd sheep.

762
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:46,029
How good are you
at riding off-road?

763
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:50,088
Me? I've no idea, never tried it.
Right. Have you ever ridden off-road?

764
00:50:50,123 --> 00:50:53,981
Not really. I've never
ridden off-road.

765
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:59,008
'In less than two minutes the Aussies
had all the sheep back in the pen. '

766
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:05,012
Hey! Together, together.
You guys get 'em.

767
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:16,016
Well done. Mate,
they won't beat that!

768
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,092
'This was hardly the
revelation of the century... '

769
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:23,981
Up the hill, come on. Bloody hell.

770
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:28,000
'.. given that James and I were
working with Evil Knievil. '

771
00:51:28,035 --> 00:51:30,072
Right, I'm in gear...

772
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:34,997
Clutch.

773
00:51:35,032 --> 00:51:38,044
ENGINE STOPS

774
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,021
A- a-a-a-argh!

775
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,001
No! No! They're all split.

776
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:46,012
Up the hill, come on. HORN TOOTS

777
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,013
No! Bloody hell!

778
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:51,064
Feed in the power like a learner.

779
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,033
ENGINE STOPS Why are
you doing this?!

780
00:51:55,068 --> 00:52:00,048
It's amazing that a bloke can be on a car
show for this many years and have so little
mechanical sympathy.

781
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,013
Help! I think this will work.

782
00:52:02,048 --> 00:52:06,076
Eventually, they'll get so inquisitive,
they'll want to go and see what he's trying
to do.

783
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:08,040
It's going! It's moving!

784
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,088
It's moving! Where are the sheep?

785
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:15,013
A- a-a-argh!

786
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,977
Look, you stupid woolly BLEEP.

787
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:20,040
Maybe the trick is to sneak
up on them and do it quietly.

788
00:52:20,075 --> 00:52:25,040
Right, watch this.
Right, got you, got you, go!

789
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,036
How the hell does it do that?

790
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:30,013
Look at me, I'm a shepherd!

791
00:52:30,048 --> 00:52:33,548
I'm shepherding! Look at me!
Hammond, look!

792
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,048
No, that's the next one.
They're in the woods.

793
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:41,985
No. Bad. Bad. Bad thing we've done!

794
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,064
That's what made British Leyland
great, it's that kind of teamwork.

795
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:50,049
This event had been a disaster.

796
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:57,096
'The Aussies had been awarded 10 points and
we'd got minus 20 for losing all the sheep.
'

797
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:59,609
So we were behind on the scoreboard

798
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:02,088
as we went into the final event.

799
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:08,556
A race on a World Championship
rally stage through the grounds

800
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:12,088
of what we had told the Aussies
was a typical British house.

801
00:53:15,004 --> 00:53:17,977
These are the cars we'll be using.

802
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:22,017
Super 2,000 Protons, four-wheel
drive, 280 horse power.

803
00:53:22,052 --> 00:53:28,008
The Australians will be using this one and
James will be driving... James? Yeah, James.

804
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:29,025
Why does it have to be James?
It's got to be James.

805
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,092
You did the drag race.
I did the drifting, so it's his turn.

806
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,040
Remember who took on
the Germans, remember?

807
00:53:36,075 --> 00:53:37,567
Oh, JAMES?

808
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:39,311
James! James!

809
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:41,020
He'll like it.

810
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:42,977
Yeah.

811
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:47,084
'While JAMES was getting ready, the
Aussies arrived to inspect the cars. '

812
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,045
They identical this time?

813
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,016
They are identical, hand on heart.

814
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:53,985
Who's driving yours?

815
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,092
Steve. You're driving that one and who's
your co-driver? You're the co-driver.

816
00:53:57,127 --> 00:54:02,016
Hammond is the co-driver in this and
James is going to be driving it.

817
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:03,072
Oh, here he comes now.

818
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,058
There we go. Lovely.
Right, let's get on with this, then.

819
00:54:08,093 --> 00:54:11,041
Hang on. Hang on. Do you think
our eyes are painted on?

820
00:54:11,076 --> 00:54:15,044
You're cheating again. May thebest
man win. James... All aboard.

821
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:22,032
Because the Aussies were 15.1 points
ahead of us on the scoreboard,

822
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:26,028
they were allowed a head
start of 15.1 seconds.

823
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:29,013
Hey! Are you ready?

824
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:31,072
ENGINES REV This is it...

825
00:54:31,107 --> 00:54:34,080
three, two, one, go!

826
00:54:39,084 --> 00:54:43,001
That a boy. Wahey!

827
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:45,084
Right, we've got 15
seconds, remember.

828
00:54:48,028 --> 00:54:50,520
Three, two, one, go!

829
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:53,012
Oh, we're going.

830
00:54:54,096 --> 00:54:59,037
'If we could beat them by even
a second, we'd win the Ashes.

831
00:54:59,072 --> 00:55:04,028
'Unfortunately, they'd saved their
pro racing driver for this event. '

832
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:08,036
I know this stuff. This is gravel.

833
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:12,092
'Happily, though,
James was on fire!'

834
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,052
Oh, my God!

835
00:55:18,052 --> 00:55:22,076
I hope I don't wet myself in James's...
Your race suit, your race suit, yeah.

836
00:55:29,088 --> 00:55:32,013
That was all right, wasn't it?
Yeah. Good.

837
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:36,052
I don't even know how
far ahead they are now.

838
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,084
Oh, my God. Yes!
Look at your little feet going.

839
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:45,000
May, you're a different
man in this car!

840
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,558
Time for the hand-brake,
are you ready? Righto.

841
00:55:51,593 --> 00:55:55,076
Hey! Not bad. Not bad
for a circuit driver.

842
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:00,000
I see dust, that's got to be them.

843
00:56:00,035 --> 00:56:02,004
That could be them.

844
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:08,092
Oh! That's just...
He's getting better!

845
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:15,965
'James had almost
caught the Aussies

846
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,969
'but then, with just two
miles to go, disaster. '

847
00:56:20,004 --> 00:56:24,064
I know this stuff, this is asphalt.
Yep. Now I'm back in business!

848
00:56:27,056 --> 00:56:30,028
That's quite brisk now!

849
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:36,064
'Luckily, James preferred
the tarmac surface too. '

850
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:39,020
Oh, he's in the zone!

851
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:43,048
Come on, Stevie, keep going!

852
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:47,997
Not far to go now!

853
00:56:48,032 --> 00:56:50,993
'Even though we were right
on their tail, it didn't look

854
00:56:51,028 --> 00:56:56,092
'like we would be able to pass, but let's
not forget, this was James at the wheel!'

855
00:56:56,127 --> 00:56:57,096
Oh!

856
00:57:02,048 --> 00:57:03,052
Argh!

857
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:10,052
Oh, my God, Stig...
James, you've gone mad!

858
00:57:15,072 --> 00:57:19,092
What's he doing? Unbelievable!

859
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:22,080
It really is. He's good.

860
00:57:26,072 --> 00:57:29,096
OK, I can hear 'em.
Yeah. Keep going.

861
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:33,033
We've got to beat The Stig.

862
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:36,044
Come on, James,
this is your moment!

863
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,072
Oh...!

864
00:57:44,072 --> 00:57:45,092
Ooh!

865
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:48,969
Who is that?

866
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:52,064
That can't be James? Not driving...

867
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:58,088
Yes! It's the United Kingdom!

868
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,057
Oh, mate!

869
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:08,060
Yes, stay cool! Yeah!

870
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:17,044
Bruce! Sorry about that, Bruces.

871
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,985
Can James get out?

872
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,080
He's overcome. He's overcome.

873
00:58:21,115 --> 00:58:24,037
He's actually asleep.

874
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:26,092
He sleeps it off.
He doesn't look asleep.

875
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,593
Very tired, very tired.

876
00:58:28,628 --> 00:58:31,350
Bruce... Unbelievable.

877
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:34,037
13,000 miles, pointlessly.

878
00:58:34,072 --> 00:58:37,060
Well, you came second...
which means you lost!

879
00:58:43,056 --> 00:58:45,977
APPLAUSE

880
00:58:46,012 --> 00:58:47,088
Well done, mate!

881
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,044
Well done.

882
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:53,013
Lovely.

883
00:58:53,048 --> 00:58:59,036
Was it just me or did anyone else see that
funny looking bloke who put his face round
the tree? Yes! No!

884
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:02,033
That hideously ugly tree troll

885
00:59:02,068 --> 00:59:06,053
that put its ghastly gargoyle face
round the tree and then disappeared?

886
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:10,574
Can I just stop you for a moment, because
since we filmed that, obviously Australia
has been

887
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:15,025
blighted with terrible floods, a lot of
people were killed, a lot of people are
missing.

888
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:19,048
If you're one of the people whose house is
now several miles from where you left it,
we would just

889
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:22,048
like to say we are thinking of you
and we wish you all the very best.

890
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,993
You're being nice. I know.

891
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,013
On that bombshell,
it's time to end.

892
00:59:26,048 --> 00:59:28,068
Thank you very much for
watching, good night!
