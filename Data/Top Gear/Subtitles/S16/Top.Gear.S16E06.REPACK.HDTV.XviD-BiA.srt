1
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,360
A fat man in a Kia... 
Woah, there she goes!

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,440
..and a race against the 
Lord God Almighty. Come on!

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,280
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,320
Hello, everybody! 
Thank you so much.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,240
Thank you very much. Thank you.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,520
Richard Hammond says that back in the 1980s, 
when he was a small boy,-there were only two cars that

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,280
caused him to run about his house in Birmingham 
clutching feverishly at his as yet unformed tinkle.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,640
 [LAUGHTER]

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,680
So you can imagine how 
excited he was when

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,880
the producer said to him this 
week he could drive both of them.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,440
We've been wanting to get these two 
together for as long as I can remember,

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,480
We've been wanting to get these two 
together for as long as I can remember,

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,320
and we've finally got hold of them. 
And, well,

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,360
it's a short winter's day and I don't want any 
traffic jams holding me up or any of that nonsense, 

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,560
which is why I've kipped 
the night at the track.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
And I believe they are here.

17
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,040
In 1986, Porsche launched 
the greatest supercar

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,680
the world had ever seen, the 959.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,600
And then, a year later, Ferrari 
responded with the greatest supercar

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,400
the world had ever seen, the F40.

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,560
Oh, my word!

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,520
Would you just look at that?!

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,840
I can't recall ever seeing these two- 
together on television before.

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,160
So let's get cracking, 
beginning with this one.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,760
Come on, Richard, stay professional!- 
Oh, ho! Oh, ho!

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,880
When the 959 first came along in 1986,

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,920
it was the most advanced and 
most high-tech car ever made.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm not talking about the upmarket pleasantness of 
my surroundings, the- air-con, electric seats and so on.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,400
No, it's cleverer stuff than that.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
For example, it had 
adjustable suspension

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,840
and a complex four-wheel-drive system.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
You could split the power between the front and back 
wheels not just according to how much grip you had

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,480
but how you were cornering, how much- 
G-force you were putting down.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,560
You can just feel...

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,560
I mean, I've driven - I have owned -- 
911s from this period,

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,240
I mean, I've driven - I have owned -- 
911s from this period,

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,840
and this thing just feels so much more!

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
And the tech fest didn't stop there.

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,480
The 959 came with a million 
things we'd never seen before -

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,600
tyre pressure sensors, for example, and 
magnesium wheels with hollow spokes.

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,320
No wonder Bill Gates bought one.

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
And while we're on the subject of Billy Microsoft,

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
he was one of the few people back 
then who could have afforded to pay

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,200
the proper price for one of these things.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Because in the 80s, Porsche 
asked L150,000 for a 959,

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,720
but it actually cost them L300,000 
to make, it was so advanced.

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,600
Other famous owners included 
my style hero Don Johnson,

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,440
and a young Boris Becker, who maxed 
out his 959 on the Italian Autostrada,

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,920
which must have been lively!

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,760
A 959 was fast.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Really fast.

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,920
Thanks to its 444 brake horse power,- 
2.9 litre flat six turbocharged engine.

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,040
In fact, the top speed was 
197 miles an hour...

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,720
..which in 1986 made it the fastest 
production car in the world.

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Oh! When the turbos come on! 
Oh, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh!

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,920
However, its reign as the 
speed king- was short-lived...

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
..thanks to this.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,080
The 201 mile an hour Ferrari F40.

59
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,640
God!

60
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
It's the ONE that gets me.

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Not 200, 201.

62
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
It's like when kids say,
"Everything you say plus one!"

63
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,880
So we know that Ferrari has a higher top speed 
than the Porsche,- but what about acceleration?

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,720
You know, I feel a drag race coming on.

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,000
I am, as you know, a big fan of Porsches.

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,480
And it's not that I think that 959 
is going to lose or anything,

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,040
but it's a cold day, and I think 
it's best if I stay here in this car,

68
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,440
the one that's 250 kilograms lighter

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,040
and has got 478 brake 
horse power instead of 444.

70
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
ENGINE REVS

71
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,000
Both these cars have twin turbos.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Both 2.9 litres.

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,520
Oh, it's going to be close!

74
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,880
It's going to be close!

75
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,160
I think the Porsche is taking it!

76
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,680
The Porsche is going to win!

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
Enzo would not like that result.

78
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll be honest, a couple of my gear 
changes could have been slicker.

79
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,440
Dial out my iffy gear changes, though, and 
these two would cross the line neck-and-neck.

80
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,680
And that's odd, because they are very different.

81
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,680
Where the 959 is all hi-tech and luxury,

82
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,480
the F40 has string for door handles,- 
no carpets and wind-up windows.

83
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,800
What you get in this car is a twin 
turbo V8, some windscreen wipers,

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,080
and that's about it.

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,480
It was the first car to be 
made entirely of carbon-fibre,

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,040
which is only just starting to 
happen in Formula One.

87
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,880
The lightness and the stiffness 
of it, allied to that colossal power,

88
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,280
made it a bit of a hyper go-kart 
through the corners.

89
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,000
As a Porsche fan, it pains 
me to say this,

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,040
but in the corners, the F40 is 
far more exciting.

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,520
God... The steering wheel is alive!

92
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,240
Oh! Ho, ho!

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,360
This thing is so sharp.

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,720
Oh, God!

95
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm sorry to keep squeaking

96
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,480
and making noises, and if it's 
disturbing you, I apologise.

97
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,720
So often it is, "Don't drive your heroes."

98
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Not this time.

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,440
It's better than I could have imagined.

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,120
Better than I ever knew as a 
kid looking at pictures of it.

101
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,760
Choosing between these two is like choosing 
between shirt or trousers -- it's pointless.

102
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,000
But I will stay this, we simply wouldn't 
be where we are now without them.

103
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,480
Because these two cars are, 
I believe, incredibly important.

104
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,520
It's this pair that took road cars to and 
beyond the 200-mile-an-hour barrier.

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,800
Before them we had 
Countaches and Testarossas,

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,880
and in evolutionary terms they were 
like man first making it into space.

107
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
With these two,

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,600
it was man walking on the moon.

109
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,600
They really are that important.

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

111
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,480
Sorry. What? No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

112
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,120
Woah, woah, woah. Did you...

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,960
Did you say it was pointless     
to decide which of these was best?

114
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,240
Yeah. Well, it IS pointless. Well,    
apart from the fact that the 959 is

115
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,840
neither here nor there and the F40 is probably 
the greatest car ever built in human history.

116
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,440
No, look, if I'm honest I prefer the F40 as well, 
but we mustn't forget the 959 WAS important

117
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,880
because it set the trend for computers and sensors 
that modern supercars have followed ever since.

118
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,520
Yes, and I wish they hadn't.

119
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,560
I wish they'd all followed 
the route set by the F40 -

120
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,600
it's a twin turbocharged V8 go-kart, it's just 
very simple. It's better. I know what you mean,

121
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,320
it's analogue versus digital. It is.

122
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,320
But anyway, we must now find out     
how fast they go round our track.

123
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,960
The owners must be insane to let us 
do this. Of course. [LAUGHTER]]

124
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,440
Handing them over 
to our tame racing driver.

125
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,320
Some say that his favourite disease- he had 
when he was a child was gout. [LAUGHTER]

126
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,840
And that he was very surprised     
this week when he was able to

127
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,040
pick up some remarkably cheap    
tickets for the Bahrain Grand Prix.

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,720
All we know is he's called the Stig!    
[CHEERING]

129
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
And he's...

130
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,760
not going anywhere.

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,600
He is obviously... There's something 
wrong there. Oh, dear, yes.

132
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,400
[LAUGHTER] There's something VERY wrong. 
What the Hell's happened there?

133
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,680
And across the line and into the garage!    
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

134
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,040
That's not good. It's awkward. You see? You see?

135
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,640
I know what you're going to say...

136
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,160
Let me say it anyway. The Ferrari is- fragile, that's why 
I like Porsche, because they may not be as exciting

137
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,640
to look at, but they are durable and 
tough, and that wins in the end.

138
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes, yes, yes. All right. Come on, 
let's have a look at how the 959 got on.

139
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,920
And, yes, that one 
is actually going.

140
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
It is incredible how soft 
it looks as it rocks about.

141
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,040
Also looks rather old-fashioned       
and, I must say, very slow.

142
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,320
He's got a problem in there, 
he must have.

143
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,960
Here's Chicago.

144
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
That's an even bigger problem,          
that is.

145
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,520
Oh!

146
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
So what had gone wrong?

147
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,640
What happened? Well, apparently...

148
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,800
yes, I've just heard        
that the turbos let go.

149
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,200
So that had no boost, that lost its seal, 
so what we've got here for the first time ever

150
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,080
is a DNF - a did not finish and 
a DNS did not start. Yeah.

151
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
 [LAUGHTER]

152
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,720
Right, and now the news.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,400
And the Bahrain Grand Prix, because it's been 
cancelled, well this is a bit of an issue, because...?

154
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,280
It was supposed to be the first
race of the season. Yeah.

155
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,120
So are they going to replace it with 
something else, just going to forget about it?

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,520
Well, they can hardly stage it in 
Tunisia, can they? Maybe Egypt?

157
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Wait, wait, wait.    
Why don't we offer them our track?

158
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

159
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,560
Really, why can't we hold it here? It makes 
sense. Most F1 teams are UK-based,

160
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,240
So it's convenient.

161
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
And catering, we've got that caravan 
next to the security hut. Yes.

162
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,240
And if it rains, there is 
the security hut itself.

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,720
Were you all able to park easily today? 
[ALL: YES] Oh, mate, F1 here.

164
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,560
Plus, Bahrain, incredibly boring track.

165
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,800
You can crash off for miles on those 
run-off areas and not actually hit anything.

166
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,520
Whereas here, we could offer the prestigious 
opportunity to crash into an old Boeing 747.

167
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,080
Hang on a minute, though.

168
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,080
Isn't our track a figure of eight?

169
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,640
Yes, it is! That makes it even better! 
Imagine, you're in an F1 car, you'd be flat out

170
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,880
towards follow-through. About 
to go right, and then there'd be

171
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,440
another F1 car coming the other way 
about to go left towards Chicago.

172
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,480
Your closing speed is about 
350 miles an hour.

173
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,360
I think... I think the 
most common phrase

174
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,520
we'd hear from the commentary team    
would be, "Tumbling end over end."

175
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,840
Anyway, Bernie, if you like this
idea or want to take us up on it,

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,440
write to us at: "Well, you've got 
more viewers than us anyway."

177
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,360
Now, anyone here from London?

178
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,120
[AUDIENCE: YES] Right. You're 
all familiar with the Westway?

179
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
It's a big snaking ribbon 
of tarmac that scythes

180
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,640
into the centre of the city,

181
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,320
the idea being it gets you in as quickly as 
possible and out as quickly as possible.

182
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
For many years it had a 50-mile-an-hour 
speed limit, which is too low,

183
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
but they've decided this week to 
lower it to 30. 30 miles an hour!

184
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,000
I tried driving down there            
earlier this week

185
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,080
at 30 miles an hour, I damn nearly caused 
27 accidents. A little girl on a scooter,

186
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,960
she was like, 
"What are you doing, you idiot?!"

187
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,840
Isn't it a temporary speed limit while they do some 
works underneath the bridge bit or something?

188
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,480
Yes. But when they introduced the 70-mile-an-hour
limit on all British motorways in 1965,

189
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,040
they said then that was temporary.        
Here we are 46 years later,

190
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,800
we've still got it.

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,840
Speed limits are like herpes.

192
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Are they? Yeah, you get them, you never 
get rid of them. Forever.-[LAUGHTER]

193
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,760
It doesn't look... Why is that man 
nodding and going, "I know, yeah"?

194
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,720
I've got speed limits!

195
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,560
This road, OK, is run by 
Boris Johnson, yes?

196
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,920
Boris Johnson wrote a piece in Her 
Majesty's Daily Telegraph last week

197
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,000
in which he said he didn't want to be 
forced to wear a helmet while skiing

198
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,440
because as an individual he should   
be allowed to make up his own mind,

199
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,680
and he doesn't want governments 
telling him what to do.

200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
[HE CLEARS THROAT]
Boris...

201
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,960
I give you that. 
It is weird, isn't it?

202
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,840
We all think of Boris Johnson as being cuddly 
and affable and having slightly funny hair,

203
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,840
but history will remember       
him as Boris the Oppressor.

204
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,680
He is. Boris is a Russian name,

205
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,320
and this is a Russian thing to do.           
But listen, Boris,

206
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,000
when whatever it is you're doing     
under that bridge is finished,

207
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
I want to see that 30 limit gone.

208
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,080
A serious point if I may,   
last year we showed you a tribute

209
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,920
to Ayrton Senna on Top Gear,         
a little film we made.

210
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,360
Now there's a much longer one come out, 
90 minutes, an incredible documentary.

211
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
This is completely unmissable.

212
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
I've got a clip for you here,   
I want you to have a look at this.

213
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,040
He will be ranked       
among the all-time greats.

214
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,640
Ayrton has a small problem, 
he thinks that he can't kill himself.

215
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,640
And I think that's very dangerous.

216
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,200
We are competing to win.

217
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,680
And if you no longer go for a gap,    
you are no longer a racing driver.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
Senna is trying      
to go through on the inside!

219
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,680
I was treated like a criminal.

220
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,680
The best decision is MY decision.

221
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,680
Walking away from the dark forces    
just doesn't become an option.

222
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,960
I was not going to give up.

223
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,600
Real racing, that makes me happy.

224
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,040
There's footage in that you just    
can't believe. I've got goosebumps.

225
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,840
It's unbelievable.     
It's just won an award, actually,

226
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,000
at the Sundance Film Festival, as best documentary, 
and I'm really not surprised. It's out in June.

227
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,600
If you've got any heart, any soul at all, 
you've got to go and see it, it's fantastic.

228
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,640
Anyway, moving on...

229
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,520
Yes, BMW has launched a whole sort of eco 
flavour of cars beginning with the letter "I".

230
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,680
They've got two so far, the i3 and the i8. Do you 
want to see a picture of them? Here they are.

231
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,440
Very difficult to see out of.  
Or get in.

232
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,080
That's not going to work, is it?! 
What is this current obsession

233
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,160
with putting "I" in front of things and 
believing that makes them special?

234
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
It started with the iPod, yeah, 
fair enough.

235
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,200
But we are going to have an 
iSandwich and iShoes.

236
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,520
I don't want an iInfection. No.     
I don't want one of THOSE, though.

237
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah. Oh, now, listen, Chrysler is going 
to launch this little L11,000 car in Britain,

238
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,080
and the first thing you need to 
know about it is it isn't a Chrysler.

239
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,880
What it is, OK, what happens is... 
Here's the story.

240
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
Fiat make the 500, OK?

241
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,600
They then give that to Lancia, who make 
it a bit longer and add two rear doors,

242
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,480
then Lancia give that to Chrysler,     
who take the Lancia badges off,

243
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,360
put Chrysler ones on and they're      
going to sell it in Britain.

244
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,040
So Fiat have gone as far as recycling their 
cars before they've even sold them? Yes.

245
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,640
It's not a car at all, it's kind 
of an archaeological dig.

246
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,760
You scratch away at the pads

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,960
then underneath you discover, "Yes, it was a Lancia."
Then you go a bit further, you'll find it was a Fiat.

248
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,000
Not just a Fiat 500, because if you actually 
keep going, you'll find it's a Fiat Panda,

249
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,080
which is effectively what it is. Dig a bit further and 
you'll find a load of coins and a bronze helmet.

250
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,720
The Piltdown Man is in         
the glove box of that car.

251
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
Let's make it go away,         
because, more importantly,

252
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,680
Aston Martin, have launched a new      
car this week called the Virage.

253
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,640
The idea is fits between the quite soft and 
comfy DB9 and the much more expensive DBS.

254
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,120
Fantastic looking thing.

255
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,400
What is there to say? It's going to cost, apparently, 
around L150,000, V12 engine, absolutely perfect.

256
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,720
Just one thing - underneath,        
of course, it is a Fiat 500.

257
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,280
Cos everything is.           
Because everything is.

258
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,520
Now, round about 20 years ago,    
Peugeot made the momentous decision

259
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,720
to stop making nice cars and make instead 
NOT very nice cars for elderly people.

260
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,400
Yes, but now they've had another change of heart, 
and they've come up with this. It's called the EX1.

261
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,440
It's a twin-engined four-wheel 
drive electric roadster, and it's...

262
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,040
Well, the main purpose of it, really, 
Hammond, is to break records.

263
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,000
Rather like myself, actually. 
Really? Yeah. Anyway,

264
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,760
look at this. You open the door,      
but when you do you also get...

265
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,520
A broken wrist?  [LAUGHTER]

266
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,960
No, you also get...         
look, you get the seat.

267
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,840
Oh, wow!    The seat is 
part of the climb in.

268
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,240
Half the car comes with it, so I'm actually 
getting into the door's pocket now

269
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,080
with all, like, the crisp packets and the 
change? Feet up, get your feet right up.

270
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,360
I put my feet in there? Yeah, 
and then... Oh, yes! Look at this!

271
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,240
Hey, that steering wheel is very 
Batman. It does all that and that.

272
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,480
And that's where the instruments 
are up on those two screens.

273
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,440
That's fantastic, look!

274
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,800
I have to say, for a Peugeot, especially, 
it looks absolutely fantastic. It's very funky...

275
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Look at his face! It's very 
funky and very modern,

276
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,080
and you can expect to see this in    
your local Peugeot dealership...

277
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,560
never.

278
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,400
Moving on, with one of the most    
ambitious races we've ever staged.

279
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,840
As the sun sets,      
I will start from here,

280
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,480
Land's End,     
Britain's most westerly point,

281
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,200
and I will attempt to get to here

282
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,560
in Lowestoft,     
Britain's most easterly point,

283
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,200
before it rises again.

284
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,040
Now, to make this especially hard,    
I was made to do the race on

285
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,520
Midsummer's Day,    
during the shortest night we had.

286
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,760
This is a big one.

287
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,440
Space is a never-ending race track.

288
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,200
The thermal shock region on the prow 
of our Solar System, for example,

289
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,000
is screaming through 
the heavens at 490,000 mph.

290
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,080
Earth is hurtling round the 
sun at 67,000 mph.

291
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,120
God, it seems, 
is a complete speed freak.

292
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:06,880
God, it seems, 
is a complete speed freak.

293
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:06,920
The supercharged V it is

294
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:06,960
The supercharged V it is fast

295
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:29,400
The supercharged V it is fast and

296
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Stopwatch. This is it, then. We

297
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,840
Stopwatch. This is it, then. We are

298
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,040
Stopwatch. This is it, then. 
We are Sunday-night

299
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
Sunday-night delegation,

300
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,400
Sunday-night delegation, at

301
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,240
Sunday-night delegation, at big

302
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,440
Sunday-night delegation, 
at big Jaguar

303
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:32,640
Jaguar verses

304
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,680
Jaguar verses God.

305
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:34,880
Jaguar verses God. It

306
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,080
Jaguar verses God. It is

307
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,720
Jaguar verses God. It is like

308
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:35,960
Jaguar verses God. 
It is like songs

309

The sun will

360
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,400
will rise

361
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,360
will rise over

362
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,600

363
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,800
will rise over East Anglia

364
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,000
will rise over East Anglia at

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
will rise over East Anglia at 4:30am.

366
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:09,800
4:30am. That

367
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,440
4:30am. That gives

368
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,520
4:30am. That gives me

369
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:10,720
4:30am. That gives me at

370
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
4:30am. That gives me at six

371
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,680
4:30am. That gives me 
at six hours

372
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,880
4:30am. That gives me 
at six hours  and

373
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,080
and 54

374
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,320

and 54 minutes to do 432 miles.

379
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,640
and 54 minutes to do 432 miles. That

380
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,600
That means

381
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,800
That means averaging

382
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,400
That means averaging 62

383
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,640
That means averaging 62 miles

384
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,800
That means averaging 62 miles an

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,640
That means averaging
62 miles an hour.

litre V 12 in an Aston Martin Raff

496

litre V 12 in an 
Aston Martin Raff peak.

497
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,440
peak. It

498
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,720
peak. It is

499
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,200
peak. It is unhinged

500
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,840
peak. It is unhinged performance,

501
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,040
peak. It is unhinged 
performance, that

502
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,240
that is

503
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,440
that is what

504
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,680
that is what this

505
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,880
that is what this is.

506
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,080
that is what this is. I

507
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,880
that is what this is. I am

508
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,080
that is what this is. I am going

509
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,880
that is what this is. 
I am going to

510
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,080
that is what this is. 
I am going to thrash

511
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,960
thrash God.

512
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
thrash God. But

513
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,000
thrash God. But then

514
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,200
thrash God. But then he

515
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,400
thrash God. But then he enlisted

516
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,000
thrash God. But then 
he enlisted the

517
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,200
the services

518
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,400
the services of

519
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,040
the services of an

520
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,240
the services of an unusual

521
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,560
the services of an unusual ally.

522
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,800
the services of an unusual ally. The

523
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,080
The devil's

524
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,360
The devil's work!

525
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,160
The devil's work! The

526
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,360
The devil's work! The cones

527
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,560
The devil's work! The cones went

528
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:02,800
The devil's work! 
The cones went on

529
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,760
The devil's work! 
The cones went on for

530
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:03,960
for miles

531
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,040
for miles and

532
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,320
for miles and my

533
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,000
for miles and my average

534
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,160
for miles and my average speed

535
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
for miles and my average 
speed collapsed.

536
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,600
collapsed. I

537
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:06,640
collapsed. I am

538
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,040
collapsed. I am in

539
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,240
collapsed. I am in Cornwall

540
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,640
collapsed. I am in Cornwall at

541
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:07,840
collapsed. I am in 
Cornwall at doing

542
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,040
doing 50

543
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,200
doing 50 miles

544
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,680
doing 50 miles an

545
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
doing 50 miles an hour.

546
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:12,720
doing 50 miles an hour. This

547
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:12,920
doing 50 miles an hour. 
This son

548
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,520
doing 50 miles an hour. 
This son has

549
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,920
has already

550
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,120
has already risen

551
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,360
has already risen in

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,440
has already risen in his

553
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,160
has already risen in his Sydney.

554
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,200
has already risen in his Sydney. God

555
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,480
God was

556
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
God was winning.

557
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,000
God was winning. Which

558
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,040
God was winning. Which meant

559
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
God was winning. Which meant that

560
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,240
God was winning. 
Which meant that when

561
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,520
when the

562
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,840
when the road

563
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,120
when the road works

564
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,360
when the road works finished,

565
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,640
when the road works 
finished, I needed

566
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,120
needed to

567
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,880
needed to get

568
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:22,960
needed to get my

569
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,240
needed to get my foot

570
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,640
needed to get my foot down.

571
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,840
needed to get my foot down. 
Make

572
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:25,920
needed to get my foot down. 
Make it

573
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,360
needed to get my foot down. 
Make it so.

574
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:33,840
This

575
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,040
This is

576
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,240
This is quick

577
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,760
This is quick car,

578
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:34,840
This is quick car, but

579
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,240
This is quick car, but there

580
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,480
This is quick car, but there is

581
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:35,680
This is quick car, 
but there is a

582
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,480
This is quick car, 
but there is a bit

583
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:36,680
bit more

584
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:36,880
bit more to

585
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,800
bit more to it

586
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,080
bit more to it than

587
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,320
bit more to it than raw

588
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
bit more to it than raw speed.

589
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,840
bit more to it than raw speed. Sitting

590
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:39,920
Sitting in

591
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,120
Sitting in an

592
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,800
Sitting in an old

593
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,960
Sitting in an old Jaguar,

594
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,200
Sitting in an old Jaguar, even

595
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,520
Sitting in an old Jaguar, 
even the

596
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:43,720
Sitting in an old Jaguar, 
even the last

597
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,000
last one,

598
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,400
last one, was

599
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,160
last one, was like

600
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,200
last one, was like sitting

601
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,400
last one, was like sitting in

602
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,760
last one, was like sitting in a

603
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:45,960
last one, was like 
sitting in a country

604
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
country pub.

605
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,040
country pub. You

606
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
country pub. You were

607
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
country pub. 
You were cramps,

608
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,520
country pub. You were cramps, 
but

609
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,720
country pub. You were cramps, 
but this

610
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:52,920
this one,

611
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,200
this one, with

612
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,320
this one, with the

613
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,480
this one, with the blue

614
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,760
this one, with the blue lighting,

615
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,360
they have

616
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,560
they have even

617
00:24:59,560 --> 00:24:59,800
they have even lined

618
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,040
they have even lined this

619
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,080
they have even lined 
this cubbyhole

620
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,360
they have even lined
this cubbyhole and

621
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,920
and glove

622
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,480
and glove box

623
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,680
and glove box with

624
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:02,840
and glove box with purple

625
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,760
and glove box with purple velvet!

626
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,000
and glove box with purple velvet! That

627
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,600
That is

628
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,120
That is like

629
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,320
That is like lifting

630
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,520
That is like lifting up

631
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:05,720
That is like lifting up the

632
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:05,960
That is like lifting up the Queen's

633
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,200
That is like lifting up the 
Queen's Guard

634
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,040
Guard and

635
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,320
Guard and finding

636
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,560
Guard and finding she

637
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:07,760
Guard and finding she is

638
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:07,840
Guard and finding she is wearing

639
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,120
Guard and finding she is wearing a

640
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,760
Guard and finding she is 
wearing a thong!

641
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,440
There are other thoughtful 
touches, too.

642
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,120
Oh-h-h-h, yes. Hard.

643
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Oh, yeah. Lower, lower

644
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
There, there, there!

645
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,360
Yes, as I'm sure you realised,    
that's the seat massager at work.

646
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,960
It's, like, kneading me...

647
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,160
and all that. In the seat!

648
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,760
Then there's the stereo system.

649
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,280
In the last Jag, you got a    
gramophone with a dog sitting on it,

650
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,360
but in this, I've got 1,200 watts

651
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,840
and it will play anything. Anything.

652
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,480
You just....

653
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,840
you push, you push...

654
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
that.

655
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
And... er...

656
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,640
By the time I realised I didn't understand 
iPod connectivity, the sun was over Thailand.

657
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,280
And I was facing a decision made by 
thousands of holidaymakers every summer -

658
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,320
M5 and M4, or A303 past Stonehenge?

659
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:25,200
The motorway is 20 miles further, but 
probably better for fuel consumption.

660
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,560
But the A303 is more 
fun in a car like this.

661
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah, A303 it is!

662
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
This was a good call.

663
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,280
There's a whiff of NASCAR
about this car.

664
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,200
And now I'm going to give it a bit more, 
because I'm going to engage Dynamic Mode.

665
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
Look - the dials glow red.

666
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,320
What this does is firms 
everything up, gives you more punch.

667
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,240
And also, because the XJ    
is made entirely from aluminium,

668
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,960
it's much lighter         
than any other big car.

669
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,280
It feels like a sports car.

670
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,560
On good roads like these,

671
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
it's not far short of a masterpiece.

672
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,480
And because it has an active    
differential, you can do a slider.

673
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,360
The Jag set about          
chewing up the miles.

674
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,000
Druids!

675
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,640
By 1:45am, I figured I was   
in the lead, but I'd reach the M3.

676
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,160
Which was boring. So I decided     
to let the car drive itself.

677
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,840
Right, cruise control on.         
Very good system, this.

678
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,440
Set the speed at 70, and the road    
ahead is scanned by microwaves.

679
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,520
I'm going to hook on to the back    
of our camera car - there we go -

680
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,520
so now, if he speeds up, I speed if he slows down, 
I slow down. I don't have to do anything.up,

681
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,040
I can even choose what sort    
of distance I want to follow it at.

682
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,960
There's the safe distance there,      
right down to the full Audi.

683
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,040
Yes! There we are, that's the 
Audi following distance!

684
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
It was now late.

685
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,000
The motorway was monotonous and my 
thoughts turned to the business of staying sharp.

686
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,640
The production team, as usual, 
has provided me with a CD

687
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,120
to keep me awake on this long,     
perilous and difficult voyage.

688
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,400
'And it was while working at Radio 
Lancashire that I experienced a revelation.

689
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,880
'I took over as producer and presenter 
of the weekend mid-morning shows.

690
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,520
'I recorded on...

691
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,160
'..carol concerts, jumble sales...'

692
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,920
Hammond's adventures     
in local radio weren't helping.

693
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,640
'..record-breaking attempt, 
and sponsored swim.'

694
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,080
But soon, something else did.

695
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,520
Ooh, the fuel warning light is on!

696
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,200
INDISTINCT COMMENT

697
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,960
No!

698
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,120
A splash and dash pitstop         
cost precious moments.

699
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,000
Here we go. And then Beezlebub      
decided to cost me even more.

700
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,960
Oh, no, no...

701
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,320
This is exactly the sort      
of hold up I can do without.

702
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,160
Is anyone going to be working 
on them? I mean, really!

703
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,960
So, you have to drive along 
at 50 miles an hour, glaring at the

704
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,880
speedometer, not looking at the    
road ahead. That's very dangerous.

705
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,040
It raises money for the government,
 but it's very dangerous.

706
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,440
By the time the roadworks finished,
God was back in the lead.

707
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,320
He was now just over        
one hour from Lowestoft.

708
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,400
65 miles to go, and I would say   
that the inky blackness of night...

709
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,400
..has become sort of royal blue.

710
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,680
I don't suppose the sun        
would be early, would it?

711
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,320
Would it do that?

712
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,360
There is a smudge        
in the sky, a big one.

713
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,720
The mother of fire,       
it seems, is coming back.

714
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,160
That is daylight.

715
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,840
I have...

716
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
..39 minutes.

717
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,640
There were still 34 miles to go, but win or lose, 
I was glad I'd done this race in the Jag.

718
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,840
An S Class...

719
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,280
may be a comparable limo to this,

720
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,200
but an S Class doesn't go           
and stop and steer

721
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,600
anything like as well as this.

722
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,880
If you're a keen driver,

723
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,480
this is the only big car 
you can have.

724
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,000
The sun was now over Amsterdam

725
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,040
and would appear in Suffolk           
in just 12 minutes.

726
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,080
Come on, come on.

727
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,360
4.9 miles.

728
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,080
Right, where is..

729
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,480
England's most easterly spot?

730
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,640
Come on, I'm lost!

731
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,480
No-o-o

732
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,720
red light now!

733
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,400
Come on!

734
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
This is it!

735
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,120
HE LAUGHS

736
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,240
Loser!

737
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,360
I may be the first person     
in history to call God a loser!

738
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,040
Here, let me just get this right.

739
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,760
It drives like a sports car?

740
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,520
Yes, very like. It just feels       
so light, it's incredible.

741
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,840
It's about L20,000 less than the 
equivalent Mercedes S Class.

742
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,600
Yep, the S63, definitely.

743
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,200
And it's faster than the Lord God Almighty? 
Yes, it is, just, by about five minutes.

744
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,240
But do you know what? I'm just not sure its 
the looks. I know. That's why we filmed it at night.

745
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,560
What makes it doubly annoying is that Bertolli, 
which is not Italy's most successful styling house,

746
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,000
recently did the concept of what they think 
Jaguars of the future should look like.

747
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,240
That's why we've got a television      
here, so you can have a look.

748
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,080
This is just spectacular,             
from any angle.

749
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,480
That is absolutely glorious.

750
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,160
Am I right in thinking that's got suicide doors?

751
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,240
Yes, it has - they open this way.

752
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,240
Now, this is an absolutely fantastic car

753
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,400
and I just think if it looked like    
that, it would be the best car ever.

754
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,160
Absolutely ever.

755
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,920
Anyway, isn't it time you put a star- 
in our reasonably priced car? Yes.

756
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm sort of delaying it, really.

757
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,320
Last week we had a very       
intelligent, beautiful...

758
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,280
lesbian...

759
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,880
muscle car enthusiast.

760
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,080
This week we've got      
the exact opposite of that.

761
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,400
Ladies and gentlemen, make some    
noises, please, for John Prescott.

762
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,720
CHEERING

763
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Expected.

764
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,000
I knew they'd do that.

765
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,040
Lord John Prescott.

766
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Thanks for those that cheered.

767
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,400
And those that booed,     
well, you know what you can do.

768
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,600
I don't know where to start with you.   
[JOHN LAUGHS]

769
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,800
I was wondering about that.           
So many questions.

770
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,920
I think the one     
that raises to the surface is,

771
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,160
what in the name of all that's holy

772
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,480
were you thinking when you said,

773
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,280
"Let's put a bus lane on the M4."

774
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm glad you've said that.

775
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,200
Jeremy, I'm going to introduce 
you to a revolutionary thought -

776
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,520
you can go slower         
and get there quicker.

777
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,400
That's to do with flow.

778
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,920
As soon as you made it two lane and brought it 
from 70 to 50, they got there quicker, actually.

779
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,200
Cars as well. That's not possible. Don't take my 
word. Take the independent transport research.

780
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,320
It meant that the flow of the traffic was better. 
There were less accidents, less deaths.

781
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,440
I think that's an important factor. You 
just want to speed everywhere, right?

782
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,920
In reality, what we've seen is the deaths 
of children and deaths of adults...

783
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,040
There aren't any children on the 
M4 bus lane! It's a motorway!

784
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,000
There are no schools there.

785
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,840
I used to be able to drive into London 
on three lanes. You made it two.

786
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
Yes. You put a speed camera,            
you made it 50.

787
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,480
That was daft. And it meant that       
the flow of the traffic was

788
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,400
better because people aren't 
rushing to the two lane from three.

789
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,360
I've heard motorists cheering here, but don't you 
get annoyed when someone wants to push in,

790
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,400
when you've done        your three and your two?

791
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,680
How many people get annoyed at when they come 
down to three, come down to two? Public meeting!

792
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,960
Put your hands up! 
There you are. John...

793
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,680
bloody well sit down! Sit down.

794
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,920
They're cheering for me, not you!

795
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,480
All right, fair enough.

796
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,680
Fair enough. Let me ask you this.

797
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,880
If you believe that narrowing    
a motorway causes the traffic flow

798
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,760
to be improved, why did you widen       
the M25 and the M1? Well...

799
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,120
[HE STAMMERS, CHEERING]

800
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,320
Why did you do that?

801
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,000
Why didn't you narrow them?

802
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,040
If this is going       
to be a public meeting...!

803
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,320
Listen, from 1997,         
when we came in, right,

804
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,480
you guys in the public     
bought seven million more cars.

805
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,240
Now, if you look at the congestion,-     
seven million more cars. Right?

806
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,720
You didn't get rid of the second    
car, did you? You passed it down.

807
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,760
So what is happening, the growth       
in cars on the motorway...    [AUDIENCE JEERS]

808
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,440
That's the reality! John!

809
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
You don't want to face 
the facts, do you?

810
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,280
I knew I'd get that        
from you ruddy motorists!

811
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,000
In 1997, YOU said that if there    
weren't fewer cars on the roads,

812
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,720
more people using buses by the time you finished 
in five years, you could be judged a failure.

813
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,520
I didn't say that.

814
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,920
You read it.

815
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,280
I know what I said, let me tell 
What did you say?you.

816
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,320
If I don't get more people         
using public transport,

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,920
and using their motor vehicles    
that's what I said.less,

818
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,360
But there are more people on trains now, 
more on buses, right? That was achieved.

819
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,000
But there are more people on trains now, 
more on buses, right? That was achieved.

820
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,240
What I didn't recognise, you 
bought seven million new cars!

821
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,040
That was because of the prosperity we brought 
you under Labour. You bankrupted the country!

822
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,480
You damn nearly bankrupt us! You 
won't get it from this outfit, be sure of it.

823
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,600
When somebody came to you one day and said that 
there was a problem with the environment and that man

824
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,800
was creating some carbon-dioxide, which was 
getting stuck in the upper atmosphere and this

825
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,640
was going to cause           
the world to melt,

826
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,240
you decided the best thing you      
could do is fly to the Maldives?

827
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,720
To go on a diving trip.             
No, I didn't.

828
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,040
I went to the Maldives, I was    
doing the negotiations at Kyoto.

829
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,440
There's no way you can bike there. 
No, but the Maldives isn't... Hang on.

Just try to understand what you've got here.
Kyoto's in Japan - it's not in the Maldives!

831
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,560
Hang on, just give       
your bloody brain a chance!

832
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,000
I went to the Maldives,          
on the way to India.

833
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,880
I went to dive on the coral reefs.

834
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,000
I was arguing that       
what was happening is that

835
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,400
these coral reefs were being blanched and 
dying because the water was getting warm.

836
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,600
I wanted to bring home to people,      
look what is happening here.

837
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,560
People didn't accept it in 1997.    
Why can't you do that from Hull?

838
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,320
Why did you need           
to go to the Maldives?

839
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,680
Because that's where you get... 
At taxpayers' expense of 6,500 quid?

840
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,880
You've sent me to Kyoto, I'm on the way back 
by India. I negotiate with the Indian government.

841
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,680
I go via the Maldives and dive to look at the 
huge range of coral reef they've got there.

842
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,960
So, why did you then            
go to Sri Lanka?

843
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Sri Lanka was the stop-off for the    
plane. I didn't go to Sri Lanka.

844
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,880
I thought you looked at tigers      
there? No, that was in India.

845
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,720
You looked at tigers       
and then you went diving...

846
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,720
They asked me to join the Save the Tiger campaign 
when I was there on the environment negotiations.

847
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,240
Listen,     the tigers are a real problem.

848
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,840
The thing is, John, we know this. We have David 
Attenborough to say, "Tiger numbers are dropping fast."

849
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,560
We read this     
in the newspapers all the time.

850
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,320
We don't need to go to India.   
Presumably they showed you a tiger?

851
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,040
If they'd have showed you an empty   
wood and went, "Look, no tigers..."

852
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
It's all right them cheering    
and shouting at your clever remark,

853
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,120
but basically... [LAUGHTER]

854
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,360
How many...? They like that.    
[CHEERING DROWNS COMMENT]

855
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,000
Sit...down.

856
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,480
Because, can you understand,     
honestly, can you understand

857
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,280
why a man threw an egg at you?

858
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,240
Do know why he did    
and what he was concerned about?

859
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,640
I was against fox-hunting        
and he thought I was one

860
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,120
of the guys that he hates because     
he wanted to keep fox hunting.

861
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,640
But wait a minute when I got pied,            
because I understand

862
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,680
that I am very lucky to have this         
forum come here every week

863
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,480
on Top Gear and I say things          
and I understand that if

864
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,160
someone sitting at home and    
violently disagrees with what I say

865
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,800
it is really annoying and this girl     
shoved a banoffee pie in my face.

866
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,440
I just went "good shot"            
and you punched him.

867
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:45,320
But don't you understand that as a politician 
you had 13 years of doing what you want.

868
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,240
I am subjected to what they call     
a vote. If they agree or disagree.

869
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,440
Nevertheless, you had all of these years 
when you were allowed to do what you want

870
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,800
and you must have known there were      
people at home sitting thinking,

871
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,680
"I wish they'd stop doing it?"        
Did you not understand that?

872
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,360
Let me say, when I walked past this    
guy and he hits me with the egg,

873
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,040
right, I don't know it's an egg, I just feel this 
very warm thing running down my neck.

874
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,840
I just think somebody has perhaps knifed me or 
assaulted me, that all happens in a split second.

875
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,600
And I see this fella built like a bloody 
barn door and I turned and I reacted.

876
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,040
When Tony asked me what happened, 
I said I was carrying out his orders.

877
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
He told us to connect with         
the electorate, so I did.

878
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,400
[LAUGHTER]

879
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:03,800
I had

880
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,080
I had one

881
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,160
I had one house

882
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,400
I had one house a

883
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,920
I had one house a home,

884
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,160
I had one house a home, and

885
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,360
I had one house a home, 
and one

886
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,040
I had one house a home, 
and one car.

887
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,240
I had one house a home, 
and one car. I

888
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,080
I still

889
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,160
I still only

890
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,400
I still only have

891
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:09,640
I still only have one

892
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,120
I still only have one car.

893
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,320
I still only have one car. Does

894
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,120
Does anybody

895
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,320
Does anybody here

896
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:13,520
Does anybody here have

897
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:13,680
Does anybody here have a

898
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:13,960
Does anybody here 
have a company

899
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,440
Does anybody here 
have a company car?

900
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,560
car? So

901
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:15,760
car? So how

902
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:15,960
car? So how many

903
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,200
car? So how many cars

904
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,360
car? So how many cars have

905
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,480
car? So how many cars have you

906
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,320
car? So how many cars have you got?

907
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,560
car? So how many cars have you got? No,

908
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,040
No, none

909
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,240
No, none is

910
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,440
No, none is the

911
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,280
No, none is the answer.

912
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
No, none is the answer. 
Anywhere,

913
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:23,920
No, none is the answer. 
Anywhere,    you

914
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,200
you are

915
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,280
you are a

916
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,520
you are a Jaguar

917
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,000
you are a Jaguar man.

918
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,240
you are a Jaguar man. I

919
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,760
you are a Jaguar man. I have

920
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:28,960
you are a Jaguar man. 
I have had

921
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,040
you are a Jaguar man. 
I have had 11

922
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,160
you are a Jaguar man. 
I have had 11  Jags.

923
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,960
Jags. I

924
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,240
Jags. I made

925
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,440
Jags. I made an

926
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:34,640
Jags. I made an attempt

927
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,360
Jags. I made an attempt to

928
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,240
Jags. I made an attempt 
to go

929
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,280
Jags. I made an attempt 
to go to

930
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,520
Jags. I made an attempt 
to go to a

931
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:36,800
Jags. I made an attempt 
to go to a Rover

932
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,640
Rover wants.

933
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,240
Rover wants. I

934
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,480
Rover wants. I admired

935
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,720
Rover wants. I admired their

936
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,320
Rover wants. I admired their    
engineering.

937
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
That was the problem in those days.

938
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,200
Right, your lap,

939
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,480
how was it?

940
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,880
I was a bit worried, I thought I was skiing 
rather than driving. It was a wet day.

941
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,240
The car, I must say, was really 
impressive as it got into the speeds

942
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,360
and into the corners, but I was a bit 
worried about the puddles, the water.

943
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,880
When I got confident, I enjoyed it.

944
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,720
Who would like to see         
Lord John Prescott's lap?

945
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Yes!

946
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,520
Here we go, let's have a look.

947
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,960
Bet you look good in a helmet.

948
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,240
Oh, you don't. I am away.

949
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,320
Are you in automatic or manual?

950
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,560
Automatic. It will be slower.

951
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,720
Whoa, there she goes.

952
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,080
Right, through the tyres.    
There we go. That is soaking wet.

953
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,160
Yes, that was a bit fearful.   
It's not a bad little car, though.

954
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,640
This is really the one.

955
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,720
This is where we had to put cones out for you 
because you couldn't see the white lines.

956
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,200
Yep, there are the cones       
to show you where to go.

957
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,320
I can see why you made it          
a 50 limit on the M4.

958
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,360
You are allowed to go     
faster than that on our track.

959
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,960
Right, did you lift off?

960
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,240
You did lift off. I had my 
foot on the break then.

961
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,960
It is hard to say how fast you are    
going, it looks like a canal boat.

962
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,600
Here we are coming up to       
the second to last corner.

963
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,560
It is a nice line in that.

964
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,440
Very smooth, very well done.

965
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,040
And Gambon got it right this time.    
Ooh, little bit of tail coming out.

966
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,520
Nicely held and there we are,           
across the line.

967
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,640
APPLAUSE

968
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,560
Where do you think you've come on   
this magnificent board? Bottom.

969
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,920
Bottom?

970
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,040
So, you're not even going to try and 
get on to Alastair Campbell, 1.47.

971
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,480
It would be great to have beat him.

972
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,360
No, you haven't.

973
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,280
Well, John Prescott, you did it     
in... What is the slowest time?

974
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,040
1.53.7, effectively.

975
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,680
You did it in one...

976
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,560
56.7.

977
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,840
Which is by far and away the    
slowest lap time we have ever had.

978
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
APPLAUSE

979
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,320
It is amazing. Well, now...

980
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,440
it has been very interesting...

981
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,920
having you here today.         
I'm very glad you came.

982
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,240
It is something      
I thought would never happen

983
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,360
and I think you are very brave to     
come into in front of, what is,

984
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,240
let's be honest, an audience    
that's on my side, rightly so.

985
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,560
Ladies and gentlemen, 
John Prescott.

986
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,560
APPLAUSE

987
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Jezza versus Prezza, I like it.

988
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,680
I thought it would be an actual fight.

989
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,920
Right, now, important moment 
because, for the first time,

990
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,000
I think, in two years, we are 
going to do the Cool Wall!

991
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,600
CHEERING

992
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,800
Look, here it is.

993
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,600
And straight away, we can see that      
currents have blown certain BMWs

994
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,440
right up here into           
super cool, sub-zero.

995
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,520
Things like the Z4, the M3, the one series, 
the five series. Not all Beamers, though.

996
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,360
This one, the five series GT     
is down among the Audis. Uncool.

997
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,360
That is a horrible thing. 
It is like a fat old auntie,

998
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,800
the one with terrible embarrassing
flatulence that nobody dares mention.

999
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,520
Called Marjorie.

1000
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,240
Other changes.

1001
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,000
Down here, a clutch of superminis, the 
actual Mini, Fiat 500, the Citroen DS3.

1002
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,880
These are all inexpensive ways of 
looking seriously cool. Good cars.

1003
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Now, what do you make of this?     
This is called the Nissan Juke.

1004
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,600
What is interesting, you buy a car because you 
want something which is practical or cheap.

1005
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,480
Or you want something fast.      
How many people do you know say,

1006
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,120
"I want to buy a car that           
is absolutely stupid?"

1007
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,080
Because that's what this is. Do you not agree
that is the stupidest thing in the world?

1008
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,840
It is ugly. It is ugly.

1009
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,280
There is a chap back here,            
you know your hat...

1010
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1011
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,960
You obviously like            
to go out in public

1012
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,800
looking ridiculous.

1013
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,880
Do you like the Nissan Juke?

1014
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,400
I don't mind it. 
What do you drive? A Golf.

1015
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,760
Not a diesel? It is a diesel, yes.

1016
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,760
You would look like that       
and you've got a Golf diesel?

1017
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,800
That is fantastic.

1018
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,840
A blend of many things going       
on there in that man's hat.

1019
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,720
This is a hideously uncool car so it goes 
down there. What have you got there?

1020
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,160
This is the Renault Wind. A couple 
of problems here, first of all the name.

1021
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,640
Basically it is a Renault fart.
It is.

1022
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,200
I suspect that supercar-looking body is writing 
cheques that the rest of the car cannot cash.

1023
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,960
But, this is the Gordini version 
so it has stripes on it.

1024
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,240
And, as we all know, things 
with stripes on are cool,

1025
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,080
Shelby Mustangs, tigers,
toothpastes...

1026
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,640
James May's jumpers. That is not cool.

1027
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,600
Thank you very much. It has stripes on it, it looks 
like James May's knitwear so that goes there.

1028
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,480
Ahem. What? Check it out.

1029
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,520
What is it? Toyota Yaris Verso.

1030
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,440
It is not good. This is for people    
whose lives are completely empty.

1031
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,320
They are looking forward           
to the day they die

1032
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,920
because it will give them            
something to do.

1033
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,520
And they don't have sex any more cause' 
these days, you know, we prefer sherry.

1034
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,000
They are utterly, utterly boring and catastrophic 
in every single way and they have bought this

1035
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,640
and it is the worst car I've ever    
seen in my life and it goes there.

1036
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,480
Crikey, getting that off your chest. One thing, has 
sherry ever lead to sex? Do you get sherry sex?

1037
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,280
One thing, has sherry ever lead to sex? 
Do you get sherry sex?

1038
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,080
I think you do. It is the one alcoholic 
drink that's never led to nooky.

1039
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,240
I will demonstrate sherry         
sex to any volunteers.

1040
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,640
Could you volunteer to        
have sherry sex with me?

1041
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,520
Oh, dear Lord.

1042
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,920
Just bear with me.     
You don't have to go very far.

1043
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,800
She is keen. Sherry sex.

1044
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,440
Here we go.

1045
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,080
Good night.

1046
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,520
Sherry sex, like that.

1047
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,320
APPLAUSE

1048
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,120
Thank you. I need a cigarette now.

1049
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,240
 [LAUGHTER]

1050
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,520
And now we have got          
a problem with this.

1051
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,320
This is the Porsche 911 Carrera C2S.

1052
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,120
We know the rules on the Cool Wall.

1053
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,920
If one of us has a car,         
it is always uncool.

1054
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,040
Both Hammond and May own this car.

1055
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,880
I don't think the board             
is long enough

1056
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,120
to be able to accommodate that.

1057
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,520
I'm just trying to work out the direction.

1058
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,640
That is east, that is west.         
Who lives west of here?

1059
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,640
Where do you live? Wiltshire.

1060
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,880
Does anybody live      
further west than Wiltshire?

1061
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Ireland. Ireland? Excellent! 
Could you do me a favour?

1062
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,400
Could you take that home      
and pop it on your gatepost?

1063
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,040
Thank you very much, it will       
live there for ever more.

1064
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,640
Those are the rules, I can't argue with that.

1065
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,160
I would like to proffer this. OK?

1066
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,000
What is it? It is a Morgan. 
The new Morgan three-wheeler.

1067
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,080
New? Yes, they are recreating 
the three-wheeler runabout

1068
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,120
that launched the company 100 
years ago and it is magnificent.

1069
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,560
It is made with aluminium and it is 
a modern re-creation. No, it isn't.

1070
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,280
It isn't modern anything. Yes it is.

1071
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,040
It is modernised. No, you know 
everybody will have this, OK?

1072
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,640
You know the cupboard under 
your sink, OK, which is full

1073
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,720
of wedding presents you never used, 
you're all familiar with that?

1074
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,760
That is the fish steamer             
you were given.

1075
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,200
It is. It isn't. It is.

1076
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,200
It isn't. It is.

1077
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,680
Well, it isn't.

1078
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,720
If you put that in cool,      
I will put you in a drain.

1079
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,400
I have a chair and I am 
not afraid to use it.

1080
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,080
I have a hammer.

1081
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,800
Well, make your move, big fella, 
it is going in cool.

1082
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,320
Make your move, come on.

1083
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,560
You know what this is, don't you?

1084
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,200
Awkward. This is a 
Mexican stand-off.

1085
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,320
 [LAUGHTER]

1086
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,480
Right, it is now time for a       
small celebration, because

1087
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,000
this year marks the 40th birthday    
of the world's most expensive car.

1088
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,720
Operating. We're underway.

1089
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,760
It had no doors.

1090
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,400
No roof. No windscreen.

1091
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,440
It produced just one horse power

1092
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,120
and it had a couple of        
garden chairs for seats.

1093
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,200
And yet, the Lunar Rover,     
or moon buggy, cost L25 million

1094
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,720
and that was in 1971 when a V12    
E-type Jag cost less than L3,500.

1095
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,600
In its short life, the moon buggy         
covered just 56 miles,

1096
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,440
which in Top Gear maths works out        
as about L500,000 per mile.

1097
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,880
Although they were all on the moon.

1098
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,520
You are go!

1099
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,000
The moon buggy was used       
in three space missions.

1100
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,880
Man, oh man, what a 
Grand Prix this is.

1101
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,920
I tell you, it sure does a good 
job with this kind of terrain.

1102
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,640
And the short, bouncy 
journeys it made

1103
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,200
were about the most useful       
a car has ever undertaken.

1104
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,880
The moon buggy meant that the        
astronauts could explore

1105
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,720
more of the moon than they 
would have been able to on foot,

1106
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,240
and that meant they could take    
more pictures, collect more rocks,

1107
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,800
drill for more samples and 
generally get a better understanding

1108
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,680
of where the universe           
may have come from.

1109
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,360
However, in 1972 the moon 
missions were scrapped,

1110
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,600
which means that for the last      
39 years, the only moon buggy

1111
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,880
you will have seen on earth          
has been in a museum.

1112
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,480
Until now.

1113
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,040
Because... Yes, it's back.

1114
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,280
This really is it.

1115
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,320
The Moon Buggy Mark II.

1116
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,560
A car for outer space.

1117
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,440
This is much more exciting

1118
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,880
than something like a       
Veyron SS or a Ferrari 458.

1119
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,560
Those are just earth cars.

1120
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,760
And because I am the one who goes    
by the name of Captain Buzz Slow,

1121
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,440
NASA have said I can drive it.

1122
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,640
There we are, we are flat out in the 
Lunar Rover Mark II, that is 10 miles an hour.

1123
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,400
The original Lunar Rover did eight    
miles an hour until the astronauts

1124
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,000
got hold of it and they managed         
to push it up to 11.

1125
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,320
So, who knows,    
this could get into the teens.

1126
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
I can't believe I am        
being allowed to do this.

1127
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,640
I am alone in it.

1128
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,080
Well, almost alone.

1129
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,840
Since Moon Buggy Mark II          
cost $4.5 million,

1130
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,360
there was a car behind me      
containing some NASA heavies

1131
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,040
who could remotely shut it down       
if I did anything stupid.

1132
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,880
Absolutely fantastic control            
interface here.

1133
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,120
I have got this screen with touch      
buttons, loads of parameters

1134
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,800
I can fiddle with, every 
single wheel is monitored.

1135
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,720
My heading, my direction,     
roll, pitch, all these things.

1136
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,320
If normal cars were as complicated 
as this, they would be a lot more fun.

1137
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,200
Watch this for a really brilliant     
little Lunar Rover party trick.

1138
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,400
If I just push the joystick       
to the side, very slightly,

1139
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,520
you will see that is not   
turning right, that is crabbing.

1140
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,640
How about that?

1141
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,640
SCREECHING

1142
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,360
What was that?

1143
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,120
Am I that close to it?

1144
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,600
Sorry.

1145
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,560
After an astronomical rollicking,

1146
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,640
I decided to concentrate on         
moon buggy pub trivia.

1147
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,160
This is the only vehicle of any type I have 
ever driven with two quoted weights,

1148
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,400
because here on earth it weighs        
approximately four tonnes

1149
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,800
but on the moon, of course,    
the gravity is only about a sixth

1150
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,560
of what we have here, so it only    
weighs something like 760 kilograms.

1151
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,680
They do have to think about           
that sort of thing.

1152
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,760
It will behave differently and your 
sensors will behave differently as well.

1153
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,200
The moon buggy has 12 wheels.

1154
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,320
Powered by six motors    
and they have a great party piece.

1155
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,320
Right, watch this.

1156
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,600
We are now crabbing

1157
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,640
exactly sideways.

1158
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,120
The Eagle has parked.

1159
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,520
BANG

1160
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,760
Sorry.

1161
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,200
Now, we have done a small         
amount of maths here.

1162
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,320
This is proper maths,           
not Top Gear maths.

1163
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,280
We worked out that if every car    
in Britain could park like that

1164
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,920
and didn't have to leave          
a gap at each end,

1165
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,800
we would save, wait for it...

1166
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,680
10,000 miles of parking space.

1167
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,320
But since there is not really a    
problem with parking on the moon,

1168
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,800
those wheels, combined with        
an adjustable ride height

1169
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,000
are designed primarily        
to be amazing off-road.

1170
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,240
Houston, we are go for rocks.

1171
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,360
Now, you'll see when         
you're looking outside,

1172
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,600
each wheel set is working out where
 it's going and what it's doing,

1173
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,120
sort out the right height,         
deal with the traction,

1174
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,680
it is extremely intelligent,   
it has extremely powerful computers.

1175
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,920
The tyres themselves are 
not quite so hi-tech.

1176
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,400
They were chosen for their toughness 
and are from a crop sprayer.

1177
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,640
Look at this!

1178
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,440
That's bags of torque.

1179
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,880
It is a four-ton vehicle     
climbing up a 30 degree slope.

1180
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,200
What a climb!

1181
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,640
What a ride!

1182
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,000
It is absolutely brilliant,               
this thing.

1183
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,680
ENGINE STALLS

1184
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,760
Sorry.

1185
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,240
It is not just the moon buggy's off-road 
abilities that have moved on either.

1186
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,040
The original Lunar Rover        
had a very limited range

1187
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:29,320
because if it broke down, the astronauts had to be 
able to make it back to the lunar module on foot.

1188
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,440
But this one is more of a 
cosmic camper van.

1189
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,720
This is a space bed.

1190
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,600
There is another one that     
folds down here for your buddy.

1191
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,600
They are covered in memory foam,       
which was a NASA invention.

1192
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,480
There are privacy curtains here,         
there is an iPod dock,

1193
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,760
there is a home cinema,          
here is a space John.

1194
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,600
But sooner or later, you are going     
to get bored watching Apollo 13

1195
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,240
and you might want to go          
for a walk outside.

1196
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,240
If you do, you have to exit through
the rather unusual back door.

1197
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,400
Here we go.     
My feet are entering the suit.

1198
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,880
My gentleman's area is compressed     
by the crotch of the spacesuit.

1199
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,760
I have my hands in the space suit.

1200
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,400
Leak check complete.

1201
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,640
Closing the hatch          
in the Lunar Rover.

1202
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,200
That is quite a giant leap        
for a very unsteady man.

1203
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,840
I would now like to         
perform a short tribute

1204
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,600
to the late Alan Shepard Junior,

1205
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,560
one of only 12 men       
to have walked on the moon,

1206
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,320
and the only man to have done this.

1207
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,280
Houston, the Eagle is going for a birdie.

1208
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
There we go.

1209
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
Miles and miles and miles.

1210
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,320
I'd like to be deadly         
serious for a moment.

1211
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,640
This is the most fabulous vehicle        
I have ever driven. Ever.

1212
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,640
But there is a problem with it.

1213
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,040
Not a technical problem,        
it is the President.

1214
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:23,160
He has cancelled all the funding
for the next moon mission.

1215
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,640
Because that is what          
makes the ship go up.

1216
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,280
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

1217
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,360
That means, if you're a kid,     
you will never have the thrill

1218
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,680
of getting up in the middle        
of the night, like I did,

1219
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,480
to watch the funny little car       
hooning about on the moon.

1220
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,920
Yahoo!

1221
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,560
That was all four wheels 
off the ground there.

1222
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,800
This is really some machine.

1223
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,960
This piece of film I am watching now shows men 
leaving the surface of the moon for the last time.

1224
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:05,000
That is the ascent stage of the Apollo 17 lunar 
module blasting off from the lunar surface.

1225
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,240
That bit of film was captured with a remote 
camera mounted on the moon buggy.

1226
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,480
Which means, obviously, that 
the moon buggy was left behind.

1227
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,960
It does make me sort of sad, really,       
to think of that amazing car

1228
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:25,120
being left up there,    
gathering moon dust for eternity.

1229
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,360
But if you ask me, it is not       
half as sad as a moon buggy

1230
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,400
that will never go up there at all.

1231
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,680
APPLAUSE

1232
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,880
I understand the        
financial considerations,

1233
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,800
but it is sad, isn't it?          
Yes, it makes me sad.

1234
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,240
I tell you what else is sad.

1235
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,880
That is not only the end of this   
show, it is the end of this series.

1236
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,120
Thank you very much for           
watching, though,

1237
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,760
we will see you again in June.          
Take care. Goodnight.
