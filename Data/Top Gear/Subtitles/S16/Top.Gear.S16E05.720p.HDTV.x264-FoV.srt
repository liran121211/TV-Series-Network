2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,890
Tonight... Richard wears a blue hat,

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,890
James wears a different hat

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,920
and I wear a hat with things on it.

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,540
Hello! Thank you.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,539
Now, as you may remember, before Christmas
there was a bit of snow. Everything stopped,

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:48,219
we all ran about waving arms in the air saying, "Why in this country
do we not have more snow ploughs and more gritting machines?"

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,939
The main problem of course is cost, especially at the
moment, because councils everywhere are laying people off.

9
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,259
They cannot very well make a
whole department redundant

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,849
and then spend the ￡90,000 they
have saved on a snow plough.

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,399
Especially if the snow plough is just going to be sitting around.
It might not be needed for five years. Exactly.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,899
So, what is to be done?

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,329
Well, this is the combine harvester.
It works 24 hours-a-day through August,

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,469
but then it sits idly in the
shed for the rest of the year.

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,629
How hard would it be to turn this
in winter into a snow plough?

16
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,849
To find out, we bought an old model, of this very combine
in fact, and set about making the necessary modifications

17
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,509
at Top Gear's top-secret testing
facility in Nottinghamshire.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,400
On the B6011, Just North
of Bestwood, St Albans.

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,980
This is the result of our endeavours.

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:04,569
Straight away you can see we have removed the rotating, cutting,
harvesty blade thing off the front and replaced it with this snow blade.

21
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,049
It is V-shaped, because that makes it
more easy to cut through the snow.

22
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,100
This should be able to move through
snow up to three feet deep, no problem.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,029
Power comes from a V8 diesel engine
which drives these chunky front wheels.

24
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,200
In the snow, as any BMW driver will tell you, front-wheel
drive is a lot better than rear-wheel-drive.

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,069
The combine, when you think about it, it is almost
as if it was designed with snow clearance in mind.

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,490
It is uncanny. Everything about it,

27
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:39,039
it has the ground clearance, knobbly tyres,
front-wheel drive, the weight of it, it is all there.

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,629
This is one of those times
on top gear actually...

29
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,340
We have accidentally been a bit clever!
...this might work.

30
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:56,820
Since the dominator has a top speed of just 12mph, it's
easy to decide which one of us would be the driver.

31
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,200
What happens if I put it on full?
BLEEP. I don't like that!

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,250
Give it the beans! Faster!

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,270
Hang on, it is not like a rally car.

34
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,260
He is going the wrong way.
Rear wheel steering, look.

35
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,739
It is not very sensitive steering.
BLEEP. Oh, BLEEP.

36
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,099
There is of course, one drawback
to the combine as a snow plough.

37
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,149
Because it was designed to work
in August, it has no heater.

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,889
Which is why there is a drum in there,
you can probably see through the window,

39
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,209
and that is an urn. We put that in there.

40
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,749
Full of... Well, we wanted tea,
but James said 'I want Bovril'.

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,440
Because he is in 1950.

42
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,879
We all know that when it is snowing and it is
cold, you have Bovril. That is a rule of life.

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,149
He likes to paint himself all over in it,

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,380
it is like baby oil to him.
That is what he does.

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,270
Him and his lorry driver friends, all Bovrilled up,
and then they slip about. That is what they do!

46
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,649
"Besides attaching a plough on the front,

47
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,110
we also converted the tube that normally shoots out
the harvested wheat into a makeshift gritter".

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,769
I shall be responsible for shovelling
the grit from here into this hopper.

49
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,339
I should be good at this,
because my first job was

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,940
actually shovelling grit into
a water filtration plant.

51
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,920
Go on then, shovel. Make shovelling.

52
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,679
While he is doing that, I
shall explain my role.

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:43,120
I can use this lever here to swing the arm to direct the
flow of grit on to the pavement or onto the road behind.

54
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,529
Yes, look at this!

55
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,260
Initiating gritting.

56
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,810
Yes! And there was grit!
We have made a gritting machine!

57
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,450
"But there was one more
check we wanted to do".

58
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,249
You know what it is like when you are
following a gritting lorry on the motorway

59
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,459
you can go 'No, it is turning
my car into a DeLorean!'.

60
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,760
Exactly. So, to make sure
this is not too powerful,

61
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:22,409
we have got Hammond in a car.
We are going to do a little experiment,

62
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,559
fire the gritter at it, make sure it
does not actually take the paint off.

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,700
It will be all right sideways, won't it?
Yes, yes.

64
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,479
OK James, engage.

65
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Initiating gritting.

66
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,489
Stop it James, there has been a problem!
Make it stop!

67
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,030
Gritting ceased.

68
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,459
"Apart from the fact that the grit would
kill the occupants of any car it hit,"

69
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,770
we felt that the dominator
was ready to start work,

70
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,130
but there was a problem".

71
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,060
It is not going to snow, is it?

72
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,559
"With crossed fingers, we tuned
in to the weather forecast".

73
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,619
Good afternoon... Shh! We are going to see a
change in our weather later on this week.

74
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,569
Temperatures really starting to climb, things heading much milder.
We have had a fair bit of cloud around already...

75
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,389
The good news is there is absolutely no sign
of the cold air returning in the near future,

76
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,359
it is a very mild outlook. The reason we have got all
this warm air, it is pumping up from the tropics.

77
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,419
What does he know?

78
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,650
He does not have to rub it in, does he?
He sounds all gleeful about it.

79
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,350
"So, if the snow would not come to the dominator,
we would take the dominator to the snow."

80
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,659
Here in Norway, we decided to clear the
snow from a frozen lake to make a runway

81
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,150
and then a Nor would land his plane on it".

82
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,669
This is quite snowy. It must have snowed.

83
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,859
"We knew the ice would be thick
enough for a light aircraft,

84
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,740
but what about our heavy snowbine?".

85
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,520
Ooh, oh. I thought he would
be drilling for hours!

86
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:15,219
That was 10 seconds!

87
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,420
Seriously, has that gone through? Yes.

88
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:27,059
Norwegians actually have a chart to say how much
weight you can put on various thicknesses of ice.

89
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,829
So, how thick is it? 45 centimetres.

90
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,779
Well, say 50... let's say 40. It is 45.

91
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,549
So 50 centimetres of ice, 12 tonnes.

92
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,879
Combine is more than that. It is 13 tonnes.

93
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,960
So, we can't do it?
Well it is only a tonne over.

94
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,529
"Bravely, Hammond and the optimistic
Jeremy decided not to be on board,"

95
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,730
as I gingerly drove the
snowbine out of the woods,

96
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,070
towards the ice".

97
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,410
Three yards to the lake,

98
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,250
this is it!

99
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,730
I do not like that noise!

100
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,480
"Eventually though, I made it".

101
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,059
I or did I not say we would be all right?

102
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,530
Was that or was that not
based entirely on guesswork?

103
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,790
"As my guesswork was
correct, we set to work".

104
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,710
We are ploughing.

105
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,700
We are ploughing chaps, look at this.

106
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,690
Here we go!

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,070
The snowbinester - it works! Yes!

108
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,500
Come on!

109
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
This is.. Oh!

110
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,290
I think we have just gone through it.

111
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,240
Ho-ho, yes we have!

112
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,429
Is not an emergency, it is just
time to empty your bowels.

113
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,850
Sinking! Sinking!

114
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,730
"Bravely, Jeremy dismounted".

115
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,699
Back it up!

116
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,580
"And then he started to issue orders".

117
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,920
That is sinking badly. Put your blade down
because that has just gone through again.

118
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,150
"When the combine finally moved, we
could see the scale of the peril".

119
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,010
That is 300 metres deep.

120
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,130
It's just water.

121
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:52,800
"However, unlike the snowplough people at Heathrow
Airport, we decided not to just give up".

122
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,790
Do you know how many flights were cancelled in
Heathrow last year, because of the weather?

123
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,989
3700.

124
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,630
Do you know how many flights were
cancelled in Oslo because of the weather?

125
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,689
2000? Two.

126
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,870
Heathrow 3700.

127
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,180
"As we were proving, all of that
misery was completely un-necessary".

128
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,989
There really is no excuse. Heathrow, BAA,

129
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,429
if you're watching this, you're pathetic.

130
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,889
And if anybody in a meeting says "Oh well,
the reason why it was shut is...", sack him.

131
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:38,690
There is no reason why it was shut because it is
not difficult to clear a runway. It just is not.

132
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,629
"My rant was interrupted at this
point by news from below decks".

133
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,420
The Bovril is boiling over.

134
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,890
"Up top, Hammond was still
fretting about the ice".

135
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,860
Oh my god, that is another crack
there, look. Yep. Big one.

136
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,539
When we go through, it is
going to be worse for him.

137
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,360
Oh god yes, because he will be
pawing a t the glass, desperate.

138
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,160
"Right now though, he was
pawing at the steering wheel".

139
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,910
James, James, go right you idiot!
Stay right, it is a straight line we are looking for!

140
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,959
I think this will be a tricky landing.

141
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,950
We got into a tank slapper.

142
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,190
Look where we're pointing.
James, the trees indicate land.

143
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,600
"Eventually though, James are
mastered at the rear wheel steering".

144
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,979
I am waiting to look behind us and see a
runway, complete with lights and everything.

145
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,090
That is not happening,
but it is not bad, look.

146
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,200
"Pretty soon, the runway was finished.

147
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,310
So we pulled over and radioed the pilot,
giving him permission to land".

148
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,610
It is not the smoothest runway.
No, but there is less snow on it than there was.

149
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,610
It is smooth enough, isn't it?
Well we are about to find out. Here he comes.

150
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,509
Look at that, job done.

151
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,000
Ladies and gentlemen, we did that!
How about that.

152
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,480
"Sadly though, our
celebrations were premature".

153
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,730
Oh, oh my God. That is quite bumpy.

154
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,900
He has crashed.
He has pretty much crashed there.

155
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,239
In time like this, there is
only one thing a man can do.

156
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,480
Right, quick, go! Go go go!
Right, James, run!

157
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,890
That was deeply embarrassing.

158
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,219
I know we are often accused of
faking things on this programme,

159
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,209
but trust me, you cannot
actually fake a plane crash.

160
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:11,079
I think that it is probably safe to say we will not be getting
a Christmas tree for Trafalgar Square this year, from Norway.

161
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,429
Anyway, we will be picking that film up later on.
We want to explain it is not just a massive cocking around.

162
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,969
We really do believe that we were
on to something with that snowbine

163
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,029
because if you think about it, if it works, farmers can
rent out equipment that would normally be sitting idle,

164
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,429
councils do not have to maintain a
fleet, which savesthem a fortune.

165
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,049
And we get our roads open.

166
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,140
So we really do think it
is worth persevering with.

167
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:37,469
Anyway, now, we are going to do the news.
I want to begin by talking about Nissan.

168
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,500
They have announced they are going
to make a new electric sports car

169
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,599
which they are going to exhibit at the
Geneva Motor Show, which is soon.

170
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,209
That is a picture of it.

171
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,919
They have sent us lots of
details about this car.

172
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,289
Interestingly and unusually, they
have also sent us a description

173
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,190
of the sort of person who will buy it.

174
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:56,589
An actual biography.
I am quoting now from a Nissan themselves.

175
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,349
They say the driver, Daniel...

176
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,260
So this guy does not exist,
they have made him up? Yes.

177
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:06,949
They say "Daniel works in tech
but lives for the weekend.

178
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,689
On a Friday night after work,

179
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,680
he gets behind the wheels of his Esflow,

180
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,159
"which instantly links
with his pocket PDA..."

181
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,499
he sounds like a bit of a prat.
He does. Anyway,

182
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,249
"...it determines the fastest
route to his girlfriend's home.

183
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,050
On Sunday, he drives through
the mountains for leisure,"

184
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,529
on his milk float.
And then he gets home eventually,

185
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,049
it is all charged up, and
he lives in Barcelona.

186
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,230
Hang on a minute, he's called Daniel?

187
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,899
Could he be the Daniel
from the Elton John song?

188
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,010
Yes, that is who he was writing about.
Hang on.

189
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,199
♪ Daniel is travelling tonight....

190
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,199
In his stupid electric sports car.
I can see the red tail lights...#.

191
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,360
No, you would not be able to, would you?

192
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:49,660
It is battery-powered,
they will have gone flat.

193
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:55,400
♪ Daniel's girlfriend is bouncing
around on a man with an Aston v8...♪

194
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,529
I have just had a thought.

195
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,630
What is James' middle name?
It is Daniel! Yes it is.

196
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,270
Anyway, that is enough Daniel.

197
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,349
Bentley have announced that
in the next James Bond book,

198
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,419
007 will be driving a Bentley Continental.

199
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,180
Wow. Is that the next James Bond?
Look at him.

200
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,170
He looks like an accountant.

201
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,750
What is the book called?
On her Majesty's Customs and Excise?

202
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,460
Ledger. Live and Let's File.

203
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,110
I should point out that man is the author
of the book, not the new bond. Sorry.

204
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,550
I do not know why you would
want a modern Bentley anyway,

205
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,460
I drove one in Albania
recently and it was terrible.

206
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,600
I was killed in it. You were!
So it was not all bad.

207
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,989
Now, you know infinity?
You mean when James explains how something works?

208
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,269
And infinity just stretches
out in front of you forever.

209
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,079
No, not endless time and space, Infinity,
the Japanese car maker. Oh, yeah.

210
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,370
They are Datsuns with a bit
of velvet in them, Basically.

211
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:04,399
A bit like Lexus is to Toyota.
Well, at the Geneva Motor Show,

212
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,249
they have announced they are going to show
off a new direction they are going in.

213
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,909
This is the car they will be
showing, it is a concept,

214
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,819
I think it looks like an
ordinary car that has melted.

215
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,850
But what I am worried about his
they have called it the Urethra.

216
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,179
Are you sure?
It is not actually spelt urethra,

217
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,879
but it looks like it is pronounced urethra.

218
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,469
Is the urethra the bit your old chap...

219
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,249
Isn't it a tube connecting
your kidney to your bladder?

220
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,099
Where the wee goes a long to get it
from your kidney to your bladder?

221
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,180
How come you keep saying yes to everything!

222
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:41,130
How come you're such an expert?
You look like a scaffolder!

223
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,699
Are you actually a wee doctor?
Yes. You are?

224
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,229
What are you really? I am a car salesman.

225
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,600
Car salesman.

226
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,429
Anyway, so if you want a melted car
named after a tube with urine in it,

227
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,919
that is the car for you.

228
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,889
Now, Ferrari. This year's F1 car they
said is going to be called the F150.

229
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,769
Then, they got a call from
Ford's lawyers saying.

230
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,409
"No, you cannot do that because we own the
name F150 and that will cause confusion."

231
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,209
So let's have a look at the Ferrari.
This is the F150, this year's F1 car,

232
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,060
and now let's have a look at Ford's F150.

233
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,839
It is easy to see how the
confusion could arise

234
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,930
between the two if you kept them together.

235
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,980
What would be worse than getting pole
position sitting on the grid and thinking,

236
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,750
"Right, here we go in my big F1 race,"

237
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,000
why is there a man in a cowboy
hat sitting next to me?

238
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:36,249
Oh, no, I am in a pickup truck!
" Ferrari actually say, and I am quoting now,

239
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,589
it is difficult to understand
Ford's viewpoint on this matter.

240
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,419
I am sort of with them.

241
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,429
Anyway, they have changed the name.

242
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,950
The Ferrari Formula One car is now called

243
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:49,140
the Ferrari F-Henry Ford
is a massive peach.

244
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,659
Two things with the same name do not
necessarily have to be confused.

245
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,760
Like Hammond can mean a massive
organ, or it can... Oh yeah.

246
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,639
Does anybody here play golf? You do?

247
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,800
OK, I have got some news about
personalised number plates.

248
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,940
I know you love that sort
of thing if you play golf.

249
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,909
We have got the new 11
plates coming out very soon,

250
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,509
the numbers will be 11.

251
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,350
Obviously, that gives a
wealth of possibilities for

252
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,610
writing amusing words on your number plate.

253
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,149
Bulldog, Holland, gallop and so on.

254
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,529
The DVLA, which is a big building in Wales

255
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,609
are now selling these numbers
for between 3,000 and 10,000.

256
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,309
To be fair, it is between 3,000 and 10,000
plus the fine you get for interfering

257
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,230
with the letters and numbers
on your number plate.

258
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:34,580
It is true.
We are the only country in the world

259
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,749
where the government says if you
move the letters and numbers around

260
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,379
to make this word you can buy this from us,

261
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,540
and then they fine you for moving
the letters and numbers around.

262
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,560
It is a bit weird, that.

263
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,850
The interesting thing is
that some of the words

264
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,399
have been banned for being
offensive or sinister.

265
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,430
Words like psycho and vulgar.
But they have allowed ballbag.

266
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,699
They have? No, they haven't.
They have not allowed ballbag,

267
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,900
But they have allowed melons.

268
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,959
Isn't that sexist? It is sexist to me.

269
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,189
It is also not fair, because what if you
were a wholesaler of giant hold-alls

270
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,629
for transporting footballs in large
volumes to school playing fields?

271
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,570
You might want ballbag.
They are not doing it,

272
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:23,599
but I think it is unlikely it would
be bought by a sporting wholesaler.

273
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,939
In the same way that melons would
not be bought by a greengrocer.

274
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,969
It would end up on
Jordan's pink whore's box.

275
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,649
What? Horse box. Oh.
What did you think I said?

276
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,960
That is what I thought you said.

277
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,509
One of the things we have learned
over the years on this show is that

278
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:46,380
if you want a small, fast saloon
car, you have to buy a BMW M3.

279
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,809
You can go off and buy a fast
Mercedes or a fast Audi if you want,

280
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,210
but that is like going out and buying a.

281
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:56,739
Playstation war game
that isn't Call of Duty.

282
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,870
The M3 is the best, and
that is an end of it.

283
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,310
Now however, BMW claim they
have made it even better.

284
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,799
First of all, it is fitted with
a devise that cuts the engine

285
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,439
when you stop it is set of lights,

286
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,420
and then start it again when you set off.

287
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,880
All on its own, this will
solve the Global Warming.

288
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,939
Next, it is available with a matt finish,

289
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,250
which is as cool as buying some skinny
jeans, and then making an app about them.

290
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,899
There are some drawbacks to this though,

291
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:58,479
first of all, it costs 1,755.
I think it is a lot for a bit of paint.

292
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,739
Plus, you cannot take it in
a car-wash or polish it,

293
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,219
and you must remove tree sap,
dead insects and bird droppings

294
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,300
immediately or you will ruin it.

295
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,380
So really, you are paying 1700
quid for some inconvenience.

296
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,540
The biggest new feature is what
BMW call the competition pack.

297
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,069
This will cost you 3,300.

298
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,849
For that you get bigger wheels
and tyres, a lowered ride height

299
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,629
and one or two other
software tweaks designed to

300
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,460
keep people pointing in
vaguely the right direction.

301
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,700
Or if the mood takes you, in
completely the wrong direction.

302
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,299
I would love to say at this point that the
competition pack has transformed this car

303
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,600
into a mesmerising blend
of God and Uma Thurman.

304
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,370
But it hasn't.

305
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Truth be told, most of the time it
makes absolutely no difference at all.

306
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,120
In a straight line, it is no
faster than the standard car.

307
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,570
Around the bends, it
feels exactly the same.

308
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,759
Except of course when you
eventually spin, it will assume

309
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,290
you have arrived at a set of
lights and cut the engine.

310
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,980
Why have you done that!

311
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,170
Nobody arrives at traffic lights
backwards in a cloud of tyre smoke!

312
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,840
Stupid thing!

313
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,410
However, with the competition pack, you
do get one feature that you will notice.

314
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,940
If you push this little button here,
twice, you engage sport mode.

315
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,780
It does not make any difference
to the speed you go,

316
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:12,520
but it does make the car
very uncomfortable.

317
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,759
I know, for example, this
runway is very smooth.

318
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,800
But now it feels like I am
driving over a teenager's face.

319
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,779
So there we are. The competition pack.

320
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,609
You spend 58,000 and what
you get in exchange is

321
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:41,390
a normal 55,000 M3 with a little
button that makes it worse.

322
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,889
So what about this? The new Audi RS5.
This is also 58,000,

323
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,240
but it does come with many
bells and a fleet of whistles.

324
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,189
It has four wheel drive, a new
mechanical centre differential

325
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,210
and an electronic gizmo that splits
the torque between the rear wheels.

326
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,139
Sounds juicy! And that is
before we get to the engine.

327
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,820
A Lamborghini derived 4.2 litre V8.

328
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,819
Audi has even gone to the trouble of
fitting the engine with a device that

329
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,989
fires a droplet of petrol into the hot
exhaust every time you change gear.

330
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,360
So, ready?

331
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:47,570
They are using the planet's resources to
make changing gear sound nice. I like that.

332
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:55,080
But can it beat the BMW? Let's find out.

333
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,049
He has 414 brake horsepower,
I have 30 more.

334
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,319
I am expecting to just cruise by.

335
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,239
But, the Audi is heavier, and despite
the high-tech four-wheel drive

336
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,020
it is nowhere near as good on the corners.

337
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,950
I will get him on the next one. Oh, dear.

338
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,720
No matter, I will get him on the braking...

339
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,940
I won't get him on the braking. Ooh...

340
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,459
er! This is weird, because in
all fast Audis I can remember,

341
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,999
the engine has always been way
out in front of the front axle

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
sticking out like Bruce Forsyth's chin.

343
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,670
In this, they have moved the axle forwards.

344
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,370
The idea being that that would kill the
understeer that has always plagued Audis.

345
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,279
Honestly, it really has not worked.
Come on!

346
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,470
Turn!

347
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,699
The only hope you have of getting
past is that eventually,

348
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,190
the BMW driver will have to pull over
to wipe an insect off the bonnet.

349
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,499
I thought the RS5 would be a modern
day version of the original Quattro

350
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,749
a hardcore, fire spitting monster.

351
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,450
A machine born in the forests,
rough, brutal and exciting.

352
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,069
But it is not. It is comfortable
and relaxing and quiet.

353
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,099
I am sorry, but if that is what you want,

354
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,070
why spend 58,000 on a four-wheel drive V8?

355
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,199
In short, neither of
these cars really works.

356
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,780
As a result, we are back where we started.

357
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,340
If you want a small, fast
saloon, buy a standard M3.

358
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,940
What is there to applaud?

359
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,970
Let work this out, shall we.

360
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:30,299
A couple of weeks ago, you reviewed
three cars that no one can buy.

361
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,409
And you have just reviewed two
cars that no one will want to buy.

362
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,189
I have. Thank you.

363
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,979
But listen. I have another problem with the
Audi apart from the ones we have already seen.

364
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,059
You know Audi's sponsor, Manchester United?

365
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,220
How many people here support
Manchester United? Hands up.

366
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,249
It is a few, so they
think yes we like Audis.

367
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,819
Now, how many people here hope that
Manchester United, the entire team,

368
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,870
catch gonorrhoea and are
unable to play ever again?

369
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,519
That is the problem with a car
when its sponsors a football team.

370
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,179
It automatically means that the vast
majority of people, my son included,

371
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,319
he hates Audis! If anyone does not
support that football team... Exactly!

372
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,410
I do not want to think that
divide bought an Audi,

373
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:15,009
any of my money, even a tiny
bit, is going to Wayne Rooney.

374
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,140
Or Sir Ferguson. With his chewing-gum.

375
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,759
Anyway, it is now time to find out how
fast these cars go around our track.

376
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,939
That, of course, means handing them
over to our tame racing driver.

377
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,110
Some say that in his wallet he
keeps a photograph of his wallet.

378
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,740
And that in a recent race, even he
was beaten by The King's Speech.

379
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,860
All we know is he is called The Stig.

380
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,709
And they're Off...

381
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,929
The track is moist and that should
favour the four-wheel drive Audi.

382
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:01,260
Let's see as they come up to the
first corner, Audi is OK there.

383
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,789
What about the BMW?
No, it is getting a bit out of shape.

384
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,090
A bit squiggly, there.

385
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,870
Tequila! It makes me happy!

386
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,660
I have no idea why he is listening to that.

387
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,999
There we are, the RS5's
front end washing out.

388
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,900
The BMW still tail happy. Ok, the Hummerhead.
Will the Audi follow its nose like a truffle pig?

389
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,130
It seems to be doing all right.

390
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,819
The tyres are squealing though,
with that precise Germanic pain.

391
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,149
BMW drifting like a matt painted lunatic.

392
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,750
Tequila! It makes me happy!

393
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,990
Powering into the follow-through.

394
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,380
The Audi has got its dander up now.

395
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,259
Through the tyres, not much in it so far.

396
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,389
Two corners left.
Here they come now on the braking,

397
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,890
the RS5 looking a bit squirrelly there.

398
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,410
The brakes I must say are not
that great on the track.

399
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:56,950
They are both slithering through Gambon
and there we are, across the line.

400
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:06,719
So the Audi RS5 did it.
- 1:27:5, so that's there, the moist symbol. The competition pack,

401
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,570
even though it does not have four-wheel
drive and the track was a bit wet,

402
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:14,229
1:26:5, so that goes there. Way faster.

403
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,519
Yeah but hang on, where is normal M3?
It is there, so it is not as fast.

404
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,660
The M3 is the best car. It always will be and
there is no point ever thinking otherwise.

405
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,829
Now, it is time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

406
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,559
My guest tonight appears in a new
film alongside Nicolas Cage,

407
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,509
one of those films where everything explodes,
there is a car chase and it is all in 3D.

408
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,599
But she did cause a bit
of a row in the office.

409
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,529
You see, the producers said, you cannot have
her on because nobody has ever heard of her.

410
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:53,299
I said, yes that is true, but she is bisexual.
And she likes guns and muscle cars. And I won.

411
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,730
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Amber Heard!

412
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:23,239
Carlsberg do not do guests for chat shows but
if they did, that is pretty close to perfect.

413
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Where do we begin?

414
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:27,099
I hear that is a good sign.
It is a good sign.

415
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,400
I am trying to think of anybody else I would
rather be sitting and talking to now...

416
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,240
No, can't think of anybody.

417
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,919
The films you have been previously
haven't really allow you to indulge

418
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,779
this passion for guns and
muscle cars, I guess.

419
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,649
Really, what was that, the
Pineapple Express, Zombie Land..

420
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,599
And then what was that one where you're
pretty much naked throughout? The Informers.

421
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,720
The Informers, I've watched it a lot.

422
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,939
I think that's why people watch
it at all, to be honest.

423
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,950
I am watching it now.

424
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,900
Come back to me!

425
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,979
But the new movie, the new movie
Drive Angie in 3-D, Nicolas Cage,

426
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,599
this is written with you in mind.

427
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,750
This movie is so BLEEP cool. It is.

428
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,460
It's loud guns, fast cars and short
shorts on me, not Nicolas Cage.

429
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,549
We have actually got a clip of the film.
We will show that to you now.

430
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,010
Let's look at that.

431
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,180
Tell them I'm coming. You're too late.

432
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,929
Hell already is walking the earth.

433
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,189
He broke out of hell to make things right.

434
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,930
Now he's got one last shot at redemption.

435
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,029
Just so you know I don't
pick up hitch-hikers.

436
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,090
I didn't have my thumb out.

437
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,260
Between now and then I'mma mess you up.

438
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,040
That's got all the things we need. Yeah.

439
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,799
I drove the BLEEP out of that car.

440
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:24,219
I did almost all my own stunts and jumping
out of the car on to the other car I did.

441
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,349
You did do that? Yeah. That was me.

442
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,329
Presumably you could get that badly
wrong and go through the windscreen?

443
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,670
We have to do it over and over again.

444
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:34,899
Doing it once is no problem
but doing it ten times...

445
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,719
every day I came home
with bruises and scrapes.

446
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,439
That must take forever.
It does take a long time.

447
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,419
So muscle cars, where
does this love come from?

448
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,479
I am from Texas and I think that
had something to do with it.

449
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,209
It helps being from the south, people
are obsessed with their cars there.

450
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,780
Have you got one? Yes, I drive a
68 Mustang in LA. That's my car.

451
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,730
You have just grown a third leg. He has.

452
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,000
Has it always been muscle cars or did you

453
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:14,389
go through a period of rabbit or whatever?

454
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,449
I have had everything...

455
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,570
It's a Golf, stupid idiot!

456
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,449
Has it always been a love
of old American big V8s?

457
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,779
I have had a 67 Mercedes, a 62 Checker.
The cab? Yes.

458
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,309
The Mustang is that in Los Angeles?
Yes, that's my baby.

459
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,659
What colour is it? It was cherry red
until the last time it got stolen.

460
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,780
It gets stolen a lot.

461
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:40,950
Why does it get stolen so much,

462
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:44,909
I would have thought it was easy to
find someone driving a 68 Mustang?

463
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,689
Apparently burglars or whatever
you call them - car thieves.

464
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,940
Bustards is another one.

465
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,179
I like how you say it.

466
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,049
Anyway, apparently it's easy to
find for all sorts of people.

467
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:04,759
Most people that talk here about car who is live
in California have bought a Toyota... Prius.

468
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,390
Why haven't you gone down that route?

469
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:10,879
I don't blame people for buying
them, that's great, smart.

470
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,680
You have a Prius? I DO NOT have a Prius.

471
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,780
I loath them with an unbridled passion!

472
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,369
When people say I have a Prius because
I care, I care about the environment,

473
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,290
shirts made from leaves.

474
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,700
My shirt is made from leaves.
Is it? No, no. It's just...

475
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,979
I mean the Nickell for the batteries
in that thing is mined in Canada

476
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,739
and it's taken to Norway and go to Japan.

477
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,529
It's done two and a half million miles
before you buy it in California.

478
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,980
I just ram into them in
your Mustang if I was you.

479
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,599
I have done that in a Checker.

480
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,220
You hit a Prius? I rammed into a
couple of them, not just one.

481
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,490
I would have just laughed.

482
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,899
We have done cars now.
We will move on to guns.

483
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,969
You are obviously from Texas, it's
part of the culture there, I guess.

484
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,379
You grew up with them.

485
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,809
I grew up around guns,
around gun owners and users.

486
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,859
My dad at any given point had
several, it's the culture.

487
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,590
I have a gun myself.
What sort? A 357 Magnum.

488
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,170
I have gone again.

489
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,060
Have you ever fired a machine gun?
I have. I have actually.

490
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,239
A automatic weapon, I set fire to
Arizona once with one of those,

491
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,199
you are just firing away, it's brilliant.
And oh God, the desert is on fire.

492
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,020
Great fun.
Sounds like you know how to party...

493
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,480
On that bombshell, it's time to end.
Thank you for watching, good night.

494
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,959
Obviously, you are from Texas.
Austin, I believe. Yeah.

495
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,529
I went there once and went to a
bar called the Broken Spoke.

496
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,019
Have you been there?
I used to square dance.

497
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,129
You didn't do line dancing? Oh, yeah.

498
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,919
I am from Texas after all.

499
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,620
The guy that ran it, I
can remember watching,

500
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:19,619
we don't have none of that fancy water.

501
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,070
I think that was my dad.

502
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,479
So, when you went back to Texas,

503
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,969
which is a deeply conservative
neck of the woods.

504
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,880
Bible belt.

505
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:30,130
And said this is my girlfriend,

506
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,409
how did it go down?
I think that, you know, I have always been...

507
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,660
I used to go to Catholic
school and got in trouble

508
00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:42,109
for the books I read,
written by George Orwell...

509
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,190
You read a George Orwell book in Texas?

510
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,699
I found myself going against the grain and

511
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,819
I have had to confront preconceived notions

512
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,249
for what a girl like me should be like

513
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,069
my whole life and I have always
been myself and done my own thing.

514
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,429
I am surprised you weren't put in an
electric chair for reading George Orwell?

515
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,870
Because he is a communist.

516
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:04,360
I carry a gun.

517
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,119
You came here to do your
lap wearing those shoes.

518
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,710
These are my driving shoes.

519
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,259
Did you do a lap in those?
They wouldn't let me.

520
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,209
They made me wear a helmet
too, can you believe that?

521
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,090
Made you what?
Wear a helmet, with this hair.

522
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,730
You fluffed up nicely. Thank you.
I have a good fluffer.

523
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,419
Stig, OK, he was very - please
don't take this the wrong one,

524
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,379
he is a very unusual person he was
very disappointed when you arrived

525
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,240
because he was expecting Thora
Hird, not Amber. I don't know...

526
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,040
He has a complete crush on her.
He loves her.

527
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,590
How did you manage to get on
with our Cee-apostrophe-d?

528
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,029
It did OK on the track.

529
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,329
Don't know if it would be my everyday
car, but it did OK on the track.

530
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,190
Shall we find out.
Who would like to see Amber's lap?

531
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,730
Here we go.

532
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,930
There's no wheel spin. I was trying.

533
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,230
What are you wearing on your hands?
Gloves. What, driving gloves?

534
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,130
Wow, that's how go through there!

535
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,059
Not all the road, but not bad.

536
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,360
Look at those gloves!

537
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,719
Are you actually a
murderer, part time? Yes!

538
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,099
They look like strangler's gloves, to me.

539
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,559
This feels very illegal.
Like it should be illegal.

540
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,379
No no no, you can drive as fast as
you like in Britain, you're OK.

541
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,409
There are yellow boxes
to record it for you.

542
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,050
They send you a note of praise.

543
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,530
That's not bad, a bit of
understeer, not your fault.

544
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,680
This does not have quite the same intensity

545
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,450
when you watch it back. No, you're right.

546
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,409
Open your eyes! Keep your eyes open,

547
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,259
you're not going in that corner.

548
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,660
That looks pretty quick, actually.

549
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:07,130
BLEEP. Have a look in here, cut it.

550
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,640
That is quite uncomfortable
when you do that.

551
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,140
Right, coming up, second to last corner.

552
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,450
This is where most people get it wrong.

553
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,730
I think you're on the
wrong side of the road.

554
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:20,179
There we are, in to Gambon, where
Tom Cruise damn nearly rolled over.

555
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,670
And there we are, across the line!

556
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,099
Where do you reckon you have come?
I have no idea.

557
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,339
Well, Tom Cruise is 1:44:2. That show-off!

558
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,719
It was a bit show-offy.

559
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,859
Cameron Diaz, who you probably
also know, is 1:45:2.

560
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:51,680
Really? Anyway, you did
it in one minute, 50.3.

561
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,679
Which is the slowest dry
lap we have ever had!

562
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,500
Oh no!

563
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,770
It is a record of sorts!

564
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,499
The most important thing is that
we now know you are a beautiful,

565
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:15,349
well read and intelligent, well travelled,
bisexual gun and muscle car enthusiast.

566
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:20,290
Ladies and gentlemen, you really have
struck lucky this week, Amber Heard!

567
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,980
Thank you.

568
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,239
Right. Now. This evening we
solved Britain's financial crisis

569
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,459
by making a combine harvester
into a snow plough.

570
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,599
Earlier on in Norway, we used it
to make a runway on a frozen lake.

571
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,680
If we are honest, things did
not go entirely to plan.

572
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,339
No. The aeroplane that we
landed sort of crashed a bit,

573
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,619
but never mind that.
We pick up the action later that same evening,

574
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,289
heading for a nearby town,
where Jeremy was very keen

575
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,360
to try out a de-icing he fitted.

576
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,820
I am the God of hellfire
and I bring you fire! Yes!

577
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,209
"As we entered the town, we
all went to action stations."

578
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,930
I turning the Bovril on.

579
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,000
Hammond! You have got good grit!

580
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,770
"Unfortunately, communications
were a bit ropey".

581
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,909
Stop! Stop we've hit a building!

582
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,359
Fans are on, going forward.

583
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,599
Stop! Stop Stop Stop! James, James stop!

584
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,419
No, do not stop. Drive! Drive!
Just drive away, James.

585
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,039
He did it! He did it!

586
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,769
"Annoyingly, it was a dead end,"

587
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,329
so James had to do a three-point turn,

588
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,430
which he is not that good
at in a normal car".

589
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,680
Stop stop stop!

590
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,999
"If I am honest, Jeremy and
I were not much help".

591
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,949
Hard left, hard left. Up to the right.

592
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,310
Not now, wait until the top
of the slope! Not now!

593
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,199
Maybe straighten up now.
I have also had a wee.

594
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,219
Can you give me sort of clear instructions
rather than a load of hysteria?

595
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,160
I have no idea what is going on.

596
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,870
"After much palaver, we
finally broke free".

597
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,559
We have damaged it quite badly at the back.
And that house.

598
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,440
But it is OK, because we have
gritted at least 30 ft of road.

599
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,420
"On the High Street, we
had yet more success".

600
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,760
I am in a Ford Sierra Cosworth
seat with a flamethrower.

601
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,960
It is not possible to be happier than that.

602
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,589
Here we go, burning the bank!

603
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,309
We are gritting, we are flame throwing,

604
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:22,160
we have done a bit of ploughing,
it is all marvellous.

605
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,579
We are International Rescue.
We are Thunderbirds!

606
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,570
Cruising through Norway, looking
for people who need our services.

607
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,770
I have to do the three-point turn
now chaps, we are at the end.

608
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,080
I will provide the rear lighting.

609
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,920
It is like a reversing light, this.
Kind of.

610
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,539
When Jeremy fires his flame-thrower, I
can see a little bit in that mirror.

611
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,009
Keeps going backwards James.

612
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,799
Oh look! No, no!

613
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,540
Look what I have done! What have you done!

614
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,489
Go Go Go!

615
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,609
"Again, There was only one thing to do."

616
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,330
Are we running away?
I have no idea what is happening.

617
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,419
"After much driving
around and doing things,

618
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,300
we were hungry, and the tank was empty".

619
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,120
Dive in here for fuel and a bag of
crisps and then we will carry on.

620
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,060
Does he realise how much
the back swings out!?

621
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,569
I am going to clear this
thing of snow for them,

622
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,730
that will make them happy.

623
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:32,830
Watch this!

624
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,430
Cock!

625
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,000
Why have we stopped?

626
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:44,430
I was trying to clear that thing of
snow but it has got a car in it.

627
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,639
I was going to be helpful and clear
that, there was a car in it.

628
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,570
A car? The whole thing was covered in snow.
I thought it was a pile of snow.

629
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:55,289
It is not covered in snow!
Not any more, you moron! It was!

630
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,619
Why did you ram a car?
He rammed into a car!

631
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,769
I was trying to be helpful!

632
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,619
"There was only one thing to do".

633
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,140
Go, go. Run away, run away.

634
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,659
"So far then, we had crashed a
plane, ruined a car, burned a sign

635
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,900
and smashed a house.
Then, things got worse".

636
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:25,260
Hang on, my flame-thrower is jammed!
The flame-thrower is jammed!

637
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,830
So what are you doing?

638
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,040
I can see a yellow mist in the mirror.

639
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,380
There is a man on fire!

640
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,320
James, Jeremy has set fire to a skier.
Run away.

641
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,189
I think that if we do get
reported to the police,

642
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,030
it will not take them very long to find us.

643
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,409
"Still, as we were not actually
being stoned by an angry mob,"

644
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,850
we went to bed that night
feeling quite cheerful.

645
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,760
However, the next morning,
there was bad news.

646
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,790
What does it actually say? Is it upbeat?

647
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:13,110
I do not think it is going
to be upbeat, is it?

648
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,159
HE ATTEMPTS TO READ THE
NORWEGIAN ARTICLE OUTLOUD.

649
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,369
"An incredibly small man
knocked my house"?...

650
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,070
Good morning!

651
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,670
We are in the paper.

652
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,609
It says what a good service we provided?

653
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:30,139
We cleared the snow and... No.

654
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,259
"A man who looked like a dog
crashed into one of my trees",

655
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,650
I do not think it is a good
idea to stay here any more.

656
00:47:36,651 --> 00:47:38,269
Can I make a suggestion? Yes.

657
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,550
Since this is a sort of prototype
and we are testing it,

658
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:42,819
why don't we go and test
it on a country road

659
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,209
where there is just snow? No people.

660
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,879
No people or cars or buildings
or trees or benches,

661
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,710
let's just try and clear some snow.

662
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,079
"This was a good idea.
So we fired up the dominator and"

663
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,050
headed for a road so remote, even the
Nors had abandoned it to the weather.

664
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:09,670
A mountain pass called 'the
road of terror', probably".

665
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,250
If we can open this one road...

666
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,399
have proven the work of this
machine, internationally.

667
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,630
And I think we will be forgiven
for all the small things

668
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:25,500
we have done wrong.

669
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:29,030
The man on fire, houses,
the car and the sign.

670
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,300
"Eventually, we arrived at
the gates of a frozen hell".

671
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,759
One of a problems we
found yesterday was that

672
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,989
you tend to get snow
sticking to the plough,

673
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,249
building up and it does not work as well.

674
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,079
So, an idea that I had is
to cover the plough itself

675
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,469
in a mixture of oil and diesel.

676
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,819
I am now doing it, because it is my idea.

677
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,200
He is claiming it is his idea.

678
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,600
I happen to know he was talking to a
snowplough driver in the bar last night.

679
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,200
Nothing is going to stick to that.

680
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,050
"With the preparations done, we set off ".

681
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,520
Come on, dominator!

682
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,410
"Our destination was a desolate
hamlet 10 kilometres away".

683
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,060
Look at that.

684
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:28,780
Boldly ploughing where no Norwegian
has ploughed so far this winter.

685
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,760
This is a 1980s machine, so
that is a cassette player.

686
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,009
Do you think James is getting lonely downthere?
He will love it.

687
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:46,109
And I bet 10 million he is fantasising
about a being a lone skipper

688
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:50,349
of some weather battered
trawler out in the North Sea.

689
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:55,770
A lone skipper, but with one quite
attractive man in the galley.

690
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,359
"With the oiled plough siding
nicely through the snow,

691
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,730
Jeremy and I swung into action."

692
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,110
Burn Baby Burn!

693
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,060
The gritting is going well, Hammond.

694
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,730
I have lost my wedding ring!

695
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:47,350
What? I have lost my wedding ring!

696
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,460
Has it gone in the thing?
It must have done.

697
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,120
That is a tricky one to explain.

698
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,889
"Soon though, we had bigger things
to worry about than Hammond's ring".

699
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:01,680
Oh, hang on.

700
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,580
What was that?
I nearly went through the windscreen.

701
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,610
"But a snowy hillock was no
match for the dominator".

702
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,810
Take this, snow.

703
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,230
Charge!

704
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,680
We're through!

705
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,860
"However, while the battering ram
was OK in this lonely place,

706
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,400
the rear wheel steering was a nightmare".

707
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,540
Oh no, no no no! A tank slapper.

708
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,290
Don't do it! It has got a mind of its own!

709
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,890
"On the hills, we had a
serious power shortage".

710
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,400
James, is that full-speed? Yes it is.

711
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,280
We are stuck.

712
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,310
If you think about it, a
combine harvester was designed

713
00:52:09,311 --> 00:52:13,159
to never work in the snow,
or the rain, or on a hill.

714
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,790
It is always flat ground on
lovely summer's evenings.

715
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,210
It is out of its comfort zone here.

716
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,710
"Which meant that sadly, so was I".

717
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,249
He will want the Victoria Cross
now, for using a shovel.

718
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,320
He will.

719
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,260
Will I just raise the plough
and take his head off? Yes.

720
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:38,570
Oh, for god's sake!

721
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,510
"Each kilometre was now
a growing challenge.

722
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,280
My ingenious snow measuring
tactic did not go brilliantly".

723
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,750
"But the Top Gear snowbine kept on moving".

724
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,640
Go! Full power!

725
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,260
Look at us carving a path.
Look, that is ours.

726
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,559
This road is open and will
remain so until it snows again!

727
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,300
Tonight, probably. Or tomorrow.

728
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:27,540
'Warning - the Top Gear Snowbine
Harvester is approaching!'.

729
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,570
This is really annoying.
For the first time in my life

730
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:34,740
I have one of these Tannoy things and
there is absolutely nobody to talk to.

731
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,020
James, there is one kilometre to go!

732
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:45,510
One more kilometre and this road is open.

733
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,060
Who fancies a celebratory
Bovril, when we get there?

734
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,520
Unless Bovril is a code word for something
dirty, I do not want to do that.

735
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,129
Hang on, getting a bit of a tank slapper.

736
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,840
It is wandering off!

737
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,130
Oh no!

738
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,490
BLEEP.

739
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,510
"This time, we had come off the
road and into a massive snowdrift".

740
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,040
Jesus wept. That is a lot of snow.

741
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,849
The snow out here, that we
are in, is incredibly deep.

742
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,839
Yes, that is what I feared.

743
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,190
It felt quite deep as it went off the edge.

744
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,729
You can see the extent of
the problem is quite big.

745
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:41,270
A whole machine is... BLEEP.

746
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,050
"So, one wheel was stuck and
one was spinning uselessly".

747
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,600
Full power!

748
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:54,880
It is not going to do it.

749
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,880
"Spurred on by the previous day's
failures, we dug furiously".

750
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,690
Just for once, I want to
do something properly.

751
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,230
I want to clear this road and do it.
No cocking about.

752
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,300
This is coming out.
Do not rock it back. Now forwards!

753
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,970
That feels abusive.

754
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,960
I am wearing the clutch out, hang
on, it is starting to smell.

755
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,299
Do not stop, James!

756
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,939
"With darkness falling and
the temperature dropping,

757
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,610
this was no time for mechanical sympathy".

758
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,850
Come on, James. We can do this.

759
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,980
Nearly! Power!

760
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,400
Yes, come on! Come on!

761
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:12,500
Yes! Yes! Yes! That's it, climb aboard.

762
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,760
"The dominator surged forwards."

763
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,350
Soon, our destination hoved into view.

764
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:33,580
We are so nearly there. Look at that!

765
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,810
That is a blaze of glory!
Blaze of glory, grit and Bovril.

766
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:50,190
Ladies and gentlemen the Top Gear
snowbine harvester has arrived.

767
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,359
"And so, there we are."

768
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,469
For once in our wretched
lives on this programme,

769
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,970
we had actually done
what we set out to do".

770
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,329
You know what? What?
We have been ambitious and brilliant,

771
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,880
and it is all thanks to the dominator.
Successful.

772
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,080
Gentleman, it has been a
pleasure ploughing with you.

773
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:11,590
It has been a joy and an honour.

774
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,860
That was the right road, wasn't it?

775
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,559
We did something! We were actually good!

776
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,180
I can hardly believe it but
it is true, that's weird.

777
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,049
Some conclusions we can draw from
our outstanding success, there.

778
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,899
Britain has 3700 snow ploughs and gritters,

779
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,979
and spends 160 million
per year clearing snow.

780
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,179
Obviously, that is not enough because
every time there is a light flurry,

781
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,319
everything shuts down and closes.

782
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,619
That is why our idea makes
so much sense because

783
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,389
there are 15,000 combine
harvesters in Britain.

784
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,379
All it takes to convert them
into snowploughs is a spanner

785
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,880
and a couple of burly men.

786
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,630
Well, the gritter bit was
a bit more complicated.

787
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:02,830
And the flame-thrower.
I am not sure you need that.

788
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:05,719
You do. It is brilliant.
It is a good reversing light.

789
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,719
You set fire to a man. No, I did not!

790
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,959
He spontaneously combusted
as we were driving by.

791
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,479
It was incredible.
I have never seen anything like it.

792
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,189
Anyway, the important thing is that
our dominator was an old machine.

793
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,099
If we used one of the more
modern ones with more power,

794
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,579
especially if it had four-wheel
drive, it would be brilliant.

795
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,410
It would.

796
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:30,149
There we are, we have succeed where
the Bank of England has failed.

797
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,219
We have solved the country's
financial crisis.

798
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,259
And I think we will get marquises now.

799
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,410
I suspect so, yes.

800
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,999
So on that bombshell, it's time to end.

801
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,480
Thank you very much for
watching, good night.
