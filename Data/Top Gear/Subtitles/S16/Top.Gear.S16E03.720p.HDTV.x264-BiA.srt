2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight: A fat man gets murdered,
a donkey gets overtaken,

3
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:21,480
and James wears ladies' underwear
on his head.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,980
Hello. Hello, good evening.

5
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,487
Welcome. Welcome, everybody.

6
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,021
Thank you. Thank you so much.

7
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:38,485
Now, we begin with a letter.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,320
It says, "Dear Top Gear, I'm a
leading light in the Albanian Mafia

9
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:48,120
"and I'm thinking of buying the
new baby Rolls-Royce, the Ghost.

10
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:52,445
"But how does it compare to,
say, a Bentley or a Mercedes?

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,960
"Yours sincerely, Normanski Ataesi. " Now
this caused one hell of a row in the office.

12
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,885
The producers said we should go
out to Albania and do the test.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,360
We said, "No, we can't be seen to be
helping the Mafia. " We were adamant.

14
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:10,360
We said, "This is our line
in the sand, we will not go!"

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,120
You join me on the ferry from Corfu to
Albania and here is the car in question,

16
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:25,125
the new Rolls-Royce Ghost -

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,160
ã200,000 of power,
prestige and... peeled cows.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,400
And this Mercedes
is the alternative -

19
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,845
the twin turbo-charged V12 S65.

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,080
In short, the most powerful
saloon car in the world.

21
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:46,245
And this is where the
Bentley Mulsanne should be,

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,840
but just a few days before
we were due to come out here,

23
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,480
Bentley decided
not to take part in the film.

24
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:55,005
So no Bentley?

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,100
No. So you're going to tell a
leading light of the Albanian Mafia

26
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:01,160
you couldn't bring them their
car because it was a bit difficult.

27
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:04,440
No, I've made an
alternative arrangement.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,920
And when we arrived the alternative
arrangement was waiting for us.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,365
It's a Yugo. Yes.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,400
But in a number of critical ways, it is exactly the
same as the new Bentley Mulsanne. Listen to this.

31
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:26,685
There you go.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,765
That's the same sort of
dull aristocratic whump.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,445
Four door. There's a hole on
the outside you put the fuel in.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,160
Yeah, engine at the front, rear drive, probably.
Drive it from there. From that wheel there.

35
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:40,057
It is
- for this mission, it's exactly the same as the Bentley Mulsanne,

36
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:43,920
in the same way that Roy Hattersley
is the same as a tub of lard. Yes.

37
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,800
This is the perfect car for the job.

38
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,645
Can't say that. What?

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,560
You can't say that word, the C-word.
I didn't, did I?

40
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:56,685
Not that C-word, the other C-word.
Car? Yes.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,800
Car? You can't say that,
car here means gentleman's sausage.

42
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:06,845
Really? What? That's why
they all watch Top Gear in Albania.

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,165
Funnier even than Norman
Wisdom, you make show about...

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,040
So when I say, "My car's enormous... " That's the
funniest thing in the world they've ever heard.

45
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,245
They tune in every week.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
We do a car show.
Yes, but you can't say car or peach.

47
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,045
Peach? Don't say peach?

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,280
What does that mean? Lady garden.
So this car's a peach is really bad.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,560
With the ground rules established, we headed
inland into the rain to begin the road test.

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Let's get one thing absolutely clear from the
start - the Ghost is not a bespoke Rolls-Royce,

51
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,677
not like the Phantom,
the bigger one.

52
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:52,525
This one underneath
is a BMW 7 Series.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,000
However, everything you see, everything you
touch, everything you feel, it's all Rolls-Royce.

54
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:02,640
It's chuffing marvellous,
this ca... motor.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,480
At ã160,000, the S Class
is ã40,000 less than the Ghost.

56
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,325
But it's not like they have skimped.

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,640
I've never driven anything where you get such
a sense of there being a lot of things going on

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,445
in the background, to keep you safe,
to keep you on the road.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,525
Everywhere I look there's a little
light comes on to let you know -

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,925
one there to tell me it's a 30 kilometre
an hour speed limit around here.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,480
It just knows that and I have never
experienced a car this big and so powerful.

62
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:40,685
I can't believe
I said car this big.

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,840
In the Mulsanne, however... I must say
I'm terribly disappointed by the Bentley.

64
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,365
It is the most expensive...

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Oh, God, strewth! I'm going off.
No, I managed to... Jesus wept!

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,005
It is the most expensive penis
of the three,

67
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,680
ã220,000, and from where
I am sitting, it is hard to see why.

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, crunch. What the hell
were Bentley thinking of?

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,680
Even by Albanian standards,
it was absolute rubbish.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,000
Until 1991, Albania was probably the
most extreme Marxist state in the world.

71
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,000
One man, who owned a cafe, got 18 years in jail
for telling a customer he didn't have a spoon.

72
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:41,485
Another guy pointed at Corfu
over there and said,

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,600
"Why have they got a light in their
harbour and we haven't?" He got 25 years.

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,400
And soon we were reminded of the dark
days because the road just sort of stopped.

75
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:58,880
And to make things worse, instead
of white lines, they'd used rocks.

76
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Let's not view this as a bad thing, it is
at least a chance to test the car's ride.

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,325
As far as I'm concerned, the road
merely changes colour occasionally.

78
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,440
I am quite surprised because this is an AMG-tuned
Merc, which you would expect to be a very firm thing.

79
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:25,760
It's coping with this very well.
However, in the Bentley...

80
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,920
This has to be the least
refined car I've ever driven.

81
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,485
This is simply intolerable.

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,285
ã220,000 for this. Oh, God, it's...

83
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,285
Yeah, you got hooked
up on a cat's eye, mate.

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Let's - can we - if one pushes and two lift
the wheel arches... We just lift it off. Heave!

85
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:53,917
The bumper is in deep trouble here.

86
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:57,085
Yes. Just drive it back, hang on.

87
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,480
That is wedged. That's sad to
see a Bentley treated in such a...

88
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Nice It's off.

89
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,485
Tough thing!

90
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,360
Fortunately, the rough road soon ended.
Unfortunately, it ended at an Albanian river crossing.

91
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,085
That's not the ferry, is it? Yes.

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,800
That's a raft,
rather than a ferry, isn't it?

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,880
Still, it wasn't like the cars we'd
be loading were valuable, or heavy.

94
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:33,520
It's not even fastened together.
It's driftwood.

95
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,485
Have seen the captain's chair?

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,000
That's the most incredible thing I've seen
- it's got five legs, it's got five legs.

97
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:45,000
Despite the peril,
James volunteered to go first.

98
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:48,245
Ha-ha-ha!

99
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,520
No, no. You're all right now.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, my God. What worries me is the Bentley
is 2.8 tonnes, it's the heaviest by far.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,280
Wow. I guess because it's in the
middle, it didn't have the same effect.

102
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,405
We're off.

103
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,400
We are now leaving the shore on an old piece of
flotsam with over half a million quids worth of cars.

104
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,245
This is the best ferry
I've ever been on.

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,640
It is the worst I've ever been on. This is the worst
thing I've ever been on. It's absolutely terrible.

106
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:30,880
Eventually, HMS Driftwood deposited
us gracefully on the other side.

107
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,685
Oh, no. And as we drove
on, we realised that one

108
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,520
benefit of the Mercedes, if you're a
Mafia boss, is that you do blend in.

109
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:47,040
Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes.

110
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:49,165
Mercedes. Mercedes.

111
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,880
Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes.

112
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,160
Look at them all.

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,925
Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes.

114
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,800
It turns out that a staggering 80% of all
cars registered in Albania are old Mercs.

115
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:09,485
But that said,
English cars are popular too -

116
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,320
a point we discussed when we
pulled over for afternoon tea.

117
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:19,205
Apparently, what happens is,
Albanians go to England,

118
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,085
get a job, buy a car, and then
bring it back with them here.

119
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,525
Right. It is quite traditional when you
bring a car back like that that you drive it

120
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,400
around with the door locks pulled out and sometimes
little marks along the back of the door, the trailing edge.

121
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:40,045
They have a tradition here of filing off any numbers
they find under the bonnet. That's to save weight.

122
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,360
Oh, is it? Yes, that's why they do it, all the VIN
numbers, identifying plates, that makes the car lighter.

123
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh I see.
Weight-saving measures are important.

124
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,280
Some of them, though, are stolen.

125
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,685
No! Give up!

126
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm afraid they are. After tea, the sun came out,
so we hit the coast road and went for a nice cruise.

127
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,485
Well, it was nice for me.

128
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,640
God! The power of this thing and the
acceleration it makes possible is mind-blowing.

129
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:20,245
It's weird, actually,
because it's so quiet.

130
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,800
There's always noise when you go fast
and yet, in this, there really isn't.

131
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:32,240
The beans, oh! It doesn't encourage
you to be sporty, or aggressive.

132
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:36,925
It's just so nice.

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,725
It's nice in the Rolls-Royce.

134
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,880
But then my nice time was
ruined by news from the Bentley.

135
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:47,405
Oh, no, the Mulsanne is overheating.

136
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,400
We stopped to let the twin turbo V8
cool, but then... it decided to die.

137
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,020
No.
So I tried a reverse bump start.

138
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:02,600
He's done that wrong. The brakes!

139
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:03,760
No.

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,565
The door mirror's come off!

141
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,600
It's suddenly dawned upon me
that he isn't very bright.

142
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,560
I think he could be a massive idiot.

143
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,565
The door mirror!

144
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,120
How long will he go before...?
Well...

145
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,405
Oh, no.

146
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,365
Just get it away from the wall.

147
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,645
It's the steepest hill in
Albania you've broken down on.

148
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,560
While we examined the engine, the
orang-utan tried to mend the door.

149
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,720
Then an Albanian mechanic
arrived and Jeremy filled him in.

150
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,885
Running, then stop.

151
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,800
That describes most breakdowns.

152
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:54,645
Running and then stop, you idiot!

153
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,920
Don't say to that man,
"My car needs a jump. "

154
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,880
Yes. Yes.

155
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,405
The Bentley is running well.

156
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,600
It had been a long and tiring day on
the road, but for Hammond, that was OK.

157
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:15,925
This S Class has a
new system on board.

158
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,285
It just monitors the driver to make
sure he or she isn't getting sleepy,

159
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,420
or wandering out of the lane, or nodding off, and
it's monitoring 70 different parameters about me.

160
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:32,247
That must include whether or not I like different
types of cheese, or if I'm thinking about hats.

161
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:39,040
I was on life-support in an intensive care unit
and they weren't monitoring 70 things about me.

162
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,040
Soon, we arrived at a
disused submarine base.

163
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,720
And Jeremy insisted we should stop.

164
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,597
I am a mountain goat. Oh!

165
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:02,405
That was close.

166
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,805
Yes.
I love the idea of sneaky warfare.

167
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,480
If there were to be a war tomorrow, and I had
to volunteer for some service, definitely subs.

168
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:14,880
Which is ironic - can you imagine a
place where you'd be less welcome.

169
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:16,725
I wonder if they're for sale.

170
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,440
What are you going to do
with a submarine, Jeremy?

171
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, drive about in it.

172
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,240
With the sun going down,
I was dragged away from the sub pen

173
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,805
so we could get back
to our Mafia road test.

174
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,405
We've had a discussion, and we reckon
that when someone from the Albanian Mafia

175
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,800
is choosing a new car, uppermost in his mind
will be this: "Can I get a dead body in the boot?"

176
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:48,045
Makes sense.
That is why the car has a boot.

177
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Stands to reason. Unfortunately, to find out which
of the cars is best, we've had to murder a passer-by.

178
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:56,805
Yeah. And here he is.

179
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,280
As you can see, he's quite a big
chap, so he took a lot of murdering.

180
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:02,965
And now James is going to see

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,920
if he can get him in the boot
of the Rolls-Royce.

182
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:09,400
Am I? Yes. You go first, yes. OK.

183
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
That's a good start. Look at that.

184
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:16,965
What? He was a member of a gym.

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,525
He was not! Could we have murdered
someone a bit smaller? Not really.

186
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,720
He was the only one we could catch.
Anyone smaller would have been faster.

187
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:27,440
Come on, James, the police
could be on their way.

188
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,360
I can't lift him up.
Three, two, one and up.

189
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,925
No, it's not working.

190
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:40,520
OK. This was hopeless. So rather embarrassingly,
we had to ask the man we murdered to give us a hand.

191
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:44,205
It's not so much the
head, but everything else.

192
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,040
All we have to do now is
saw his leg. Wait a minute.

193
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,165
Just get that in there.

194
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,760
Bend that back round there. Yes!

195
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,885
Yes! Yes. Excellent.

196
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,245
The great thing about the Rolls-Royce
is, it has self-levelling rear suspension,

197
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,880
so when the boot is shut you won't know from the
way it's riding that there is a body in there.

198
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,685
Except the boot won't go down.

199
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,280
Right, you get him out and put
him in the back of the Benz.

200
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,645
Get him out?

201
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,365
'Sadly, there's a fridge in
the boot of the Merc,

202
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,520
'which takes up a lot of room. '
Is that it? Can you move that knee?

203
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,205
No chance!

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,680
That meant our dead body
wouldn't fit.

205
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,485
Nobody wants to see that.

206
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,360
And even though he did fit in the
Bentley, there was still a problem.

207
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:37,597
Mate, you can see him. Look.

208
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:40,765
That is a drawback. Clearly.

209
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
You might as well just put him
in the passenger seat.

210
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,285
James, Richard, bad news.

211
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,240
What? Do you see the girl
with the red beret on? Yeah.

212
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:58,765
She's from Albania. Hello!

213
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,160
And can we just ask, is it right
that the word "car" means...

214
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:06,217
Yes.

215
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,750
And "peach"?

216
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,405
Yes.

217
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,400
I thought you'd made it up.
No, we didn't make it up.

218
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,885
She's actually from Albania.
Fair enough.

219
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,965
I have got some more information
on this, er...

220
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,920
You know in the film I said that
some of the cars might be stolen?

221
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:28,837
I know, you did, that was shocking!
Yes, it was.

222
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:31,685
Anyway, I've got some information
here on it.

223
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,600
Albania's public order minister was on his way to
Greece to sign an agreement with his opposite number

224
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:43,480
on cross-border crime, and as a formality the Greek
police did a check on his car and it was nicked.

225
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:47,525
And just so I balance this out,

226
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,760
neighbouring Macedonia, the interior
minister was very embarrassed

227
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:57,960
when police noticed her car was
actually registered to David Beckham.

228
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,845
That happens to footballers a lot.

229
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,400
Two AC Milan players had their Range Rovers
nicked. D'you know where they turned up?

230
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:08,605
Bournemouth? No, it was Albania.
Was it really?

231
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,485
It was. I have to say - and not
just because you're here -

232
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,400
genuinely, Albania is a fascinating,
brilliant country, very pretty too.

233
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:22,280
Beautiful. Anyway, it's now time
to do the news. We begin with this.

234
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,685
Honda, which is a Japanese
car company,

235
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,125
they've developed a hat that knows
what your hair is thinking

236
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,400
and then translates those thoughts in
such a way that it can drive the car.

237
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:41,480
Have you gone completely mad? No,
seriously, I absolutely haven't.

238
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:46,045
They say that hair transmits
neurological information. Yeah.

239
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,480
The hat picks that up, translates it, so if
you think, "I'd like to turn the wipers on,"

240
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,560
your hat knows that
and the wipers go on.

241
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:55,040
Cos your hair tells you. Your hair?

242
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,805
Your hair cannot drive a car.

243
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,480
Your hair isn't very good at
being hair! In fairness, really.

244
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,200
What if you'd had a hair transplant?

245
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,205
Gordon Ramsay!

246
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,725
Yeah, exactly. Gordon Ramsay, no,
wait, wait, wait! Think about it,

247
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,320
if he's stopped for speeding, he can go, "It wasn't
me, I bought my hair from a man in Los Angeles. "

248
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,285
Are we heading for a future where
a policeman stops you and says,

249
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,685
"Do you know how fast your hair was
going, sir?" It's out of my hands.

250
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,800
Does it have to be your hair... on your
head... Enough! If I buy some pants?

251
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,360
What, Honda pants?

252
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,880
But imagine, 17-year-olds think down
there a lot, don't they?

253
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,965
Imagine a 17-year-old boy
driving with his pubes.

254
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,720
A million miles an hour!
It'd be terrifying. Listen...

255
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,925
Ferrari - let's get it back to cars.

256
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,840
Ferrari has made a new car. It's
their first-ever 4-wheel drive car,

257
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,525
their first-ever hatchback.

258
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,365
There's a picture here,
it's called the FF.

259
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,925
It's got a V12 direct-injection
engine, 6.2 litre,

260
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,120
208 miles an hour, it's going to
cost ã250,000, which is a lot,

261
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,920
but I think that's fantastic.
It's a return to what I call

262
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,925
the shooting brake,
the two-plus-two estate.

263
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,460
We haven't seen one of those
since the Lancia HPE.

264
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:18,925
Ooh, yes. And do you remember
the Volvo P1800ES?

265
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,445
That wasn't very brilliant, though.
No, it was terrible, but it looked good.

266
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,900
It looked brilliant. And the Reliant Scimitar, which
you can see... Ah-hum! You've forgotten the rules!

267
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:33,320
The law of the land states, if you say "Reliant
Scimitar" you have to have a comma and then say...

268
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:36,125
Princess Anne has one of those,
you know?

269
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,285
But you say it in such a way that
you assume no-one else knows.

270
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,725
It's extraordinary, I can't think of another
person who is so associated with a car.

271
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,960
Nobody ever says, "Henry Kissinger had an Escort
RS2000." He didn't, though, did he, let's be honest.

272
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:51,920
She is commonly thought of as being
the hardest working Royal.

273
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,957
She does a lot of work
for a lot of people,

274
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,925
raises millions of pounds
all over the world.

275
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,160
Yet she's still just known for having
a Reliant Scimitar. It must be annoying.

276
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:04,205
If you think about it - her daughter
is getting married later this year.

277
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,460
You just know the commentary. They'll wheel
out a Dimbleby and the commentary will be,

278
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:12,680
"There's the bride's mother looking radiant
- she has a Reliant Scimitar, you know. "

279
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:17,405
It will. I've never driven
a Reliant Scimitar, you know?

280
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,765
I know someone who's got one. Do
you? Yeah, Princess Anne. Oh, right.

281
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,840
You know the Fiat 500. We love it. There's a new one
- the Fiat 500 Twin Air.

282
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,925
It's got a tiny 875cc
2- cylinder engine in there

283
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,440
and it produces so little CO2 that it's free
to go in the congestion charging zone in London.

284
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:38,097
Great little thing. When I heard
it had a 2-cylinder engine,

285
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:40,685
I thought that won't move,
but it goes like the clappers.

286
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,840
It sounds like a billion hornets
stuck in someone's bicycle spokes.

287
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,205
Brrrrrr! It's just fantastic!

288
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,680
There is one problem with this
fuel-saving car, though. What?

289
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:55,805
It uses quite a lot of fuel.
Yes, it does.

290
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,845
Can't argue with that.
We did a test last week.

291
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,920
We left the track here, went back to
London - so a bit of country road,

292
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:06,925
bit of dual carriageway, bit of
city driving, and it averaged 38mpg.

293
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,260
We did the same route in a Volkswagen
Polo Bluemotion and that did 50mpg.

294
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:17,560
So we have a Top Gear top tip. If
you want to buy a car to save fuel,

295
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:19,925
buy this one and don't save any.

296
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,160
You won't save anything, but you will have an
enormous amount of fun not saving any money.

297
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:27,165
That's what it's for.
That's fine by me.

298
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,485
You know Breakfast News
on television? No, not really.

299
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:37,120
You must. Earlier this week they ran a story about
cyclists wearing video cameras on their crash helmets. Yeah.

300
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:41,600
So they can video examples of road
rage and people cutting them up.

301
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,205
But cyclists deserve it.

302
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,680
Don't say that. But they do.
Just the other week... Honestly,

303
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,725
I'm sitting in a traffic jam,
in London,

304
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,445
and a Frenchman tried to cycle
between the pavement and my car

305
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,005
and after he'd removed most of the
paint with the brake handle thing,

306
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,920
he came round to the driver's door to tell me
off in that silly accent French people have.

307
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:03,085
A French accent. Yes, that.

308
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,880
I said to him, "If you just work harder,
you could have a car. " Oh, you see...!

309
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:11,777
YOU are exactly the reason why I want
a camera on my helmet when I cycle.

310
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:15,640
Why? So when idiots like you get
out of their car, having cut me up...

311
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,605
Who pays the road tax? Well...
I'm sorry.

312
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,880
I don't mind if cyclists want to come on the
road with their silly Victorian distractions.

313
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:25,965
But they must behave themselves.

314
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,885
There are a few militant cyclists...
You're one of them.

315
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,120
I'm not a militant cyclist. You are.
On a bicycle, you are a peach.

316
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,205
Actually, you're a peach most of
the time, but you're a big peach.

317
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,160
You're just another fat car in his Mercedes and
has a pop at me for riding my bike to work...

318
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:49,277
You always do, don't you? Often.
Yesterday I saw you riding to work,

319
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:53,360
and I thought, that bicycle looks
exactly like a 1967 Ford Mustang.

320
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,997
Yeah, well... always ride it, no.

321
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:58,565
Right, that is the end of the news.

322
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,040
Now, what we have here is a Ford Sierra
Cosworth and a Ford Escort Cosworth.

323
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:09,440
I like these cars very much,
which is why I am delighted to say

324
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:13,840
that after a 15-year gap,
the Cosworth name is back.

325
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,680
But not where
you might be expecting it.

326
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,960
Here it is, on the back of a Subaru.

327
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,360
And in theory, that's a marriage

328
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,405
made in heaven.

329
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,200
You see, what Cosworth is really good at
is taking ordinary, boring family saloons

330
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:43,765
and turning them
into street-fighting,

331
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,965
come-on-if-you-think-you're
hard-enough road racers

332
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,920
with fiery nostrils and a Geordie
Saturday night attitude to peace and love.

333
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,720
But what they've done here is
take a dreary Impreza SDI

334
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:03,880
and throw most of it away.

335
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,920
The 2.5 litre flat-four engine is
fitted with new pistons, bearings,

336
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:14,405
conrods, gaskets and head nuts,

337
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,840
along with a totally reworked
oil pump, turbo charger,

338
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,925
intercooler, intake system
and exhaust.

339
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,920
There have been similar modifications elsewhere
- new wheels, tyres,

340
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:29,017
springs, dampers, bushings
and brakes.

341
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:33,080
It's not really a Subaru any more,
is it?

342
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,560
So, is it any good?

343
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,805
In a word, quite.

344
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,160
Certainly, it does capture some of the magic
we used to get from old Subaru Imprezas.

345
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,080
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

346
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,925
Even when you think all is lost -

347
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,040
sliding - oh, no, you just give it
a dab of power, like that,

348
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:08,800
and even in rain like this,
it isn't lost any more.

349
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,085
Other nice things?

350
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,640
Well, it rides beautifully for
such a limpet mine, and it is quick.

351
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,000
0-60 takes 3.5 seconds.

352
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,560
But there's a huge amount
of turbo lag.

353
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm now in fifth gear, 60mph,
foot down...

354
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,560
.. nothing.

355
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,725
Still nothing.

356
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,805
Hang on a minute, hang on...

357
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,920
No, I was mistaken, sorry,
still nothing.

358
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,405
There is another issue, too.

359
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,920
Cosworths are supposed to be rough-and-ready
cars for people who work with ladders.

360
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:02,525
They're supposed to be
a cheap-and-cheerful way

361
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,400
of embarrassing the Ruperts
and the Joneses in their Ferraris,

362
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:11,125
but this is as near as makes
no difference ã50,000,

363
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,000
and with all that turbo lag, all you're
going to embarrass really is... yourself.

364
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,520
Still nothing.

365
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,200
So, if the Subaru's no good,
what else is there?

366
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,440
Well, there's this.

367
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,600
It's the Ford Focus RS500,
and let's not mess about...

368
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:42,640
it's brilliant.

369
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
Ha-ha!

370
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,220
It has a 2.5 litre turbo-charged
engine, just like the Subaru,

371
00:26:58,255 --> 00:27:04,480
not quite as powerful, but you still
get 345 brake horsepower...

372
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,160
.. all of which is sent
to the front wheels.

373
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,480
That sounds like the recipe
for a massive accident.

374
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:19,917
But it isn't.

375
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,320
This is really very, very good.

376
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,645
Of course, you do get a fair bit
of torque steer.

377
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,200
Watch the steering wheel when I put
my foot down. Hands off, here we go,

378
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:34,165
and... yeah, we've turned right.

379
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,205
And right again. Every time
the turbo cuts in, you turn right.

380
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,920
But, thanks to a clever front
differential, the grip is incredible.

381
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,680
It's also extremely fast.

382
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,600
The top speed, they say, is 165mph.

383
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,560
165- that means this Ford Focus

384
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:11,600
is 10mph faster than a BMW M5.

385
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,800
Since that is now 150...

386
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,965
155...

387
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,440
yeah, I'll believe them.

388
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,040
This is a really well-sorted car.

389
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,920
Well-equipped too, with voice
activated keyless Bluetooth.

390
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:35,577
And to top it off, it's ã35,000,

391
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:38,926
nearly ã15,000 less than the Subaru.

392
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:42,205
So if you're after
a family hatchback

393
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,680
that's vaguely yobbish and very
fast, this is your obvious choice.

394
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:49,320
Or is it?

395
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,800
This is a Volvo.

396
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,320
But, before you leap
to conclusions...

397
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,360
.. watch this.

398
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,520
I'm in the Volvo!

399
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,800
Go! It's a good start.

400
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,880
And look at this!

401
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,720
The Hush Puppy is beating
the Reeboks.

402
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,880
Oh, yes! Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

403
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
Yes!

404
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,920
The pensioner is victorious.

405
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,760
So, what is it, then, this deafening,
electric-blue streak from the frozen North?

406
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,405
Well, it uses exactly the same
turbo-charged 2.5 litre engine

407
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,640
that Ford use in the hot Focus, but
in this it's all turned up to 27...

408
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:18,977
or 86 or 109 because it produces,

409
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:22,280
as near as makes no difference,

410
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:24,400
400 horsepower.

411
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,725
Small wonder they called it the PCP

412
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,040
cos it really is like driving around
in a cloud of angel dust.

413
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,960
Brrrrrrrr!

414
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:46,597
Listen to that!

415
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,640
Of course, you probably think
it will all fall to pieces

416
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:55,280
when it sees a corner. But, no.

417
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,180
It has, I'm delighted to say on
a day like today, four-wheel-drive,

418
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:09,720
so the grip is just phenomenal
and you can reach amazing angles

419
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:10,840
and still rescue it.

420
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,640
It was built for fun by the team
that makes the Volvos

421
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:21,520
for the Swedish
Touring Car Championship

422
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,205
and it is genuinely remarkable.

423
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,300
Really sharp, really hard,
really raw,

424
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:31,360
and it just goes like the clappers.

425
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,600
To top it all off, the PCP
is based on a normal Volvo C30,

426
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,000
which we on Top Gear
think is the best-looking

427
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,925
of all the small hatchbacks.

428
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,565
Inside, the steering wheel,
the gear lever, the doors,

429
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,920
the seats, everything, is covered
in what appears to be mole skin.

430
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,040
And that does make you wonder
how big was the mole

431
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,480
they peeled to make this piece?

432
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,720
This car is epic, but there is
one quite large problem with it.

433
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:16,440
Volvo refuses point blank
to put it into production.

434
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,200
Pity.

435
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,040
Wow. It's a shame. That Volvo does
just sound incredible. Amazing.

436
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:34,777
But because they're not actually
making it, you would have the Focus?

437
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:39,480
The problem is, they only made
500 of these and they're sold out.

438
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:42,440
Right. So if you want a very
hot hatch, it's got to be

439
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:44,365
the not so good Subaru?

440
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,720
They only made 75 of those
and they are sold out, as well.

441
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:53,005
Hang on, you have just spent
nine minutes of our lives

442
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,360
reviewing two cars you can't buy
and one that doesn't exist?

443
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:57,765
Yes, I have. Thank you.

444
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Yes, I have. Now, we must find out
how fast they go round our track.

445
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:06,040
Not the Volvo, because this board
is for production cars only,

446
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:07,765
so, the other two.

447
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,000
That, of course, means handing them
to our tame racing driver.

448
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:17,005
Some say he once tore a goat in half

449
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,920
and that he's now regretting
buying his new holiday home

450
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:23,000
in downtown Cairo.

451
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,645
All we know is,
he's called the Stig.

452
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,600
And they're off. The track is damp
and that should mean

453
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,680
the four-wheel-drive Subaru
has the advantage over

454
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:35,337
the front-wheel-drive Ford.

455
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:36,925
Let's see in the first corner.

456
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Coming in wide and...
let's have a look.

457
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:44,160
Oh, it's the Imprezza,
getting out of shape.

458
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,340
Absolutely no idea
why he is listening to that.

459
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,827
Now, the Ford coming out there,
looking OK, good.

460
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:58,991
That trick dif pulling it straight
in the Hammerhead.

461
00:33:59,026 --> 00:34:02,120
Let's watch out for understeer
from either of them...

462
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,365
No, all pretty tidy.

463
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,360
So, here we are, two turbo-charged
slingshots on to the straight.

464
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,085
Into Follow-through...

465
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,760
Ooh, Stig drifting
the Subaru like a mad one!

466
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,220
Imprezzas normally
look like a gum disease.

467
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:25,685
This one is a gum disease
with a spoiler on it.

468
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,720
And with those blacked windows,
the Ford looks like a van.

469
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:31,285
Just Gambon left.

470
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,280
Two hatchback drabs
coming through there.

471
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,840
And across the line!

472
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,980
I have the times here.
And the Focus did it

473
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:48,485
in 1.30.8.
So, wet track, in between two 911s.

474
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,960
The Subaru, though, I think, thanks
to four-wheel-drive, did it in

475
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:57,485
1.27.7, so that goes there, look.

476
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,960
That's some useful consumer advice,
if you are thinking of buying

477
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:04,077
any of them, which you aren't,
because you can't. Thanks

478
00:35:04,112 --> 00:35:07,160
Let's move on now.
It's time, in fact, to put a star

479
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,045
in our reasonably-priced car.

480
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,805
My guest tonight
is a prodigious tweeter.

481
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,800
He tweeted only this morning
to say he was going to appear

482
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:17,120
on the show dressed as a Mexican.

483
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, Jonathan Ross!

484
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,680
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello. Hello, Jeremy.

485
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:30,600
Very well. How are you? I'm good.
Have a seat.

486
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,645
What?

487
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,760
I brought my Mexican
wrestling mask along,

488
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:38,680
so you can apologise in person.

489
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:40,445
Put it away.

490
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,605
There's just no possibility of us
mentioning Mexico this week.

491
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,400
We mentioned it maybe twice, I think we have
got away with it. You are back on the BBC?

492
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm back, who thought that would
happen? Not me. I had 20 quid on it.

493
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,420
Are you a bit nervous?

494
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:56,787
No. Why, should I be?

495
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,085
No, back on the Beeb.

496
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,280
I thought you were going
to come out to me.

497
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,600
At least you have chosen
to come back on a show

498
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,797
that never gets into trouble.
Exactly.

499
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,925
And I'm a safe booking for you.
Exactly.

500
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,360
Listen... do you have Tourette's
or do you know what you're doing?

501
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,200
BLEEP BLEEP, you BLEEP!

502
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,360
Oh no, I don't. Did that come out?

503
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,257
Yeah, you said it out loud.

504
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,085
For me, that was just in there.

505
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,800
No, I don't have Tourette's,
Mr Clarkson, but I do sometimes

506
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,937
maybe go a little bit further
than other people.

507
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:34,005
I always thought that was
part of what I should do.

508
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,840
You are paid to do certain things and feel you
should push things in a certain way and put it out.

509
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:41,897
You had David Cameron on the show
and asked him if - what's the word

510
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:45,920
I can use? - pleasured himself
while thinking about Mrs Thatcher?

511
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,765
Yes. You did say that?

512
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,845
And then there was Gwyneth Paltrow.

513
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,640
You said you would like
to make a bouncy-bouncy!

514
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:57,400
Look, when you were driven round
by Cameron Diaz,

515
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:59,520
what were you thinking? Oh.

516
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:00,857
Yes.

517
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,100
We know what you were thinking. Many bad
things. You didn't say it out loud, but I was...

518
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:10,040
The show I had on the BBC, certainly part of
the fun of it and part of what we were doing

519
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:13,005
was doing something very much
of the moment and that was the joke.

520
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,285
I would stand by that, even though
that was one of the complaints upheld,

521
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,680
not made by Cameron, by the way. who I would
still love to... Cameron? David Cameron?

522
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:23,605
Cameron Diaz. Oh, Cameron Diaz!

523
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,320
I thought you were coming out to David Cameron
- a terrifying prospect.

524
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:31,000
I'd rather come out to Nick Clegg.
He looks so much easier to dominate!

525
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,240
We are living in strange times.
We must be careful that we don't

526
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,160
trip up over anybody,
which means...

527
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:40,720
We can't talk about anything.

528
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:42,325
Well, your beard...

529
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,565
Lovely. We might upset
beards and beardmen.

530
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,000
Why have you grown a beard?
Why have I grown a beard? Mmm.

531
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,645
It's easier than getting up
and shaving, for a start,

532
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,120
because you only do this - zzz, zzz,
zzz. I did take a really big chunk

533
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:56,605
out the bottom the other day,

534
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,005
because I've got one where you
set it and it takes a bit,

535
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,560
but I had it on the wrong one, my wife was
talking, I went, "Yes, darling. " and I had

536
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:04,360
a reverse Mohawk,
with a big stripe up there.

537
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,445
The opposite of a Brazilian?

538
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,805
Yes, I do use the same one down
there, to trim up the old fella,

539
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,160
because otherwise you get to our age
and you can't see anything there.

540
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:16,480
I should explain, we are - we don't
look it - but we are the same age.

541
00:38:16,515 --> 00:38:18,200
Man, what happened to you?!

542
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,340
Well, I'm now... You were going
there, I had to get in first!

543
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,527
I now walk up stairs. Do you?
Yeah. Have you never walked up?

544
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:29,680
What did you used to do - crawl
on your belly like a snake?

545
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,565
No, do you not do exercise?

546
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,085
I do. I'm quite strong
at the moment, but a bit flabby.

547
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,560
Can you do those things where you
lie on the floor, you basically do

548
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:41,000
a press up and then just hold
it there? A plank, yes. You cannot.

549
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,520
What's wrong with you?
You made out of jelly?

550
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,005
Get your clock out.
Get your BLEEP out?! I'm going.

551
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,480
At least my hearing's still working!
What's wrong with you?!

552
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:54,920
Get down on the floor. I bet you
I can do one for longer. Go!

553
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,520
I can be here for hours. I can be
here for hours. Are you in a rush?

554
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:05,320
My arms are starting to wobble quite
badly now. They're not. They are.

555
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,480
That was just bullying!

556
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,280
Otherwise, we would have been there for
hours. I can do that, literally, all day.

557
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,605
That is not an exercise.
It is an exercise.

558
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,080
That is not an exercise.
All you have done is freeze

559
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:25,080
your joints in place,
that's not an exercise.

560
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,340
Give me a minute. It is hard,
isn't it? I'm sweating quite badly.

561
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:37,445
You grow this. Now we have
passed 50, this has just appeared.

562
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,800
I have no clue what you're saying. I want to talk
about cars. People buy cars for different reasons.

563
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:45,600
I buy them because they're loud, James
May buys them because they're brown.

564
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,365
Looking at yours,
you buy them because they're stupid.

565
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,760
Well, you might think stupid, but one
man's stupid is another man's cute and fun.

566
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:55,480
Pink Ford Thunderbird?
I've got the Thunderbird.

567
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:56,965
It is quite stupid.

568
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,480
No, it's pretty. I don't like driving
around seeing all cars look the same.

569
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:03,717
I like Hammond, what's happened
to him recently? He's got very...

570
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:06,920
In what way? He looks like -
imagine if you asked a girlie girl

571
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,000
to decorate a scarecrow, that's him.

572
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,800
Somebody's bought him an Adam and the
Ants video. He's wearing a necklace.

573
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:15,525
♪ Stand and deliver. ♪

574
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,600
Does he think he's on his gap-year?

575
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,220
At least May, you know he's going
to be dull before you see him.

576
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:25,320
I don't much like Jonathan
Ross, he's much too flamboyant.

577
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:27,085
He didn't like me at all.

578
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,900
Stop changing the subject.
Pink Thunderbird?

579
00:40:29,935 --> 00:40:32,645
It's coral pink
and I love convertibles.

580
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,820
If it's not raining, even if it's Arctic, I
will have... in the snow, I had my roof down.

581
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:40,960
Just tell me, when you are driving along then
and people can see it is you and everything...

582
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,680
Are people appreciative or do they say other
things? They love it. "Hey, Wossy", all the time.

583
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:50,405
The other ones -
a Messerschmitt and a bubble car.

584
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,685
Is that two... The Messerschmitt
has got the seat behind each other.

585
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,120
It's like a two-stroke engine, but it's really
weird, because if you want to go in reverse,

586
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:02,160
you press the key and when you do the
ignition, the solenoid drops to the back.

587
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:04,805
So you can get in fourth gear
in reverse. You can.

588
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,320
You can go to something like 50mph in
reverse in something which is like a lunchbox.

589
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,240
You've got kids, family and all that.
There's nothing in that list where you say,

590
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,960
"Come on, kids, I'll take you in... "

591
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,300
The one we use for the family
is the car we have had the longest,

592
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:23,427
which is, we've got a Toyota Previa,
bought second hand 12 years ago,

593
00:41:23,462 --> 00:41:26,520
and we've had any number of scrapes
in it. The dogs have been sick,

594
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:29,165
people have
dropped drinks everywhere.

595
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,840
I think my wife did a wee once on
a long journey. We've all done it!

596
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:36,445
I was saying to her the other day,
"You know what is a brilliant idea,

597
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,200
"we should get together and get some business,
go and see the Dragons. " If you had a car seat,

598
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:43,405
on a long journey, pull out a little
thing and it's a potty.

599
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,320
Then when you go along, press a button, a little
panel opens up underneath the car like on a plane,

600
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:50,717
drops the poo and the wee
out on the motorway.

601
00:41:50,752 --> 00:41:53,080
Or outside someone's house
you don't like.

602
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,000
I think we've managed to get through the interview
part of the interview without too much of a problem.

603
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:01,360
Thank Allah for that!

604
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,420
That's fine. That's all right.
That's positive.

605
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:08,205
That's all encompassing,
that is multi-cultural.

606
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,960
If you do have a problem,
write to us, at Jonathan Ross, ITV.

607
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,340
So we get on now,
of course, to your lap. Yes.

608
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,760
The last time you were here,
you got lost.

609
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:20,845
No, I didn't get lost.

610
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,285
Well... you stopped at the Hammerhead
and went like this...

611
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,160
Because I couldn't... All right, because there
was no-one there to give directions and the

612
00:42:29,195 --> 00:42:32,440
track had disappeared under a large,
let's call it a lake, shall we?

613
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:36,485
It was a very rainy day, and I
went, apparently, over the line.

614
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,240
Because you are clearly threatened by me, the
Alpha male, you took time off me for that reason.

615
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,725
You've got that arthritis
in your finger.

616
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,560
No, this is a tragic story from my youth. I
chopped the top of my finger off when I was two,

617
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:50,605
because my mum had gone out to
borrow food from the neighbours -

618
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,360
this sounds so bleak and poverty-ridden
- I apparently crawled to the bin

619
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:59,117
and got a can of beans out and then
sliced my finger off on the top.

620
00:42:59,152 --> 00:43:02,840
And you see the stitch marks,
if you look closely. Look at that.

621
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,160
I did mine skiing in St Moritz!

622
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,280
Anyway, who would like
to see Jonathan's lap?

623
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:12,285
Yes!

624
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,000
Let's have a look.

625
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,960
Right. Ooh, I say we're determined.

626
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,885
Is that a good start? Ish.

627
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,960
I think Clarkson arranges
bad weather for me.

628
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,920
Here we go into the first corner,
still going round it...

629
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:31,045
Is that good, I can't tell?

630
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,205
Well, not very fast,
but sometimes...

.. sometimes when a car looks slow,
it is actually quite fast.

633
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,120
Boom. Third. Up.

634
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,960
Here we go.
You have slowed that footage down.

635
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,885
This is very slow through here.

636
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,885
That's a good corner,
that's good cornering.

637
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,360
That's where you got lost last time.
You've done well - got out of it.

638
00:43:56,395 --> 00:43:59,960
I was trying to go to third
and I went into fifth. Showboating.

639
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:01,125
I was in BLEEP fourth.

640
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,245
I put it in the wrong gear.

641
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,040
Fourth sounds about right,
fifth, there. Pretty good.

642
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:08,960
This is better.
And missed the BLEEP tyres.

643
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,525
Whoa!

644
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,560
The reason you look so slow
is because you are quite slow.

645
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,885
Where are you going now?!

646
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,165
He told me to do that.
Stig told me to do that.

647
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,320
He wouldn't tell you to go off
on the grass. You are lost again.

648
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:27,280
I didn't want to miss the
opportunity to see the greenery.

649
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,605
There we go, across the line.
Was that my best one?

650
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,960
It's a combination of various shots
to illustrate your driving style.

651
00:44:35,995 --> 00:44:39,400
It's harder than it looks.
It is harder than it looks.

652
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:41,200
It isn't easy.
What did I do last time?

653
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:43,285
I bet I've beaten my last time.

654
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,245
I was low last time. You were
really low last time. Let's do it.

655
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,520
Last time you were here, you did it in one minute
57 seconds, which would have put you about here.

656
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:58,240
That was a lot slower, that car.
This is a faster car. Yeah.

657
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,680
1.57. This time you did it...

658
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,920
.. one minute...

659
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,565
.. 49 dead. Yes!

660
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,200
That is a big improvement.
I'm up there with Jeff Goldblum.

661
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,885
Yes! Thank you!
And you were in the wet.

662
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,800
That's good. I'm pleased with that.
Congratulations. Pretty good.

663
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:21,777
You have improved massively.

664
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:23,685
You're still quite slow.

665
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,725
I did better, though.
You did, but the thing is,

666
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,160
we also have another little bi of footage to
demonstrate that you're not really a car man.

667
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:36,177
Well, listen, no. I know how
to drive. I don't think you do.

668
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:40,125
Nor does it, it seems,
do you know how to get out of a car.

669
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,600
It was too impossible to get out of. Would you
like to see Jonathan trying to get out of a car?

670
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:47,600
I wondered why they made me
pull over there to climb out.

671
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:49,880
Here we go -
Jonathan getting out of the car.

672
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:53,680
I broke it.
I broke something.

673
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:55,520
Ha-ha-ha!

674
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,765
He's out!

675
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,445
Yes!

676
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,845
That was hard. That was...

677
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,160
You need to take part in Le Mans where
quick driver changes are important. Say no.

678
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:12,440
It's hard to get out of a car like that
and you've put things in the way! Say no

679
00:46:12,475 --> 00:46:15,165
to any race involving a driver
change or indeed any race.

680
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,780
I'll come back and try and slowly
crawl up that pole of yours.

681
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:22,325
Oh, come on! This show won't
be running that long. LAUGHTER

682
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,880
It's been fantastic having you back. It's lovely being
back. Ladies and gentlemen, Jonathan Ross. Thank you.

683
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:31,080
Great fun. Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

684
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:32,600
Thank you.

685
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,565
Right, back to the main story.

686
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,880
We've had a letter from a leading light in the
Albanian Mafia asking us to find out which is best -

687
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:54,480
a Rolls, a Merc or a Yugo which, for complicated
reasons, Jeremy is using as a Bentley.

688
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:57,245
Yeah. And he would not stop moaning
about it.

689
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,005
You wouldn't stop moaning about our
interest in history. Yeah.

690
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,360
Good point there. Word to the wise,
never go on a trip with two OLD men

691
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:09,085
who keep getting teary-eyed about
the Cold War. Never go on a trip

692
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,440
anywhere with someone who believes the
whole world should be like Birmingham.

693
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,480
It's market day obviously -
that's nice.

694
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,000
Taking a wheelbarrow, shovel handles
and lettuce.

695
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,925
These little tiny patches of land

696
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,000
each with the little tiny house on it, and
people farming it, is that to do with Communism?

697
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,400
He is the stupidest man
in the world.

698
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:43,200
I assume it is.

699
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,440
Ooh, I've seen control towers
over there.

700
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,080
I want to go and play
on a Cold War airfield.

701
00:47:55,115 --> 00:47:56,960
Oh no.

702
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,000
'The airfield was abandoned, so assuming straight
line speed would be important to a Mafia boss

703
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:09,200
'we lined the cars up on the runway
for a drag race. '

704
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,045
This is pure Mercedes territory
we're in now.

705
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,560
The S Class might have the smallest
engine of the three, a mere six litres,

706
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:23,840
but that twin turbo-charged V12
belts out 604 brake horsepower

707
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:27,320
and 737 torques.

708
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,500
On paper, Hammond is right,
the Mercedes ought to monster it.

709
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:39,565
But the Rolls-Royce does have 563bhp
AND it has eight gears

710
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,520
where the Mercedes has only five so
this will stay on the power better.

711
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:45,837
Anybody's race, this.

712
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:48,120
Well, not ANYONE'S.

713
00:48:54,595 --> 00:48:56,125
Can I have a push?

714
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,165
This is not customary, is it?

715
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,520
I want to get it going
and then we'll have the race.

716
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:04,160
Yeah. Go! Come on,
put your back into it.

717
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:06,200
Right...

718
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,360
What?! He's gone!

719
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:09,765
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

720
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,760
They weren't expecting me
to do that.

721
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:15,297
What kind of drag race is that?!

722
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,800
Now, come on, Bentley, come on.

723
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:19,400
We have the advantage.

724
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,120
Give me a gear. Right.

725
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:25,840
Three, two, one.

726
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:30,805
Woah!

727
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,640
God that Mercedes is quick. Look at
that! This thing is unbelievably fast!

728
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,560
100kph.

729
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,240
Bentley now up to 130...

730
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,525
Oh! Holy moly!

731
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,440
240 kilometres an hour!

732
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:54,160
153, 4, 5, 6, 7...

733
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,600
260 kilometres an hour!

734
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,485
That is actually
quite a big adrenaline hit. Oh...

735
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:17,400
Quite interesting, the runway here is... has
got crazy paving, and some of the slabs are mined

736
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:22,040
so they can be detonated should Albania
be invaded by a country that wants its, um,

737
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:25,360
watermelons. We're doing 70 now.

738
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,405
'With the drag race done,
I thought we should move on.

739
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,000
'But I had forgotten I was on tour
with Brezhnev and Khrushchev. '

740
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:39,200
James, you are in for a surprise.

741
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,640
Oh, bloody hell!

742
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,120
Oh, God! Oh... God...

743
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:48,297
Those are MiG-15s.

744
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:50,440
This is astonishing.

745
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:51,897
That's a 19.

746
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:53,285
Look at that!

747
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,280
I mean, there's a lot of MiGs here,

748
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:57,680
really a lot of MiGs.

749
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,000
The drag race has murdered it.

750
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,405
Come on, shut that,
let's look at this.

751
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,920
I've never been in a better place
to let an engine cool.

752
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:20,360
Oh! So these are MiG-15s?
No, that's a 19.

753
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:22,165
This is a 19? Yeah.

754
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,180
While those two are re-living
their Cold War fantasies,

755
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:28,160
let me talk you through
some features of the S Class.

756
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:29,897
For a start, I can a adjust

757
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:31,565
the seat sides down here,

758
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,060
the backrest sides,
the lumbar overall,

759
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:36,485
the lumbar cushioning,
the shoulders.

760
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,400
Then I access the massage menu
because I have a choice -

761
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:42,280
slow and gentle, slow and
vigorous, fast and gentle,

762
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:43,600
or fast and vigorous.

763
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,965
Ooh.

764
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,240
It's got... The ejector seat handles
are where your right shin is.

765
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:53,360
This is just... Honestly
I have never been anywhere...

766
00:51:53,395 --> 00:51:55,125
Albania is like a museum. It is.

767
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,800
Opening the boot lid,
it can be done with a key fob,

768
00:51:57,835 --> 00:52:00,520
or it can be done remotely from
within the car.

769
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:02,405
But you don't want to just open it

770
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,280
because how far do you want
your boot lid to open?

771
00:52:05,315 --> 00:52:06,645
I can set it here

772
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,160
to open this much, or a little bit
wider, assuming there's room, obviously.

773
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:15,365
'Back in the scrap yard,
James was starting to get boring. '

774
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,125
I think the 17 is interesting because it
points to a lot of nascent developments

775
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,845
in aerodynamics around that time when
transonic and supersonic flight was only just...

776
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,000
The TU-15, two-seater version of the MiG-15 from the
Korean War. I believe that will have been built in China.

777
00:52:31,035 --> 00:52:36,400
When the relationship between China and Russia
broke down the Chinese made copy-engineered MiG-15s.

778
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:38,240
But the flaps still work.

779
00:52:38,275 --> 00:52:39,760
Ailerons, dear boy.

780
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,800
'After James's interesting lecture, I
turned my attention back to the Mulsanne. '

781
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,080
I don't know that this new Bentley is going to
catch on with Bentley's traditional customer base -

782
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:58,240
Kerry Katona, Jordan, Peter Andre,

783
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,045
John Terry, Brian Cline,

784
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,565
Wayne Rooney, Coleen Rooney
and so on.

785
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,980
'But would it be perfect for a
leading light in the Albanian Mafia?

786
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:15,360
'Or would he prefer one of the
others? We realised we didn't know.

787
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:17,197
'So that night, James and I

788
00:53:17,232 --> 00:53:18,965
'dreamed up one more test

789
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,440
'and then, in the bar,
we explained it to Hammond. '

790
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:26,005
What do you mean,
"We're going to rob a bank"?

791
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,560
It's a great test. We rob a bank,
OK? Use our three cars

792
00:53:30,595 --> 00:53:32,285
as the getaway cars.

793
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,000
The ones that get away from the
police and on to the ferry

794
00:53:35,035 --> 00:53:38,005
and back to Corfu are good cars.

795
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,405
If you're caught by the police
and you spend the next

796
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,160
40 years in jail... You've got the wrong
car and you know what to blame. The Bentley

797
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:47,040
might suddenly come good.
No, it won't.

798
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,560
'The next morning,
we found a bank full of money...

799
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,765
'and robbed it. '

800
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Going for a stroll. Look normal.
Look normal. Look normal.

801
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,320
Yeah. Take the Merc,
that's the quickest.

802
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,325
Oh, God. Hammond! Hammond!

803
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,960
There we are, completely normal.

804
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,925
My Merc...

805
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,060
Clarkson, you BLEEP!

806
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:16,160
Right, Rolls it is.

807
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,160
Seatbelt safety.

808
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,580
You utter BLEEP!

809
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,280
What a pair of utter, utter cars!

810
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,520
Where's the sign to Saranda?
I want Saranda.

811
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:39,445
Oh, zebra crossing. N-not ideal.

812
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,680
Take your time, chum, why not
I would.

813
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:44,717
Saranda? Saranda? This way?

814
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,685
That's the first time EVER

815
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:52,400
in history, someone escaping from
a bank job has asked directions.

816
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:55,557
Right, can we make it to the ferry

817
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,680
to Corfu without being caught?

818
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,520
Police, police!

819
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,120
No! Come on!

820
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,080
Hello.

821
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:15,605
Come on!

822
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,840
Why did we rob a bank at rush hour,
Hammond?

823
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,205
Yu-u-uh...

824
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,520
Why didn't we use a cashpoint
like everyone else?

825
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,520
Undercut.

826
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:25,680
Yes.

827
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,600
'Meanwhile, in the Mulsanne... '

828
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:33,480
I can't see a bloody thing.

829
00:55:33,515 --> 00:55:35,560
Come on!

830
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,200
Crikey, it's the Albanian rozzers.

831
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,800
Argh!

832
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,320
Really annoying me now,
keeps dropping down.

833
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:51,680
How do women wear tights?

834
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,680
Ooh, squeezing, squeezing...

835
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,520
They're getting closer. 'Eventually,
the road began to open out. '

836
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:05,045
Right. Go, go, go, go, go!

837
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,920
Everything you've got, old Roller,
come on!

838
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:10,240
Move!

839
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,920
Don't pull out. Do not...

840
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,245
BLEEP!

841
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:32,320
Strewth! How a bank robber lives to be beyond
25 years old, I don't know because it is stressy.

842
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,200
'In a Bentley, it's VERY stressy. '

843
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,880
The heat's all over me.

844
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:49,440
Come on, Bentley.

845
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,320
Climbing. Climbing.

846
00:56:54,355 --> 00:56:55,520
Ears popping.

847
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,485
Big drop.

848
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,280
'Annoyingly, on the damp
switchback road, Albania's Five-0

849
00:57:03,315 --> 00:57:05,000
'could keep up. '

850
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,125
It rolls a bit more than the Merc.

851
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,680
God. It's like trying to escape
in a bed!

852
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:13,600
I might fall out.

853
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,600
It's got the power.
But then you get to a corner -

854
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:18,717
and this is a biggy -

855
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:19,800
see, front's gone.

856
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,960
Any curve, any dampness
and you've... Whoa.

857
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,160
'Mercifully, though, the road soon
straightened out which meant

858
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:41,160
'Hammond and I could absolutely
fly. '

859
00:57:41,195 --> 00:57:43,200
Go, go, go, go, go!

860
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,965
Oh! What a machine! Yes! I like it.

861
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,040
It's faster than I was expecting,
this Rolls.

862
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,840
It is genuinely jaw-dropping
this thing.

863
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,160
It feels SO fast.

864
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,480
I think I just got air
in a Rolls-Royce.

865
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:10,445
I think I did.

866
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,800
'For James, though,
things weren't going so well. '

867
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:17,240
They're gaining. They're gaining.

868
00:58:17,275 --> 00:58:22,565
No! Catastrophic understeer.

869
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,040
'Up front, Richard and I had left
the rozzers far behind. '

870
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,720
The ferry is near now.

871
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:34,245
Good car, this.

872
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,485
Not as good as my Merc

873
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,160
but a good car none the less.

874
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,360
This is the getaway car
of the century.

875
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,405
If you are a leading light

876
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,880
in the Albanian Mafia,
look no further.

877
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:56,640
'Eventually, we made it to the ferry
terminal and could taste the freedom. '

878
00:58:56,675 --> 00:59:01,365
Go, just go! Hang on,
shouldn't we wait for James?

879
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,040
'But James was in big trouble because
the cars chasing us had stopped

880
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,440
'and formed a road block. '

881
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,720
You'll never take me alive, copper.

882
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,280
I'll see you in Spain, lads!

883
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,380
Argh!

884
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,520
See you, James.
It probably didn't hurt much.

885
00:59:43,555 --> 00:59:45,765
No... Ha-ha-ha!

886
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,845
So James May is dead. Anyway...

887
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,920
I love Albania.
Could you have made THAT

888
00:59:53,955 --> 00:59:58,397
in any other country in the world?
Exactly. Anyway,

889
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:01,836
we must now choose which of the cars
is best. Yes,

890
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:05,205
I suppose we must.
I prefer the Merc, definitely.

891
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:10,640
I know that the late James May preferred
the Rolls-Royce. He made that very clear.

892
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:14,477
And as the Bentley is plainly rubbish,
I think you have the casting vote.

893
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:18,396
If you were a leading light of the
Albanian Mafia, which car would you buy?

894
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:22,280
If I was a leading light in the Albanian
Mafia, I wouldn't BUY either of them.

895
01:00:22,315 --> 01:00:26,840
Good point. OK, which do you prefer?
I am minded to say the Rolls-Royce.

896
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:29,045
But the problem is,
if you have one of these,

897
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,000
one day you will pull up at a set
of lights and alongside

898
01:00:33,035 --> 01:00:36,920
will slide Simon Cowell in his
bigger Phantom and he'll go...

899
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,440
I know what you mean. Be honest, you would only buy
the Ghost because you couldn't afford the Phantom.

900
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,960
Because I don't want that, I'd have
the Mercedes. Yes!

901
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:49,085
It's not really a bombshell, is it?

902
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,140
James's death is a bombshell.
It's an inconvenience, yes.

903
01:00:52,175 --> 01:00:55,125
That's true. So on that
inconvenience, it's time to end.

904
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,520
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night.
