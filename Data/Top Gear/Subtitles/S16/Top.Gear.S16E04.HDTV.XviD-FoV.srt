1
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:49,316
Hello, hello, thank you,  
Now, there are lambs in the fields

2
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:53,644
£2,000 and told us we had to spend  
the cars we'd bought down

3
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:59,768
where we'd be given a number of challenges. 

4
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:02,240
This is what I bought. 

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,832
It's a 1987 BMW 325i convertible.

6
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:10,204
According to the mileometer it's 
done 94,000 miles which means the one 

7
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:14,736
 thing you can be sure of is it 
hasn't done 94,000 miles. 

8
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:17,240
But on the face of it, pretty solid car. 

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,736
Best of all, it only cost £1,600.

10
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:23,424
CAR HORN HONKS Oh! 

11
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:26,172
Oh, no. 

12
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,488
That's awkward. 

13
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:31,844
 That is a 3... Yes. 

14
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,000
32... Yeah. 

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,472
325? Yes. 

16
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,784
 325. Yes. 

17
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:38,092
How old? 

18
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:41,048
'87. '88. How much? 1,600. 

19
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:43,504
 19,950! 

20
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,316
How many miles? 

21
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,092
94, it says. And? 

22
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:50,608
This "says" 137,000 miles. 

23
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:54,908
I'm pretty pleased with this, at least they 
didn't fit stupid after-market wheels on it unlike... 

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,248
Mine. Yours comes from a good area, 
I can tell. Anyone who's got these. 

25
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,752
Extra locks. They don't live in 
Bourton-on-the-Water, do they? 

26
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not a Cotswoldian feature, no.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,284
More St Pauls in Bristol, I'm thinking. Yeah. 

28
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:10,564
This is, well, just superb. 

29
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:13,624
So many different shades of black 
on there, it's unbelievable. 

30
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,064
He's taken care of his car. 

31
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:19,128
Oh ho ho! There, you need that. 

32
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:21,936
Was he delivering paving slabs one at a time? 
No. 

33
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:25,220
Why is that there? 
Because it improves handling. 

34
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,624
'At this point, James arrived in his 
four-seater convertible.' 

35
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:35,500
Oh, dear. Oh! 

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,284
Oh, God! I don't suppose by any 
happy chance that's the 318, is it? 

37
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,408
It's a 325, sir. Yours? 

38
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:45,880
325. Is it? Yes. 

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,408
325, yes. 

40
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,656
What year is yours? 1989. 

41
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,624
How much did you pay? £1,900. 

42
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:55,500
Yours looks pretty standard. It is.- 
Except for the rust obviously. 

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,316
Mine's nice. 

44
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:59,880
Don't do that! I've just fixed that. 

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,956
I barely touched it! 

46
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:07,908
'So none of us had bought an Audi or a 
Ford or a Merc and that looked like a cock-up. 

47
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:11,528
'But then I realised that actually,- it wasn't.' 

48
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,564
I think this is brilliant. 

49
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:15,908
Well, not really. We've got the same car. 

50
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:18,880
We're always being asked, 
people come up to us and say is a Golf 

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,220
a good used purchase, or a Volvo or 
whatever and we always say it depends. 

52
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,752
So what we've got here are three cars, 

53
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:27,888
they were made in the same factory by the same robots 

54
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:32,220
at roughly the same time and they've all been driven 
in the same- country by the same sort of people. 

55
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,248
So they should be the same. Ah. 

56
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:39,248
But I bet you, I bet you they aren't. 

57
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:43,812
'So we decided to bin the 
challenges the producers had devised 

58
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:47,188
'and dream up some of our own.' 

59
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,936
Where's Hammond? 

60
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,128
Don't know, I think we've lost him already. 

61
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,812
CAR IGNITION FAILING,
CAR ALARM SOUNDS 

62
00:03:54,852 --> 00:04:00,408
JEREMY AND JAMES LAUGH 

63
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,596
No, listen, it's... 
Let me hear that sound again. 

64
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:05,472
CAR ALARM SOUNDS 

65
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,880
Oh, dear. It keeps doing that. 

66
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,784
JEREMY AND JAMES LAUGH 

67
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:15,160
 Stop doing that! 

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,188
 'Hammond's cheap after-market alarm 
matched his cheap after-market wheels.' 

69
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,880
 They leach into dry rot, 
they leach into the system. 

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,172
 There's wires going everywhere. 
Can't you just take it all off? 

71
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:30,064
 No. No, because otherwise you could've 
stolen a car by just taking the alarm off. 

72
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,092
 They weren't that stupid in the '80s. 

73
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,216
CAR ALARM SOUNDS That's got it. 

74
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:38,468
'Jeremy and I decided to abandon 
Hammond and have a race. 

75
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:42,112
'From nought to 100 and then 
back to nought again, 

76
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:45,936
'so that we could test our cars' 
power and brakes.' 

77
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:50,344
Here are the vital statistics. 
2.5 litre straight-six, 170hp, 

78
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:52,688
at least when it was new, 
it may have lost a few. 

79
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:56,936
 Jeremy has a 2.5 litre 
straight-six with 170 horsepower, 

80
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,656
 or at least when it was new, 
he may have lost a few since then. 

81
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:05,656
 The difference, he's got a 
big slab of concrete in the boot. 

82
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:08,092
 It's not the paving stone in 
the back I'm worried about, 

83
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:10,328
 it's the automatic gearbox. 

84
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:21,216
 Doing a drag race with an auto is like doing a 
100 metre sprint in wellies. Full of tadpoles. 

85
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:24,656
 Yes! 

86
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:28,032
Bit of steering wheel wobble coming in. 

87
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:31,688
No concrete is the answer. 

88
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:36,624
There we go, nought to 60, 
that was about 25 seconds. 

89
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:45,596
RICHARD'S CAR ALARM SOUNDS,
FAILS TO START 

90
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,936
 90! 

91
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:55,528
 Must be able to do 100. 

92
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:58,000
 And there it is. 

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,528
 There it is. 

94
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,092
 No brakes, no brakes. 

95
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:06,780
 It's just not stopping. 

96
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,188
 Please, stop! 

97
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:16,624
 'The gap between our supposedly 
identical BMWs was staggering.' 

98
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:21,064
 77, 78, 79, 80, 81. 

99
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:24,752
281 yards. 

100
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,440
There is another conclusion we can 
draw from this. Which is what? 

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,188
That as you'd expect, 
I've done this properly and I've 

102
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:33,656
proved myself to be better than 
you at buying second-hand BMWs. 

103
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:36,408
Well, your brakes are better. 

104
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:39,312
And my engine's better and my gearbox is better. 

105
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:41,216
Speed isn't everything. 

106
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:43,216
Is it not? 

107
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:46,280
RICHARD'S CAR ALARM CONTINUES TO SOUND 

108
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,656
After the race, we got 
Hammond's car going again. 

109
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:54,704
 And went to a Waking The 
Dead-style- forensics lab 

110
00:06:54,744 --> 00:07:00,468
 to find out in great detail what 
sort of life our cars had had. 

111
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:04,624
You know the company 
we're using to do this... Mm-hm. 

112
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:07,596
 ..Are called Manlove Forensics. 

113
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,688
 Are they? They are. No, they are. 

114
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,344
 Why are they called that? 

115
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:14,032
Yeah, the boss is called John Manlove. 

116
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:17,484
Oh. Not many fond school-day 
memories for him, I bet. 

117
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:22,264
They've actually already discovered- that your car 
used to belong to a Muslim man from Birmingham. 

118
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:26,280
What, they can tell that just 
from swabbing the seats? 

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,544
 No, they found this letter in the footwell. 

120
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:35,392
 Oh, yes. Addresses to Jamir Masjid, 
it's from a mosque in Birmingham. 

121
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:38,124
They're good, they are good. They're good. 

122
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:42,640
'But the test they were doing went far 
beyond looking for old envelopes.' 

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,608
Do you know what I'm most worried 
they'll find in my car? 

124
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,360
What? Gentlemen's relish. 

125
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,828
I quite like gentlemen's relish.

126
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:54,688
Oh, you don't mean the stuff from the jar. 

127
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:58,952
'After many hours, the boss 
came over with the results.' 

128
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,420
 Hi, I'm John Manlove. Can we stick to John? 

129
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,108
 Otherwise we're just going to get giggles. 

130
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:06,092
 This vehicle here. This is mine.

131
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:10,264
This had crisp fragments in it. Crisps is 
fine, nobody's worried about that. 

132
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:13,672
There was a little bit of vegetation. Leaves? 

133
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:16,856
Bits-and-pieces such as that 
and some flakes of skin. 

134
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,688
There'll be mine. 

135
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:21,732
So that's not too bad then. 
No, not too bad, fairly standard. 

136
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,048
Let's move on, James's car. 

137
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,312
Lots of skin in this one. 

138
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:30,484
Including some nice, large flakes of 
yellowish skin with some blood staining on. 

139
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:32,672
A scab! Somebody's picked a scab in your car. 

140
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,640
Full of scabs. Go on. Seriously?

141
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,920
Anything else worth note? 
Quite a lot of nasal mucus. 

142
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,108
That's bogies, he's talking about bogies. 

143
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,328
Were they smeared on the 
seat or the sun visor? 

144
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:46,296
Little balls in the footwell. 

145
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:47,968
Shall I just finish James's car?

146
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,516
Was there more? The last one was 
that the steering wheel was stained 

147
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:55,528
with a chemical that can be present- 
in high quantities in saliva. 

148
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:00,372
Gob. So basically if you're talking and 
driving, that's what you may well expect. 

149
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:03,936
So Roy Hattersley owned it? Picked his 
scabs off, spat all over your steering wheel 

150
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,108
and dropped bogies in large 
quantities in your footwell. 

151
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:10,448
I don't even want to look at your car now! 

152
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:13,876
But then Mr Manlove came to Hammond's car. 

153
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:19,388
First of all, there was some black sports type-tape 
with what turned out to be blood staining on it. 

154
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:22,808
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sports tape with 
blood on the end of it? 

155
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:25,296
Somebody's been bound. 
And murdered.

156
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:28,688
Again the steering wheel had what 
appeared to be saliva staining on it. 

157
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:36,236
And lastly, we had pubic hairs and faeces present. 

158
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:41,780
I'm sorry, did you say the word "faeces"? 
What certainly appeared to be faecal matter, yes. 

159
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,088
That's poo, isn't it? 

160
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:45,720
That's poo. Your car's got poo in it. 

161
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,420
Is that normal? 

162
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,968
It's like driving around in a Moroccan prison,
isn't it, really? In the front of his car. 

163
00:09:53,008 --> 00:10:01,000
'After the forensic tests, my 
colleagues were very distressed.' 

164
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,136
Oh, God. 

165
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:08,360
So we decided to pull over and see 
which of our cars- was the most thief-proof. 

166
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,236
This meant finding some thieves who 
insisted that we pixelate their faces. 

167
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:21,156
Unfortunately the pixelating was done 
by a man who'd just had his car nicked. 

168
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:23,592
 Our thieves with the pixelated... 

169
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:29,624
chests will now see how quickly they 
can break into- the cars and drive them away. 

170
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:32,156
Are you ready, chaps? Here we go. 

171
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:36,856
Three, two, one, go! 

172
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:40,936
'I felt sure at this point that thanks to 
the double locks and the immobiliser, 

173
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:44,136
'my car would finally start to come good.' 

174
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,184
I think you'll find they'll take a while getting in. 

175
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:50,328
He's into mine. Oh, he's into yours! 

176
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:56,688
Yeah, but even though... OK, he's in, 
but I think you'll find... 

177
00:10:56,728 --> 00:11:01,080
HE STARTS CAR,CAR ALARM SOUNDS 

178
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,388
That's ridiculous! That was honestly,

179
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:07,404
 that was just no time. 

180
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:16,156
Your car is now on a cross-Channel 
ferry on its way to Uzbekistan. 

181
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:19,044
It really is quite tense now. 
Come on, Jeremy's thief. 

182
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,700
Come on, James's thief. 

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,156
Come on, Jeremy's thief. 

184
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:27,388
However after 20 minutes, both our 
cars were still where we'd left them. 

185
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:32,124
So we decided to call it a draw.

186
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:35,932
Unsurprisingly, the thief decided to 
return my car which meant he could 

187
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:40,028
explain the reason it was so 
easy-to-steal is the ignition barrel is all 

188
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:47,264
worn smooth inside so you could start it with 
the handle of a teaspoon or a lollipop stick. 

189
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:51,840
I think it has done more than 94,000 miles. 

190
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,280
So far then we'd proved that our identical 
cars were in fact completely different. 

191
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,328
And that Hammond's was full of 
someone else's pubic hair. 

192
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,464
APPLAUSE 

193
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,952
And that Hammond's was full of 
someone else's pubic hair. 

194
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:06,264
APPLAUSE 

195
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:09,200
I've washed my hands, 
I've washed my hands. 

196
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,080
I mean, honestly... Not nice. 

197
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,808
 Just knowing that. Isn't it extraordinary when 

198
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:20,280
you buy a used car, you'll do checks-to 
make sure the gearbox is working, 

199
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,216
the differential isn't all brokenbut you don't do 
anything to check the state of the interior. 

200
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:29,416
It's really weird because I could cope if I 
thought a car had missed a service or two 

201
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:36,720
or something like that but once I found out that one 
was full of nasal mucus, I'd have walked away. 

202
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,292
Has anyone here bought a used car recently? 

203
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:43,136
Nobody's bought a used car? 

204
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,668
So you bought a used car? 

205
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,368
Yes. And did you check it out for...

206
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:52,136
Scabs? Scabs? Blood? No. Faeces? 
Nothing, no. 

207
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:54,292
You're from Liverpool? Liverpool. 

208
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:57,796
I said bought, anyone here bought!

209
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,684
Oh, here we go again! You have? 

210
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:03,528
Did you check out if it's got any 
finance owing on it? 

211
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,436
Finance. You did finance, you did 
checks on the mechanical components? 

212
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:11,044
I did. Did you see if there were anybody else's 
bottom mushrooms growing in the carpet? 

213
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:15,700
No. You didn't. I'm very surprised,- I'm really quite 
surprised. Anyway we're going to pick it up later on. 

214
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,808
Now we ought to do the news. 

215
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,216
Can I just talk about speed 
cameras, does anybody mind? 

216
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,904
 You know Oxfordshire Council 
announced recently, last year, 

217
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:25,280
it would turn all the speed cameras- 
off and when they said that, 

218
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,312
all the road safety groups 
were running around saying 

219
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:30,952
everybody will be dead in 
ten minutes as a result of this. 

220
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:35,496
 Well, six months have now elapsed and the 
road safety groups are saying they don't know 

221
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:38,464
 what effect the switch-off has had 
on accident figures. 

222
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:42,748
 How can they not know? 
They say they're not in yet. 

223
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,436
But I always know pretty much 
immediately when I've had an accident. 

224
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:50,368
There are clues, big noise, 
sudden stop, that sort of thing. 

225
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,840
The thing is they may not know but 
I do because I've done some digging.

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,248
 In a three-month period in 2009, 
when the cameras were on, 

227
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:58,728
there were 35 accidents at speed camera sites. 

228
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:02,136
In the same three-month period when 
the cameras were switched off 

229
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:06,028
in 2010, there were 35 accidents 
at speed camera sites. 

230
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:09,216
No difference. No difference at all. 

231
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:14,932
What about fatalities? Fatalities, there were none 
with the cameras on and none with the cameras off. 

232
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:20,528
Really? What's interesting about this is that you'd 
think this made no difference and saved the council 

233
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,808
a fortune by getting rid of the speed cameras. 
They're now saying the police are going to take over 

234
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:30,324
running them and turn them back on again in April. 
I thought they said- they couldn't afford to run them? 

235
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:33,120
 No, the police are doing it. 

236
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,624
But this is very good news because that must mean 
they've solved all the other crimes. What, the police? 

237
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:44,608
Actually, they haven't solved them all but they have 
caught that bloke- who nicked the lead off my roof. 

238
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:47,388
You had lead stolen from your roof? 

239
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:54,136
All of it. Only you would be the 
victim of a crime from the 1950s. 

240
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:58,212
Was the villain chased by a black and white 
policeman blowing a whistle by any chance? 

241
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:01,184
Yes. Was he driving a Ford Zephyr?

242
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:07,388
The thing is I live in Oxfordshire and I was burgled 
recently and they haven't caught her yet. Her? 

243
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm not sexist. Nice touch. Good work. 

244
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,184
See? We're not. 

245
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:20,728
You might have seen in the news Formula One 
driver Robert Kubicainjured horribly in a rally crash. 

246
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:24,248
He probably won't be watching but 
his family in Poland might be 

247
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:27,700
and we did want to say we wish youall the very best, 
hope you recoversoon and get back behind the wheel. 

248
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,136
Yes, he's a terrific driver, 
really is, Robert, and I'm 

249
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,684
sure everybody here will join in wishing 
him a very speedy recovery. 

250
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,872
Yeah, we do. Get well soon. 

251
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:42,044
APPLAUSE 

252
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,436
I'd like, if you don't mind, 
to talk about magpies. 

253
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,416
It's a car show, Jeremy. 

254
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:51,760
Bear with me, because there's an 
organisation called the Songbird Survival Trust. 

255
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,292
They're calling for a cull on magpies. 

256
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:57,416
They're not calling it a cull, they're 
saying they want to do an experiment. 

257
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,212
 Is it an experiment to see what happens 
to a magpie if you fire a shotgun at it? 

258
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,028
 Yes, it is, basically. 

259
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:06,152
I agree with them on this but for different reasons. 
They say if you get rid of magpies then we'll 

260
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:11,152
have more songbirds because magpies- eat songbirds 
but there's a better reason than that I can think of. 

261
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:14,776
 Magpies are a menace to road safety.

262
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:19,888
They look like they'd be bad don't they? 
Stupid idiot, listen, drivers,- I'm not a superstitious man. 

263
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:23,448
I can walk under a ladder, 
put my head in a lion's mouth. 

264
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:26,480
That's not a superstition, you idiot,
it's a bad idea. 

265
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,696
I can put a hat on my new shoes, all 
those things but I do salute magpies. OK? 

266
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:34,388
The problem is because the magpie is 
the only bird in Britain these days, 

267
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,808
you're just driving along doing 
this the whole time. 

268
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:42,464
No, you don't just salute, if yousee a single magpie, 
one on its own,-you have to say "morning, captain" 

269
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:47,200
three times. Morning, captain,morning, captain, 
morning, captain, salute three times, spit three times,

270
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,496
touch your right elbow with your left hand, 
one, two, three times 

271
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:53,400
and then lick your thumb and make a cross
in the top right-hand corner of the windscreen. 

272
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,668
You don't have to do that. You do. Do you do 
that when you see a magpie? Every single time. 

273
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,728
It's quite a faff and it's difficult on the bike 
but I do it. Morning, captain... 

274
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:06,292
 one, two, three, and then you carry on. 

275
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:10,152
You've both got that completely wrong 
because what you're supposed to do, 

276
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:14,136
it's only the first magpie of the day and 
you salute and say "morning, Mr Magpie", 

277
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,640
and you don't do it in the afternoon 
because that's bad luck 

278
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,932
 and you don't do the second one...

279
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:23,588
Rubbish! How do you know it's the first magpie 
of the day? You don't join the Village People. 

280
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,796
Is anyone here Jewish? 

281
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,168
Yep. You are, where's Jewish, hands up? 

282
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,416
You are? Do you know what we're talking about? 

283
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:34,544
Yeah, Newcastle. No, no, no. 

284
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:37,980
It's not Newcastle, I know where 
you're going with that. 

285
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,640
It's just that our studio director's Jewish 
and has no idea what we're 

286
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,260
talking about because he said, 
perhaps Jews don't do it. 

287
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,640
Is anyone else Jewish who has no clue? 

288
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,200
You're Jewish, and do you salute magpies? 
No, but we know about it. 

289
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,040
You know about it but you don't do it? 
Interesting. 

290
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,232
So it could be a religious thing. 
I don't know. 

291
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:57,932
Do Jewish people have more road accidents 
as a result of magpies? No, fewer. 

292
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:03,324
Jewish people will have fewer road accidents 
because they're not spending all day long doing this. 

293
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,948
Anyway, look. To cut to the point here, 

294
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:11,088
whether you do my simple salute which 
is correct, or his full Morris dance... 

295
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:12,480
Can't be too careful. 

296
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,244
We need to stop it because 
the advantages are huge 

297
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:20,356
because if you get rid of magpies, you have 
more songbirds so the air sounds nicer. 

298
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:23,200
 You've got tits and... Why did I say tits? 

299
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,760
Sparrows and all that sort of 
thing and that'd be brilliant 

300
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,464
plus we don't have to do that 
and that'll make the roads safer. 

301
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:37,232
There we are, Top Gear Top Tip, 
kill all magpies and kill them now. 

302
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:41,808
Who told you about the eyes and ears and nose 
and chin? I've accumulated them over the years.

303
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:45,480
For God's sake, nobody tell me any more 
that I have to do or I'll add them to my routine. 

304
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,288
What you have to do... No! 
Take your trousers down, 

305
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:54,932
look at somebody in the next car, preferably 
a van driver, and go... That's a tradition. 

306
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,920
 Hey, listen, listen. 

307
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,792
There's a new lightweight Lamborghini 
Gallardo Spyder has come along. Here it is. 

308
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:06,200
It's called the Performante. 
That's- going to cost you a hundred and... 

309
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,416
 I can't read that. What's that say? 

310
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,400
 You poor, knackered old goat. 

311
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,212
 £188,000. £188,000. 

312
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:20,964
Top speed I do know. 201 mph. Is that possibly 
the best-looking car in production right now? 

313
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,056
It is a fantastic-looking car. 

314
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:28,948
The problem is it's getting quite old and compared 
to the Ferrari 458, it just feels old fashioned. 

315
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,696
The thing is, this isn't just a 
duel now between the Italians, 

316
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:34,544
because the British have moved 
in with a new McLaren. 

317
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:39,560
Yes, it's called the MP4-12C. 

318
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,544
We've got it here in the studio and- this is the first 
time we've been able to have a proper look at it. 

319
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:49,696
It has McLaren's own engine, 
a 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8. 

320
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:54,260
It also has very sophisticated 
computer-controlled suspension. 

321
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,760
And, most interestingly, it was tested 
here at the Top Gear test track. 

322
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,212
We should stress we had nothing to do 
with the testing or development of it at all. 

323
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:08,696
No, nothing whatsoever. The thing that bothers me, 
Hammond, is I've driven the 458 a lot, as you know. 

324
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:11,728
I love it and I cannot see how this can be better. 

325
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:14,056
I know, but what if it is? 

326
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:18,056
There are a few pointers. For one thing, 
it's cheaper than the 458. 

327
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:23,492
You can't get in! I can.It's also more powerful, 
592 brakehorse power, which is 30 or so more. 

328
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:29,152
These are good signs. I like it in here because 
they've made the steering wheel the steering wheel. 

329
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:33,368
They haven't fallen into that trap of putting 
buttons all over it to make it feel like Formula 1. 

330
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:37,432
They don't make you choose on your instrument 
panel between the speedometer and the sat nav 

331
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:42,920
like Ferrari do. All that stuff they put here, and 
your music, on a sort of iPad thing in the middle. 

332
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,964
It's a fantastic place to be. 

333
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:52,040
My only problem with this really is,- I like a supercar 
to look a bit crazy, a bit mad, like a Zonda. 

334
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,008
If you ask me, this is sort of plain.

335
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,168
You say Zonda, but 
which Zonda do you mean? 

336
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:03,088
Well, the Pagani Zonda as opposed to 
the Kia Zonda or the Ford Zonda. 

337
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:09,184
No, you see, over the years, 
there have been thousands of them. 

338
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:14,604
The saga began 12 years ago 
when Pagani launched this - Genesis.

339
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:19,948
The very brilliant and very dramatic C12. 

340
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,744
A year later, they introduced a slightly 
faster version called the C12S, 

341
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,868
 and we saw that it was good. 

342
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:33,288
Then there was the Roadster S 
and the Monza, and the F, 

343
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,320
 and the F Roadster. 

344
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,744
And then, just when we thought every 
angle had been explored, the F Clubsport. 

345
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:49,432
We imagined that this would be 
the final Zonda, the final encore. 

346
00:21:49,472 --> 00:22:01,616
 But we were wrong. 

347
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:09,056
Welcome, everyone, to the Zonda R, 
the last of the breed. 

348
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:16,088
 And by far the most confusing. 

349
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,088
It looks like a pure-bred racer, 
but you can't race it, 

350
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:23,568
because there are rules and 
regulations in motor sport, 

351
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:28,228
and this meets none of them.
And if- you try to take it on the road, 

352
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:32,276
a policeman is going to stop you and say, 
"Sir, where are your indicators 

353
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:38,808
"and why do you not have any tread on your tyres?" 

354
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,256
So if it's not for racing and it's not for the road, 

355
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,928
what is it for? 

356
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:54,808
Well, this. 

357
00:22:54,848 --> 00:23:00,200
SPEECH DROWNED OUT BY ENGINE 

358
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:10,008
Annoyingly, the R is so loud that our team of 
sound recordists had to have a bit of a rethink. 

359
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:18,432
What I was saying before I had this 
microphone fitted is, it really is jolly fast. 

360
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:22,492
Very jolly fast! 

361
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:26,868
 Nought to 60 takes three seconds. 

362
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:35,840
Top speed? Nobody knows. 
Definitely more than 230 though. 

363
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:44,336
The main reason for all this 
phenomenalness is the engine. 

364
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:51,604
It's a six-litre Mercedes V12, 
which produces 740 horsepower. 

365
00:23:51,644 --> 00:24:03,744
And it's being used to power a car 
which weighs less than a Ford Fiesta. 

366
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:13,244
That makes the performance 
extremely dramatic! 

367
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:19,616
The Zonda R recently blitzed their 
own record at the Nurburgring.

368
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:24,288
It got round in six minutes and 47 seconds, 

369
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:32,916
and from where I'm sitting, I cannot 
work out why it took so long. 

370
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:38,944
I can only assume the driver stopped 
off halfway round to read a book. 

371
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:47,636
Bruce Forsyth could get this thing round 
the Nurburgring in less time than that. 

372
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:54,588
All Zondas look like they will be more complicated 
to drive than spaceships, but they're not. 

373
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,288
They're easy. 

374
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:02,088
And because this one has grippy, 
slick tyres, it's the easiest of the lot. 

375
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:05,088
You can whizz about at top speed

376
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,412
 and you've got time and brain power to think, 

377
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:13,508
"I really like the way they've got these air vents laid out." 

378
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:19,928
That's a nice strap, kind of old fashioned 
and modern all at the same time. 

379
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:24,304
 It doesn't really matter if you're not concentrating. 

380
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:26,556
 Because it doesn't weigh anything 

381
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:30,460
and because its carbon brakes are so enormous, 

382
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:43,488
it will go from 125 mph to a dead stop in 4.3 seconds. 

383
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:47,992
Oh, yeah. Like that. 

384
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,804
The only way to stop faster is to hit a tree. 

385
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:59,728
And this is the first Zonda to have- 
a flappy-paddle gearbox. 

386
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:05,692
It isn't the most refined system in 
the world, if I'm honest, but it is quick. 

387
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:10,024
And it does mean that when you 
floor it, you enjoy the fury 

388
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:16,336
 and all you have to do when the fury runs out, 
pull the lever and it starts all over again. 

389
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:23,304
 Go! Yeah. Go! Go! Yes, go! 

390
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:27,524
 Go, go, go! 

391
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:31,164
 This car is fantastic. 

392
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:36,276
 An extraordinary example of what can 
be done when there are no rules.

393
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:41,444
 But for a toy, it is a bit expensive. 

394
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:46,760
 The car will cost you £1.46 million, 
and because most British racetracks 

395
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:54,400
 have noise limits, which this breaches, 
you'll need your own. 

396
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,524
 And the going rate for one of those these days, 

397
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:03,336
 about 6 billion. Billion! 

398
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:12,960
 One last go, come on. 

399
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,088
 Honestly, what a machine. 

400
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:20,412
 What a machine. 

401
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:26,368
 It seems a shame that we wave goodbye to 
the Zonda with a car that is absolutely brilliant, 

402
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:32,744
 but also completely useless. 

403
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,648
 The people at Pagani obviously thought so too, 

404
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,224
 because they recently announced 

405
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:42,128
 that the R would not be the last Zonda after all. 

406
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:46,916
 They would actually finish by making 
five road-going versions of it. 

407
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:55,788
 And then they'd really, definitely finish 
with five convertible versions of those. 

408
00:27:55,828 --> 00:28:02,128
But like a 1970s rock band, they 
don't seem to be able to end the song, 

409
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:07,332
 because they now say that there 
will be another, one last hurrah. 

410
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:11,488
 This is it, the Tricolore. 

411
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:14,804
 Named after the Italian Air Force 
aerobatic squadron, 

412
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:30,052
this too is a quietened down, 
softer version of the R. 

413
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:33,944
 It's heavier, slightly less powerful, 

414
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:38,276
and thanks to normal - oops - 
road tyres, a lot less grippy. 

415
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,488
 Ha ha! 

416
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:43,960
 Oh, dear. 

417
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,148
 But it's still a great car. 

418
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:54,960
 And still properly, properly fast.

419
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
 Ho, ho, ho! 

420
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,896
 And because you don't need your own 
track, it's about 6 billion less than the R. 

421
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:08,680
 That makes it good value. 

422
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,992
 But of course, what makes this 

423
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:17,804
 the best value of all is that I'm driving Revelations. 

424
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:22,224
 The final encore. 

425
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:24,880
 Bye-bye, Zonda. 

426
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:42,444
 Bye-bye. 

427
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:51,632
APPLAUSE 

428
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:57,768
Poor old Richard Hammond. The Zonda 
is his favourite car and now it's all gone. 

429
00:29:57,808 --> 00:30:01,176
 No, actually, because after I made that film, 

430
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,412
Zonda announced they would make two 
more Tricolores. Really? But then it's over? 

431
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:11,896
No, because when they finish doing those, 
they're going to make a new one called the 750. 

432
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:16,304
Then that's the last Zonda? No, 
because after that... I'm not joking. 

433
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:19,304
They're doing one called the HH. 
Then they're going to start 

434
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:22,304
 finally building the new car, 
the... What's it called? 

435
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:26,412
 Huarrr... Yeah, that one. Huayra. 

436
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:31,008
While they're dithering about, making up 
their mind, it's time to find out how fast this one, 

437
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:36,616
the R, goes round our track. Of course, 
that means handing it over to our tame racing driver. 

438
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:42,928
Some say his nipples are explosive. 

439
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,240
And that he's recently had a Mexican... 

440
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,024
I mean Brazilian! I mean Brazilian!- 
Why did I say that? 

441
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:54,960
I'm sorry, Mr Ambassador. Anyway, 
all we know is he's called the Stig.

442
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,804
And he's off. I can't imagine 
this is going to take very long. 

443
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:04,520
V12 AMG fury powering towards 
the first corner. Here we are. 

444
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,332
So much grip in this car. 

445
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:10,024
It is just gliding through. 

446
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:12,804
Bit of a four-wheel drift there.

447
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:17,304
No stereo, of course, just 
12 cylinders singing. 

448
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:22,116
Actually, not singing, shouting! 
Actually very wide through Chicago. 

449
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:25,052
How will he attack Hammerhead? 

450
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:31,648
Leaning hard on those incredible 
brakes. Yes. He's nailed it now. 

451
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:37,816
Yes, he's through. 

452
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,504
 Really open the taps now. 

453
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,692
Cuts a steady throttle through 
the follow-through. 

454
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:46,912
Unsettled a bit by the bump on the apex. 
Stig not scared. 

455
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:51,320
Two corners left. It stays so flat.- 
It actually looks undramatic. 

456
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,096
Oh, a spit of flame! 

457
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:56,020
Into Gambon and across the line.

458
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,008
APPLAUSE 

459
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,760
 I have the time here. 

460
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,536
 He did it in 1:26.7. 

461
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:10,144
 No! No, I'm lying. 

462
00:32:10,184 --> 00:32:13,400
1:8.5. 

463
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,504
CHEERING 

464
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:22,816
The thing is, you may remember, 
a couple of years ago, 

465
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:26,196
Michael Schumacher came here and 
took a Ferrari FXX round, 

466
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,944
 which is the same sort of thing as this, OK? 

467
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:32,348
 That was 1:10.7. 

468
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:38,128
So that is 2.2 seconds quicker than 
Schumacher in a Ferrari, on slick tyres as well. 

469
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:42,944
Amazing. Either that car is 
truly incredible... Or? 

470
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:46,708
 The Stig is rather underpaid. 

471
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:50,320
Yes. There's one more thing we have- to do, 
I'm afraid. Get rid of it. 

472
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,972
Yes, of course. It's not a road has 
no place on our board car. 

473
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:59,144
 It's the rules. It's the rules, I'm afraid. 

474
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:03,320
Let me cheer you up, because it's time 
now to put a star in our reasonably-priced car. 

475
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,444
In fact, this week, two stars. 

476
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:10,348
 These guys, well, they've fought off zombies in London. 

477
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,880
They've had a knife fight in a 
supermarket in the West Country. 

478
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,040
More recently, they've helped an alien 
get back to its home planet. 

479
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,848
So they're either actors or massive liars. 
Let's find out. 

480
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:24,632
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Nick Frost and Simon Pegg! 

481
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:28,004
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

482
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:30,408
 Gentlemen! How are you? 

483
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:33,536
 I'm very well. Good to see you. 

484
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:38,972
 Look what we've got here. 

485
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:42,048
 Great to see you, guys. Great to see. 

486
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:46,600
You two have known each other for donkey's years, 
haven't you? Yes. 17-18 years. Met in a restaurant? 

487
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,348
Yes, Mexican restaurant. 

488
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:52,252
LAUGHTER I can never go back now. 

489
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:56,176
They've ripped up my Golden Fajita Card. 

490
00:33:56,216 --> 00:34:00,380
You became friends because you 
shared a love of Star Wars noises? 

491
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,632
Yeah. That's kind of how we bonded.
-We met because Nick was interested 

492
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:06,160
in being a stand-up comic, 
I was a stand-up comic. 

493
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,192
We met, went out a few times. 
I did this. 

494
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:12,536
HE BEEPS LIKE A STAR WARS ROBOT 

495
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:16,020
Which is a noise that a smalldroid... 
I can see you glaze over. 

496
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,332
No, I'm quite good at Star Wars, 
but I am struggling here. 

497
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:23,864
That's why I fell in love with him,- because I 
thought no-one knew about that except me, 

498
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:30,320
and then he did it to me and it was like 
he'd sprayed me with his nerd musk. 

499
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,600
That was it, then. How loving. 

500
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,476
 It must be great working with your friends, I imagine. 

501
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:41,972
 I don't know, obviously. 

502
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:44,380
We have the new film, which is out this week. 

503
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,020
Valentine's Day. It's called Paul. 

504
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,020
The idea was literally a spitballin the garden 
when we were shooting Shaun Of The Dead. 

505
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,396
The weather was really bad.Our producer said, 
"Can't we shootsomewhere where it's always sunny?" 

506
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:03,020
We thought of the desert, then because of 
our nerd minds, we went straight to Area 51. 

507
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,288
That became aliens. We said, "OK, there's two guys 
and there's analien and they help him get home." 

508
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:12,476
We've got a clip of the film, 
which we can look at. 

509
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:17,068
 Put... the phone... down. 

510
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,536
 Ha-ha-ha! 

511
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,660
What have you done to him? 
I didn't do anything to him. He fainted. 

512
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,408
 Yeah, but you made him faint. 

513
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:27,628
But it's not like I set my phaser to faint. 

514
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,252
You've got a phaser?! No! Look, listen. 

515
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,848
Hey, I really need your help, OK? 

516
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:34,536
 Can we get this guy back on your wagon? 

517
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:37,612
 HE GIBBERS

518
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:41,456
Are you an alien? To you, I am, yes.- 
Are you going to probe us? 

519
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:43,768
Why does everyone assume that? 
What am I doing? 

520
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:49,736
Am I harvesting farts? How much can I 
learn from an ass? W-w-what? 

521
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:53,224
I love the alien. He's great, isn't he? 
A brilliant alien. 

522
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:58,224
 What gave you the idea to make 
your alien smoke and swear? 

523
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:02,068
We just liked the idea that he's been on 
earth longer than Graham and Clive have. 

524
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:06,348
He's less alien than they are, really. 
They're two British guys out of their depth. 

525
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:10,456
He's been hanging round, smoking 
strong weed that he gets off the military, 

526
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:13,756
that he claims killed Bob Dylan. 

527
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:19,208
They do say there's aliens in Area 51, 
don't they? Yes. Do you actually believe that? 

528
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:21,440
 I'm not sure we do. No. 

529
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,424
It's very coincidental that people see lots of 
flying saucers nearan experimental aircraft facility. 

530
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:30,504
 Logically, it's probably planes! 

531
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:35,064
Did you go out to Area 51 to research it? 
We did, we did the whole trip. 

532
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:40,768
We got an RV and we drove from Los Angeles 
right the way through Nevada and Utah. 

533
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:43,080
 Did you meet many lunatics? 

534
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,552
 A few. Lot of cowboys. 

535
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:50,048
We went to a rodeo,fully Stetsons,
jeans, cowboy boots, 

536
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:53,756
 shirts with business on, felt completely normal. 

537
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:57,848
Thought, this is fine, it's goodto wear 
this stuff. I did not feel normal, by the way. 

538
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:03,016
We didn't look like them, but like people dressing 
up, pretending to be them. They could smell our fear. 

539
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,644
 That's because you had a 
toy gun on your hip. Pow! 

540
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:10,284
 Did you get to drive your RV 
across America? 

541
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:15,176
We had to learn how to drive. This is going to 
sound really BLEEP- but we had a driver. 

542
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,960
 What? Neither of us have ever driven an RV. 

543
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,940
The point of it was that we would be 
sitting, writing, while America 

544
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,376
 drifted past and we just thought, 
"Let's have a driver." 

545
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:31,252
He was the guy that did that 
amazing-handbrake turn in Meet The Fockers. 

546
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:36,892
De Niro's big CIA blacked-out RV.There's a 
bit in that when it turns a full handbrake turn. 

547
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:40,488
He was the driver? He left me driving... 
We decided to take 

548
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:44,880
a highway because we were running behind time. 

549
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,192
He really needed the toilet, so he left me 
at the wheel and I started to lose control. 

550
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,488
Nick was going, "Small corrections, 
small corrections!" "I can't! I can't!" 

551
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:57,848
Steve came out the toilet, doing up his flies... 

552
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,268
There was the old story of the guy that rented 
one, an English guy rented an RV for his holiday. 

553
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:08,940
It said cruise control, 
so he put on cruise control. "Lovely!" 

554
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,784
Nobody could work out, in the accident, 
why he was killed with a kettle in his hand. 

555
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:20,688
Doing 80 mph. Stupid idiot. Anyway, 
so look, the lap, this is why you're here. 

556
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:24,968
I know you were nervous, because you thought 
that your size would count against you. Yeah. 

557
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:31,408
Whereas you, of course... What do you weigh?
I'm 11.5 stone. My leg weighs that much! 

558
00:38:31,448 --> 00:38:36,736
But the thing is, are you very fit?- At the moment I am, 
because I'm doing Mission Impossible 4 

559
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:40,580
 as we speak, and I'm sort of having to be... 

560
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,816
 I'm an agent now, so I need to be on... 

561
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:48,908
I had a long conversation with MrCruise about 
his appearance on this.- Still talks about it. 

562
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:52,988
Does he? He is full of Top Gear. He has 
such a shallow and empty life, obviously. 

563
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:55,172
But he is obsessed with it. 

564
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:58,532
Nevertheless, whose lap shall we see first? 

565
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:01,784
Let's have a look, shall we, 
at... your lap, Simon. 

566
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:06,768
Come on, Simon. Let's see your lap.
- Here we go. 

567
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:10,328
HE SPLUTTERS 

568
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:13,960
I've changed gear.
That's a good sign. Yep. 

569
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,520
 Right, first corner. 

570
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,112
 Nice wide line in there. 

571
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:20,784
 New Stig does teach that line. 

572
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:23,704
He does, yeah. Very... Ooh, 
you're not using all the road, though. 

573
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,892
 Come on, you motherhumper. 

574
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:28,144
 Mother what? Motherhumper. 

575
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:31,112
 Motherhumper? Nice. Watershed language. 

576
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:32,940
 That's looking quite tidy. 

577
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,988
Where are you going? Oh, Hammerhead. 
Let's have a look. Whoa! 

578
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:38,892
That's squirreling underbraking. 
That is quite impressive. 

579
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:41,424
 Right. Keep it in between the lines.

580
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:44,064
 Just about... Yep. 

581
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:47,644
It's much sportier than the last one. 
This is a great car. 

582
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:50,172
 See apostrophe Dee. 

583
00:39:50,212 --> 00:39:53,172
TYRES SCREECH 

584
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:54,960
 That noise. I know. 

585
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,924
 Ooh, that gives me a funny feeling!

586
00:39:57,964 --> 00:39:59,908
 Really? 

587
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:03,328
Whoa! Almost had the back 
wheel off the ground there. 

588
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:06,268
Right, second-to-last corner is 
where most people go wrong. 

589
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:09,988
 That is extremely tidy. Look at that. 

590
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:11,488
 And Gambon... 

591
00:40:11,528 --> 00:40:14,128
 Looking very smooth through there.

592
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:16,360
And there we are - we've crossed the line.
Lovely. 

593
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,112
APPLAUSE 

594
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:24,112
 Now... 

595
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:27,192
 Before we get on to how you did... Yeah. 

596
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:30,064
 ..I think we should have a look at Nick's lap. 

597
00:40:30,104 --> 00:40:33,344
OK. Now, Nick, your practices 
weren't entirely smooth. 

598
00:40:33,384 --> 00:40:37,892
No. I've sat forward already. No, I just 
wanted to go for it and see what happened. 

599
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:40,204
 Of course, on the second-to-last corner... 

600
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:42,892
 Well, let's have a look at what happened. 

601
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:45,296
 This is ballsy. 

602
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:48,172
 Too ballsy, in fact. 

603
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,548
LAUGHTER 

604
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:51,736
 That's a proper spin! What's that?

605
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:53,172
 Hitting the kerb. You could have rolled! 

606
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:57,608
APPLAUSE That's what I call ballsy. 

607
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:59,376
 I think the thing about being in a... 

608
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,832
being a big guy in a 
small car when you roll it 

609
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:04,600
 is there's nowhere for you to go so it's fine, 

610
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,192
you just roll around. You're wedged- 
in and your eyes go around. Yeah. 

611
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,704
 Nick, let's see how you got on. 

612
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:11,048
ENGINE REVS 

613
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,800
TYRES SCREECH 

614
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,832
Right. Good start. 
Ah, that rubber smell. 

615
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:19,956
 Reminds me of my honeymoon! 

616
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:21,736
LAUGHTER 

617
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:24,000
 Helmet suits you, got to say. 

618
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,452
I'm not going to talk about the 
honeymoon, that's why. 

619
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:27,220
 Right, first corner. 

620
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,172
 That's a tighter line there than 
Simon's and using all the road. 

621
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:33,548
When it squeals, ease it off. 

622
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,112
 Just like a bag of pigs. 

623
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:37,328
LAUGHTER 

624
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:39,628
 'I was trying to channel you.' 

625
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:42,860
'I'm not even going to go anywhere 
with these remarks in the car. 

626
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,064
 'A bag of pigs. 

627
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:47,812
'Less aggressive on the brakes
than Simon was there. 

628
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:52,800
'Now, let's have a look. 
Does this look tidy?' 

629
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,968
 'Ooh, little chirrup. Slow. 

630
00:41:54,008 --> 00:41:56,888
'Looks slow. Could be fast, though.
- You never know. 

631
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,924
 'And on to the straight.' 

632
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:00,676
 You waved! 

633
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:04,036
 Why do I keep looking in the mirror? 

634
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:06,344
Why did I keep looking in the mirror?
I don't know. 

635
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:09,520
It's natural. It's in everybody they 
must check the mirror. 

636
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,608
 Swing it to the right. 

637
00:42:11,648 --> 00:42:13,532
 Past the wall of tyres. 

638
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,936
 No, left! Left, left! It's left on the wall! 

639
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:20,048
 I went out right... Oh, I see, to come in again. 

640
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:22,752
 My willy feels funny. LAUGHTER 

641
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:27,376
 That's a James May problem. He's always 
saying he has this fizzing penis root. 

642
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,688
Right, there we... Ooh, 
so where are we going? 

643
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:32,424
Whoa! Tom Cruise line! There we are, 

644
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:35,328
we've crossed the line. APPLAUSE 

645
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:38,564
That's two wheels! 

646
00:42:38,604 --> 00:42:42,408
That's dangerous, with me being 
on the right, too. That could have... 

647
00:42:42,448 --> 00:42:44,564
Now that is... There's Michael Gambon, 
Tom Cruise 

648
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,036
and you have had it on two wheels 
in that last corner. Good. 

649
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:53,328
Awesome. But was it enough? 
That is the question. 

650
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:56,204
I can feel my heart in my ears. 

651
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:57,296
LAUGHTER 

652
00:42:57,336 --> 00:42:59,676
Right. Simon. Yes? 

653
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:01,580
You're first in the list, OK? 

654
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:07,392
When you were last here, you did it in 1:48.05, 
which actually is a very quick time, in that old...

655
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:10,408
It was a Lacetti, wasn't it? It was, yeah. 

656
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:13,736
So where do you think you've come this time? 
1:48.05 - where do you think you are now? 

657
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,360
I honestly couldn't tell you. 

658
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,984
Well, you did it in 1... 

659
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:21,640
40... 

660
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,676
4... Ooh! Wow. 

661
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:25,924
..9! Wow! You... 

662
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:27,676
APPLAUSE 

663
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:35,080
..are there. 

664
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:41,080
You'll be able to tell Tom Cruise you're right 
on top of Cameron Diaz... This isn't working, is it?

665
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,640
I think it's working fine. Between 
Cameron and Tom. That's great. 

666
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,016
You are between Cameron and Tom. 
Now, Nick, obviously the heavyweight. 

667
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:50,128
Yeah. Are you going to put HW on mine? 

668
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:52,656
LAUGHTER FF. 

669
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:56,768
 Ah! Aw! 

670
00:43:56,808 --> 00:44:00,016
He nearly killed a journalist in Birmingham 
once for making a joke about his weight. 

671
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,608
I did. Did you? I grabbed him 
round his throat. 

672
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:07,160
Really? Yeah. That's what the new 
Ferrari's called. 

673
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,752
I was talking about Ferrari. 

674
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,440
 I feel like Chewbacca now. 

675
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,296
"Let the wookiee win." HE GRUNTS 

676
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:20,472
Where do you reckon you've come 
on that? I don't know. 1:49, maybe. 

677
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:24,188
 Well, you did it in 1... 

678
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,720
 40... 

679
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,064
 4... 

680
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:32,376
 Oh! ..point 5. 

681
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:40,064
 Oh! So that puts you third... 

682
00:44:40,104 --> 00:44:41,376
 We did really well. 

683
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:43,688
 Well done. 

684
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:45,924
 Thank you, Jeremy. 

685
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:50,676
Are you surprised by this? Imagine if I 
weighed 11 stone. I'd get round in 1:08! 

686
00:44:50,716 --> 00:44:54,732
That is a remarkable performance. Have 
you done track? You've been here before. 

687
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:57,140
I've never done it. 
You've never driven on a track? 

688
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,172
I bought you a track day, 
you never went. I never went. 

689
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:02,860
You should try and take it up 
because there's a natural talent. 

690
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simon Pegg, Nick Frost. 

691
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,688
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

692
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:10,720
 Thank you very much. 

693
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,064
Well done, man. I know. Brilliant. 

694
00:45:15,104 --> 00:45:18,296
 Right, moving on. 

695
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:20,216
 Tonight... 

696
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:23,844
 Tonight we are engaged in a challenge 
that was supposed to be 

697
00:45:23,884 --> 00:45:28,124
to find the best four-seater convertible 
you can buy for less than £2,000. 

698
00:45:28,164 --> 00:45:31,812
 Yeah. Sadly, though, we all bought BMW 325i. 

699
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:33,844
 So instead we're finding out how different 

700
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:38,064
three supposedly identical cars 
have become over the years. 

701
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:43,908
Yeah. So far we've discovered that his 
car is full of mucus and mine full of poo... 

702
00:45:43,948 --> 00:45:46,968
And pubic hair. Yeah. Andspent 
most of the time broken down. 

703
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:54,564
But as we rejoin the action,
all three cars are actually working. 

704
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:56,688
 What you're looking at here is the Stig 

705
00:45:56,728 --> 00:46:02,732
setting a lap time in the 
modern-day equivalent of our cars. 

706
00:46:02,772 --> 00:46:05,908
 A time we shall try to match. 

707
00:46:05,948 --> 00:46:10,968
I'm, in some ways, confident. I have the 
paving slab in the boot giving me better handling, 

708
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:17,344
 and yet not confident at all 
because I have no brakes. 

709
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:22,608
I wonder if my brakes are any good. 
You don't know, do you? Not really, no. 

710
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:26,236
 Oooh, stand back! 

711
00:46:26,276 --> 00:46:29,968
 1:35.09. 

712
00:46:30,008 --> 00:46:36,016
Right, now we just have to see 
which one of us gets closest to that time.

713
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:40,800
 Here we go. 

714
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,092
 Wipers not working. 

715
00:46:44,132 --> 00:46:48,108
OK, this, little BMW,
is when you win back your stripes. 

716
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:50,124
 It's been lowered. 

717
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:53,080
 I think you'll findit'll suddenly 
emerge as the star. 

718
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,624
TYRES SCREECH 

719
00:46:56,664 --> 00:47:01,452
 Get out of the way, you incompetent, 
long-haired old spaniel. 

720
00:47:01,492 --> 00:47:05,248
 I think this is Chicago. 

721
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:07,360
 Come on, paving stone, do your work.

722
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,140
TYRES SCREECH 

723
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,656
 Holy moley! 

724
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:17,032
These old 325is, they had 
semi-trailing on rear suspension. 

725
00:47:17,072 --> 00:47:21,936
 They were known as the third biggest killer of 
yuppies because of the tail-happiness, 

726
00:47:21,976 --> 00:47:26,808
 after Porsche 911 and accidents involving races. 

727
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:31,424
 Here's the non-braking Jeremy Clarkson. 

728
00:47:31,464 --> 00:47:36,936
 I'll go get Hammond. 

729
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:42,548
 Ooh. I think I'm wasting quitea 
lot of time being sideways here. 

730
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:48,516
'Hammond was very easy to catch because whoever 
had lowered his car hadn't done a very good job.' 

731
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:50,764
 He's got a wobble. 

732
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:53,720
 Whoa! 

733
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,516
 My car obviously isn't the fastest here, 
but it seems to be the most stable. 

734
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:06,080
TYRES SCREECH 

735
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,092
 'In truth, 

736
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:11,516
'all of our ultimate driving 
machines had lost their edge.' 

737
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,344
 Oh, dear. 

738
00:48:13,384 --> 00:48:15,800
 'But Hammond's was in a class of its own.' 

739
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,904
 Oh-ho! 

740
00:48:18,944 --> 00:48:22,392
 He's gone. He's so gone now. 

741
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:28,780
 Ha-ha-ha! 

742
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,528
 There's a simple rule when you're buying 
a car, demonstrated by Hammond here. 

743
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:39,984
If it's been modified, especially
if it's been lowered, walk away. 

744
00:48:40,024 --> 00:48:45,800
I'm beginning to think Jeremy's rather 
crude handling pack might be the answer. 

745
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,392
'With one lap to go, we all 
decided to really go for it.' 

746
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:57,652
 No, no, no. Don't do that. Damn.

747
00:48:57,692 --> 00:49:00,528
 My seat's collapsed, badly. 

748
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:08,000
 'Still, could be worse.' 

749
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,124
ENGINE WHINES 

750
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:14,372
 Yeah! 

751
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:16,140
 Right. 

752
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,544
 Well, I hope I got a quick time in. 

753
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:22,000
 We'd find out soon enough 
because the results were in. 

754
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,280
 Here we are, these are the times.
Remember, the Stig did it in 1:35. Yeah. 

755
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,344
 James - 1:55.04. 

756
00:49:31,384 --> 00:49:34,984
 Me - 1:55.03 is my best. 

757
00:49:35,024 --> 00:49:36,952
 And, Jeremy, your best, 

758
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:40,528
 1:48.0 - which means you win. 

759
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:43,372
It's a hollow victory. 
Where's your car? Over there. 

760
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:46,888
 It's quite broken. What's wrong with it? Well... 

761
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:51,688
the rear hose let go, sprayed water over 
the electrics, which shorted them out. 

762
00:49:51,728 --> 00:49:54,968
 The exhaust manifold is cracked 

763
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:58,688
 and the head's cooked. You've killed it. 

764
00:49:58,728 --> 00:50:03,440
Luckily for Jeremy, our next experiment 
didn't involve any movement. 

765
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,968
Over time, the roof on a convertible- 
will get baggy and start to leak. 

766
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,904
 To see which of our cars leaks the most, 

767
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:16,108
 we've devised an ingenious test. 

768
00:50:16,148 --> 00:50:21,888
James is sitting in his car holding his 
breath, because his car is full of gas. 

769
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:26,608
Now if the car leaks, the gas will escape, and 
when he needs to take a breath, he'll be fine. 

770
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:32,080
If it doesn't leak, the gas won't escape and when 
he needs to take a breath, he'll be in trouble. 

771
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,672
 So is it cyanide we're using? 

772
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:35,280
 No, helium. Helium? 

773
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,032
 Yeah. Pure helium? Yes. 

774
00:50:37,072 --> 00:50:38,468
 That'll kill him. Yes. 

775
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:40,404
JAMES EXHALES Here we go. 

776
00:50:40,444 --> 00:50:43,032
 He's breathing. That's it, come on. 

777
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:46,156
HIGH-PITCHED: Whose idea was 
this test? Bloody stupid idea. 

778
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:48,468
OTHERS LAUGH It's a very good idea. 

779
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:50,732
 We've learned about your car. 

780
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:55,328
You sound like Donald Duck 
because your car has done well. 

781
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:59,544
Given the contents of his car, 
Hammond quite enjoyed holding his breath. 

782
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:04,280
HE EXHALES 

783
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,936
NORMAL PITCH:
Ah, you see mine's had a new... Oh! 

784
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:10,000
OTHERS LAUGH 

785
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,448
 Not a new roof fitted very well. 

786
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:18,780
You thought you'd have a squeaky voice! 
I was expecting a full Smurf and it's not worked. 

787
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,000
 Finally it was Jeremy's turn. 

788
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,312
 He's going to have to breathe. He's done it. Right. 

789
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:28,652
 HIGH-PITCHED: I just have to say that's stupid. 

790
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:32,468
 It's just a test of how big your lungs are. 

791
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:34,528
 After this we got Jeremy's car going 

792
00:51:34,568 --> 00:51:39,496
 and went to see a group of BMW specialists. 

793
00:51:39,536 --> 00:51:41,248
 Their job was to calculate the cost 

794
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:49,764
 of returning each of our cars to showroom condition. 

795
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:53,404
 These cars come from a time 
when people fitted after-market stereos. 

796
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,420
 Let me talk you through this one. 

797
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,404
 Here's the radio. 

798
00:51:57,444 --> 00:52:00,404
 STATIC That's Radio 1, Radio 2, 

799
00:52:00,444 --> 00:52:03,920
 Radio 3, Radio 4... STATIC CONTINUES 

800
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,328
 ..Radio 5. 

801
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:09,932
STATIC CONTINUES 

802
00:52:09,972 --> 00:52:11,840
 Don't know what that is. 

803
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,840
Eventually the experts had 
finished their assessments. 

804
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,796
 Who has the results for 
Richard Hammond's sewage farm? I do.

805
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,560
 £7,500. 

806
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,808
 7,500 to put that into showroom condition? 

807
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:28,000
 Sir, you have the results for James' car. 

808
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,216
 Around 5,500. So £2,000 less. Well done. 

809
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:34,088
 Did you just say well done? I did.

810
00:52:34,128 --> 00:52:37,280
 You're a girl. How much would mine cost to put into show? 

811
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,248
 Well, how many pence? 

812
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:42,216
HE CLEARS THROAT Er...11,000. 

813
00:52:42,256 --> 00:52:44,340
 That's pounds, not pence. OTHERS LAUGH 

814
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,156
 What a pile of junk! Why is it £11,000? 

815
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:49,748
 What possible reason is there for that? 

816
00:52:49,788 --> 00:52:52,528
 Oh. Oh, there's a few reasons. 

817
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:56,388
 Oh, it's blown away. 

818
00:52:56,428 --> 00:53:00,448
Since none of our cars were really 
roadworthy, we decided at this point 

819
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:07,312
that the best thing we could do with 
them was form a stunt driving team. 

820
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:15,776
 We began by watching the experts. 

821
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:22,904
 How do they memorise the moves? 

822
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:25,436
 That was a J-turn. 

823
00:53:25,476 --> 00:53:33,776
 I can do all the moves individually, I think. 

824
00:53:33,816 --> 00:53:37,060
 'It all looked terribly complicated- 
and that was a worry, 

825
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:45,872
 'because the next day, we would be 
performing in front of a live audience.' 

826
00:53:45,912 --> 00:53:51,248
 Wow. That's quite good. 

827
00:53:51,288 --> 00:53:52,624
We're going to need to work on that. 

828
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:56,108
 'We began by planning our moves on a blackboard.' 

829
00:53:56,148 --> 00:53:58,120
 That's the nose of the car that 
pointing that way. That's 

830
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,088
 Over here, right, that's Jeremy.

831
00:54:05,128 --> 00:54:10,012
 Then here... 

832
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:13,436
 Those cars both have J on. They 
both have J. So it could be... Oh. 

833
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:15,592
 'James took over.' 

834
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:19,368
We have a numbering system, 
so you go first. I cross behind you... 

835
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:22,340
 Everything goes through that point,
- the point of the performance... 

836
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,968
 'But his plans were a bit confusing.' 

837
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:27,904
 Sorry, I'm lost. 

838
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:29,980
 Which is my dotted line now? 

839
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,592
 That one. No, you were this one. 
Yeah, it is that one. 

840
00:54:34,632 --> 00:54:37,776
 'Nevertheless, we wet the track 
to make it more slippery 

841
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,496
 'and got to work.' 

842
00:54:39,536 --> 00:54:45,000
 Right, here we go. 

843
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,932
 'Initially, things didn't go well.' 

844
00:54:48,972 --> 00:54:53,280
 This is just a lot of driving about.

845
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,652
 Why have you gone over there? Sorry.

846
00:54:57,692 --> 00:55:01,652
 'Then, thanks to my awful brakes, 
they got worse.' 

847
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:04,028
 I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping!- 
MUFFLED THUMP 

848
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:07,056
 Oh, damn it. 

849
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,280
'Despite everything, though, the 
next day we were ready to perform 

850
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:17,212
 'at one of the most 
prestigious venues in the country...' 

851
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:18,652
 In the wild, birds of prey... 

852
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:23,608
 '..The Essex County Fair. 

853
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:26,000
 'Our cars had been given a new lick of paint, 

854
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,980
 'and as zero hour approached, 

855
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,624
 'we were in our motor home 
rehearsing our moves.' 

856
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:33,904
 Go. Right, so... 

857
00:55:33,944 --> 00:55:35,904
 Turn, Turn, through. And I'm here.

858
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:38,324
 Handbrake. Back forwards. 

859
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:41,932
 Face the other way by then. Through- 
the gap. Round you. Handbrake. 

860
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,560
 OK, ready? And then now... Cross, I go first. 

861
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,652
 Over there. 

862
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:53,572
 It's going to be magnificent. Right, let's do it. 

863
00:55:53,612 --> 00:56:00,728
We're a bit like the Red Arrows. Pretty 
much. It's quite an exciting moment. 

864
00:56:00,768 --> 00:56:06,808
 Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from TV's 
Top Gear, The Dukes Of Harlow stunt driving team. 

865
00:56:06,848 --> 00:56:10,264
 'The capacity crowd was beside itself. 

866
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:14,340
 'As the music signalled the start of 
our routine, we entered the arena.' 

867
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,840
MUSIC: "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen 

868
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:24,652
We'd better deliver. Suddenly feel 
this is quite a responsibility. 

869
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:26,592
 Right, left, down... 

870
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:29,620
 left, straight up. 

871
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,648
 Must remember that crossover. 

872
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:40,056
 Ready, steady, go. 

873
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:43,480
 And turn, turn. 

874
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:52,044
 Oh! 

875
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:55,356
 Now, it is a shame we can't 
show you the rest of that film, 

876
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:59,324
but we lost the tapes. Yes! 
Can you believe it? LAUGHTER 

877
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:04,728
You left them on a bus. And then the dog 
ate them. Yeah. Dog ate them. It is a rotten... 

878
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:08,368
It is a massive shame, because 
therest of our routine was brilliant. 

879
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:12,232
 It's just a tragedy you can't see it. 
I do apologise. 

880
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:17,008
It does at least give us time to knock up a 
scoreboard and see who bought the best car. 

881
00:57:17,048 --> 00:57:21,932
 Yes. In the nought to 100 and 
then nought again test, 

882
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:24,168
James set the benchmark,
so he gets zero. 

883
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:28,668
 I got minus 281 and, Hammond, 
you got minus 1,000. 

884
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:33,000
I didn't even take part. 
That's why you get minus 1,000. 

885
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,168
Now, forensics, you get ten points off for every 
disgusting thing that was found in your car. 

886
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:42,120
Mine was crisps, leaves and bits of- my own skin, 
so that's not really disgusting at all, so nought. 

887
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,684
 James, you were mucus, scabs and saliva. 

888
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:49,168
 You're minus 30. 

889
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:53,008
Hammond, you, let's get this straight, 
you were saliva, blood... 

890
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:55,716
But there was no mucus in mine! mucus, 
but there was pubic hair... 

891
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:58,464
 Yeah, yeah. ..so minus 30 and then poo. 

892
00:57:58,504 --> 00:58:00,480
 Yeah. That's 1,000... 

893
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,696
 Why do I get minus 1,000 for poo? 
Because poo's really disgusting! 

894
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:08,076
Of course you're going to 
get minus 1,000 for that. 

895
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:12,436
We don't make the rules. The thief test. 
Jeremy... JEREMY MOUTHS: We do! 

896
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:15,716
Your car wasn't stolen so you 
get nought. Yeah. 

897
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:18,544
My car wasn't, so I get nought. 

898
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:23,528
Hammond, your car was stolen. Yes? 
And you get minus 1,000. 

899
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:25,448
 Do I?LAUGHTER 

900
00:58:25,488 --> 00:58:29,308
How do you get to that?
It just is, it's scientific, this. Lap times. 

901
00:58:29,348 --> 00:58:30,872
 You didn't get minus 1,000 for that.

902
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:33,480
 They're there. The gas test. 

903
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,544
Let's get this straight. No gas escaped 
from my car so I get nought.

904
00:58:37,584 --> 00:58:41,008
 No gas escaped from your car, 
James, so that's nought. 

905
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:43,852
All of the gas escaped from 
yours so that's minus... 

906
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:48,448
Let me guess. Yes, you're right, 
it's minus 1,000. Is it? 

907
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:52,288
Is it really? Yes, it is. The restoration 
test, here you lose a point 

908
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,776
for every pound it would take to get 
your car back to showroom condition. 

909
00:58:55,816 --> 00:58:58,964
Now, I, as you would expect, 
did best at this, 

910
00:58:59,004 --> 00:59:03,028
 so I'm minus 5,500 points. 

911
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:05,280
 It's like being on QI, this. 

912
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,368
 Hammond, you are minus 7,500 points.

913
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:12,336
 And Jeremy Clarkson... Mmm-hmm. 

914
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:17,260
 ..you are minus 11,000. 

915
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,728
Ah! I might beat... 
Well, not him but you, anyway. 

916
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,900
 What have you got, James? 
I've won, obviously. That's a given.

917
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,620
 You are... 

918
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:32,684
 minus 11,293.1. 

919
00:59:32,724 --> 00:59:36,400
 Minus 11,293.1. Yes. 

920
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,528
 So, Hammond, this is tense. Minus 11,000... 

921
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:42,184
 Still hope, though. I can still do it. Oooh! 

922
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:43,492
 549... Yes! 

923
00:59:43,532 --> 00:59:47,308
APPLAUSE 

924
00:59:47,348 --> 00:59:48,604
 I mean, well done, James. 

925
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:52,852
But, really, two conclusions 
we can draw from this. 

926
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:57,728
One, all identical cars aren't 
necessarily identical. 

927
00:59:57,768 --> 01:00:01,088
Some of them do have 
pubic hairs in them and poo. 

928
01:00:01,128 --> 01:00:05,900
And two, Richard Hammond, who buys 
more used cars than any man alive, 

929
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,024
 is useless at buying used cars. 

930
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,228
I am. On that bombshell, it's time to end.
