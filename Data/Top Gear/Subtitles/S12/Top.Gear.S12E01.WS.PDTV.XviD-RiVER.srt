1
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:16,175
Tonight, the brighter,
whiter way to ruin your underpants.

2
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:19,815
How much lorry-ing
can you get for £5,000?

3
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:25,096
And Michael Parkinson has a go
in tu' reasonably priced car.

4
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:33,055
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:35,615
Hello! Hello and welcome!

6
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:36,736
Hello!

7
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:42,016
Thank you so much, thank you and
welcome to a brand new series.

8
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:47,375
Now, in this series we thought
we'd aim it at a slightly
more mature, older audience,

9
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:52,175
so we did a thing on why beige
is the right colour for your car.

10
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:55,776
Erm, we did... I went on a coach
tour of North Wales.

11
00:00:55,776 --> 00:01:02,855
And then, and then we found out
the BBC is putting us up against
Strictly Come Sequins.

12
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,935
The same time, on the other side!

13
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:07,976
Now, everyone over the age of 85
is gonna be watching that,

14
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:13,975
so we had to throw all our hard
work away, and literally,
yesterday morning, begin again.

15
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:17,415
Here comes a taster now of what
we've been able to cobble together.

16
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,696
Blinkers on, and off we go!

17
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:24,336
Aagh! Ha-ha!

18
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:26,976
Wow! This is great!

19
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,695
Right, San Tropez.

20
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,456
Please can I go home?

21
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:36,656
No!

22
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:38,736
Go, go, go!

23
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:47,655
Come o-o-o-on!

24
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:49,135
Check it out!

25
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:53,655
Forward into the pages of history!

26
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,736
This is important work.

27
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:02,855
Stig's Communist cousin.

28
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,136
Goodbye, Mr May!

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,856
It's Hakkinen!

30
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,496
Now, I'm just utterly lost.

31
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:21,336
Back to the studio.

32
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,855
Hey, that's my line!

33
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,016
ALL LAUGH

34
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,456
APPLAUSE

35
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:26,536
Not bad, hey?

36
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:28,376
All that in 24 hours.

37
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:34,495
So anyway, that's
what's coming up in the series.

38
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:38,976
Now, let's get on with tonight,
has bought Volkswagen,

39
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,536
and as a result every hedge
in the world has gone bust.

40
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:45,856
I've no idea what any of that means,
but I do understand this,

41
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:53,335
it is the GTII, it's a lightweight,
stripped out, hardcore two-wheel
drive version of the Turbo.

42
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:55,976
And I've been out on the track
to see what it's like.

43
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:03,696
Aaaaaaagh!

44
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:07,576
Aaaaaaagh!

45
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,735
Aaaaaaagh!

46
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:18,216
And that concludes
my road test of the GTII.

47
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:19,215
It's terrifying.

48
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:25,736
Which is why, if I wanted
a really fast two-seater,

49
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:28,495
I'd get one of these.

50
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:43,335
Some people have said
in the last year or so
that the Lamborghini Gallardo

51
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:47,016
is just an Audi R8 with a fancy name
and a bigger price tag.

52
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:54,496
Not any more it isn't.

53
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,016
This new model,
daintily called the LP560-4,

54
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,976
looks pretty much
the same as the old model.

55
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,255
But it's 20 kilograms lighter,
and more powerful.

56
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,895
It now has a 5.2-litre V10,

57
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:22,296
which produces 552 horsepowers.

58
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:32,176
That means this streak of
white lightning is faster even
than the old Gallardo Super Legera.

59
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:35,016
It's faster, too,
than a Ferrari Scuderia.

60
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:50,935
That thing has launched control,
you put it in first, built the
boost up to 13lb per square inch,

61
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:56,215
dump the clutch, and you're off.
This has something
called thrust control.

62
00:04:56,215 --> 00:05:02,136
I think that sounds like the hero
in an airport thriller -
Thrust Control.

63
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,536
What you do, put it in Corsa,
which means...something.

64
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:09,136
Turn off the traction control,
like so.

65
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,455
Left foot on the brake,
build the revs up...

66
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,375
Oh, my God!

67
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,656
Wow!

68
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,295
That's so fast.

69
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:55,136
So, the Lamborghini is faster,
and it's nicer to drive as well.

70
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:59,616
In a corner, the GTII
was all over the place,

71
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:01,696
the wheel was bucking and riding,

72
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:05,536
the back end was playing hopscotch,
the front end was pitter-pattering.

73
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:11,215
Look at it!

74
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:16,856
I can see it here, look, following
me around on this rear-view camera,

75
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:23,176
it's like being chased
around by a turbocharged,
newly-born albino smoking horse!

76
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,736
Don't get me wrong,
this is still very Lamborghin-ish.

77
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,936
Loud, big grunt...

78
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:44,855
But behind the shouty,
get out of my way exterior

79
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:49,336
beats the heart of
a big four-wheel-drive softie.

80
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:56,535
I'm not kidding, anyone could get
into this and drive it very fast
straight away, no problem at all.

81
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:14,055
MUSIC: THE ARCHERS THEME

82
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:38,696
Drawbacks?

83
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,936
You have to have
the flappy paddle gear box,

84
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,695
which is annoying some of the time.

85
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,816
Like for instance
when you're parking.

86
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:50,095
But the option is
the six-speed manual,
which comes with the clutch pedal,

87
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,775
and that means there's nowhere to
put your left foot.

88
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:54,455
And that's annoying all the time.

89
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,056
So far as styling's concerned,

90
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:06,696
the GTII is just
a squashed Volkswagen Beetle
with a wing on the back.

91
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:18,016
The Lamborghini on the other hand
will probably go down
in automotive history

92
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:21,496
as one of the all-time
great-looking cars.

93
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,455
Especially with its
pointy new Reventon-style nose.

94
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:37,056
They say this new shape is much less
damaging to any pedestrians
you might hit.

95
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,256
But, if I were a pedestrian,

96
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,856
and I saw one of these
things coming, I'd just go...

97
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:52,896
As I see it, there's just one
drawback to this low-riding Lambo.

98
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:57,935
At £147,000, it's even more
expensive than a loaf of bread.

99
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:03,335
So, it's your choice, really.
You can have a dog.

100
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,375
Aaarrghhh!

101
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:13,016
Or a car that can be driven by one.

102
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:27,055
How can you not like the GTII,
you great, fat, balding, useless,

103
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:32,896
hopeless, bandy-legged bubble head,
pointless, talentless, gutless,

104
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:36,496
cowardly, witless lump
of suede shoe-wearing

105
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,656
daft-jean wearing idiocy?

106
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,615
I knew you were gonna say that.
All of that?

107
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,896
So I've decided that we're gonna
settle this on the track, OK?

108
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:48,136
That means handing these cars
over to our tame racing driver.

109
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:52,256
Some say that he sleeps inside out.

110
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:58,816
And that he once had full sex with
Russell Brand's answering machine.

111
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,335
All we know is,

112
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:06,895
he's called The Stig!

113
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:10,735
And he's off! Just a hint of
wheelspin, but then it digs in,

114
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,096
this thing really is
ferocious off the line.

115
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:16,416
The green Lambo here, Stig
trying to mount the white one!

116
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,936
Very composed through
the first corner,

117
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,856
like to see the Porsche try that!

118
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,855
BEEPING

119
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:29,856
Yes, Stig appears to have
started listening to Morse code,

120
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:32,616
very strange, or maybe
it's him making that noise!

121
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,256
Belts it through Chicago.
Now, Hammerhead...

122
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:38,735
Four-wheel drive, of course,
that should keep it tidy.

123
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,056
Yes, it does!
Not a hint of understeer,

124
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:44,096
just a wall of that V10 noise.

125
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,215
BEEPING
And Morse code.

126
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,096
Now, Follow-through.

127
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:57,376
Look at that, he's having to use
a flick of opposite lock,
Stig's really going for it!

128
00:10:57,376 --> 00:11:01,975
Steps out again after
the tyres, steady on,
you Morse-crazed mentalist!

129
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:06,295
Two corners left, still working
hard, only Gambon to go now.

130
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:09,415
Look at this! Here he comes,
he just glides it through,

131
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,056
and across the line!

132
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:17,416
The Lamborghini did it in 1.19.5,

133
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,015
that's quicker
than the Scuderia, I said.

134
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,216
Now let's do the news.

135
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:23,816
No, no, no! Very good,
but what about the Porsche?

136
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,656
No, what did the Porsche do it in?
I don't think anybody's interested.

137
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:30,895
It was faster, wasn't it?

138
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,255
What time did the GTII manage?

139
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,336
Tell me the time for the Porsche.

140
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,496
It's caught fire.

141
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:41,496
I don't know how that happened, it's
literally spontaneously combusted!

142
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:44,695
Where does it go on the board?

143
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:46,576
Can't see any more.

144
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:49,176
It was an hour. An hour?

145
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:53,176
Yeah, I'm sorry, mate, that's it.

146
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,976
That is pathetic!

147
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:58,856
It has come to this,
let's do the news, as I said.

148
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:02,255
Right, the news. And of course we
have been off the air for a while.

149
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,335
God, he's such a child.
Yes, where is he, anyway?

150
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:09,856
I don't know, in the audience
flicking people's ears and blaming
people... Excuse me. Hi.

151
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,496
What a man. What a man!

152
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,416
Or...

153
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,296
Ah!

154
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,096
Twice on the trot!

155
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:51,455
Still, never mind, Lewis,
next year, third time lucky.

156
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:54,976
But why do we record this
on a Wednesday? I've no idea.

157
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:57,055
If we did it on a Sunday,
we'd know by now.

158
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:00,016
world. I'll tell you what,

159
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:05,176
if we recorded on a Sunday, we'd
know who won Strictly Come Dancing,
and then we could tell everybody.

160
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:10,816
Now, OK, there has been
a financial crisis.

161
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:14,136
Is it the first time
you've heard of it?

162
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:18,335
What happened in essence as far
as I could work out is
because we were off the air,

163
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:22,856
everyone got bored,
so banks started lending money
they hadn't got to other banks

164
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:28,095
that gave the non-existent money
to Mexicans in southern California
who couldn't pay it back.

165
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:30,695
Now as a result
your cars are all worthless. Yeah.

166
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:36,056
I think what I've done there
is summarised the financial crisis
quite well. You done it nicely.

167
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:40,375
I was having dinner with a man.
We were talking about
the financial problems,

168
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:45,015
and he said he bought a Volkswagen
Phaeton, the five-litre V10.

169
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:49,736
He paid £60,000 for it, 18
months ago, just been offered 17.

170
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:57,175
Ow! That's £85 a day
depreciation on a Volkswagen.
You're gonna feel that.

171
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,776
I can beat that. Really?

172
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:09,975
Yes, the Aston Martin V8 Vantage,
a nice one, £88,000, list price...

173
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,576
We know somebody who's got one
of these, actually.

174
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,815
Yeah, we do, it's, erm,
hang on, er...

175
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:19,256
Oh, no! It's the Clarksons!
That's it, I knew somebody...

176
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:22,215
I'm not going to enjoy this, am I?
No, do carry on, please.

177
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:25,335
A car just like yours...
The one you've got.

178
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:30,735
It was £88,000 new, with
a few extras on it, guess how much
that was worth a year later?

179
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:33,856
What? £44,000.
Half its value gone.

180
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,016
Halved its va...?
Anyone here got a V8 Vantage?

181
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:43,136
Well, you're all
better off as a result.

182
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,416
Has anybody here got a Vanquish?

183
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,976
Here? Yeah. No, cos they're here,
James. That's very true.

184
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:52,855
That's even worse, that's £175,000 -

185
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:56,055
guess how much that car was worth
after 10,000 miles?

186
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:57,816
Guess how much he got. No idea.

187
00:14:58,135 --> 00:14:59,536
£50,000.

188
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:02,575
That's 125 grand in 10,000 miles!

189
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:08,535
So that means if his nearest shop
is two miles away, if he pops out
for a pint of milk,

190
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:10,696
that's 50 quid. Yes.

191
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:13,535
£50 for a pint...?

192
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:20,615
That's £50 in depreciation,
that doesn't include, you know, tyre
wear, petrol, insurance, milk...

193
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:24,976
You see, I get my milk from the
back of a cow, it's much cheaper.

194
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:27,296
From the back of a c...?
That's not milk.

195
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:28,736
LAUGHTER

196
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:30,135
Under a cow.

197
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,816
It's not just Astons.

198
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:36,175
Mercedes Benz CL 600,
the big coupe...

199
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:39,416
Yes. 2004, how much do you think
it was worth then?

200
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:44,976
Well it depends on a million things,
like, is it baby diarrhoea brown?

201
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,216
No, it's black.

202
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:49,696
Has it done a million miles?
No, it's done 30,000 miles.

203
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:54,736
Four-year-old, they're 100 grand,
those things. About four years
ago, about 100 grand? Yep.

204
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:58,575
So £100,000,
four years old, 30,000 miles,

205
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:03,335
in black, with extras, 50? 55.

206
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,776
16. 60? 16.

207
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:10,055
16,000? He got £16,000 for it.
For a hundred grand car?

208
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,896
I'd have given him a 16 and a half.

209
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,376
I'd have gone 17.

210
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:15,735
Are you watching?

211
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:18,775
How do you feel now?
Yeah, you sold it cheap!

212
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:21,336
I'll tell you exactly
what's happened here,

213
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:26,696
Since 1993, the whole world
of flash cars has been
playing musical chairs,

214
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:31,496
and the music has just stopped,
so whatever colour you've got now,
or house, that's it for life.

215
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:37,376
James, bad news, the Dacia Sandero.

216
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:41,616
The what? The Dacia Sandero
is not coming to the UK.

217
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,776
Oh!

218
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,136
AUDIENCE: Oh!

219
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,255
Now, er, British car...

220
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:51,496
British sports car makers,
heroic chaps in sheds,
they've always been able to

221
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:54,816
pretty much melt your heart
with their creativity,

222
00:16:54,816 --> 00:17:00,776
with the fantastic swooping curves
of an E-Type Jaguar
or an Aston Martin DB7.

223
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:03,176
And now, there's
a new British sports car.

224
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:04,696
And here it is.

225
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:05,776
Good grief!

226
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,896
Is that a car or the shed he
built it in with some wheels?

227
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:17,815
It's the Jet Stream SC250,
it costs you £30,000,
and it's made in Cornwall.

228
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,375
Is it made out of tin?

229
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,496
No.

230
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,695
Clotted cream? Strawberry wheels...

231
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:27,096
Does it spend every night
on Harlyn Bay trying to snog
public school girls?

232
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,695
While smoking marijuana?

233
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:34,776
None of these jokes are
working with this audience,
but they are in my house.

234
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:35,695
I know what you mean! Yes.

235
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:45,416
Actually, I have to say,
I do feel for the poor bloke
who's launched this,

236
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:49,936
Are you saying all British sports
car manufacturers who
optimistically set up in a shed

237
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:53,335
and think they can do better than
Porsche go bust? What, like TVR?

238
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,895
Yes. Marcos? Yes.

239
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,416
Yes. Yes. Yes.

240
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,976
Ginetta. No!
Are Ginetta still going? They are.

241
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,335
Well, there's hope for him yet!

242
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:10,175
Erm, a really good report
in the papers this week,

243
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:14,816
and in Shropshire, somebody went
to one of those speed cameras,

244
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:18,016
put a tyre over it, a blanket over
the top of the whole ensemble

245
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:20,616
then poured petrol on it
and set it alight.

246
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:24,455
The fire brigade spokesman said
it was "a deliberate attack".

247
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:31,536
Now listen, a lot of, in the current
financial crisis, a lot of people
won't be going on holiday next year

248
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:35,095
to the Caribbean, or indeed
anywhere even remotely exotic.

249
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:38,496
But don't worry because I think I've
come up with a solution for you.

250
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,695
Check it out. Good grief!

251
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:47,695
It's a company in the Isle of Wight
that's modified a Citroen
by fitting it with a hat. Yeah.

252
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:50,535
Do you know, it cost £19,000?

253
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:55,896
What's that, is that a window,
or do you sort of unzip it, climb in,
and put your head through it?

254
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,496
Look, I've come as a Citroen!

255
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,736
It's like one of those things
at Pontin's -

256
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:04,375
go on, kids, stick your face through
the Citroen. At £19,000.

257
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,895
For a Citroen costume!

258
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,216
And it only has one bed. Well,
he's not gonna have a friend, is he?

259
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,416
No.

260
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,295
You won't need two!

261
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,656
Lorry drivers - they're
always telling us they
have got a very hard job.

262
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:24,136
As far as we can work out,
they go to work, sit down
and then go home again.

263
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:25,855
Yeah. How hard can that be?

264
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:31,456
To find out, the producers gave
us each £5,000 and told us to use

265
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:38,416
our extensive knowledge of
lorries and lorrying to try and buy
the best trucks we could find.

266
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,335
Then we were told to report to our
test track where we would find out

267
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:44,496
what it's actually
like to be a lorryist.

268
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,695
No, the purple one was
biscuit and raisin. No.

269
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,695
Yes, it had little bits of biscuit
in it. The blue was the original.

270
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:02,456
Blue has nothing extra.
Yes, that was. Just chocolate.

271
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,175
And then they did the pink one,
which was only.. EH?

272
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:06,376
They never did a pink one! They did.

273
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:10,255
It was called It's For Girls and they
only sold it on the Isle of Man.
Not a lot of people know that.

274
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:16,255
At exactly 9.14,
the lorries turned up.

275
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:21,975
Brilliant. Good.

276
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:33,456
Using our massive knowledge of HGVs,
we set about explaining why we bought
what we'd bought.

277
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:37,175
May, which one's yours?

278
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:44,656
Scania D94. This is the sleeper cab,
which has got the extra bit on
the back where you can sleep.

279
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:49,456
They also did it as a day cab,
which didn't have that bit
so you couldn't sleep in it.

280
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,256
He doesn't know anything.

281
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:56,056
What colour is it, James?

282
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,135
What have you got then? A lorry.

283
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,816
What sort? A big one.

284
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:10,135
Clearly. It's a Renault.

285
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:16,816
the engine, so it has a flat floor
and that means...

286
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:19,456
The floor's flat.
.. it's easier to fit the carpet.

287
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:22,175
Come on, Hammond.
Show me what you've got.

288
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,216
I have this. What is it?

289
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:30,616
It's an Erf. This was hopeless. So
we resorted to our lorry crib sheets.

290
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,056
Has yours got...

291
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,655
Is all this just my lorry?

292
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:40,136
12 litre straight six. Go.

293
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:44,776
11 litres. It's not as big
but it's still pretty big.

294
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:47,936
Nine litres. The thing is...

295
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:49,856
Did you just buy a shed?

296
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:52,816
Yours is tiny.
It is ridiculously small.

297
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:55,696
That's a Caterham of the lorry
world. Right. And the point
of that is?

298
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:59,296
Well, there's bound to be a speed
test. You think your lightweight
11 litre lorry...

299
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,016
It's a Lotus lorry. Yeah.

300
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:08,735
No, not that. In less developed
countries, such as Australia

301
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:12,296
and America, people like to decorate
and personalise their lorries.

302
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:16,856
You will now go away and do the same.

303
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:19,096
I'm gonna need a hell
of a lot of paint.

304
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:28,216
Once our lorries had been
redecorated, we were told to meet at

305
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:32,615
Top Gear's secret Alpine
test location in Bedfordshire.

306
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:42,376
Richard had tried to make his
lorry look more American by
fitting a bonnet,

307
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,976
which was actually a dog kennel.

308
00:22:44,976 --> 00:22:48,456
James had gone for a gay
and friendly Indian look.

309
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:56,496
And I hadn't. Damn it.

310
00:22:56,496 --> 00:23:00,816
So, time for the next challenge.

311
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:03,576
What matters to lorry drivers?
Murdering prostitutes...

312
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:06,615
And fuel economy. Load. Breakfast.

313
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:12,335
You must now demonstrate
your lorry driving skills by

314
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:16,296
power sliding your trucks around...

315
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:18,976
I presume it is that skid pad.

316
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,455
What is the point? You can't power
slide lorries anyway. Technically,
you can't power slide anything.

317
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:29,496
To prove that it's possible you
will now watch a demonstration
by our tame racing driver.

318
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:35,856
Some say that his favourite
all-time tune is Forever
Autumn by Justin Hayward

319
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:40,855
and that he has the world's
largest collection of
pornographical material.

320
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:46,536
All we know is, he's not The Stig
but he is The Stig's lorry-driving
cousin.

321
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:53,736
# On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell...

322
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:55,456
# Look, he's got the lorry
driver's suntan.

323
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:56,935
Oh, sunburn. I see, yes.

324
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:02,975
He's really as
big as the American Stig.

325
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,576
Rig Stig.

326
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:10,416
Rig Stig climbed into
his tuned man and set off.

327
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:16,056
Look at that! That's fantastic.

328
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:21,976
I love the smell of burning rubber
in the morning when it is
coming off that.

329
00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:24,175
That is power sliding now.

330
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,775
He's doing a doughnut!

331
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,256
Run for your lives!

332
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,736
James, what do you reckon?
You can do that?

333
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,655
Piece of cake.

334
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:48,575
Gingerly, we hit the skid pan.

335
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:54,055
This strip I've put here, I
can't really see where I'm going.

336
00:24:54,055 --> 00:25:00,576
Take the outside line
second gear high range.

337
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:04,296
Power sliding is easy in a car.
Turn in, no power on.

338
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:09,495
That's not gone as well as I'd hoped.

339
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,895
Here we go. A slide.

340
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:14,735
Come on, you're a racing truck.
This is what you should be good at.

341
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:17,135
Oh, my bonnet ...
I've driven over my own bonnet.

342
00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:24,776
Left foot braking,
there's the answer.

343
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:30,775
That didn't work,
so I gave it more welly.

344
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,695
And that really didn't work. No, no!

345
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,056
Yeah, I'll do some of that.

346
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,776
It doesn't work.

347
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:49,176
Meanwhile, in the Renault...

348
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:51,735
Come on! Spin!

349
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,576
Ow!

350
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:11,816
Lorry driving, it turns out, is
quite a lot harder than I thought.

351
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:16,216
Have you done something to
your leg as well? Yeah, the
gear lever's gone up my arse.

352
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:21,615
After the gear lever had been
removed from Jeremy's bottom,
we moved on to the next challenge.

353
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:25,015
I've lost the suspension linkages.

354
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:26,616
On your leg? No, on the lorry.

355
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:28,815
You will now drive to
Milbrook's High Speed Bowl.

356
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:31,375
You see!
I told you there'd be a speed test.

357
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:37,256
But, first, you must hitch up
a trailer and get there via the
Alpine handling course.

358
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:40,215
That's hundreds of miles. No.

359
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,415
It's here, you idiot.
It's just over there.

360
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,455
This is where car makers test
the handling of their new models.

361
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:54,295
It's also where James Bond rolled
his Aston Martin in Casino Royale.

362
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:58,376
In a car, it is huge fun.

363
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,815
In a lorry ...

364
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,616
it probably isn't.

365
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:06,855
From the moment you arrive at
the Alpine course, you have
three minutes to get round.

366
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:10,936
You will also need to drive smoothly
because your trailer
is full of valuables.

367
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:14,095
Valuables? Valuables?

368
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:15,775
They weren't kidding.

369
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:23,256
Richard's trailer contained a car
that hadn't been fastened down.

370
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:26,855
Mine contained an enormous
wedding-cake.

371
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:32,416
And in Jeremy's , there was
some straw, which didn't seem

372
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:37,736
so bad but at the other end
there was an electric fire.

373
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:44,056
First though, we had to get the
trailers attached to our lorries.

374
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:47,056
Where's my truck?

375
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:51,735
There's no back window.
I don't see why this needs
to be all that difficult.

376
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:54,295
Which way is that now?
So I need to get that ...

377
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:02,775
Hammond, being familiar with
farmyard machinery, was confident
of a quick hitch up. Easy.

378
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,936
Us two, however ...

379
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,496
Well, where does that go?

380
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,895
Didn't think this would
be difficult and it's not.

381
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:19,055
It's done.
The space between the cab...

382
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:20,976
Yours is done?

383
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:24,695
Yeah. If a lorry driver can do that,
why isn't he a brain surgeon?

384
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:27,415
Scale. You know how he's finished...

385
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,975
Hi.

386
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:31,255
You're looking smug.

387
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:36,856
Eventually, some men came to
help James and I, which gave
me a chance to mend my window.

388
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:39,376
Why are you doing that?
Because I can't see where I'm going.

389
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:41,456
Didn't you think of that when you
put it on? No.

390
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,856
Finally, we were ready to go.

391
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,656
Away we go.

392
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:04,656
You know the, "I've done it,
I've finished" - you know that bit?

393
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:06,255
Maybe the pin's broken.

394
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:08,136
No.

395
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:11,336
It could just be a faulty
bracket that holds the... No.

396
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:16,136
OK, you're in there.

397
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:19,096
Eventually,
we were ready to go again.

398
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:20,776
Sorry about that.

399
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,415
Right, we're off.

400
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:33,416
Forgive me for saying this,
but how hard can it be?

401
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,096
Can somebody bring the forklift back?

402
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:41,015
So, third time lucky.

403
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,776
This is brilliant.

404
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:53,655
Oi! It was just over a mile from the
hitching point to the Alpine course,

405
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:58,415
but that was enough to give
us a taste of what it's like
to be a real lorry-driver.

406
00:29:58,415 --> 00:30:02,776
For starters, there's
the sheer number of gears.

407
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:05,856
First, into first and a half. Second.

408
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:10,495
Two and a half. In a car, you can
go from 1000 rpm to seven or 8000.

409
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:13,736
In this, its 1200 to 1500.

410
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:16,376
And then you have to change gear.
300 revs.

411
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,576
Get in!

412
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,615
Get in!

413
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:26,976
And when you finally reach
18th gear, you get carved up
and you have to start all over again.

414
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:30,216
Now I've just been overtaken by
someone who has now slowed down.

415
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:32,095
Don't stop!

416
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:39,495
That's the car.
Why can't it just be...?

417
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:43,695
Somebody get a move on up there. If
I have to start from the beginning
of my gears again, I'll kill myself.

418
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,216
First, first and a half.

419
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:52,896
Just let the lorry go,
always let the lorry go.

420
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:59,215
Because this is a hard job and I'm
not just saying that to win favour
with lorry drivers, it's a hard job.

421
00:30:59,215 --> 00:31:00,815
Change gear, change gear,
change gear, check your mirrors,

422
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,335
murder a prostitute, change
gear, change gear, murder.

423
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,736
Still, because I'd removed some of
my stealth paint,

424
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:13,015
I could at least
see where it was going. Sort of.

425
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:16,616
What's that noise?

426
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:27,495
Jez is making a right hash of that.
You clipped a car.

427
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,175
Whose car?

428
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:31,136
Don't know but they will notice.

429
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:38,215
We then took a wrong turn
and ended up on a road where
they test vehicle suspension.

430
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:42,695
That wasn't such a problem
for me in my sprung cab.

431
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:44,415
But as for Hammond...

432
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:47,255
I'm worried I may be
bounced out of the cab.

433
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:51,536
Eventually, we arrived at the
start of the Alpine course,

434
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,775
which also meant our
first encounter with a hill.

435
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:00,055
Jeremy, you've only got two feet.

436
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:03,856
Every time I come off the brake
in order to get on to the throttle,

437
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:06,416
which you have to do,
it rolls backwards.

438
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,976
About eight inches.

439
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:14,216
Try using the handbrake like you
would in, oh, I don't know, a car.

440
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:23,776
The twists and turns of the
Alpine course were waiting for us

441
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,855
Get in gear! Come on. No, no.

442
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:43,296
Yes!

443
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:48,975
It's a drag race between
me and Captain Slow. Come on, Magnum.

444
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:53,536
Oh God. Plainly, in the heat
of battle, James and Jeremy

445
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:56,775
about their delicate cargoes.

446
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,736
Clarkson's got the inside line.

447
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:02,295
It's getting a bit narrow here. No.

448
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:09,536
Oh Lord. Yes! I've got Slow.

449
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:15,456
After my poor start, I too had
little concern for my precious load.

450
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:19,456
It sounds like a charging
rhino running up and down
the trailer behind me.

451
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:25,815
Back at the front, Slow
was refusing to give in.

452
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,095
That's close.

453
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:32,735
I'm going to take him here.
I've got a plan.

454
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:37,455
I can't turn in that.

455
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:39,495
You weren't ready for that, Slow!

456
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:44,335
Down a bit of a hill. Carry some...

457
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:45,935
Woah, woah!

458
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,936
That was...
I didn't want to do what I just did.

459
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,696
I'm in the lead!

460
00:33:58,696 --> 00:34:04,256
Unfortunately in all the excitement,
I forgot to change down for the steep
hill.

461
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:08,936
No!

462
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:11,336
No! It's dying on me. No! No! No!

463
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,736
You! It does understeer, this lorry.

464
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:26,176
Right, got to change ratios.

465
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,216
Next box, there you go.

466
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:31,535
Get a go in these things and
suddenly you start to feel just how
much power they have got to give.

467
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,456
Yeah! Snap gear changes.

468
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:51,136
Captain Clumsy had severed
my air lines and all the
brakes were jammed on.

469
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:56,656
I absolutely hope James May wakes
up in the morning and 10,000
insects are in his underpants.

470
00:34:58,615 --> 00:35:00,016
HE LAUGHS

471
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,855
In exactly just over three minutes,
I was the first to finish.

472
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:08,735
HE LAUGHS
Now let's have a look at my cake.

473
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:14,295
Ah...

474
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,295
That's what he hit.

475
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:22,376
He is the clumsiest man
in the known world.

476
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:25,375
I'll just straighten it up a bit.

477
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:33,456
Hammond, meanwhile, was just
crossing the finishing line.

478
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:38,775
I'll be honest, I think
the headlamps, tail-lamps,
because I heard a clunk at that end,

479
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:41,616
and then a clunk at that end and
then a lot more clunks

480
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:44,416
and then it stopped and got smoother
and smoother.

481
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,695
Headlights are going to be
smashed to bits. I daren't look.

482
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:50,216
Yes, I know, it's bad, I'm sorry.

483
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,495
It's worse than that.

484
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:56,256
I was now on the move again
and flying.

485
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,976
Now come on, up the hill.

486
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:02,016
Is that bad for my points?

487
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:03,616
Yeah.

488
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,376
More to the point, where is it?

489
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:07,656
I don't know.

490
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,416
Then Jeremy arrived.

491
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:12,855
Fire!

492
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,536
You're on fire!

493
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:18,456
Have we got the next challenge,
lads? How can we be this rubbish?

494
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:25,416
This is totally...
So, anyway, how was your car?

495
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,856
Car's interesting. Stolen.

496
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:31,256
That's what it is, I've just
thought of it now, stolen.

497
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:34,856
The damnedest thing.
That is actually quite bad now.

498
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:37,495
It is, that's on fire.

499
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,016
Yeah.

500
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:40,495
APPLAUSE

501
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:50,176
OK, we're going to put that out
and pick it up later on,

502
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:54,016
but now...now we've got to move on.

503
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:57,056
My guest tonight is from Yorkshire.

504
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,656
CHEERING

505
00:36:58,656 --> 00:37:03,735
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome our Star In The
Reasonably Priced - my arse,

506
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:08,095
it cost a fortune, that thing! -
Car, Sir Michael Parkinson.

507
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:15,015
How are you?

508
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:18,575
CHEERING
A legend has come among us.

509
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:20,215
Have a seat.

510
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:24,375
Have a seat.
APPLAUSE CONTINUES

511
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:31,456
I'm a bit nervous about this one.
I bet you are(!) When was the last
time you were nervous?

512
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:36,776
Well, the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the
interview world is setting
being interviewed by young Luke.

513
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:39,576
It's easier being interviewed,
let me tell you.

514
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:43,976
I don't know about that. You've
obviously never interviewed yourself.

515
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:48,175
It's the funniest thing, when I said
you were from Yorkshire there - did
you hear? -

516
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:49,855
everyone was like, "Wah-hay!"

517
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:54,415
Well, not everyone, but you don't get
that with Nottinghamshire?
Nor Leicestershire.

518
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:57,775
Our guest tonight
is from Leicestershire.
SOMEONE BOOS

519
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:02,216
Are you still proud
of being a Yorkshireman?
I love being a Yorkshireman.

520
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:04,896
Why do you live in Maidenhead?

521
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:09,295
The same reason you live
down here - because the BBC
isn't up in Yorkshire.

522
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:12,495
If the BBC was in Doncaster,
I might never have moved.

523
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:15,295
I think I might.
LAUGHTER

524
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:19,016
It's that sort of
whole Yorkshire thing.

525
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:22,615
We could do it for hours, "Oh, my
dad were poorer than your dad."

526
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:25,176
It's a Monty Python sketch.
It is, absolutely.

527
00:38:25,176 --> 00:38:29,935
"My dad, 14 years old,
left school, bronchitis, consumption,

528
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:33,376
"diphtheria, got a job as a butcher's
boy, worked 27 hour a day,

529
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:36,456
"and paid butcher for permission
to come to work," etc.

530
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:39,576
But your dad was the same,
from what I hear? He was a miner.

531
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:41,256
He loved being a Yorkshireman.

532
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:45,576
He was very proud of being
a Yorkshireman. And he said

533
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:48,455
I'd been doing
the talk show for about 10 years -

534
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:50,816
he said "You've had a good time,
eh, lad?"

535
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:53,815
I said, "I've had a wonderful time."
"Made a bob or two?"

536
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:59,336
I said, "I have." "And you've met
all them lovely birds and all that
stuff." I said, "I have."

537
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:04,855
He said, "Think on, though, good as
that might be, it's not like playing
for Yorkshire at cricket, is it?"

538
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:08,495
And of course, in his view, that
defined immortality, not fame.

539
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:11,816
Anybody who's appeared on
television is merely famous.

540
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:16,175
Those days, if you've played
for Yorkshire, wore the white rose,
you're immortal.

541
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:18,375
He walked, didn't he,
to go and see them?

542
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:22,095
No, his grandad...his father,
my grandad, walked to Leeds.

543
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:25,095
From Barnsley?
From Barnsley. Which is 30 miles.

544
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:29,576
It was, but he only left the village
once in his entire lifetime
to go to the seaside.

545
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:31,656
Now, my granny, when she died,

546
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:35,296
she'd never set foot outside
the borough of Doncaster.

547
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:41,016
By gum. I don't know. Never once.
My father was 66 or seven

548
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,615
before he went on an aeroplane.

549
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:49,176
And when I got a bit of money, we
decided we'd send him and my mother,

550
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:51,296
she'd never been away before,
on an aeroplane.

551
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:55,175
So we arrived at British Airways and
we were going to fly them off,
first class, look after him.

552
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:58,656
Right, when they came back two weeks
later I said, "What's the matter?"

553
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:00,736
She said, "Your father, it's silly.

554
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:02,735
"He just lets me down."

555
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,335
I said, "What's the story?
Calm down."

556
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,175
She said, "We got on the airplane,
as soon as we left, this nice

557
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:11,935
young man came along and said,
'Would you like a drink?' He said
'Yes, I'd like a pint of bitter.'"

558
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:15,176
First class? First class.

559
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,936
They said, "Sorry, we don't
serve bitter, Mr Parkinson, on
this airplane." "Don't serve bitter?

560
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:22,176
"What kind of plane is this?" The
man said, "But you don't understand.

561
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:25,455
"Champagne?"
"I can't afford champagne."

562
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:28,816
The man said, "No, you don't
understand, Mr Parkinson,
it's free." "Free?"

563
00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:30,775
says my old man, "Bring it on."

564
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:34,575
My mother said, "Do you know,"
she said, "he got so drunk

565
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:38,376
"that after his meal he offered
to wash up."

566
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,416
Seriously?

567
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,136
That's wonderful.

568
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:48,576
Now I know and respect you,
more actually than a chat
show, as a journalist.

569
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:52,455
That's where you began, on the local
newspapers in Mexborough, wasn't it?

570
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:56,695
Actually, I was a district man.
I covered a nest of pit villages

571
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,536
in Royston and Cuddeth
and all round there.

572
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:05,895
Do you think that sets you up,
being a hack, for being the
chat show legend that you became?

573
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:08,616
Everything I've ever done
has been informed by that

574
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:11,055
training that I did, by the
apprenticeship that I served.

575
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:14,976
When I look back of my life,
writing my autobiography
as I have been doing, I've been

576
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:18,375
amazed that there is a common thread
through it, and that's journalism.

577
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:23,855
It's my love of journalism,
it's the fascination I had for
the job and still have for the job.

578
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:28,015
Now the chat show now, obviously
this week, there's all sorts of

579
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,056
issues around chat shows,
but let's put it this way.

580
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:36,256
There are fewer chat shows
on the television now than
there were last week. This is true.

581
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:43,576
Do you think, leaving that aside,
that it's kind of had its day now?

582
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:45,735
No, I don't think it's had its day.

583
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:49,056
I think that the people
who run television decided

584
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:53,496
that the conversational kind of chat
show which we're having now, which
my show is based on, that's gone.

585
00:41:53,496 --> 00:41:56,775
I reckon they think
that's as dead as a dodo.

586
00:41:56,775 --> 00:42:02,415
And the only way it's going to
survive in their mind is by doing
the show that Jonathan does or...

587
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:05,215
Did.
LAUGHTER

588
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:10,816
It's a show based on comedy, with a
guy who's happy to play a major part

589
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:13,536
in it, which is the antithesis,
really, of doing an interview.

590
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:16,696
If you do an interview,
you the interviewer, subjugate
yourself to allow that other person

591
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:20,015
in front of you
to actually blossom if possible.

592
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:26,336
Don't you think that these days,
let's say when you left to show,
finished recording, if the guests

593
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:31,735
hadn't been very interesting,
it was kind of their fault and their
problem. I never took that view.

594
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:34,615
I always thought if it was
a bad interview it was my fault.

595
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:36,615
Really? Without a doubt.
So Meg Ryan...?

596
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:41,176
Meg Ryan was my fault.
No, Meg Ryan wasn't an interview,
it was a car crash, for God's sake!

597
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:46,416
And of course when that happened
with her, and God knows why she was
in that kind of mood, I don't know,

598
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:51,415
but the fact of the matter is, the
drama of it, the discomfort of it,
is what they love to see.

599
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,695
They love to see the host
getting it in the neck like that.

600
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,695
It's kill the quarterback time. You?

601
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:58,135
Yeah. But you don't think
it was your fault?

602
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:01,816
It wasn't my fault, no,
but I was responsible for it

603
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:04,696
and I could have handled it
differently.

604
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:07,296
Really? I think so.

605
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:10,695
When I said to her,
"You've been a journalist,
what should I do now?"

606
00:43:10,695 --> 00:43:12,696
She said, "Wrap it up." I didn't.

607
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:14,735
LAUGHTER

608
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:17,016
Because these days, people in
the public eye, you might

609
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:22,615
call them celebrities, they get
every aspect of their lives turned
over every day by Heat magazine and

610
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:27,215
the tabloid newspapers and so on
and they don't have much to give
and actually don't want to give.

611
00:43:27,215 --> 00:43:31,296
The only way you'll get
people half the time to come

612
00:43:31,296 --> 00:43:33,976
Which is, sorry to ask this,

613
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:38,055
but how did you deal with the you've
got to... Get rid of it up top.

614
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:41,175
Get rid of the plugging up top?
Get it in the intro.

615
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:47,095
I wondered when this might happen.
I'm trying to think of a... this.

616
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:50,216
What you do, you do an intro.

617
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:54,576
You do an intro? It's a bit
late now, I've done the intro.

618
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:57,455
Then wait for me to say,
"What is that you have there?"

619
00:43:57,455 --> 00:44:01,816
I'll tell you what it is, Michael,
it's your CD. Thank you.

620
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:05,576
What's it called, Jeremy?
It's called My Life In Music.

621
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:09,535
And what's it about?
Well, I tell you what...
LAUGHTER

622
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:14,136
You see, this is literally
the master I'm learning from here.

623
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:17,296
It's the music that was
on the show and on my radio show

624
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:21,735
and it's some of the people,
all the people we had on the show.

625
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:25,536
And it's also people we discovered -
Michael Buble and people like that.

626
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:27,616
It reflects my love of music,
the other thing

627
00:44:27,616 --> 00:44:31,496
you would know about Yorkshire
is the tradition of music there.

628
00:44:31,496 --> 00:44:34,376
There isn't one brass band on here.
There's a big band.

629
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:36,535
Can we just move it on
to cars, if you don't mind?

630
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:39,376
Was that OK? Very smooth segue.

631
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,575
I see you as a Jag man.

632
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:44,136
I've had a Jag or two.

633
00:44:44,136 --> 00:44:46,735
I've got a Merc at present.
Which one? S500.

634
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:51,496
That's worth about a tenner.
LAUGHTER

635
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:55,735
Why did you switch to the Merc?
I felt like it. They've got
more room in the back, too.

636
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,336
I've got a driver now. Oh, driver.

637
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:01,296
What would your dad say?
I don't like driving.

638
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:04,015
Do you not? No, it's boring,
For Christ's sake, it's awful.

639
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:07,495
It's really, really boring.

640
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:09,336
This is a man who likes cricket.

641
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:13,176
I like being driven to cricket.

642
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:18,575
Now, look, your lap,
you're here obviously to drive
a reasonably priced car.

643
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:22,296
Now then, how did we do?
Well, you're 73 years old now.

644
00:45:22,296 --> 00:45:25,856
Most people at your age are
watching Strictly Come Dancing.

645
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,896
LAUGHTER

646
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,255
Shall we have a look at the lap?
Play the tape.

647
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:41,375
Start scared and end up wanting
to be like the Stig, stay down here.

648
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:45,775
You're mumbling, that a man at
peace with himself, when he mumbles.

649
00:45:46,856 --> 00:45:50,736
A tidy line through there,
got to be honest. Very tidy.

650
00:45:54,456 --> 00:45:58,816
Can't see anything wrong with that.
Look at that. That's not bad at all.

651
00:45:58,816 --> 00:46:01,896
A big, curly bend.

652
00:46:01,896 --> 00:46:05,255
Curly bend?
This is the world-famous Hammerhead.

653
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:07,696
And you are doing it...

654
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:11,455
Well, about as perfectly
as I've ever... There you are.

655
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,296
Here we go, flat through here.

656
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:17,496
Oh, yeah. And across the skiddy bit.
I love these two bits.

657
00:46:17,496 --> 00:46:21,575
Whee! Close to the tyres,
he moved the tyres!

658
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:28,056
Look at that, you've got the second
to last corner worked out nicely.

659
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:32,056
We're in 16 by 9 as we go
across the line. And there we are.

660
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,655
CHEERING

661
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:46,816
More fun than Meg Ryan?
Much more, most fun I've ever
had on television. Really?

662
00:46:46,816 --> 00:46:52,096
Yeah. So here we are, here are the
people, all of whom you will have
met, I'm sure and interviewed. Yes.

663
00:46:52,096 --> 00:46:54,855
Where do you think
you might have come?

664
00:46:54,855 --> 00:47:00,536
Well, I think bottom half, I think
between Ray Winstone and Alan Carr.
No.

665
00:47:00,536 --> 00:47:02,896
No? Higher? Oh, yeah.

666
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:05,776
Did I beat Billie Piper?

667
00:47:05,776 --> 00:47:07,855
Did you beat Billie Piper?
And James Blunt?

668
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,696
No, I'll tell you what you did.

669
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,976
A...

670
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:18,295
1:49:4

671
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,295
and that means you are

672
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,496
there.

673
00:47:29,175 --> 00:47:32,775
Quicker than Ronnie Wood.
I've beaten your great hero,
Michael Gambon.

674
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:34,495
You never interviewed him, did you?

675
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:37,576
He wouldn't do it. He did it
for you. We've had him twice.

676
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:41,335
I know you have. Mind you,
I tell you what, in the absence of

677
00:47:41,335 --> 00:47:43,936
a chat show on BBC One
for the forthcoming few weeks,

678
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:46,455
you should see our guest list
for the rest of the year!

679
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:49,256
Michael, it's been an absolute joy.

680
00:47:49,256 --> 00:47:52,896
I'm nervous as hell all the way
through but you've been a superstar.

681
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:55,495
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sir Michael Parkinson.

682
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:57,816
CHEERING

683
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:08,296
Now, earlier, the three of us
had used

684
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:13,776
our extensive knowledge of lorrying
to buy HGVs and it wasn't going well.

685
00:48:13,776 --> 00:48:19,496
especially for Jeremy,
who'd ended up with a gear lever in
his bottom and his truck on fire.

686
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,656
Still, we rejoin the action
after we'd addressed those issues.

687
00:48:24,256 --> 00:48:27,335
My lorry was in a pretty poor state.

688
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:32,095
Despite this, the producers threw us
straight into the next challenge.

689
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:35,335
"Since you've now had
some practice at lorrying,

690
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:37,615
and you are coming on well..."

691
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,336
I think we are. I'm not.

692
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:44,055
"We shall now see
whose lorry is the fastest.

693
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:47,056
"To do this, you will have
to take the limiters off."

694
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:50,856
I was going to say, they're
all limited to 56, aren't they?

695
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:55,216
Half an hour later,
the limiters had been deactivated.

696
00:48:55,216 --> 00:49:00,496
I'm going to drive this ruined,
ancient, burned lorry around here

697
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:04,695
faster than Her Majesty's
government deem to be safe.

698
00:49:06,016 --> 00:49:11,496
The venue for this hairbrain test
was the fearsome two-mile bowl.

699
00:49:11,496 --> 00:49:16,455
But Hammond, in his Caterer
was relishing the challenge.

700
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:19,255
This is my sports trucks territory!

701
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:25,015
However, my lightened convertible
Magnum wasn't hanging around either.

702
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:31,936
My 12-litre Magnum
has splashed the 9-litre Scalia
and splashed it enormously!

703
00:49:33,815 --> 00:49:36,535
I'm doing 60. Eat my Magnum!

704
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:37,656
Yeah!

705
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:41,816
Things were less exciting
in James's world.

706
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:44,496
59 1/2 miles an hour.

707
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:48,695
'I was staggered by
the speed of my Magnum!'

708
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:52,456
I'm going 70 miles an hour
in a lorry!

709
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:56,295
But then, Hammond found another gear.

710
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:58,735
Ha!

711
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:01,496
I'm on the way to 75 now.

712
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:04,935
So my lorry is, what's the word?

713
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,935
It's faster, your GTI lorry is quick.

714
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:16,855
We continue to pound round until
eventually we hit our top speeds.

715
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,695
80 miles an hour!

716
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:21,416
64.6.

717
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,095
Hammond, though, was touching 90.

718
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:25,696
Yeah, thank you!

719
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:30,335
But then we received instructions
that we had to stop.

720
00:50:31,656 --> 00:50:36,736
Oh, cock! The cameramen
retreated to a safe distance.

721
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:43,575
Brake too gently you won't pull up,
brake too hard, you'll lock up

722
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:46,895
the trailer's rear wheels,
you'll jack-knife and roll.

723
00:50:46,895 --> 00:50:49,576
Well, I'd rather not
do either of those.

724
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:55,696
In fact, James discovered
there is a terrifying
third way of stopping a big lorry.

725
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:05,295
Was it really that frightening?

726
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,295
Yes. We've got another challenge.

727
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:12,735
I'm not interested. No, you will be.

728
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:15,616
It says, "You now have
to do a hill start.

729
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:18,295
"This is a test of driving
precision."

730
00:51:18,295 --> 00:51:24,375
It is, James, you've got to balance
your handbrake, you clutch, your
throttle. You love all that stuff.

731
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,415
Yeah, precision.

732
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:30,575
And it says "The winner will
receive a year's supply of
gentlemen's literature."

733
00:51:32,896 --> 00:51:35,856
FLUSHING

734
00:51:36,736 --> 00:51:39,056
We're back. We're back as a team.

735
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:44,856
The literature in question
was all very exciting,
but the hill start was even better.

736
00:51:44,856 --> 00:51:49,015
Our trucks would be placed on a
slope and then, to focus our minds,

737
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:52,056
items close to our hearts
would be placed behind them.

738
00:51:52,056 --> 00:51:55,896
In Jeremy's case,
we went for his beloved drum-kit.

739
00:51:55,896 --> 00:52:00,175
Are you scared? On the drums,
Jeremy Clarkson's lorry.

740
00:52:00,175 --> 00:52:01,975
Very much on the drums.

741
00:52:01,975 --> 00:52:04,096
I'm very fond of my drum-kit.
Drum roll...

742
00:52:04,096 --> 00:52:05,736
Backwards down the hill!

743
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:07,975
Shut up.

744
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,215
Mirror. I think he's
taking it very seriously.

745
00:52:10,215 --> 00:52:13,095
Come on. Get on with it, Clarkson!

746
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:20,376
'The fate of my drum-kit rested
on me being strong enough to
engage the Renault's crawler gear.'

747
00:52:20,376 --> 00:52:23,015
This is it. The moment.

748
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:27,055
Aw... Aw...

749
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:32,775
The one thing the Renault Magnum
can do is a hill-start.

750
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,375
Now, we're not petty, but...

751
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:43,775
He just clipped it on the way back.

752
00:52:43,775 --> 00:52:47,375
Mate, so close.
I know, you must have...

753
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,176
It never moved an inch.

754
00:52:49,176 --> 00:52:51,576
You've smashed my drum-kit up.

755
00:52:51,576 --> 00:52:53,695
You've smashed my drum-kit up!

756
00:52:56,455 --> 00:53:04,176
'Never mind, Hammond was next and
I would strike down upon him with
great vengeance and furious anger.'

757
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:06,216
I think he's going to
be quite cross with us.

758
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:10,776
Have you seen what he's
done to the number plate?

759
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:13,935
Oh, for God's sake.
Personal plates. He is such a pikey.

760
00:53:13,935 --> 00:53:17,616
No! Well, it was your dog or that.

761
00:53:17,616 --> 00:53:21,015
Evil BLEEP!

762
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:24,935
My lorry didn't have a crawler gear.

763
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,816
Ooh! Ah...!

764
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:35,056
Do you want to use it as a chock?

765
00:53:35,056 --> 00:53:37,015
No! I can't do it!

766
00:53:37,015 --> 00:53:38,536
Do you want to give in?

767
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:40,775
Yes. OK, he's giving in.

768
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:43,255
May, it's your turn.

769
00:53:43,255 --> 00:53:47,335
Thanks to James's extended lavatory
break, it was now getting dark.

770
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:50,016
But there was no
way we were going to stop.

771
00:53:50,016 --> 00:53:55,295
We've been round to James's house and
we've relieved him of his prized
grand piano. Are you joking?

772
00:53:55,295 --> 00:54:00,415
No. Sadly though, even before the
test began, there was an issue.

773
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:08,976
Don't film that. Just don't film.
Let's film something over here.

774
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:12,416
What's more, our repair
job wasn't brilliant.

775
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:19,776
When he finds that his precious
piano is propped up by a mountain of
pornography, he is going to go ape.

776
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:22,176
OK, May, let it rock.

777
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:29,296
He'll be very good at this.
He likes this sort of thing.
See look, feeling the power.

778
00:54:29,296 --> 00:54:31,015
Jeremy...

779
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:40,936
Run. Yes, run away.

780
00:54:40,936 --> 00:54:44,176
Keep the porn! You can have that.

781
00:54:44,176 --> 00:54:47,575
'We hoped that would be that,
but no.'

782
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:54,336
The producers said we had to meet up
at the Top Gear test track the next
day for one final challenge.

783
00:54:56,335 --> 00:55:01,855
It says, "This is a test of speed,
braking and toughness all and one.

784
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:08,176
"You must accelerate to 56 miles an
hour, drive through an obstacle and
then stop as quickly as possible.

785
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:14,575
"Whoever does that in the
shortest distance will win
a year's supply of pies."

786
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:17,335
What do they mean by obstacle?

787
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:20,376
Doesn't say.

788
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:23,855
What sort of pies?

789
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:28,856
We really did have no idea
what sort of obstacles
we'd be driving through.

790
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:32,135
But we could see the windscreens
were being heavily fortified

791
00:55:32,135 --> 00:55:35,376
with mesh,
so it probably wouldn't be balloons.

792
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:42,536
And so, with a sense of trepidation,
I lined up on the start line
and set off.

793
00:55:45,536 --> 00:55:49,936
30, 35, come on.

794
00:55:49,936 --> 00:55:54,415
I bet Hammond's pissing himself,
but think of his book's sales.
They're massive.

795
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:58,896
Come on, build, build, build.
He hasn't got long to write it.

796
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:04,096
Here we go. This might hurt.

797
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:34,216
My truck had taken a wallop,
but the distance covered
was extremely short.

798
00:56:34,216 --> 00:56:36,656
This annoyed my colleagues.

799
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,975
I don't think that's fair. What?

800
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:43,735
Well, he had a huge structure
that will have slowed him down,

801
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:46,856
so therefore his stopping
difference will have been less.

802
00:56:46,856 --> 00:56:51,616
So if my obstacle is very solid,
I'll just stop. And you'll win.
You'll be killed, but you'll win.

803
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:56,135
It hardly slowed me.
Rubbish! No, I needed...

804
00:56:56,135 --> 00:57:00,176
Rubbish, you were barely moving
coming out of the other side of that.

805
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:05,095
Hoping for a more solid impact
than Hammond's, I began to roll.

806
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:08,295
Oh, my Lord. I'm glad I'm not
in his lorry now.

807
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:09,616
Here it comes.

808
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:20,335
Bracing, bracing.

809
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:37,375
After the crash,
my friends were deeply concerned.

810
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:40,616
He's woken up stuck in a
lorry cab with five firemen.

811
00:57:44,176 --> 00:57:47,336
Sadly, my lorry had travelled 40
yards further than the airfield,

812
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:51,616
even though I'd taken out
600 office water coolers.

813
00:57:51,616 --> 00:57:56,215
If you were going to have a meeting
in an office somewhere, I'm sorry,
I've just spoiled it for you.

814
00:57:56,215 --> 00:57:57,856
Here we go.

815
00:57:57,856 --> 00:58:01,415
So now, only the mighty
Magnum could beat Hammond.

816
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:03,415
This isn't fair.

817
00:58:03,415 --> 00:58:06,496
That'll slow him much
better than my stupid building.

818
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:16,536
Have we had lunch?

819
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:21,015
Hard down...

820
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:22,575
Here we go!

821
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:38,895
Ah!

822
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:40,576
Ah!

823
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,255
Ah!

824
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:48,056
'The impact was a bit nasty,
but before seeking medical attention,
there was some arguing to be done.'

825
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:52,736
You may have beaten me there, and
if you did that's just because you
had a better obstacle than I had.

826
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:56,095
Rubbish! You had a brick wall, I had
wooden walls. Measure it. Let's
measure it.

827
00:58:56,095 --> 00:58:58,735
I tell you, I promise you...

828
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,615
Ow, this actually really hurts.

829
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:10,935
See, how many lorries are trashed
on that Strictly Come Dancing
thing? None.

830
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:17,815
Now, we should explain, the impact
that I had there was pretty severe.

831
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:23,176
My ankle burst where the
clutch pedal went through it,
my head was dislodged from my spine.

832
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:26,775
And really, we've ended
up with a Top Gear top tip.

833
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:30,376
If you are a lorryist and you're
going to have an accident

834
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:34,336
and there's a choice of something
to hit, avoid anything with bricks
in it.

835
00:59:34,336 --> 00:59:38,456
Always swerve and go for the
big pile of mineral water.
Yes, that's a safer bet.

836
00:59:38,456 --> 00:59:40,416
Anyway, we have done a scoreboard.

837
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:44,376
It's hopeless to be honest
and massively complicated,

838
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,576
but the upshot of it is this...

839
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:49,615
I got 60 points.

840
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:54,695
Hammond, you got minus 25.

841
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:57,056
And Jeremy, you got...

842
00:59:57,056 --> 01:00:02,976
A gear lever in his bottom. A gear
lever in his bottom and minus 3,560.

843
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:10,135
Why did I get that? You just did.

844
01:00:10,135 --> 01:00:11,856
Whatever. We have proved...

845
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:13,815
we have proved

846
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:19,336
that the Scania P94D
is the best truck in Britain today.

847
01:00:19,336 --> 01:00:23,856
And next week we have more lorries
on, in fact, because we've been to
America to test some muscle cars.

848
01:00:23,856 --> 01:00:26,375
So we'll see you then,
unless of course

849
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:30,056
you're all watching the sequinned
has-beens on the other side.

850
01:00:30,056 --> 01:00:31,456
Take care, good night.

851
01:00:37,936 --> 01:00:41,016
