1
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,750
Tonight - we have
a race to Blackpool.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,271
The new Lamborghini
comes to our studio.

3
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,937
And at last, the Bugatti Veyron
is on our track.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,217
Thank you, thank you. Hello!

5
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:32,537
Hello and welcome.

6
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:37,817
Now, every week,
either Richard or I

7
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:41,616
drive a preposterously fast car
around our track,

8
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:44,936
but when it came to making this
week's film, there was a problem.

9
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:47,217
Neither of us was available.

10
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:49,336
I'd hurt my neck in the lorry crash

11
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,217
and Richard was busy
selling fish at Morrisons.

12
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,816
God help us.

13
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:11,456
When I arrived,
the track was enveloped
in typical British autumnalness.

14
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:16,217
Right, here we go. Top Gear
test track. My patch for the day.

15
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:21,216
I've been very insistent
with the office - I don't want
to find some look-at-me,

16
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,056
two-door, Italian supercar

17
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:30,256
with a 250mph speedo and a £250,000
price tag or any of that rubbish.

18
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:34,817
I want to drive something
more like, to be honest, some...

19
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:35,256
Some...

20
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:37,776
Oh, cock.

21
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:40,497
Surely not.

22
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:47,657
Well, since the choice
is testing this or the Panda,
I suppose it had better be this,

23
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,817
which is a Pagani Zonda.

24
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,536
And not just any old Zonda.

25
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,056
That is the Zonda F Roadster.

26
00:01:56,536 --> 00:02:03,896
And in the already insane world
of Pagani, this one
has its own special padded cell.

27
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:11,456
Regular car - 555 horsepower.
This one - 650. Let's try it out.

28
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:22,856
This may be my first Zonda,
but it happens to be
the fastest one we've ever tested.

29
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:25,337
The acceleration is so brutal!

30
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:33,817
I think my eyes have moved round
the side of my head like a pigeon.

31
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,577
'I think I know what to do
at this point.' Power-r-r-r!

32
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:50,257
This car is made entirely
out of improbable numbers.

33
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:58,256
0 to 60 - 3.6 seconds.
0 to 120 - under 10 seconds.

34
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:02,696
And then, when you hit
the carbon ceramic brakes...

35
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:10,096
..125mph to 0 in 4.4 seconds.

36
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:19,937
And my eyeballs
are back in the correct position
on the front of my face.

37
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:27,217
There is, though, one other number
that dwarfs all of these,
and it's the price.

38
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:28,056
It's £825,000.

39
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:36,777
Top Gear, bringing you
credit crunch news on the hour.

40
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:46,376
But we haven't just brought
this along to show you
some high-priced hyper-porn.

41
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:50,537
You see, the F Roadster is
the swansong for the current Zonda.

42
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:58,096
Next year, there'll be
a brand-new one, but the original
will always be a bit special to us.

43
00:03:58,457 --> 00:04:01,657
You know when we brought Top Gear
back to the telly in 2002,

44
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,576
the Zonda was the car we featured
in the very first show,

45
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:09,056
and we liked it, but there was
always that nagging feeling that,

46
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:13,617
"Here come another bunch
of hopeless optimists who think
they know better than Ferrari.

47
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:16,096
"Give them a year and they'll be
down the dole office."

48
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,857
But it hasn't happened.

49
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:24,056
Pagani is still very much here still
today, getting up Ferrari's nose.

50
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:29,696
Richard Hammond, who is 12,
thinks it's because Pagani
has captured that "mental market" -

51
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:34,376
the small boy's bedroom wall poster
that used to be a Lamborghini.

52
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:41,056
It's got ridiculous bodywork and
ray guns and switches from the lunar-
module. And I think he's right.

53
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:43,337
But there is something else.

54
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:48,456
It's actually a very, very good car.

55
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:54,456
See, the entire shell is
made out of naked carbon fibre...

56
00:04:55,216 --> 00:05:00,056
..which makes you look
a bit of an idiot, frankly,
but it does mean it's very strong.

57
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:04,736
So strong that even when
they've taken the roof off,
it remains perfectly rigid.

58
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:09,016
In fact,
the construction's so clever
that it hasn't gained any weight

59
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,176
in becoming a convertible,
and that's a rare thing.

60
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:16,777
The Pagani engineers
do know what they're doing.

61
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:25,256
Which means we've come to that point-
in the film where I have to go
fast round a corner to prove it.

62
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,576
Turn it in...

63
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:27,856
TYRES SCREECH

64
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:36,017
Can we cut that bit out?

65
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:39,697
With a bit of practice, though,
I did get the hang of it.

66
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,857
Dab of brakes, turn in...

67
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:44,816
You see?

68
00:05:52,336 --> 00:06:00,296
And I'm told... I mean,
I can report, that the F Roadster
is pretty agile through the corners.

69
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:03,737
The office say they have another car-
for me to try on the track,

70
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:08,257
but that I shouldn't worry
because it's only a VW.

71
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:09,217
Funny(!)

72
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:20,216
The Bugatti Veyron,
finally on our track,

73
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:23,936
and I'm gonna put it
straight to work.

74
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:30,137
I believe the done thing
at this point is to have a drag race,

75
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:31,457
so if nobody objects, we'll have one.

76
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:31,937
With these two.

77
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,737
Since I'd got my eye in
with the Zonda, I took that.

78
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:40,017
The Veyron would be in the hands of
the Stig, who wasn't here earlier.

79
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:44,337
On paper, this looks like a bit of
a one-horse race, because the Veyron

80
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:49,936
is a full second quicker than this
car to 60. 2.5 seconds, 3.5 seconds.

81
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:54,457
But you never know,
he might mess up the start.

82
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:57,416
He didn't.

83
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:58,136
Crikey!

84
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:08,536
Despite weighing over half a ton
more, the Veyron mullered the Zonda.

85
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:13,417
That is the power of power.

86
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:19,337
Now, I should really
take that Veyron off Stiggy
and drive it around a few corners,

87
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:22,737
but unfortunately, that would get
in the way of what you, me

88
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,496
and everybody else in the world
really wants to see,

89
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,577
which is him taking it for a lap.

90
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:29,537
Oh, yes.

91
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,696
Well done, you.

92
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,497
I wasn't kidding.
I do actually mean it.

93
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:43,736
Later on in the show,
after a wait of two years... Yeah.

94
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:49,376
the most powerful car in the world
goes round our track.

95
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,217
It is gonna be quite a moment.
It's gonna be up here somewhere.

96
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:56,057
But we've already had
quite a moment -
you, for the first time, out there.

97
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,697
How was it? Smooth as silk.

98
00:07:59,296 --> 00:07:59,576
LAUGHTER

99
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:05,216
It's a piece of cake.
Who here would like to see
some of the out-takes of James...?

100
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:06,977
AUDIENCE: Yes!
You would?

101
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:09,857
Let's play the tape somewhere.

102
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:14,623
Oh dear,
that Chicago has gone wrong.

103
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:17,102
Here we go again, gone wrong.

104
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:21,422
And here we go again -
it's gone wrong.

105
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:21,862
APPLAUSE

106
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,103
Thank you.

107
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,543
He is useless. Useless. What?!

108
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:32,702
The problem is... Mm?
..it's my hair.

109
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:36,542
No, it is. When you go through
a corner, it blows in my face.

110
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:40,943
Yeah. But as soon as I put
that helmet on,
everything was absolutely fine.

111
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:41,263
LAUGHTER

112
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:46,903
I think it was that you stepped
out of the Panda, into the Zonda,

113
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:52,743
which is like weaning a baby off
breast milk and straight onto port.

114
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:55,942
I can't believe
he got to drive that.

115
00:08:56,863 --> 00:09:01,622
It is my all-time favourite
supercar - it's that mixture of
sheer lunacy and engineering.

116
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,263
You could've driven it.

117
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:07,423
You were given the choice -
drive the Zonda or sell fish
for a Northern supermarket.

118
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:12,223
You chose the fish.
You can't seriously prefer
the Zonda to the Bugatti.

119
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:18,062
I do, because the Zonda's got
some pantomime to it. The Bugatti's-
like sitting in a physics lesson.

120
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,302
Were you watching
that drag race? Yes.

121
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:25,343
Did you see what the physics lesson-
did to your pantomime dame? Yes.

122
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:31,303
It annihilated it.
But if we could just listen -
what's that I'm not hearing?

123
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:33,102
Anyone not hearing that?

124
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:37,262
Anybody else not hearing
the Zonda being taken round
the track by the Stig?

125
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:41,223
I wonder if it's got anything to do-
with what happened when it arrived?

126
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:42,502
Here we go.

127
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:44,743
First corner,
the very first corner,

128
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,623
and what's that
coming out of the back?

129
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,622
It looks a bit like smoke.

130
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:52,263
Smoke! Yes, see?
It's a proper supercar.

131
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,743
It didn't just go round
like a robot and be boring.

132
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:57,623
It came to the track
and exploded immediately.

133
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:00,343
That's what supercars do.
It's proper!

134
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:03,902
Even as we speak,
several stylish Italian mechanics

135
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:08,063
are looking at the engine
in the Zonda, hoping they can
coax some life into it,

136
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:13,343
and maybe, just maybe, later on,
we'll be able to bring you
a lap of that as well.

137
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:16,423
And then we'll see.
Zonda versus Bugatti.

138
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,183
Then we'll sort it out.

139
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:24,782
Right, we've always thought there's-
absolutely no reason for anyone
to own a Peugeot. Hang on.

140
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:25,222
See?

141
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:26,903
Mmm...

142
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,222
No, anyone here got a Peugeot?

143
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:31,182
AUDIENCE RESPOND

144
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:32,222
Why?

145
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:34,983
Who said "yes"?

146
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,183
Why have you got a Peugeot?

147
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:39,942
It was given to me.
It was given to you.

148
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:40,383
LAUGHTER

149
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:42,783
Damn, that's a reason!

150
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,782
What sort of Peugeot is it?

151
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,583
306. 306...
HE MOUTHS

152
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:49,183
Lovely!

153
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,743
No, really, apart from being given
one, I can't think of a reason.

154
00:10:56,103 --> 00:11:01,462
Peugeot have decided to address
this, and they think they have
with this. It's the Partner Teepee.

155
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:02,863
LAUGHTER
No, ah...!

156
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,983
Bear with me. Here's the reason.

157
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:10,783
They've fitted it with a roof box
that goes inside, over the seats,

158
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:15,783
and they say it's ideal
for storing long thin things in,
like a surfboard.

159
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:17,423
So, what they're saying is,

160
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:23,423
if you are a surfer
who wants a car with a loft
you can keep your surfboard in...

161
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:27,463
Are there any surfers here?
Yes? Who's a surfer?

162
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,583
Do you like to keep it dry?

163
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:35,103
How many surfers are there...
"I don't like
getting my surfboard wet".

164
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:37,222
It's just...
It's not going well, is it.

165
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,982
No. Still no reason to own one.

166
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:43,543
But, Peugeot fans, this has a big
brother called the Expert Teepee.

167
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,622
There it is.

168
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:47,222
Mmmm! No, no, no, no. Listen.

169
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:51,783
They say that this is designed
for the three-children family,

170
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:57,023
where one child plays a drum kit,
one plays a tuba
and one plays the double bass.

171
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:59,263
They're not THAT specific
about it... They are.

172
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,743
What sort of band are those kids in?

173
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:09,902
The National Youth Salvation Army
Dixieland Jazz Band Orchestra
of Great Britain, or something!

174
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:13,503
Though it's why is it called
a Teepee that fascinates me.

175
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:18,743
The Americans are going to steal it-
and let you build a casino
where it used to be.

176
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:21,143
How much is it? Oh, I don't care.

177
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:25,422
If your sister gives you
one of those, just say no!

178
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:30,062
You know Boris Johnson,
Mayor of London?

179
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:34,102
I was driving behind a bus
this week, and I took a photo of
the message he's put on it.

180
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:36,623
This is from the Mayor of London.

181
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,063
It says, "Amazing!
Changing gears at lower revs

182
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:42,342
"reduces your CO2 emissions
and saves you money".

183
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:49,022
I was then reading GQ magazine,
a road test of a Ferrari 430,
and it says,

184
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:55,343
"The essence of it, in my view,
is not to change up
until you hit about 6,000 revs".

185
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:59,063
This was written by somebody
called Boris Johnson.

186
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:02,143
Jeremy. Yeah. The slippers.

187
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:05,623
Yep. Are they a bet?
Of course they're a bet.

188
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,263
Thank God for that.

189
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:10,742
Big news! Is it the Dacia Sandero?

190
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:12,383
No...

191
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:17,742
It's the European
Car of the Year 2008 is...

192
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,263
the replacement
for the Vauxhall Vectra.

193
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:22,983
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Vauxhall Insignia.

194
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:27,263
You had to look that up then. I did.
You forgot what it was called!

195
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:31,823
The weird thing is, the three
of us were being driven around
in one of these last week

196
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:34,903
and we didn't actually notice
what it was.

197
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:38,462
Seriously, I was in that, back
and forth to a show we were doing,

198
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:40,982
for three days,
and I thought it was a Renault.

199
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:44,983
I can remember one thing
about it - it had very hard seats.

200
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:46,702
Yes, it did. Ah!

201
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:53,542
You can't criticise those,
because a German panel
of seat experts... A what?

202
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:57,943
There's a German panel...? There's
a German panel of seat experts.

203
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,782
And I've invited them all
to your house for Christmas! Oh!

204
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:04,583
Where would you put them?!
"Have a seat... No, stand up".

205
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:11,303
They have voted to give it their
coveted accolade for the quality
of the seats. That's rubbish.

206
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:15,463
It's like people that say
you've got to eat natural yoghurt
because it's good for you.

207
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:19,423
You get those people who say,
"I like a hard bed,
it's good for your spine". It isn't.

208
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,622
I hate hard beds.
I do like a hard bed.

209
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:29,223
Sorry, Richard. Can anyone think
of one thing in the world
which is better hard than soft?

210
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:31,462
LAUGHTER
That's quite awkward, actually.

211
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:34,183
What? Ice.

212
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:35,623
Ice.
LAUGHTER

213
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,222
Ice?
APPLAUSE

214
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,342
He got us out of it.

215
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:50,942
Thanks for getting us out of that
one, mate. Can we move on, please?

216
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:55,423
Earlier on, we three
were invited to switch on
Blackpool's famous Christmas lights.

217
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,742
It's quite a big deal.

218
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:01,142
Look at the pantheon of greats
who have had the call in the past.

219
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:05,703
Frank Bough, Ken Dodd, Danny La Rue,
Cannon and Ball, and now us.

220
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,143
Problem is, it only takes
one person to flick a light switch.

221
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:14,542
So, to decide which one of us
would do that, the producers
organised a race to Blackpool.

222
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:18,103
First one there would get
their name in the history books.

223
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:22,503
Unfortunately, they decided that
the starting point for this race

224
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:26,702
would be in Basel,
which is here in Switzerland.

225
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:30,742
And that is 750 miles
from the light switch.

226
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,902
And here's the tricky bit.

227
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:36,423
They said we could only use
one tank of fuel.

228
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:40,743
We could fill our cars in Basel,
but then the tanks would be sealed.

229
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:46,262
I thought it was a stupid idea.
750 miles on a tank?

230
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,103
That's 750 miles
of careful driving.

231
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,703
That's not a race.
It's my idea of hell.

232
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,063
It's actually my idea of heaven.

233
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:58,623
Anyway, we could use
any production car we liked,

234
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:03,142
and we weren't allowed
to modify it in any way.

235
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:13,583
Our meeting place was in the centre
of Basel, the night before the off.

236
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:18,702
This is the car I'd chosen -
a Subaru Legacy diesel.

237
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:26,143
Yes, it's a big four-wheel-drive
estate, but it has a large fuel tank
which gives good range.

238
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:29,343
And this is the car Jeremy
had chosen, because he's an idiot.

239
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,103
An enormous twin-turbo
Jaguar XJ6 TDVi.

240
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:39,302
0 to 60 - 7.8 seconds.
Top speed - 141.

241
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:42,383
You're not trying to get to 60.
You're trying to get to Blackpool.

242
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:43,703
There's no point.

243
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:46,142
Why? I've been explaining this
to you for weeks.

244
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:49,262
We're not gonna be able to do it.
If you're gonna fail,

245
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,383
you may as well fail
in style and comfort.

246
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,943
'Whereas James would fail
in a sea of noise.'

247
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,262
It's a boxer engine.

248
00:16:56,663 --> 00:17:00,182
Yes. It's the worst diesel engine
I've ever come across.
It has no talk.

249
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:04,502
To rev the nuts off it in first,
then when you go into second...

250
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:11,302
It's... I'd rather go to Blackpool
in one of those horrible
eco Volkswagen BlueMotion things.

251
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:14,543
That hideous little Polo?
Yes, the three-cylinder.

252
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:18,143
Richard then arrived
in a Polo BlueMotion.

253
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:22,062
What are you thinking of, man?
Miles per gallon?

254
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:22,503
35?

255
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,502
50. Gonna ask me?

256
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:31,103
How many miles per gallon...?
You see, this is a VW Polo...
We know what it is!

257
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:36,343
It's one of the most economical
cars money can buy.
74 miles per gallon.

258
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:41,023
It's an ordinary car underneath,
but they've made it
extra aerodynamic.

259
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:44,503
Tiny door mirrors
so it cuts through the air
with barely a ripple.

260
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:49,503
And a little, tiny boot spoiler.
It's a very exciting car.

261
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,503
Three-cylinder,
1.4-litre diesel engine.

262
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,543
There it is! Look at that.
Yeah, it's under...

263
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:59,622
Thanks(!) I've just saved you
a little bit of weight. Wow!

264
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,103
If it's an eco car,
why have they put that on it?

265
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:05,183
So that when you open your bonnet,
when your mates are around,

266
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:08,663
they don't realise that you've got
a PATHETIC three-cylinder...!

267
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,663
Yeah, yeah... Can I ask...?
There's one other question.

268
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,862
You don't need that...
There's one other question.

269
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,343
It kept cropping up
when I was choosing my car.

270
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,703
How big is the fuel tank in this?

271
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:22,463
Ten gallons. Ten gallons.
And it's...

272
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:26,543
74... ..74 miles to the gallon -
740-mile range. Yes.

273
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,902
How far's Blackpool?
About... 750 miles, I think.

274
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,542
So, there you go.

275
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,543
Well, hang on a second.
What can you expect?

276
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,782
Well, theoretical range, 706 miles.

277
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,542
Not far enough. No.

278
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:41,262
Jeremy... 655.
I've told you - it's pointless.

279
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:44,822
It's a pointless challenge.
On paper...

280
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:48,423
Nevertheless, in the very early
hours of the following morning,

281
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:53,183
we assembled at a Swiss
filling station to brim our tanks
and make some final checks.

282
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:56,783
Richard made sure
his tyre pressures were correct,

283
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:02,623
because if they were even slightly
down, it could cost him 20 miles.

284
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:05,263
And I taped up my cracks.

285
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:08,822
This might only be worth 200 yards,

286
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:13,262
but the last bit of the journey
is 200 yards long.

287
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:16,823
Jeremy, meanwhile, confident
of failure, was having breakfast.

288
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,983
Those two are taking it
so seriously.

289
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:27,462
One of the most important factors
in economy runs is lightness,

290
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:31,262
which is why Jeremy and I
had packed James's luggage.

291
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:34,463
Yeah, that's a paperweight,
just in case.

292
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:36,262
You're really funny men(!)

293
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:41,742
But what if you need one of these?
What if you need a wishbone?

294
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:48,103
If you run out of fuel and then
a lorry driver needs a gearbox,
you could give him one.

295
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:52,263
It's transaxle...
You're spoiling an otherwise
very interesting experiment.

296
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:56,702
Name one thing that's gonna happen
today that is interesting.

297
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:02,183
We're about to do the impossible,
and that feels good. Top Gear's
always succeeding. Yeah! No.

298
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:08,142
With the tanks brimmed,
the filler caps were sealed
with impenetrable gaffer tape,

299
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:13,063
and then at exactly 11 minutes
past 4, we were ready for the off.

300
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:18,943
This is it. I'm not gonna start
the car until the last minute.

301
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:30,303
That has to be the dullest start
to any Top Gear race, ever...

302
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:32,822
In fact, any race in history.

303
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:37,102
I don't know if you were looking
forward to Top Gear tonight,

304
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,982
but, you know, there'll be
something else on somewhere.

305
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:44,902
In fact,
there was only one man in Europe

306
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:48,223
looking forward
to 17 hours of mental arithmetic.

307
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:54,222
60 miles per gallon, my average so
far over 5.1 miles has gone up to 50.

308
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:56,462
Clarkson needs to average 44.7...

309
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:00,503
But before you switch over
to Heartbeat, consider this.

310
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:06,342
This is a very clever race,
because there's that balance
between getting there,

311
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,023
so that means efficient driving,

312
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:11,222
and speed, because
there's no point getting there

313
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:15,902
when James has already said,
"I declare these lights on".

314
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:20,543
Weirdly, we'd all chosen
different ways

315
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,503
of getting from Basel
to the Channel.

316
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,783
Richard had opted
for the shortest route,

317
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,062
through towns, villages,

318
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:30,183
and worst of all,
the Vosges mountains.

319
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,303
But this didn't seem
to worry him.

320
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:36,623
If there's the odd hill, it doesn't-
matter, cos you've got to go up,

321
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,103
but then you've got to
come down again.

322
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:43,862
It'll average out as downhill.

323
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,463
My route, past Strasbourg and Metz,

324
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:49,702
was 30 miles further
than Hammond's,

325
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,622
but there's fewer hills

326
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,382
and, hopefully,
less traffic.

327
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:56,622
Thinking ahead is what it's about.

328
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,342
Planning so that
I don't brake unnecessarily.

329
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:03,022
Because what is not understood
is that braking
effectively wastes fuel.

330
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:07,543
It turns the kinetic energy
of the car into heat...

331
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:10,303
As James did science,

332
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,423
Jeremy was heading
in the wrong direction.

333
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:15,503
He'd elected to stick
to the motorways,

334
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:19,103
which meant his route
was 836 miles -

335
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:22,062
almost 200 more
than the Jag could do.

336
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:27,223
And that means I'll run out
more quickly, and then
I'll just check into a little pub,

337
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:29,222
have a juicy steak and go to sleep.

338
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:34,502
You may have noticed there
that I was wearing
a high-visibility jacket.

339
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:37,582
The French recently,
and very quietly, introduced a law

340
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:41,143
saying you've got to have one
of these in your car at all times.

341
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:45,703
Maybe we should introduce a law
saying you've got to have onions
in the boot of your car,

342
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:49,862
don't announce it,
and then fine every French person
who arrives in Dover without any.

343
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:54,862
As we drove through the darkness,
my pessimism began to spread.

344
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,182
Average 64.6 - that's not enough.

345
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,422
It's just not enough, I won't do it.

346
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:06,343
Instant fuel consumption
went down from 65mpg to 52,
and that's not good enough.

347
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,622
No, it's uphill. Oh, God.

348
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:12,662
I, however, was delighted,
because I'd just worked out

349
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:16,703
that if I went fast enough,
I could conk out on the M40,

350
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:19,822
just a few minutes from my house.

351
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:20,422
Range,

352
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:22,023
605 miles.

353
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:23,942
That's perfect!

354
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:28,382
That meant I could spend my time
wondering which of my colleagues

355
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:32,503
would be best suited to switching
on Blackpool's fairy lights.

356
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:36,383
Think about it - Danny La Rue,
Ken Dodd, Cannon, Ball, Hammond.

357
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,102
It has a ring.

358
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:42,302
Dawn broke over our dreary race.

359
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:46,103
I'm doing 55 miles per gallon.

360
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:48,142
It's not good enough. Relax.

361
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,183
I'm tensing up. OK, relax.

362
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:53,983
Hammond won't be able to do this.
Too angry.

363
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:56,702
I'm on an economy drive,
saving the planet,

364
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,423
and you, in your bus, with nobody
in it, made me slow down.

365
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:05,783
I had to use my brakes,
and then I've got to accelerate
again, which uses more fuel.

366
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:09,102
I, too, was having problems
in the Jag.

367
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:11,383
How can a V6 twin-turbo,

368
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,702
in a car that's 375 yards long,

369
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:17,423
possibly be doing

370
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:20,063
49 miles to the gallon?

371
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:20,622
49.1!

372
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:23,383
It's going up!

373
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:28,502
At this rate, I'd be running out
near Birmingham
rather than on my doorstep.

374
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:33,023
It was therefore time
to break out the heavy foot.

375
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:35,783
There we go.

376
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:42,463
Don't want to get it too hot,
because I'm not going to
put the air-conditioning on.

377
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:47,822
Some people calculate that it can
reduce your efficiency by about 10%.

378
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:49,622
That's fine by me, mate.

379
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:52,382
I've got everything on.
Air-conditioned seats...

380
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:56,543
I'm even heating the passenger seat-
for no good reason,

381
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:58,583
other than to burn fuel.

382
00:24:58,943 --> 00:25:02,823
'Despite being in France,
I even powered up the radio.'

383
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:04,622
MAN SINGS IN FRENCH

384
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:14,943
After three hours,
the little Polo was off
the A-roads and on the motorway.

385
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:18,023
I was a few miles ahead
of hyper-miler May...

386
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:19,822
69 miles per gallon!

387
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:22,542
..but way behind
hyper-spacer Clarkson.

388
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:25,503
81 miles an hour.

389
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:29,703
Amazingly, my car
was now doing 78mpg,

390
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,182
but I had a new problem.

391
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,823
My average mpg now is enough.

392
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:41,023
I can make it. But my average
speed, I won't make it in time.

393
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,383
Hammond. 'Hello?' I'm bored!

394
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,662
What are your figures? Tell me
your numbers. Average speed...

395
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:48,623
'Yes?' 63.

396
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,703
Wow! That's immense.

397
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:52,782
What's yours?

398
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:58,983
Not good. 34. You're not gonna
make Blackpool till about Sunday.

399
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:00,662
That's the problem I have there.

400
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:03,263
'And what's your predicted
range of your car?'

401
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:05,663
It says I'm gonna be out of fuel

402
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:06,943
in 450 miles.

403
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,343
Blackpool - 669 miles away.

404
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:19,823
'Frankly, it didn't look like
any of us were going to be
turning on the lights that night.'

405
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:25,102
One, two.. Ladies and gentlemen,
all the way from BBC Two's Top Gear,

406
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:26,023
please welcome...nobody.

407
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:34,783
Meanwhile, many miles to the north,
the people of Blackpool

408
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:38,823
to their big day, unaware
that us three wouldn't be there.

409
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:42,303
However, having known all along
that this was a possibility,

410
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,023
the show's producers
had sent backup.

411
00:26:50,462 --> 00:26:54,623
Six hours into the journey,
and thanks to some careful driving,

412
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:57,943
all our cars
were starting to hit their targets.

413
00:26:58,222 --> 00:27:02,983
Overall fuel consumption - 68 miles
per gallon. That is excellent.

414
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:05,102
74.9mpg, I'm averaging now.

415
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:08,822
That is bang-on
what I should be doing.

416
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:10,582
Fuel is burning away...

417
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,303
..29 miles to the gallon.

418
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:19,263
The only problem was boredom,
and that was made worse
by a phone call from James.

419
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:23,342
'I just did a bit more
mental calculations looking
at the statistics for the cars.'

420
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,582
Luckily you're breaking up, James.

421
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:29,542
'I said I've done little bit
more...the cars...'

422
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:34,343
For the one viewer
we have left who now isn't
watching Midsomer Murders?

423
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,743
I may have been bored,
but at least I didn't need the loo.

424
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:41,342
I'm quite desperate for a pee.

425
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:48,183
In Blackpool, though, our man
on the ground wasn't bored at all.

426
00:27:54,343 --> 00:28:00,182
Eight hours into my doomed run, and-
I was now bearing down on Calais.

427
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,542
Hammond is currently
30 miles behind me,

428
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:07,463
and he's dropping back at the rate
of about 20 seconds a mile.

429
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,582
He might make Blackpool tomorrow.

430
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:17,223
'Jeremy was right. I might
have been getting almost 80mpg,

431
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,543
'but what was the point?'

432
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:23,822
So, I'm gonna spend a bit more fuel-
to get there on time.

433
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:27,982
So, let's bring that average
fuel consumption down,
and average speed up.

434
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:29,743
This is a race.

435
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:34,423
'The only problem was, someone else-
had had the same idea.'

436
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,063
Richard Hammond! No! No!

437
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,142
It's neck and neck,
ladies and gentlemen.

438
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:44,663
'I, too, thought it was time
to trade fuel for speed,

439
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:48,383
'and so began the dullest duel
in history.'

440
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:52,543
No, me instant mpg...
Mustn't just put my foot down.

441
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:54,343
No, it's plummeting. 49.

442
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:03,782
That fuel gauge...

443
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:09,902
I've got a third of a tank to get
from Folkestone to Blackpool.

444
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:14,303
Why am I bothering?
Why don't you just have lunch?

445
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:16,183
'Half-an-hour behind Jeremy...'
Bonjour.

446
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:23,863
'..our spine-tingling race had ended-
in a dead heat at the toll booth.'

447
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:27,902
What a miserable cow.

448
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:37,142
On the train, Hammond saved weight
by emptying his bladder,
while I went even further.

449
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,502
Are you going anywhere near London?
Yeah, Wimbledon.

450
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,583
Do you mind awfully
taking this wheel?

451
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:49,543
Only it's quite heavy and I'm trying-
to save fuel, and I think that
could make 0.2 mile per gallon.

452
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:53,223
As they waited to depart,
I arrived back in Blighty, took off

453
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:58,263
my high-visibility jacket and set
the finish line firmly in my sights.

454
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:02,783
Dover to North Oxfordshire
on a third of a tank.

455
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:04,102
Sounds about right.

456
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:08,303
Air-con on, cool seats on, radio on.

457
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:14,622
RADIO: 'The Blackpool illuminations
get switched on this evening
by the hosts of BBC Two's Top Gear,

458
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:19,143
'Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond
and James May. Do you think
they're racing there now?'

459
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:24,423
I don't think so, Steve!
I don't think any of us
will be doing it.

460
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:24,903
APPLAUSE

461
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:31,823
And we'll find out
what happens later on.

462
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:35,502
But now, if you've always
fancied a supercar

463
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:39,303
but you need space to carry
stuff like children, luggage, a hat,

464
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:43,862
maybe a pencil,
your only choice has been this,
the four-door Maserati Quattroporte.

465
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:50,183
Now though, Porsche and Aston Martin-
are thinking along similar lines
to that, and then there is this.

466
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:52,303
This is the Lamborghini Estoque.

467
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:55,782
This is not actually a real car yet,
it's just a model.

468
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,582
And Lamborghini say if they do
make it, it could have a diesel.

469
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:01,382
I don't think so.

470
00:31:01,982 --> 00:31:03,503
Or, a hybrid engine.

471
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:05,062
I don't think so.

472
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:09,582
Or maybe the V10
from the new Gallardo.
That's more likely, I think.

473
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:13,062
Whatever engine it is,
it will go here at the front.

474
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:16,622
And that means there is room
for a proper boot at the back,

475
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:20,423
and more importantly, there is room
in here for four people.

476
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:24,983
And it's not one of those supercars
with seats in the front
and token seats in the back.

477
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:28,903
It really is massive. Have
a look at the legroom back there.

478
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,742
Do you know what I love
about this most of all?

479
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:37,983
They haven't fallen into the same
trap that Porsche fell into
with the off-roader, the Cayenne.

480
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,223
Because that, they've got
a supercar, 911 nose on the front,

481
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:44,182
and an ordinary car on the back.
You go, "Wow, it's Kate Moss."

482
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:48,463
Then you look down the side, "Oh,
no, it's got John Prescott's arse."

483
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:51,662
This... From every angle
it just gets better looking.

484
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:54,902
It's just staggering.
Please make it. Anyway.

485
00:31:57,343 --> 00:32:00,662
We've got to leave this alone,
sadly,

486
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:03,743
because it is now time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

487
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,103
What can I say
about my guest tonight?

488
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:10,062
Born on 4th July, Top Gun,
Days Of Thunder,

489
00:32:10,182 --> 00:32:12,102
he has watched them all.

490
00:32:12,823 --> 00:32:14,343
Ladies and gentlemen, Harry Enfield.

491
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:15,662
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

492
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,143
Harry! Hello.

493
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:25,303
Are you very well? I'm very well.
Good to see you.

494
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,943
Now, can I just say, because
I don't think many people will

495
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:37,262
remember this - Harry was the first-
guest we ever had on new Top Gear.

496
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:39,062
And you came back!

497
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:41,663
Yeah. There's a story to that.

498
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:47,302
Which is? Which is that when I came-
on, I did the round in the car,

499
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:52,782
the reasonably priced car, I didn't-
really realise it was a competition.

500
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:58,062
And so I did the lap, and The
Stig said "You can take a few
seconds off if you do it again,"

501
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,943
and I said "No, I want my lunch."

502
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:03,863
So you put your stomach
in front of your pride.

503
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,502
I think it was a 2.01.

504
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,863
Two minutes and one seconds.

505
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:11,342
Biblically slow.
Yeah. But you see I didn't realise.

506
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:16,502
I thought as long as I was in
the car going "Ooh, eeeh," then
that would be good television.

507
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:20,902
And it turned out that my son who
is now 11, Archie, and my daughter,

508
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:25,222
Poppy, they watch your shows
and then they come through all
the time and go "Dad, Dad!

509
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:28,063
"Jeremy's being horrible
about you again!"

510
00:33:28,462 --> 00:33:32,702
So you're coming back now
to try and... And you took
the piss out of my cars too.

511
00:33:32,983 --> 00:33:36,062
Why wouldn't I? I have to say...
I had a... I had a...

512
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,462
You went, "And look at this car!

513
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:42,143
"This is Harry's car,
when he became Loadsamoney."

514
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:46,783
And they took off the thing and it
was a Vauxhall Cavalier convertible,
which I thought was fine,

515
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:50,862
and all the men with wigs in
the audience went "hehehehehehe".

516
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:51,182
LAUGHTER

517
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:56,543
So, you were back recently
with Paul Whitehouse.

518
00:33:56,942 --> 00:34:00,622
Fantastic to see you back
together again in Harry
and Paul, which I think

519
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:04,823
was the funniest thing
I'd ever seen on television,

520
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:08,462
and I'm not saying
that to blow smoke up your bottom.

521
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:10,983
I really did think it was.
That's very kind of you, Jeremy.

522
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,622
Didn't Johnny Depp once say
the finest actor he's ever seen
was Paul Whitehouse?

523
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:15,463
Yeah, it was. Not you. No, it was
Paul Whitehouse and not me.

524
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,023
And I think he's right.

525
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:21,823
I think Paul Whitehouse is one
of the finest actors. I do, too.
And you're the second finest.

526
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:27,662
Although I have to say there was
one target that you picked on...

527
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:31,022
I don't know
what you're talking about.

528
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:33,103
I do know what I'm talking about.
I thought it was quite mean.
He picked on me!

529
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:40,902
And we even have a clip of him
picking on me which the producer
thinks you need to see. Here it is.

530
00:34:41,023 --> 00:34:41,342
Hello.

531
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:46,622
I'm on an island,
and not just any island.

532
00:34:47,022 --> 00:34:49,702
Because this island
is Clarkson Island.

533
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:52,823
And unlike any other island,

534
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:57,943
Clarkson Island has the greatest
number of Clarksons in the world.

535
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,343
Come on now, Clarksy.

536
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,342
We have to clip them twice a year.

537
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:10,622
Otherwise their woolly hair gets
clogged up with all the BLEEP
that comes out of their mouths.

538
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:11,062
APPLAUSE

539
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,542
It's very funny.

540
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,423
My son watches that every hour.

541
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:25,142
Watches that? Yeah.
"Dad, you're on again!

542
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:28,823
"Well, not you, there's a lot of
BLEEP coming out of your mouth,
Dad!"

543
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:31,703
And you didn't get
"in the world" right.

544
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:37,903
Oh. Yes, I did. No. You have
to say this is the fastest car...

545
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,863
The pause is everything.

546
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:47,102
..in the world. There, you see?
That's how you do it.

547
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:47,543
APPLAUSE

548
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,263
Much too quick.

549
00:35:52,703 --> 00:35:55,662
That was the best "in the world".

550
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,142
No! That was the best...

551
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:00,182
..in the world. No!

552
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,423
You're coming too soon, Enfield.

553
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:06,742
You are very good actor. Do you
have to work at impersonations? No.

554
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:10,303
You don't? Cos Rory Bremner
spends hours and weeks and months.

555
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:13,423
Well, that's why he's really good
and I'm not very good.

556
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:15,062
You're doing yourself down.

557
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,822
Look at Clarkson there.

558
00:36:17,102 --> 00:36:20,822
I don't even look like you. He had
dark hair. You've got grey hair.

559
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:28,543
You once said when you started
there was no comedy -

560
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:29,223
well, comedy for the working
classes was patronising

561
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,982
and it was all Cambridge Footlights.
Do you still think that?

562
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:34,822
It used to be. It used to be crap
sitcoms for the working classes.

563
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,823
Yeah. Bum titty wee-wee. Yeah,
that kind of things. Ooh, madam.

564
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:43,663
And then there was Footlights
for the upper classes
and nothing in between.

565
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:45,662
And I think when we started,
we just tried to do

566
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:49,463
family characters, but they were
a bit more intelligent. I think.

567
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:53,062
One of the things
I loved was that there was
an assumption of knowledge.

568
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:55,782
It was sort of deliberately
excluding the stupid.

569
00:36:56,302 --> 00:37:00,102
If you didn't know what the
Sicilian Defence was in chess,
you didn't get one of the jokes.

570
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:03,783
We've got to an age where we just
thought, OK, we're going to do

571
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:09,782
what we want to do and we'll
find it funny, and I think it sort
of helped our relationship, too.

572
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:12,742
We genuinely enjoyed
what we were doing with each other,

573
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:16,582
rather than just spouting lines
that we thought everyone would like.

574
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,023
I want to talk about cars, if I may.
Oh yeah, let's talk about cars.

575
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,382
Let's do that.
The last time you were on...

576
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:24,383
Is BLEEP really a swear word?

577
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:30,583
I thought it just meant bad driver.

578
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:44,942
I get called it a lot, you see.

579
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:46,223
We recommended... Sorry,

580
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:51,503
yes, cars. When you were last here,-
we recommended you bought
a Volvo XC90.

581
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:55,063
Yeah, I bought one
and I had for three years, and then

582
00:37:55,462 --> 00:38:01,983
Ken Livingstone said it was just
above the limit and he was going to-
charge £25 a day for us to drive it.

583
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:05,462
So I swapped it in for a V70.

584
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:10,382
So do you go down to
Cornwall in your Volvo? Yes,
we go down to Cornwall in our V70.

585
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:14,783
Prince Harry, Prince whatever he's
called, the other one. William.

586
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:20,623
They're all down there, yeah. Come
on, Mungo. There's a lot of that.

587
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:23,503
Do you go to Rock?
Yeah, we do, yeah.

588
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:26,982
I go surfing. And occasionally
the Daily Mail bloody get me.

589
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,062
Cos I've got a paunch, you see.

590
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:33,862
When you're in a wetsuit,
you look really, really stupid.

591
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:37,103
And they always get me on the...
and there's the surfaceboard,

592
00:38:37,622 --> 00:38:44,503
about that much, the wave is about
that big and you can see the sand
at the bottom. I'm like that.

593
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:50,823
Anyway, your lap. OK. It means
a lot to me, this lap, because
I've been so disgraced in the past.

594
00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:57,182
Unfortunately from your point of
view, there was a camera down at
the Hammerhead when you approached.

595
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,583
Who'd like to see that? Yes.

596
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:04,223
We've never seen anybody ever go
off at the Hammerhead. Jonathan
Ross got lost at the Hammerhead.

597
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:07,942
We've never seen this before.
Here we go.

598
00:39:08,822 --> 00:39:12,823
Coming up now, heavy braking.
Too much understeer. No!

599
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,022
Oh.

600
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:23,183
Oh! A small gift.
Oh, thank you very much.

601
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:26,983
The problem is that James May
is flying his plane home

602
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:31,663
from that airfield tonight, and now-
you've removed the landing lights
which means he will be killed.

603
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,182
So well done again for that.

604
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:36,423
Thank you.
Who would like to see Harry's lap?

605
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:40,743
Yes! Come on, let's have a look
at the real one. Here it is.

606
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:42,863
And we're off. Look, a serious face.

607
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:46,062
I'm determined
to beat my crap record.

608
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:51,223
Steady. Is that all right?

609
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:56,742
It's steady and accurate.
Does that mean slow?
No, that's wild, actually.

610
00:39:56,942 --> 00:39:59,103
Ooh, that was quite fun.

611
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:04,142
The Stig did say you don't have
much feel for the car. Oh...

612
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:08,182
I think I hit the brake about here.-
Woof.

613
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:12,942
Yes, here we go. Are you going to
manage to get round it this time?

614
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:17,863
You're certainly ambitious
with your speed there, Harry.
That's for sure.

615
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:22,023
I must remember this
is a family show, must not swear.

616
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:22,983
Stupid BLEEP!

617
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:28,223
You can't put that out.
Yes, we can.

618
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,822
Ooh! Look at that! Whoa!

619
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:35,982
Now you're getting up some speed.

620
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:40,982
That's a very good line through
there. And this is nearly good.

621
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:44,103
And there he is, across the line!

622
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:57,183
Well, here we are. Last time you
were here, in the old car which was-
slower than that, you did a 2.01.

623
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:59,943
Brian Cox did it in the new car.

624
00:41:00,142 --> 00:41:01,463
Where would you like to go?

625
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,943
I'd like to go just above Jay Kay.

626
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:11,263
I did say to my son,
surely it'll be more comedy

627
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:12,782
if I was even worse
than last time. He said "No, Dad.

628
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:13,742
"No, Dad."

629
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:15,263
Archie,

630
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:19,662
you were 2.01 last time.
OK, Archie?

631
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:21,463
One... he's already happy!

632
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:23,743
Yay!
LAUGHTER

633
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:27,542
40...

634
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:27,982
9.7.

635
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:32,383
There you go, ladies and gentlemen.

636
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:35,342
You're in there.

637
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:40,022
You're in that area. Ron Wood.

638
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:40,823
Ronnie Wood!

639
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:44,063
I'm really pleased with that.

640
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:48,343
You are pleased?
Yeah, I beat Steve Coogan.
Cos he likes cars.

641
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:53,863
He's always in cars. And not only
did you beat Steve Coogan, you are
by far our most improved guest.

642
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:56,142
Ladies and gentlemen,
Harry Enfield!

643
00:41:56,342 --> 00:41:57,543
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

644
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:10,222
Tonight, we are having a race from
Basel in Switzerland to Blackpool.

645
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:13,702
First one there gets the honour
of switching on the town's
famous illuminations.

646
00:42:13,943 --> 00:42:18,702
Unfortunately we only had one tank
of fuel, which meant we could drive

647
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:24,823
slowly, conserve petrol, but run the-
risk of not getting there on time,
or we could drive a bit more quickly

648
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:29,703
but then run the risk of not
getting there at all. James and I
were taking it very seriously.

649
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:34,102
When we left the action
we were here, waiting for our
Channel Tunnel train to set off.

650
00:42:34,382 --> 00:42:36,983
Jeremy meanwhile had decided
the whole thing was impossible.

651
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,703
He'd chosen a big Jag, driven
through France like a loony,

652
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:44,103
caught an earlier train than us
and was hoping to run out of fuel
as soon as he could.

653
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:53,582
Finally, the producers had sent
The Stig on ahead to Blackpool as a
stand-in in case none of us made it.

654
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:10,143
'With just over seven hours till
the big switch-on, James and I
were spat out of the Eurotunnel.'

655
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:13,502
Rush-hour, Friday night,
over 300 miles to do.

656
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:15,263
I've got enough fuel.

657
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:18,502
Well, just. 295 miles,

658
00:43:20,383 --> 00:43:22,182
the computer's telling me.

659
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:28,142
The fuel gauge would suggest
there's not more than a quarter
of the tank left.

660
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:32,103
Which means three and a half gallons.
It doesn't sound like enough to me.

661
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:34,223
It's gonna be quite exciting.

662
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:40,582
Richard and I were close together,
but soon we'd split,

663
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:43,582
as once again
we'd all chosen different routes.

664
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:46,623
Hammond would use the M1 and the M6,

665
00:43:47,143 --> 00:43:52,743
whereas I would go all the way
up the M1 to Leeds
and then over the M62.

666
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:58,583
This was 34 miles further, but I'd
miss the notorious M6 traffic jams.

667
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:04,102
Jeremy, meanwhile was using the M40,-
because it goes past his house.

668
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:06,502
Chipping Norton here I come.

669
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:11,383
Phone my wife, tell her
I'll be home earlier than expected.

670
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:19,502
'James and I could just about
make it, and make it on time,
as long as we didn't hit traffic.'

671
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,142
Ah, what the hell is that?

672
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:26,903
I'm losing out on time and fuel.

673
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:33,262
My estimated time of arrival
is now slipping again, so it's
45 minutes it's moved already.

674
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:37,303
Engine running, not going anywhere.
No miles per gallon.

675
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:43,782
In Blackpool, people were starting
to arrive for the celebrations.

676
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:49,502
Our man on the ground was preparing
by having an afternoon nap.

677
00:44:56,743 --> 00:45:01,262
'After two hours
and much wasted fuel,
Richard and I were finally on the M1,

678
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:04,862
'where we would soon
go our separate ways.'

679
00:45:06,182 --> 00:45:13,102
If I'm going to get the Blackpool
spangly jacket, I have to pray
that Hammond gets stuck

680
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,902
for about three-quarters
of an hour in bad traffic
around Birmingham.

681
00:45:17,303 --> 00:45:20,583
'My mind, however,
was only fixed on Jeremy.'

682
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:22,862
He must be out of fuel by now.

683
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:27,863
He must be. Surely the gods
of economy will punish him.

684
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,342
'And then the phone rang.'

685
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:32,983
Are you at the side of the road
yet? No.

686
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:35,102
Stupid thing is still working.

687
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:37,742
How is it doing that?
It's not possible.

688
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,662
I'm 15 minutes from home.

689
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:44,182
I can smell my bed. Hammond,
I'm so close. Stop!

690
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:47,383
Stop now. Cough. Cough.

691
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:50,582
Die. Die now!

692
00:45:52,862 --> 00:45:55,143
Bad luck, mate. Soldier on.

693
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:56,902
I love that Jag.

694
00:45:57,182 --> 00:45:58,703
I love it so very much.

695
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:03,863
Because all it can do now
is take him further from home.

696
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:04,302
Yeah.

697
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:11,702
'The irritating fact
was that after 660 miles

698
00:46:12,263 --> 00:46:20,822
'of abusive and wasteful driving,
the big twin-turbo Jag was telling
me it still had 135 miles to go.'

699
00:46:21,182 --> 00:46:27,502
Right, if I'm in this competition,
I'm in it to win it. Air-con off.

700
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:37,102
'Now all of us thought we'd be
making the speech that night.'

701
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:41,143
Good folk of Blackpool, it's a
delight, an honour and a pleasure.

702
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:48,463
It gives me great pleasure
to be here tonight to turn on
your world famous illuminations.

703
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:51,423
I declare these lights...on.

704
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:03,382
I'd had a good lead over the others
but on the M42, trouble.

705
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:07,463
RADIO: '..On the motorways. Caravans-
overturning on that stretch.'

706
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:09,702
That's what I'm stuck in.

707
00:47:10,463 --> 00:47:13,783
People slowing down to look
at a caravan. Rightly so.

708
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:17,343
I'd want to look at an overturned
caravan. There's nothing funnier.

709
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,502
It's a big old queue.

710
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:21,782
Four miles of this speed.

711
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:26,423
Hammond's going to
be right on my tail.

712
00:47:27,863 --> 00:47:30,943
I might now try and catch him up,

713
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:35,142
only to find as I catch him up
he runs out of diesel,
but I've used up

714
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:38,983
all mine as well, so maybe I should-
be prepared to go slower than him

715
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:41,303
and then overtake him
when he runs out.

716
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:43,223
Kind of a hare and tortoise.

717
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:46,222
No, that's a stupid idea.
I don't like it at all.

718
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,023
I'm gonna go fast.

719
00:47:50,263 --> 00:47:51,582
The North. Excellent.

720
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:56,702
I'm probably about 130 miles away.

721
00:47:56,942 --> 00:48:00,302
Computer says I can only do 90 miles.

722
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:02,783
James thought he had problems.

723
00:48:03,623 --> 00:48:05,862
They were nothing compared to mine.

724
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:13,183
OK, I've now got
an eighth of a tank to get me
from Birmingham to Blackpool.

725
00:48:14,382 --> 00:48:17,023
And then the news got worse.

726
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:19,022
Hammond. Where are you?

727
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:20,663
On the M6 toll. Where are you?

728
00:48:20,903 --> 00:48:22,463
On the M6 toll.

729
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:23,863
HE LAUGHS

730
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:27,823
We've closed up. What's your speed?

731
00:48:28,223 --> 00:48:32,462
70 at the moment. 70?
The ridiculous thing is
I've got twice as many

732
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:38,303
cylinders and twice as many turbos,-
but I can't pull away from you.

733
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:41,623
Meanwhile, far, far away...

734
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:48,583
I can't believe it's gonna make it
now. That petrol gauge is so low.

735
00:48:48,823 --> 00:48:50,862
This is just appalling torture.

736
00:48:52,903 --> 00:48:54,542
I'm just sitting here,

737
00:48:54,823 --> 00:48:58,342
knowing that any minute now,
Hammond is going to come by.

738
00:48:58,503 --> 00:48:59,663
And then, disaster.

739
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:01,823
Here I come.

740
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:03,423
No! No, no!

741
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:06,542
No, no, no. Hammond!

742
00:49:11,222 --> 00:49:13,823
I can't do anything about it!

743
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:15,743
PHONE RINGS

744
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:17,742
I've just seen somebody who

745
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:21,422
looks just like you in a Jaguar
doing about 56 miles an hour.

746
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:24,302
I am not going to race you. Really?

747
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:24,742
No.

748
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:30,863
I am going to sit behind you
and watch you fail.

749
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:36,942
'And with Blackpool still
60 miles away, Jeremy was more
on the money than he realised.'

750
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:44,262
I'm now gonna run out of diesel
40 miles away from Blackpool
according to this computer.

751
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:52,142
With James far behind,
it was becoming a straight race
between Hammond and me.

752
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:58,103
Both of us were running on fumes,
but I was staggered
the Jag had even got this far.

753
00:49:58,502 --> 00:50:02,303
Because
most of the way through France,
I was doing 80 miles an hour.

754
00:50:02,662 --> 00:50:05,262
I had the air-con on,
the radio on, I was charging phones.

755
00:50:05,663 --> 00:50:09,703
Most of the way through Britain,
I was doing 70.
It's been stop-start traffic.

756
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:12,182
I haven't
been on an eco drive in this thing.

757
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:14,462
Since Birmingham, neither had I.

758
00:50:14,702 --> 00:50:17,542
And now I was really
paying the price.

759
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:20,782
The range computer
has just ticked over to zero.

760
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:23,022
It's 36 miles to Blackpool.

761
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:25,022
It's telling me nothing.

762
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:25,823
Empty.

763
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:31,343
Hammond won't make it.
James won't make it.

764
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:33,582
God, this is tense.

765
00:50:34,303 --> 00:50:37,262
The fuel gauge says
I'm about to run out.

766
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:43,742
Hypermiling techniques,
gentle on the throttle,
don't let it get to me. Stay calm.

767
00:50:47,623 --> 00:50:55,822
17.4 miles to go. It's telling me
I've got nothing left and I'm
just waiting for that cough.

768
00:50:56,702 --> 00:51:03,022
With the Stig baffled by human food-
and with 30 minutes to go before

769
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:07,583
the big switch-on, I was agonising
over mounting a charge on Hammond.

770
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:10,303
It's the stupidest,
cleverest race ever.

771
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:16,502
I could easily beat him if I just
put my foot down, but I don't know
how much fuel is left in that tank.

772
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:18,302
I love economy races.

773
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:23,302
My final exit.

774
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:29,023
I'm just doing everything I can.
Jeremy's behind.
I know he's taking it easy.

775
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:32,983
He's not gonna take it that easy,
because...he's Jeremy.

776
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:38,462
So, with 10 miles to go,
my range has finally reached 0.

777
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:43,742
But still the magic Jag soldiers on.
And I've picked my speed up to 70.

778
00:51:43,982 --> 00:51:45,503
The race is on.

779
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:52,223
'The question was,
could I catch him in time?'

780
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,222
I'm four miles away.

781
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:56,103
Come on.

782
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:59,582
I can see Blackpool Tower!

783
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:02,783
Oh, this is nerve-racking.

784
00:52:03,182 --> 00:52:06,583
If it dies now,
it'll be too much to bear.

785
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:09,222
Range, 0. Fuel gauge, really empty.

786
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:19,302
All I need now is to see a little
Volkswagen Polo with a little man
sobbing his eyes out next to it.

787
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:22,982
Resetting trip computer B
for this fast stretch.

788
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:28,823
Hello? I'm still moving. No, no!

789
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:31,462
And I'll tell you something else.

790
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:36,703
What? I've got about two miles left-
to go, but even better than that,
I have a police escort.

791
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,863
You are having me on!

792
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:42,462
One mile and I'm still moving.

793
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:45,062
I've got nothing left at all.

794
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:48,662
Oh, yes! I think I could be there!

795
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:57,743
So Hammond had won.

796
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:02,543
Single most tense thing
I've ever done.

797
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:07,182
Less than a minute later,
I arrived too. I have made it.

798
00:53:07,343 --> 00:53:07,982
Hello, everybody.

799
00:53:08,743 --> 00:53:11,582
They appear to be cheering my Jag.

800
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:13,742
And James May hasn't come.

801
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:19,223
He doesn't like you. He doesn't
like anybody in the north.

802
00:53:20,543 --> 00:53:20,983
Congratulations.

803
00:53:25,223 --> 00:53:28,903
The world's second most
economical car! It's astonishing.

804
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:33,062
How you kept that... I thought,
there's no way he can do it.

805
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,983
There were just seconds to go
before the lights were switched on.

806
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:37,943
Five. Four.

807
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,982
Would James make it in time?

808
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:43,942
53.7 miles per gallon average.

809
00:53:44,142 --> 00:53:45,662
I'm looking for 56.5...

810
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:48,302
No, he wouldn't.

811
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:49,823
Three, two, one!

812
00:53:52,223 --> 00:53:53,543
Pull the lever.

813
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:56,743
You won the race. No, you should...

814
00:54:11,743 --> 00:54:13,022
Well done, you.

815
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:18,183
All of that and then The Stig
stole my big moment.
I can't believe he did it.

816
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:22,822
Yeah, well, some say he has
no understanding of queueing.

817
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:28,782
Can I just say -
in case any of you are interested -
I did actually make it to Blackpool.

818
00:54:29,063 --> 00:54:31,302
Yes, you did, James, 40 minutes
after the ceremony was over.

819
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:38,343
OK, I did make the mistake of going
too slowly, but nevertheless, I got
63 miles to the gallon out of that.

820
00:54:38,623 --> 00:54:40,982
It is amazing. I got 80 miles
to the gallon out of that.

821
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:47,062
I want to know why would anybody
buy a Prius when this is seven
grand less and it uses less fuel?

822
00:54:47,463 --> 00:54:51,023
I did 17 hours in it and
when I got out the other end,
I wasn't even tired.

823
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:56,143
We have to acknowledge though,
that the true hero
of this whole piece is that Jaguar.

824
00:54:56,583 --> 00:55:00,782
Couldn't agree more, and it's
better than you might think,
because we examined the fuel tank

825
00:55:01,183 --> 00:55:07,262
when we got to Blackpool
and found there was enough
left in it to do another 120 miles!

826
00:55:07,663 --> 00:55:15,743
If you think about it, 53 miles to
the gallon, 18.7 gallon fuel tank,
that's a range of 1,000 miles.

827
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,863
1,000 miles between trips
to the pumps.

828
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:22,943
And let's not forget,
the engine in this
was the same engine that was in

829
00:55:23,342 --> 00:55:26,982
the S-Type that took me around
the Nurburgring in less than ten
minutes. It is an amazing car.

830
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:28,263
It's just incredible.

831
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,502
Anyway, look... Yes, go.

832
00:55:30,902 --> 00:55:36,742
It's time to find out how fast the
Bugatti Veyron goes around our track.

833
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:41,503
That means, of course, handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

834
00:55:41,623 --> 00:55:42,342
Some say...

835
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:47,942
he has a stripy top just like mine.
Oh, come on, James.

836
00:55:48,343 --> 00:55:51,622
You really didn't fool anybody
with that. Not fooled anyone.

837
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:53,663
No, this really is a big moment.

838
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:55,543
A properly, properly big moment.

839
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,982
In a few moments, we probably
will have a new leader
on our power lap board.

840
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,582
The Bugatti Veyron. Let's find out.

841
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:04,943
And he is off.

842
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:07,462
Massive seamless
traction off the line.

843
00:56:07,742 --> 00:56:11,023
Massive seamless power
from the double clutch gearbox.

844
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:13,022
Look at the air brake working there.

845
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:17,222
That produces more stopping power
than the brakes on a normal car.

846
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:20,303
Four-wheel drive grip
keeping it in line.

847
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,822
Look at this.

848
00:56:23,182 --> 00:56:24,943
Cornering flat through Chicago.

849
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:29,222
No drama,
apart from that tyre squeal.

850
00:56:30,103 --> 00:56:32,822
Hammerhead.
There's the A brake again.

851
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,302
Listen to
the noise this thing makes.

852
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:49,103
Right, now the Stig can really
wind up all 16 cylinders, all
four turbos, all 987 horsepower.

853
00:56:49,343 --> 00:56:51,342
Come on, Stig. Come on.

854
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:52,742
This is important.

855
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:57,182
Just two corners left.
Hard on the brakes again.

856
00:56:57,422 --> 00:56:59,183
Little bit of a wiggle.

857
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,263
Come on, Stig. Greatest
piece of car engineering ever.

858
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,382
Can it be the fastest
round our track?

859
00:57:05,742 --> 00:57:09,102
Glides it through Gambon
and across the line.

860
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:15,303
It just looks so composed.
There's no drama in that thing.

861
00:57:15,423 --> 00:57:16,223
OK, everyone.

862
00:57:17,462 --> 00:57:21,503
This is it. This is the moment
that really every

863
00:57:21,902 --> 00:57:25,783
motoring enthusiast in the world
has been looking forward to
for years.

864
00:57:26,183 --> 00:57:30,583
Has the Veyron topped our board?
Is it quicker than the Gumpert?

865
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:31,022
1.17.1.

866
00:57:34,503 --> 00:57:37,102
Well, it did it in 1...

867
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:43,410
..18.3.

868
00:57:46,368 --> 00:57:48,128
It's the fourth fastest.

869
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:51,554
I think it's too heavy to put
in the really, really fast time.

870
00:57:52,075 --> 00:57:55,435
I have to be honest,
I'm surprised it wasn't quickest.
I have to be honest with that.

871
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:58,315
What? Chaps. Yes?

872
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,674
The Zonda F,

873
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:04,755
was it fixed in time to do a lap?
Yes, it was.

874
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,474
Can we see that now, please?
Yes, we can. Good.

875
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:10,594
Are we ready, ladies and
gentlemen, to see the Zonda? Yes!

876
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:13,555
OK, play the tape. And he's off.

877
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:19,875
A lot of wheelspin there,
because, of course, the Zonda
is only two-wheel drive.

878
00:58:22,315 --> 00:58:25,594
Remember, this roadster has 50
horsepower more than the coupe.

879
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:28,234
So can it beat the hard-top's time?

880
00:58:28,594 --> 00:58:30,034
1.18.4. Still smoke, look.

881
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:33,834
Here's Chicago.

882
00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:37,395
Looking a bit lively through
there and lively on the exit too.

883
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,355
Looking a bit lively through
there and lively on the exit too.

884
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,435
This car can be vicious.

885
00:58:44,834 --> 00:58:48,475
But in an amusing way,
like a shark in a funny hat.

886
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:52,314
Getting a little bit sideways
around Hammerhead.
More smoke as well.

887
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:55,035
Careful, Stig,
don't break it again!

888
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:59,475
He really is wringing out
that Mercedes V12 now.

889
00:58:59,714 --> 00:59:03,394
Come on, into the second
to last corner.

890
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:07,915
It does... It looks good,
I have to say. Then through Gambon.

891
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:09,595
Massive slide and across the line.

892
00:59:17,128 --> 00:59:17,567
Ready?

893
00:59:20,488 --> 00:59:24,287
It did it... Yes? You really
think it'll be faster, don't you?

894
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:25,568
God, yes. Yes.

895
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:29,887
It did it in 1... Well, yes!

896
00:59:31,687 --> 00:59:34,447
17.8!
So straight away, it's above!

897
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:38,848
Oh, yeah.

898
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:43,968
So the mighty science lesson here

899
00:59:44,968 --> 00:59:49,327
enjoyed literally a minute
as the fourth fastest car
on our lap board, and then

900
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:52,688
it was knocked off by the Zonda F,
the pantomime horse of a supercar.

901
00:59:52,848 --> 00:59:55,288
Do you know what this means?

902
00:59:55,687 --> 01:00:00,568
It means that for the first time
ever, we really can end on
a bombshell. See you next week.

903
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,687
Thanks for watching. Good night!
