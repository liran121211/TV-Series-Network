1
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:15,225
Tonight, The Stig climbs into a
bucket of hot wallpaper paste.

2
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:20,945
Richard sorts out public transport
and James gets beaten up by a boat.

3
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,465
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

4
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:35,705
Hello! Hello, and we start...we
start with something strange.

5
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:43,385
Cos you see, last year, you couldn't
buy a BMW unless you were a cock.

6
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:46,105
LAUGHTER
But then all of a sudden,

7
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:50,865
people with huge watches and
stupid Oakley sunglasses, people who

8
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:55,305
tailgate you on motorways, suddenly
started to buy Audis instead.

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,145
No idea why, don't really care
because, what this means

10
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:02,905
is normal people with normal watches
can buy for the first time ever,

11
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:04,985
what, if we're honest, has
always been

12
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,865
the best sports saloon of them all,
the M3.

13
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:12,625
Some people are saying
this new model

14
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:16,305
is too soft and too squidgy,
but I'm not one of them.

15
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:27,945
The fact is that last year we
showed the two-door coupe version

16
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:33,385
was way faster round the track than
its rivals from Audi and Mercedes.

17
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:39,225
And now, your children can have
their spleens crushed as well,

18
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,585
because this is the new
four-door version.

19
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:47,225
It has the same equipment
as the coupe we tested,

20
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:50,985
has the same butch front-end and
despite the extra weight,

21
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,025
the performance is almost
identical as well.

22
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:59,305
Of course, with the two extra doors
and a bigger boot, incidentally,

23
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:02,665
you would expect the saloon to
be more expensive than the coupe.

24
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,265
And it isn't, actually.

25
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:09,145
This is 49,000, so
it is £1,400 less.

26
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:14,305
This, then, is a brilliant car.

27
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:17,745
The obvious choice for the
family man who has a light...

28
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:19,705
but wants to keep it
under his bushel.

29
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,385
Or is it?

30
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:37,305
Because now, there's
a new kid on the block.

31
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:43,625
This - the Lexus IS F.

32
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:52,305
Now, driving a Lexus has always
been like sitting in a bucket

33
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,105
of warm wallpaper paste
reading a Jane Austen novel.

34
00:02:56,105 --> 00:03:00,865
But with this one, they claim
they've built an M3-killer.

35
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,225
TYRES SQUEALING

36
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:09,905
It's certainly very high-tech.

37
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:13,585
For instance, it has a support
vehicle integrated management
system -

38
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:16,865
whatever that is -
and airbags for your knees.

39
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:22,665
What's more, full lock-up
control is used in second gear

40
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,585
without the tongue converter.

41
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:30,345
Hmm, Jane Austen could only dream
about such things!

42
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:34,945
Happily, however, most of this
Japanesey PlayStation stuff

43
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:39,705
is buried under a wall
of brute force and noise.

44
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:43,425
ENGINE REVS AND TYRES SQUEAL

45
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:50,545
It has a massive 5-litre V8 engine.

46
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:55,065
Which produces about the
same amount of power as the M3,

47
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:57,305
but more torques.

48
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,465
It is, however,
100 kilograms heavier.

49
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:08,945
So let's see how the two of them
get on in a drag race.

50
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,545
ENGINES REV

51
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,745
TYRES SQUEAL

52
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,425
Wow!

53
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,585
I am ahead.

54
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,465
Oh, he's coming back.

55
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,105
Come on!

56
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,865
Eventually the heavy
Lexus would win.

57
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:41,185
Because while the BMW
is limited to 155 mph,

58
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:45,745
the IS F will keep going all
the way to 168.

59
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:50,425
It is a quick car, but what happens
when you show it some corners?

60
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:52,265
TYRES SQUEAL

61
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,065
Wow!

62
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:02,345
Well, as you can see,
I'm now behind the M3

63
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,665
which is being driven by
touring-car racer, Tom Chilton.

64
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,585
So, let's see if he
can get away from me.

65
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,625
TYRES SCREECH

66
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:17,785
This is so completely out of
character for a Lexus.

67
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,305
It's like Mr Darcy
coming out of the lake

68
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:26,865
and machine-gunning a
fluffy kitten for fun.

69
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,105
Oh, he's hard on those brakes.

70
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,465
These brakes are good too,
to be honest.

71
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:39,305
Understeer just kills everything
and then the weight coming out -

72
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,625
you see, he's already got
100 yards on me.

73
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:46,425
That BMW must be exciting,
look what it's done to his hair!

74
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:50,065
TYRES SQUEAL

75
00:05:57,505 --> 00:06:01,545
I can keep up but I have to work
so much harder

76
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:05,545
because this is just not quite
as composed as the Bimmer.

77
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,145
So what about price?

78
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:15,065
Well, the Lexus is £1,000 more
than the BMW,

79
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,025
but it comes with
more stuff as standard,

80
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,985
so it is slightly better value.

81
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:25,305
The Lexus also has slightly more
space, a slightly bigger boot

82
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:29,145
and a dashboard from the
pages of science fiction.

83
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,505
On paper then and on the track,

84
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:40,665
this really does seem like it could
be an alternative to the BMW.

85
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:44,145
But it isn't.

86
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,745
Firstly, it has eight gears,

87
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:50,065
and that's too many because it's
always changing its mind.

88
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:52,745
HE IMITATES GEARS CHANGING
UP AND DOWN

89
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:59,905
Then there's the styling.

90
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:02,665
The normal IS is a fine
and handsome thing,

91
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:05,545
but with all its puffed up
bits and pieces,

92
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:10,585
this is a bit of a mess and
those tail pipes are fakes.

93
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,985
There's more. This may have more
torques than the BMW

94
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,865
but they're all at

95
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:21,985
And that's like putting them on
the top shelf in the kitchen,

96
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,905
you can never really reach them,
they're never there.

97
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:31,025
The worst thing about the Lexus,
though, is the way it rides.

98
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:35,185
The BMW manages to be sharp
AND comfortable, this doesn't.

99
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:38,385
It's hard, really hard.

100
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,905
When you're driving normally,

101
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:45,425
a sports saloon should soothe your
brow, not attack it with scissors.

102
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:52,265
To sum up then, the Lexus does
a lot of things brilliantly,

103
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:56,425
but the BMW, that does
everything brilliantly.

104
00:07:56,425 --> 00:08:00,425
In the past you had to be
a cock to buy one,

105
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,065
now though, you're
a cock if you don't.

106
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,625
APPLAUSE

107
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,985
INAUDIBLE

108
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:18,025
Let me make sure I've
got this absolutely right.

109
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,745
Cocks are now driving Audis?

110
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,585
Yes, I had one right up
my chuff this morning on...

111
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,865
LAUGHTER

112
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:26,745
What?

113
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:30,625
..on the A3 on the way
down, it was this close.

114
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,825
What do you have to be
to drive a Lexus? A dork.

115
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:39,625
So, to drive an AMG Mercedes you'd
have to be an arse, a big arse?

116
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,745
A big, tall, actually
slightly fat arse?

117
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:45,625
LAUGHTER
You're being Captain Horrid.

118
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,105
Yes I am. We haven't time to explore
this new trait of your personality

119
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:52,465
because it is time now to put
the IS F round our track

120
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,705
which of course means handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

121
00:08:55,705 --> 00:09:00,465
Some say that one of his
eyes is a testie...

122
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,665
LAUGHTER

123
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:06,905
..and that he was turned
down for I'm A Celebrity

124
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:10,225
because people have heard of him.
LAUGHTER

125
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:12,945
All we know is,
he's called The Stig.

126
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,025
And away he goes...
TYRES SCREECH

127
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:18,025
..in a biblical pool of smoke

128
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,025
and strangely that was from
the exhaust, not the tyres.

129
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:24,345
Even The Stig can't access that top-
shelf torque straight off the line,

130
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:27,745
but he can torture the tyres,
by the sounds of it.

131
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,025
MORSE CODE BLEEPS

132
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,945
Stig, he's still listening to Morse,

133
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:39,345
no idea what it's saying, but
I'm sure the internet will tell us.

134
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,585
Heaved it round Chicago,
now coming up to Hammerhead...

135
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:45,745
Squirming under braking, that gives
away the sheer weight of this thing,

136
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,145
perhaps because of that
5-litre V8 up front.

137
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:50,425
Now, that's tyre smoke!

138
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,585
I suspect this car could do with

139
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,905
a proper limited slip diff -
an electronic one.

140
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,585
MORSE CODE BLEEPS

141
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:01,745
Labouring his way up
all eight gears...

142
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:05,345
through the Follow-through, that's
looking fast through the tyres.

143
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:11,185
Two corners left, all the way down
the box again, getting sideways.

144
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:14,025
This really isn't as easy
as the M3 to drive quickly.

145
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,985
Now, Gambon, still looking
frisky and across the line.

146
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,385
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

147
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:24,345
Not a bad time.
Not a bad time.

148
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:31,145
Ready... It did it in 1:26.9,

149
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:32,745
so that's pretty quick.

150
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:35,385
Look at that, about the same
as a Lotus Exige.

151
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:40,305
The thing is though, earlier on
we put the BMW round.

152
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:46,625
It did it in 1:25.3, look at that!

153
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,265
It's the same as a
convertible Lamborghini Gallardo.

154
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:52,745
So, really we have a
Top Gear top tip.

155
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:57,665
Um, if you are an employer and you
take someone on who has a Lexus,

156
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,585
he'll be late for work

157
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,305
and he'll be a dork
when he gets there!

158
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:03,585
LAUGHTER

159
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:06,185
Unless you employ somebody
with an AMG Mercedes,

160
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,745
in which case they'll arrive
in a cloud of smoke

161
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:11,065
and then they'll be an
arse when they get there.

162
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:14,185
Speaking of which...
LAUGHTER

163
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:17,145
Nothing... It just came up in
conversation.

164
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,385
Are you wearing that for a bet? No.

165
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,585
No? No.

166
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,385
LAUGHTER

167
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,345
Right, shall we do the news?
Yes, we'll ignore that.

168
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,265
Let's kick off with this Infinity,

169
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:30,785
a new brand to the UK and it is
to Nissan what Lexus is to Toyota,

170
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,785
a kind of posh version of it.

171
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:35,825
They are coming over with

172
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:39,825
This is a V6 engine,
3.7-litre convertible.

173
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,265
All I want to know about this car

174
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:46,345
is why have they styled it to
look like the Lexus SC 430? Look!

175
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:50,905
That is undoubtedly the most
vile and hideous car ever made,

176
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,025
why make it look like that?

177
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,145
It is vile but it's
completely academic

178
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,985
because you never see one of
those in the real world.

179
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:01,185
You do, go to Cheshire,
they're everywhere! Are they?!

180
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:04,305
They're always being driven
by those women that have faces

181
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,905
actually made from leather.

182
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,345
LAUGHTER

183
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:10,585
Whenever I see them,
those women driving nice cars,

184
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:14,345
I really do want to stop them and
just ask, I want to beg, "Why?!

185
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:16,905
"Why did you buy that," because
it's an expensive car.

186
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,985
It's like getting every
travel brochure,

187
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:22,505
choosing your summer holidays next
year, 180 countries you could go to

188
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,825
and saying, "Yes, Germany." Yes!
LAUGHTER

189
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:29,465
"Not Mauritius, not Mauritius,
Dortmund is where I want to go."

190
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:32,345
It's that bonkers a choice,
it's that terrible a car.

191
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:35,705
The thing is about the Infinity...
Can we see the Infinity again?

192
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:40,185
That is actually just a Nissan
with a posh name.

193
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:42,305
It's like people who buy
a normal house

194
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,705
in the middle of a road, number 22,
but then give it a name.

195
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:47,185
No, a friend of mine did that.

196
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,585
He lived in the Midlands,
I think it was Lichfield.

197
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:53,625
It was 22 Acacia Avenue or whatever
it was and he called it "Sea View".

198
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,145
LAUGHTER
That's quite good!

199
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:58,145
Hey, hey, you know Porsche
is always saying

200
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,145
they don't ever really
restyle the 911

201
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:04,345
because they want to maintain
that sense of purity and tradition?

202
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:08,345
Yes. I don't think that's true. I
think they don't restyle it properly

203
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:12,225
because they can't, they have no
idea at Porsche how to restyle cars.

204
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,105
If you think about it, the 4-wheel
drive, the Cayenne, isn't it?

205
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:18,705
The Cayenne looks like a 911 that's
been reversed into a shed, yes?

206
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:21,945
And now, they're doing a
four-door of a car, OK,

207
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:25,785
which is called the Panamera, which
sounds like a hat, OK. Look at this.

208
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:29,545
It's just woeful. It is.
JAMES COUGHS

209
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:32,025
All right? Excuse me, no,
I'm going to die now.

210
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,425
Is it this, has this
made you feel sick?

211
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:35,745
It's exactly what it is,

212
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:38,505
I looked at that and it nearly
killed me, it's so awful.

213
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:41,105
Can I make an observation
about this car? What?

214
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:43,545
That is an Austin Maxi.

215
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:47,945
Do you remember the Maxi? Have we
got a picture of the Austin Maxi?

216
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:49,945
Look... It is!
LAUGHTER

217
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,705
It is! That is an Austin Maxi.

218
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:53,785
A Porsche Maxi.

219
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,785
The only difference is, of course,

220
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:59,265
that the Porsche Austin Maxi
is going to be nearly £90,000.

221
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:01,225
What gets me is who's
going to say of this,

222
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:04,185
"No, I don't want the
Maserati Quattroporte"?

223
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:07,025
Or you know that four-door
Lamborghini we had in last week?

224
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,345
Who's going to say,
"No, I want this instead"?

225
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:11,385
That's like being offered the
choice of marrying two women,

226
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:16,785
one of them unkind and ugly and the
other beautiful with a heart of gold

227
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,065
and saying, "No, I want
the brutal minger."

228
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:21,545
LAUGHTER
That's is the brutal minger!

229
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,265
JAMES COUGHS

230
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:27,665
Excuse me. Are you a nurse?

231
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,265
I am. Could you come and kill him?

232
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:30,865
LAUGHTER

233
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:34,665
Have you got anything
in your bag which is like lethal?

234
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,265
Seriously.

235
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:38,465
I've got a syringe and some water.

236
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,105
A syringe and water?

237
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,865
Come on, I've got worse.

238
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:44,305
All she needs is a syringe and some
water to kill someone -

239
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,625
is she a nurse or a ninja?
LAUGHTER

240
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:51,705
Anyway, I want that to go away.
I don't want to see that car

241
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,105
ever again as long as I live.

242
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,665
And I never will, because
nobody's going to buy one.

243
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,705
What are we going to talk about now?
I'm going to talk about this.

244
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,705
I went on the internet this week...
Oh, God.

245
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:04,305
I thought you'd stopped doing that.
No, no, no.

246
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,865
Here's the clip that I found.

247
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:09,465
A man in a Range Rover,
and pause it there.

248
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:12,145
Now, James, what do you
suppose happens next?

249
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:15,505
Well, as I see it, he's
going to crash into the post.

250
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,945
Post? No, he'll skid into
the wheelie bin there.

251
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:21,585
The wheelie bin, OK. Play the rest
of the tape, let's see who's right.

252
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:24,945
Oh!
LAUGHTER

253
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:28,745
APPLAUSE

254
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:32,065
It's just unreal.
I bet that made him jump.

255
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,345
He's standing there going,

256
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,065
"How the hell did that happen?"
"The world's gone wobbly,

257
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,265
"I've driven through it!"

258
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:41,265
If you look, there is no
way of telling, is there?

259
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:44,505
I'd do that now, having just seen
him do it. I'd still drive in.

260
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:48,025
I'd park on this one -
I bet it's the same thing.

261
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:52,265
OK, listen. I was driving a
Volvo XC60 this week, the new one.

262
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,665
The front of it is all full of
radars and sensors,

263
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,865
cos the idea is you
can't actually crash it.

264
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:59,505
Don't ask me how. Anyhow,
I was thinking,

265
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,625
there must be a simpler
solution to not crashing.

266
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,465
And I think I have come up with it.
Oh, God.

267
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,505
For once, bear with me on this, OK?

268
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:13,385
Just imagine if you had on
the front of your car a magnet,

269
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:17,905
everybody has one, with the
north pole facing out, OK?

270
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:20,585
You'd come along,
head-on accident...

271
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,985
LAUGHTER

272
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:27,145
You could never have a
head-on crash.

273
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:30,625
This is one of these windy-up cars,
so I won't even cheat. Ready?

274
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,465
See?
LAUGHTER

275
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:37,425
You see?
APPLAUSE

276
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:41,825
Have I just solved road safety?
Apart from the big cliff.

277
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:44,785
you're right about that.

278
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:47,785
Listen... Backing
from Captain Maths!

279
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:51,945
No, but the only slight drawback is
on full-size cars you would need

280
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,985
extremely, I mean EXTREMELY
large magnets.

281
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,945
Yes, we'd get
extremely large magnets.

282
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:59,265
You haven't thought this through.
At some point there'll be...

283
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,745
Here's a car parked
at the traffic lights,

284
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:04,905
and you'll come up behind
to the other end of his magnet,

285
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:07,705
and that's his north pole,
and you're gonna have a crash.

286
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:10,265
Because...
No, that's his south pole.

287
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:13,025
Yes, south to north,
bang, you're going to have a crash.

288
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,705
Utterly, utterly hopeless.

289
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:18,465
We'll all be killed.
These are small details, OK?

290
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,625
LAUGHTER
Think of the fuel-saving.

291
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,025
Seriously... ..What? ...A puncture.

292
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,345
Why wouldn't I get a puncture?
INDISTINCT

293
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,425
Ah-ha!

294
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,625
The man here doesn't look bright...

295
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,105
LAUGHTER

296
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:34,705
He's just pointed out, you could be
driving along, every screw and nail,

297
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,865
doonk, doonk, you'd
never get a puncture.

298
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:39,545
Along with the manhole
covers and signposts!

299
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:42,265
And the railings.
And traffic lights.

300
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:47,225
And dogs with metal collars on.
And skips. You are just nit-picking.

301
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:51,305
I will admit there are one or
two things I need to address.

302
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,385
What, like the laws of
physics, for example?

303
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:56,625
Yes. But I will find a way
around them, don't you worry.

304
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,985
OK, you know Boris Johnson,
Mayor of London?

305
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:03,425
When he was voted in he said he
was going to review what sort of

306
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:07,305
buses we used in the capital
city of the United Kingdom.

307
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,065
As Jeremy pointed out last series,

308
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,385
Boris has been rather
faffing about on this one.

309
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:14,945
So we figured it was about time
for some Top Gear help.

310
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:17,545
Whether he wanted it or not.

311
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,985
To find out what sort of bus
is best for a busy city,

312
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:26,705
obviously you should form some
committees and a focus group,

313
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,345
and then do some intensive
studies into running costs,

314
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:33,825
safety, passenger usage
and environmental impact.

315
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,705
But all of that takes time.

316
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:37,865
So instead we're going to sort this

317
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:41,265
using the ultimate crucible
of excellence, motor sport.

318
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:45,305
For anything on four wheels, this
is the white heat of the anvil

319
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:47,465
of the spearhead of evolution.

320
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:50,825
If you want to improve the breed,
you go motorsport.

321
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,705
Second is the first of the losers.

322
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:56,945
You have to win to win, etc etc.

323
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:02,945
Our testing ground is here,
Lydden Hill circuit in Kent.

324
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:07,585
A place often described as
the Monza of southern England.

325
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:10,265
By people who've
never been to Monza.

326
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:13,865
It's normally a rallycross circuit,
so it is a challenging mix

327
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:18,505
of hairpins and fast sweepers,
tarmac and loose gravel.

328
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,025
Much like central London, in fact.

329
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:25,545
So, let's meet the candidates
for the next London bus.

330
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:30,505
Representing the double decker,
a 1987 Leyland Olympian.

331
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:36,425
Representing the single decker,
we have a 1993 Dennis Dart.

332
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,625
Then, on behalf of the
current London champion,

333
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,785
we have the Mercedes 0305G.

334
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,985
This of course is a bendy bus,

335
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,145
and that means it'll probably spend
the day causing crashes

336
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,385
and bursting into flames
for no obvious reason.

337
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:52,865
Which is why we've got two of them.

338
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:58,425
Finally, representing
the compact hopper bus,

339
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,745
we have a 1997 MetroRider.

340
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:06,625
Now, because there is so much
at stake here,

341
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,225
we can't leave the driving
to any old bus driver.

342
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,625
So we brought in our old friends,
the touring car drivers.

343
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:17,385
Their precise and delicate touch

344
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:21,305
certainly got motorhome racing
off to a great start last year.

345
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:27,105
So, please welcome touring car
legend, Anthony Reid.

346
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:30,585
Touring car legend, Matt Neal.

347
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:39,985
And, for the second time tonight,
hairdressing legend, Tom Chilton.

348
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,185
To be honest, they're not that good
on passenger usage per mile,

349
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,745
but if you want to sort out
the other important bus stuff -

350
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:50,585
understeer, lift off,
oversteer, then these are your men.

351
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:55,025
Each driver went for their
preferred mount,

352
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:58,305
leaving me with
the blue and yellow bendy bus.

353
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:01,505
Last time this got together
with the motor homes, to be honest,

354
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:04,425
it all degenerated
into a bit of a demolition derby.

355
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:10,585
But this time, because we
carrying out important research,

356
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:15,065
they have promised me
absolutely no contact. Yep...

357
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,185
BUZZER SOUNDS

358
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:29,385
This is it. We are off.
Let the investigations begin.

359
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:36,185
Interestingly, both bendy buses,
57 feet in length,

360
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:40,545
but his is mid-engined,
mine is rear.

361
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:42,865
So a good race should
sort out whose is best.

362
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:48,665
'True to their word, the touring car
racers avoided body contact...

363
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:50,785
'..for at least half a lap.'

364
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:02,385
This is their sensitive touch?!
That cost me a mirror.

365
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:08,185
Thinking about it, we have missed
one thing out on this test.

366
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:09,705
Cyclists.

367
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:13,025
We should have had bicycles
on the circuit,

368
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,065
perhaps being peddled
by bus drivers.

369
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:21,305
'After two or three laps,

370
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:23,745
'I realised that finding
the best bus

371
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:26,185
'would be harder than I thought...

372
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:30,465
'Because all of them had
their good and bad points.'

373
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:36,185
The double-decker, aluminium body,
air suspension,

374
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:38,985
it should
have potential here on the track.

375
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:43,185
But it is compromised in other ways.

376
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,545
No low floor means poor
disabled access.

377
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,585
Wow, look at the single-decker go!
What a manoeuvre!

378
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,665
I don't believe it!

379
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,425
That was majestic.

380
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,265
Mind you, he's only licensed
to carry 24 seated,

381
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:10,825
And that is where the bendy boss
comes in. Licensed to carry 98.

382
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,785
And the seating is pretty flexible.

383
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:22,265
'So, with all the buses
putting forward a good case,

384
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:25,745
'if we were to find a winner,
we'd have to turn up the wick.'

385
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:38,225
A common, everyday scene
from London streets.

386
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,745
This is important work.

387
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,705
'First to suffer was the little
hopper,

388
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:51,985
'which didn't do too well in the
"I'm a bus driver, when I pull out,

389
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:54,425
'"I never use my bloody mirrors"
manoeuvre.'

390
00:23:56,825 --> 00:24:01,465
Aww, that's an evil move being
pulled on the diddy hopper there.

391
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:04,225
'Thankfully, nobody would
dare mount such an attack

392
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,545
'on a bus as big as mine.'

393
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,825
Where did he come from,
you bloody idiot?!

394
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:23,785
'I was limping and frankly,
the other bendy

395
00:24:23,785 --> 00:24:25,825
'was scoring low
on passenger comfort.'

396
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:30,985
'The final lap.'

397
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:34,025
Oh, my word.
Double-decker coming through.

398
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:36,665
'The last few corners
were a straight dual

399
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:39,545
'between the single-decker
and the double-decker.

400
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:42,105
But then...'

401
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,985
Ignore that bit.

402
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:53,025
Just tell the mayor that that was
a crash test or something.

403
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,545
'Our investigation was complete.'

404
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,905
We have been thorough,
comprehensive.

405
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:01,505
I've just driven over that man's
bonnet,

406
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:03,945
but we can announce
a decision is made.

407
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:06,385
'The best bus for London
and any other city

408
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:12,025
'is the good old single-decker,
because it's quick.'

409
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:15,065
I think what we should do now is
collate all those findings

410
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,425
and get them straight
to the mayor's office.

411
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:19,625
Yeah. Well done, everyone.

412
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:24,305
Well done, you. Nobody could
accuse us of dumbing down!

413
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:26,945
No, that was serious work.

414
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:30,185
Just highbrow research
from start to finish.

415
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:33,985
I honestly thought that was
like watching Melvyn Bragg

416
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:36,425
presenting the Open University.

417
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:39,905
No, I think we covered all the
bases there. It was thorough.

418
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,425
Now, we have to move on.

419
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:42,745
You see, this week,

420
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:46,625
my guest is quite simply
that bloke off Grand Designs.

421
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,545
Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin McCloud.

422
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:53,345
I've waited a long time.

423
00:25:53,345 --> 00:26:00,305
Have a seat. Thank you. Nice suit!
That one!

424
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:05,745
Ladies and gentlemen, a genuine
car fan has come among us today.

425
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:08,305
Yeah, it's a guilty secret I have,
but it's true.

426
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:11,665
It's a bit annoying cos I'm going
to want to spend most of the time

427
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:15,105
talking about interior design,
you'll want to talk about cars.

428
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:18,625
I don't know much about interior
design, so let's talk about cars.

429
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:22,705
Looking through all the notes
and your past interests and so on,

430
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:25,345
do you have a passionate
interest in V8s?

431
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:28,985
Yes, my father was an engineer.
I'm looking at one now.

432
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:32,465
You are, I was going to say, is this
coffee table turning you on?

433
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,785
The Porsche.
I'm stroking it with my toe.

434
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:38,305
Looking at past cars you've had...
Yes.

435
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,625
..the SL Mercedes, V8,
Maserati Coupe, V8,

436
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:46,145
Ferrari 355, V8, TVR Cerbera, V8...

437
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:48,905
Now, look, the V8 thing.
Food blender.

438
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,785
Oh, my V8 food blender? Yeah, yeah.

439
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:52,985
Which was frankly
an out-and-out failure!

440
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,225
LAUGHTER

441
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:55,985
The blades need a bit of work,

442
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:59,945
but it's already being converted
as we speak into a vacuum cleaner.

443
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:01,385
LAUGHTER

444
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:04,625
I think what you should do
is combine the two great male

445
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:09,385
obsessions and get a V8
to power a power shower.

446
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:13,865
Power shower? No, male obsession
is internet pornography, surely?

447
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,705
I don't know how you can have a
V8-powered internet porn connection.

448
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:18,785
Maybe you could.

449
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:23,265
Maybe that would deliver everything
that anybody's ever dreamed of.

450
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:26,225
So where does this love of
how things work come from?

451
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:28,705
My father was an engineer,
a rocket scientist.

452
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:30,265
And so, I... What, a real one?

453
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:33,425
A real one. Really? He designed
stuff that went into space.

454
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:37,145
I grew up with a house where
the boiler was always in pieces,

455
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,185
there was always a car in
the middle of the kitchen in bits.

456
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:43,265
I have serviced most of my own cars.

457
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:45,545
I've done lots of bioethanol
petrol mixes,

458
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:47,385
experimented with fuels on them.

459
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:50,945
But I'm interested in this idea
that you can service your own cars.

460
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:53,865
Of course you did have a TVR? Yeah.

461
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:57,225
The point about the Cerbera was
that it was a kit car in reverse,

462
00:27:57,225 --> 00:28:02,305
in as much as you bought a new shiny
object and you parked it at home

463
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,385
and slowly it, sort of,
disassembled itself!

464
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,785
LAUGHTER
The gear lever would come off.

465
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:13,545
It did drive me up a slope once
with the headlamps and the washer

466
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:18,065
and the windscreen wipers and the
horn all working at the same time...

467
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,945
It drove itself! With none of them
actually turned on?

468
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:22,905
No, it turned them all on by itself.

469
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:24,465
LAUGHTER

470
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:26,065
Have you ever had a Saab?

471
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:27,425
I have had two Saabs.

472
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:30,865
I had a Saab, a big estate Saab
that ran on bioethanol.

473
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,185
And years and years ago

474
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:35,345
my second car was a big orange,
jelly mould Saab, the 95.

475
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:38,665
Oh yes. You must have done.
You can't be a designer without that

476
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:41,585
A quarter-inch plate,
that car, it's fantastic.

477
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:43,225
You could crash into anything,

478
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,705
and you'd leave a Saab-shaped
impression in it!

479
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:50,585
Did you ever try? Yes!
I had it in my 20s, in London.

480
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:53,265
I'd sit and read the paper
in the car on a hill

481
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,945
and suddenly find myself
glued to a Cortina.

482
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,345
LAUGHTER

483
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:59,905
They're not architects' cars.

484
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,385
You're a designer
but same sort of thing.

485
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:04,905
You are interested in
the aesthetics? Of course.

486
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:07,385
I'm interested in efficiency,
in design,

487
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:10,225
I'm interested in aesthetics,
in ecology.

488
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:14,065
I've gone green now...
And don't smirk!

489
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:17,345
I was gonna say... My one ambition
today was to come here

490
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:20,185
and use the word eco on Top Gear!

491
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:22,265
Let's listen. Say it again. Eco.

492
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:23,985
CROWD BOOS

493
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:26,305
There was a ripple of applause
from the corner!

494
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:29,865
Eco! You call it the green bug.
We think of it as a disease.

495
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:31,665
LAUGHTER

496
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,985
I tell you what really
excites me, is the idea that...

497
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:36,785
Actually, when we use the word, eco,

498
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:39,785
it is useless calling cars
eco cars or houses eco houses.

499
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:45,305
The reason I love Aston Martins
is that the Aston is beautiful.

500
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:48,945
They are beautifully put together.
They're beautifully made.

501
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:50,985
98% of them ever made are still
on the road

502
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:52,625
and how sustainable can you get?

503
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,865
It's the business of having
an Aston Martin

504
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:57,425
and keeping it in the garage
and it lasts 50 years,

505
00:29:57,425 --> 00:30:00,185
and you only drive it
a 1,000 miles a year...

506
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:03,665
A Toyota Prius with nickel batteries
is going to do more damage,

507
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:06,665
if you believe that cars are
damaging the environment.

508
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,305
Which I do. Which you do.

509
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:12,785
And you are entitled to come here
with this opinion,

510
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:15,585
and not be killed in any way!
LAUGHTER

511
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:18,705
I'm just going to figure out my
exit route from the studio now.

512
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:24,145
Exactly! Now, I want to get on to
your lap, if I may. Ah, yes, yeah.

513
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:26,385
How was it? It was addictive.

514
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:29,825
I mean, I've never done it before,
and I'm going to do it again lots.

515
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:31,865
Really? You enjoyed it? I loved it.

516
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:34,585
I never thought you'd get
so much pleasure out of

517
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,705
a little one point...
Whatever it is.

518
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:41,265
Who'd like to see how Kevin got on?
ALL: Yes!

519
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,745
Here we go, Kevin. Let's see.

520
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:44,825
TYRES SQUEAL

521
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,705
Tame that wheel spin nicely.

522
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:50,625
Oh, my God. Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

523
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,585
You actually looked terrified.

524
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:56,425
That was a little dab of brakes
there, halfway through the corner.

525
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:58,385
Keep the front in check.

526
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:01,745
It looks so tame.
It looks so tame here.

527
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:06,625
as you're making out.

528
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,825
That's well done.

529
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:11,785
Aww, baby, I think it's gonna hurt.

530
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:16,305
Do you ever actually blink?
You haven't blinked as...

531
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:18,465
Ooohhhh....

532
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,625
I've never seen
countryside move so fast.

533
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,105
Still haven't blinked.

534
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:30,025
I have only one devout wish,

535
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:32,625
and that is to beat Terry Wogan.

536
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:39,025
You couldn't get much
closer to those! Come on, baby.

537
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,225
Now, that looks brilliant...

538
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:45,265
I've never seen that done better.

539
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:48,665
That was cos I was driving at
15 miles per hour. No, you weren't.

540
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:53,105
That second to last
corner was phenomenal.

541
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:55,345
LOUD APPLAUSE

542
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,625
And no spins.

543
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:02,625
I've never seen anyone do that...

544
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:07,225
Normally, people cut the corner
or go too far and run wide.

545
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,185
It was the penultimate one, though.

546
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:12,305
I'd finally got my act together
by the ultimate corner.

547
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,665
That's the trouble. Anyway, to
establish how fast you went round.

548
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:18,745
There's the board. Where...

549
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:21,705
I can't believe it. This moment,
I've been dreaming of.

550
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,345
I'm looking, as you can see,
at the bottom 10.

551
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:28,025
Well no, you went faster than that.
OK, so maybe Keith Allen?

552
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:29,825
Where's Keith Allen? He's there.

553
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:33,065
He's down there. So, dry track.

554
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:35,025
You did it in 1 minute..

555
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:39,625
..40... Yes?

556
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:44,665
5...
CROWD DRAWS BREATH

557
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:47,345
What's the fastest ever? 45.8.

558
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:54,225
APPLAUSE

559
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:57,985
I've got a new career. Unbelievable.
That's Cowell.

560
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,865
No!

561
00:33:02,505 --> 00:33:04,705
The eco-mentalist!

562
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:08,785
I can't believe it! That's amazing.
And actually...

563
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:15,705
We actually have...
The specific time is 1.45.87.

564
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:19,225
Yeah, yeah. Jay Kay was 1.45.83.

565
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:21,665
So you're only
half a second off Jay Kay.

566
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:24,945
I don't know how you're going to
be able to live this down, Jeremy.

567
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:27,585
That you have the eco-mentalist
come on the show and...

568
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:28,985
LAUGHTER

569
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:33,385
Thank God for Jay Kay! If the
eco-mentalist had gone to the top...

570
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:37,065
You're really... You're barking up
quite literally the wrong tree.

571
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:40,505
You have a natural gift for it,
there can be no doubt about it.

572
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:43,265
That's an amazingly quick time.
I can't say any more.

573
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:44,585
I'm a bit overcome.

574
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:48,625
You can hold your head up high.
Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin McCloud.

575
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,145
APPLAUSE

576
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:56,305
And now, I'm very,
very pleased to announce

577
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:59,225
that it is time for the Cool Wall.
Yeah.

578
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:02,025
CHEERING

579
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:05,625
I'm going to start.
You're going to start? I am.

580
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:10,665
This is the Nissan GTR. There's
loads of technical reasons why

581
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:13,665
it's so clever and brilliant,
but the simple facts are,

582
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,745
it is faster round the Nurburgring
than the Porsche 911 Turbo.

583
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:20,745
And it is half the price. Which
means it is cool. No, listen.

584
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:24,705
When you're a kid, you want to
impress girls. You learn the guitar,

585
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:27,265
not a Casio keyboard.

586
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,345
No girl's interested in a man in...

587
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:31,945
All the buttons, very clever,
not cool.

588
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,105
That's a very good point,
but you don't have to explain it.

589
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:38,345
You just get in and drive it
like a proper car.

590
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:41,905
So, what are you driving these days?
A Nissan... Right. Thank you.

591
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:46,825
Uncool. Now, may I just do this one?
Please. This is the new Sirocco.

592
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:48,905
Basically underneath,
it's a Golf GTi.

593
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:52,705
You pay £100 more for the Sirocco,
and you get a bit less practicality.

594
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:54,145
And that's a good thing.

595
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:57,865
Who here married their wife because
she was easier to wipe down?

596
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,025
LAUGHTER

597
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,785
What?!
That's why this is a cool car.

598
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:06,385
It might even be super-cool.
What do we think?

599
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:08,985
Hands up for super-cool?

600
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:12,305
Hands up for just cool.

601
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:13,785
They are wrong, you see.

602
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:18,825
They were momentarily correct.
I think that is a super cool car.

603
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:23,225
You? Alfa Romeo, the baby
Alfa, small Italian car.

604
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:26,105
Anybody here got an Alfa?
SOME IN AUDIENCE SHOUT OUT

605
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:29,545
There's two people. All the others
are in a cloud of steam on the A3.

606
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:34,665
That's cool! What's yours?
It's a Sportwagon. 156. Excellent.

607
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:38,665
And you didn't buy a BMW because?
I wanted an Alfa.

608
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:42,705
Because you see, he wasn't a cock.
And who else had an Alfa?

609
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:46,185
Can I just say, I'm his son,
and yes he has. What, he is a cock?

610
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,225
What do you drive?
I don't at the moment.

611
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:51,545
Clearasil will help with that,
by the way.

612
00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:53,145
LAUGHTER

613
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:56,785
Do you find him attractive?
I came with him. You came...

614
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:59,465
Is everybody all together?!
They brought me here.

615
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,265
What the hell accent's that?

616
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,905
LAUGHTER

617
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:04,985
American.

618
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:08,625
You're American? You can't be,
you're nowhere near fat enough.

619
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,345
LAUGHTER

620
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:12,785
You're American?

621
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:17,385
Welcome. Welcome to the
free world, you'll like it here.

622
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,665
Did everybody come in one group?

623
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,945
Where were we?
It's nice to have the colonies here.

624
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:25,665
This Alfa is called the Mito,
M-I-T-O,

625
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:30,465
because it was designed in Milan
and built in Torino, Turin.

626
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:33,385
I'm thinking, what if they'd
designed it in Twickenham

627
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:36,185
and built it in Attercliffe?
LAUGHTER

628
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:41,345
But they didn't and it's a
cool car, and that's an end of it.

629
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:43,585
Ah, wow, yes.

630
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:47,705
This is a Morgan AeroMax
and I have a question.

631
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:53,105
What kind of monumental moron
would spend 100,000 of their pounds

632
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:56,545
on a car as catastrophically ugly
as that, Richard Hammond?!

633
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:59,545
It is utterly beautiful
and it's as English

634
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:02,025
as the Malvern Hills
amongst which it's built.

635
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:04,945
It combines cutting-edge technology
with proper, traditional,

636
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:07,425
old-fashioned craftsmanship. Uh-hu.

637
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,465
Yes, in yours,
I couldn't help noticing

638
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:11,545
there was a wooden beam
down the roof.

639
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:15,025
Yes, it does have a beamed ceiling.
It does.

640
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,985
When you open up the handbook,
does it go, "Hear ye, hear ye!"?

641
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,345
What do we think of this car?

642
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:22,985
Uncool.

643
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:24,985
Cool.

644
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:28,385
I like it. Correct, well done, sir.
Stand up to him.

645
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:30,065
He's a big oaf, just keep going.

646
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:34,785
Would you be inclined to sleep with
this man if he had that car? No.

647
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,345
No. Would you sleep with him?

648
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:39,785
I have to. You have to?

649
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:41,265
LAUGHTER

650
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:51,625
Anyway, mate... I know. ..you know
the rules of the Cool Wall.

651
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:55,385
If we have one of the cars, it
goes there, and that's an end of it.

652
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:59,305
Our hands are now empty and you
think the Cool Wall is over. It is.

653
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:02,865
However, I have a theory that
the Jaguar XKR convertible

654
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,825
which we said last time we did this,

655
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:07,745
was the coolest car you can
buy in Britain today,

656
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:10,025
may have met its match.

657
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:12,065
Really? In this box here...

658
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:15,945
Yes, I really do believe this,
the Volvo V70 estate.

659
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,905
You're saying that's...? This is
now the coolest car in Britain.

660
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:23,265
I think you can tell

661
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:27,105
by the stunned silence in this room,
you can go too far and that's...

662
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,065
We know, and I'll whisper this
slightly,

663
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:32,945
people who like cars
are quite dreary.

664
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:35,145
Yeah. You go to a party,
you sit down,

665
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:38,665
and you say you are interested in
cars, you can see them moving away.

666
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:41,945
Yeah. It's like a club.
We are car bores. Terrible.

667
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,545
You can drive this great car

668
00:38:44,545 --> 00:38:47,185
but you can pretend
you're not interested in cars.

669
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:50,945
This is a box for carrying airbags.
Driven by men with beige trousers

670
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:53,785
and a problem stopping
when they've finished weeing.

671
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:57,425
It's just a dismal, dreary,
safety obsessed...

672
00:38:57,425 --> 00:39:01,225
It's like turning up on Bondi Beach
with a lifejacket already on.

673
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:04,145
Who is the worst-dressed man
in the world?

674
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:08,305
Our studio director, Brian. He comes
to work in a piece of faux sealskin,

675
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,265
with turquoise twine and you go,

676
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,625
"Brian, that's rubbish". He goes,
yeah, but it's Dolce and Chanel

677
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,345
or whatever.
As though that's an excuse.

678
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:20,585
This has no badge.
It's just a blue turtleneck jumper.

679
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:23,185
No, that has no badge,
just like it has no genitals.

680
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:25,345
It says, "I've given up,
give me my Volvo."

681
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:29,545
You're wearing Volvo shoes! No,
I'm not! They're not! You are!

682
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:32,905
Look, stout soles... They're
RM Williams, they're just boots!

683
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:35,985
Australian Volvos.
A little bit of a heel at the back.

684
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:37,705
LAUGHTER

685
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:43,105
You can tell a lot about
a man's car from his shoes.

686
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:46,065
All right then, what are they
if they're not Volvo ones?

687
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:49,745
They're Lancias. They can't
go through puddles.

688
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:51,505
You must be American.

689
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:52,545
LAUGHTER

690
00:39:53,785 --> 00:39:56,585
This is somebody with
a Nissan Micra.

691
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:58,625
Perfect.

692
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:01,505
And I'm guessing here...Jag.

693
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:03,865
A6. A6? God.

694
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:07,905
And then...oh my God!
What kind of an idiot?

695
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,985
Hello, James.

696
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,985
LAUGHTER

697
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,945
APPLAUSE

698
00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:21,065
I'm going to put this on the board.

699
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:25,825
I'm prepared to nail it
there if you go near it.

700
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:29,585
And I'm glad you're here, James,
because it's time to move on.

701
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:35,425
You see, this year, a motoring icon
is celebrating its 40th birthday.

702
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,065
Richard Hammond?

703
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:40,505
No, he's 38. Same as he was last
year, and the year before.

704
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,705
It's his birthday next week,
isn't it? It is. Then he'll be 38.

705
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:45,705
Yes, all right. Funny.

706
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:48,785
38 year old, Richard Hammond.
I am, thank you very much.

707
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:51,145
This motoring icon,
it's an important one.

708
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:54,705
To celebrate its birthday we had
to go somewhere really special.

709
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,385
To here, in fact, the Riviera.

710
00:41:01,385 --> 00:41:05,185
The legendary stretch of
coastline which for decades

711
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:07,625
has been the spiritual
home of Playboys,

712
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,905
movie stars and the jet set.

713
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:15,305
Which sort of makes it
the perfect place

714
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:18,065
for one of the all-time
great jet set cars.

715
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,625
The Ferrari Daytona.

716
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:35,025
It may take its name from a
racetrack in America, but trust me,

717
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:39,945
the Daytona is the absolute
essence of pure European supercar.

718
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:43,705
Drop-dead gorgeous looks,
stunning speed,

719
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:46,345
born in Italy.

720
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:50,585
I'm going to take it for a
drive now, from here, Portofino,

721
00:41:50,585 --> 00:41:55,865
which is a sort of Italian Whitby,
along the coast to Saint Tropez.

722
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:58,385
And even though it's 40 years old,

723
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:02,305
this is the perfect machine
for the job. No it isn't.

724
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:04,385
Yes it is. Well, it isn't.

725
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:06,665
Well, it just is.
That is why I'm here with it.

726
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:09,865
It isn't. Not any more.

727
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:11,465
What is?

728
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:15,665
Well, it's a boat. Not that one.

729
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:18,945
This one.

730
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,745
What we have here is
the XSR48,

731
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:28,305
or in plain English, the only way
to get around on the Riviera.

732
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:31,825
Not only is it stunning to look at,

733
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:35,545
it's also the world's fastest
diesel production boat,

734
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:38,785
with a top speed of 80 mph.

735
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:42,465
James, this is from the future.

736
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:44,985
But you're from 1948.

737
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,305
I know you think that,

738
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:49,505
but I like modern intelligent
engineering solutions.

739
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:50,585
And this is one.

740
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:52,705
This is a carbon fibre
racing hull

741
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:56,265
that's won World Powerboat
Championships, and then they've put

742
00:42:56,265 --> 00:43:00,745
some nice seats
and switches...sat nav...

743
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:05,865
James was adamant that this wasn't
just some rich man's vulgar toy.

744
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:09,505
So. What? Mr May...defend this.

745
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:13,865
Ah, yes. I was hoping you wouldn't...
That is a carbon fibre bog.

746
00:43:13,865 --> 00:43:15,505
Yeah, it is.

747
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:19,945
To prove to James, of all people,
that the old ways are the best,

748
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,505
I offered to race him
to Saint Tropez.

749
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:28,465
and me in the greatest
grand tourer ever made.

750
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:30,985
How much is that worth, by the way?

751
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:32,145
That one? £200,000.

752
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:36,545
One-and-a-quarter million. Chav.

753
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:38,665
Move your scrap off the harbour.

754
00:43:48,345 --> 00:43:51,225
The start of the race
wasn't exactly dramatic.

755
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:55,225
There was a three knot
speed limit in the harbour,

756
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:58,065
and my car was, well,
40 years old.

757
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:01,265
These old Daytonas take
a while to warm up.

758
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:03,385
You have to sort of
skip second gear,

759
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:05,705
go straight to third for a while,

760
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:07,745
until the gearbox
is up to temperature,

761
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,465
otherwise it sort of explodes.

762
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:17,225
While his 215-mile route was
40 miles longer than mine,

763
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:21,865
Hammond was convinced he'd be able
to maintain a higher average speed.

764
00:44:21,865 --> 00:44:26,305
But once my cabin cruiser
was out onto the open water,

765
00:44:26,305 --> 00:44:30,185
it would turn into a ferocious
powerboat racer,

766
00:44:30,185 --> 00:44:34,105
and for that reason,
I couldn't drive it on my own.

767
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:38,025
This is Peter, he's a many times
World Powerboat champion,

768
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:40,305
holds powerboat endurance records.

769
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:43,625
He's doing the tricky throttle and
trim stuff, I'm doing the steering.

770
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,065
And the nav.

771
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:47,945
How fast are we going? Nine knots?

772
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:51,625
Need to go in the right direction.
Going the wrong way at the moment.

773
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:52,905
It's that way? Yeah.

774
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:56,225
The autostrada beckoned.

775
00:44:57,425 --> 00:44:58,665
This is it.

776
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:08,985
The Daytona shouldn't really have to
defend its honour on its birthday.

777
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:12,265
But if James wanted a race,
he'd get one.

778
00:45:12,265 --> 00:45:16,945
4.4-litre Italian V12, unleashed.

779
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:18,545
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

780
00:45:22,145 --> 00:45:25,465
Right, here we go.
1600 shaft horsepower.

781
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:28,545
That's more than one-and-a-half
times a Bugatti Veyron.

782
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:33,265
That's 45 knots, so 50 mph.

783
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,505
And here's a tunnel.

784
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:40,825
I have to open the window a little
bit. I'm sorry about the wind.

785
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:44,865
Oh, that really is spine tingling.

786
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:50,185
70 mph across the water - that's
fabulous.

787
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:56,065
This boat has been
conceived like a supercar.

788
00:45:56,065 --> 00:46:01,385
very agile, has just enough trim

789
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,745
and creature comforts
to make it bearable.

790
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:08,265
But that's all, it is
a hardcore performance machine.

791
00:46:14,265 --> 00:46:17,825
My supercar doesn't
have a space-age khazi,

792
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:21,385
but it does have
infinitely more pedigree.

793
00:46:21,385 --> 00:46:26,225
What's odd about the Daytona,
is that if somebody says

794
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:30,105
to you "Ferrari Daytona"
even if you've never been in one,

795
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:33,985
if you've never even seen one,
it sounds right -

796
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:37,345
you know, with a name like
that, it's not going to be a minger.

797
00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:43,265
These days it takes many months and
many millions to design a new car.

798
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:47,105
seven days.

799
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:49,065
And just look at it.

800
00:46:49,065 --> 00:46:50,985
It's...

801
00:46:50,985 --> 00:46:53,745
absolutely sublime.

802
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:58,905
On the water, I had no time

803
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:02,345
for Hammond's misty-eyed
Mills and Boonery.

804
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:05,185
Old towns just racing by.

805
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:09,945
I know exactly what's
going on in Richard Hammond's mind -

806
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:16,665
he's got a romantic vision of
Sophia Loren and all those people.

807
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:18,225
But it's different now.

808
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:21,465
This place is full of Puffy
Dad and New York Hilton.

809
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:24,625
This is the modern way to do it.

810
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,465
As long as I'm not driving.

811
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:30,225
Your ten o'clock. Go behind it.
I've got it.

812
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:40,785
When it was launched in 1968,
the Daytona cost £10,000,

813
00:47:40,785 --> 00:47:43,545
making it the most
expensive Ferrari ever.

814
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:46,745
But not everyone thought
it was worth the money.

815
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,585
A year earlier,

816
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:52,745
Lamborghini had brought
out the Mura,

817
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,985
and that was impossibly
futuristic - mid-engined,

818
00:47:55,985 --> 00:47:58,665
really showing the way
forwards for supercars.

819
00:47:58,665 --> 00:48:02,905
And yet it was Ferrari,
with a front-engine car.

820
00:48:02,905 --> 00:48:06,065
In its day, it was seen
as a bit of a dinosaur.

821
00:48:06,065 --> 00:48:10,225
But the Daytona had the last laugh.

822
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:13,025
Because of the Mura's
front-end lift at high speeds,

823
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:14,465
it started to go very light,

824
00:48:14,465 --> 00:48:17,345
cos aerodynamically
it didn't quite work.

825
00:48:17,345 --> 00:48:19,305
It could never get near
its top speed.

826
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:20,945
This could. 174.

827
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:25,425
30 miles into my journey, the
water was getting a bit choppier,

828
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:28,265
but I wasn't worried.

829
00:48:29,585 --> 00:48:31,545
My feet here are suspended

830
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:35,465
with suspension units
off a Paris-Dakar racer,

831
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:38,465
and the technique, apparently,
is to relax

832
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:41,185
and let the seat take the battering.

833
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,145
Ohhh!

834
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:49,345
40 miles into my journey,

835
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:52,665
and something rather
perverse was happening.

836
00:48:52,665 --> 00:48:56,785
You're watching a man go through
the process of falling in love.

837
00:48:56,785 --> 00:49:00,745
It's not perfect,
this new love of mine -

838
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:04,305
I'd heard stories about incredibly
heavy steering, the clutch...

839
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:07,345
It's a bit like a big Italian
V12 engine truck.

840
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,705
And all those things are true.

841
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:12,425
The steering wheel is like
turning a hatch wheel

842
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:14,265
on a submarine
in a World War II film.

843
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:19,825
But the Daytona brings
back the glamour.

844
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:23,385
It reminds the Riviera what
the Riviera is all about.

845
00:49:26,785 --> 00:49:28,425
Oh.

846
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:29,905
Ohhh.

847
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:33,625
Wow!

848
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:38,545
On the ocean waves, life
was no longer so jolly.

849
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:41,825
My situation report -
it's becoming very choppy,

850
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:45,585
so we've had to reduce
our speed by ten knots or so.

851
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:51,145
And on top of that, the Dakar
seats weren't really helping.

852
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:52,745
Ahhh!

853
00:49:52,745 --> 00:49:55,145
Meanwhile, in the Daytona...

854
00:50:04,385 --> 00:50:06,145
Ahh!

855
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:09,185
Ahh! Ahh!

856
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:12,305
# I love you baby

857
00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:14,225
# And if it's quite all right

858
00:50:14,225 --> 00:50:20,025
# I need you baby, to warm the... #

859
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,665
You all right?

860
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:24,785
The camera was broken.

861
00:50:24,785 --> 00:50:29,185
I was broken, and the rough seas
had forced us down to 25 knots,

862
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:32,865
which meant that Hammond
would be roaring ahead.

863
00:50:32,865 --> 00:50:35,225
God, how much further is it?

864
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:36,945
About 100 nautical miles.

865
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:37,945
Ahh!

866
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:40,185
Marvellous.

867
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:44,945
I was indeed ahead, and as I neared
the French border,

868
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:47,585
I was now so in love
with the Daytona

869
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:50,185
that I might have
been babbling a bit.

870
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:54,345
Everything that it was, it still is.
When you drive one, here,

871
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:59,745
the mechanical interface between you
and it, it does take you into its...

872
00:50:59,745 --> 00:51:04,145
Mercifully, my doe-eyed
dribbling was then cut short.
POLICE SIREN

873
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,625
Oh, I think we've just been
pulled by the police.

874
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:12,185
Oh. Yes.

875
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:14,305
He's waving his arm
at the cameraman.

876
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,025
Er...

877
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:20,625
I think the rest of this film may
not look as good as the first bit.

878
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:25,825
I'm in a Daytona, and I'm wearing
shades, so I'm absolutely fine.

879
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:30,025
Despite Hammond's setback,
we had to keep going

880
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:34,785
as fast as our spines would allow,
if we were to stay in the race.

881
00:51:34,785 --> 00:51:38,825
We're back up to 41, 42 knots,

882
00:51:38,825 --> 00:51:42,825
which is twice as fast
as we were going half an hour...

883
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:48,065
It's much better
than a Max Mosley party.

884
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:57,465
The shades haven't worked.

885
00:51:57,465 --> 00:52:00,345
The Italian police weren't convinced

886
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:03,545
that we had rightful
possession of the Daytona.

887
00:52:03,545 --> 00:52:05,585
He wants the documents for the car.

888
00:52:08,945 --> 00:52:10,985
Documents for the car. Erm...

889
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:12,945
Sort of no.

890
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:14,545
I don't have them.

891
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:20,065
72 miles to go.

892
00:52:20,065 --> 00:52:22,425
How do we know when we're in France?

893
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:25,145
Does the sea become
even rougher, like the roads do?

894
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:28,345
Whoa, this is enormous! Ahh!

895
00:52:31,825 --> 00:52:33,065
This was bad.

896
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:35,745
My lead was now being destroyed.

897
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:37,985
Right, I'll go and sort this out.

898
00:52:49,745 --> 00:52:53,705
Right. They've told us to follow
them to the police station.

899
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,105
Out on the sea, my body may
have been taking a battering,

900
00:52:58,105 --> 00:53:02,545
but at least I didn't have
to worry about the rozzers.

901
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:05,465
SIREN WAILS
It's the police.

902
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:10,945
Oh, God, he wants to see documents.

903
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:16,905
Hello. Hello, how are you?

904
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:20,145
I've been stopped by the police.
You haven't.

905
00:53:20,145 --> 00:53:22,185
Yeah, the sea police.

906
00:53:22,185 --> 00:53:25,305
You know the Riviera thing,
the grand tour?

907
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:27,305
It's not what it was, is it? No.

908
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:30,185
It's not all Sophia any more.

909
00:53:30,185 --> 00:53:34,065
There's more paperwork
than Brigitte Bardot would
have been doing, and does.

910
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,945
Finally, we were both released.

911
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:46,785
Right. Saint Tropez.

912
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:50,145
But because the police had
stopped Hammond for much longer,

913
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:52,505
I had now closed the gap.

914
00:53:54,345 --> 00:53:56,785
We are now going past Monaco,
which is on the right.

915
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:59,185
50 nautical miles to go.

916
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:02,225
It's anybody's race.

917
00:54:02,225 --> 00:54:07,305
But then, at motorway speeds, it
soon started to go my way again.

918
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:12,465
The final stretch of motorway to
Saint Tropez. And I'm home and dry.

919
00:54:12,465 --> 00:54:18,945
I am probably the most low rent,
lowbrow chavvy urchin

920
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:22,465
ever to pedal one
of these along the Riviera.

921
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:25,025
Over 50 knots. Yeah.

922
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:39,465
With a considerable lead over James,
I was now off the motorway,

923
00:54:39,465 --> 00:54:43,505
on the A road, and just
20-odd miles from Saint Tropez.

924
00:54:46,465 --> 00:54:49,985
This is where the car
just comes alive now.

925
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,705
Yes, it's not a nimble, tiny,
lightweight sports car,

926
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:58,385
but it feels lithe and supple...

927
00:55:00,985 --> 00:55:05,265
And now, to complete
a truly excellent day,

928
00:55:05,265 --> 00:55:07,305
I shall win the race in the Daytona,

929
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:11,265
have a little gloat,
and then, I think, a beer.

930
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:17,065
Blister.

931
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,585
55.

932
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:21,905
60 knots there.

933
00:55:23,425 --> 00:55:25,865
I was getting really close
to Saint Tropez.

934
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,705
Land of glamour, here I come.

935
00:55:30,985 --> 00:55:33,945
Any minute, the Daytona
would be back

936
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:38,305
in the world of Mick and Bianca,
where it belongs.

937
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:41,145
60 knots there.

938
00:55:41,145 --> 00:55:44,785
I was now entering the
fabled town itself.

939
00:55:44,785 --> 00:55:49,865
Some of the signs and advertising
hoardings have got a bit bigger...

940
00:55:49,865 --> 00:55:53,025
But, you know, modern world.

941
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:57,705
OK, this is getting
a bit...snarly, now.

942
00:55:57,705 --> 00:55:59,465
Fair dos.

943
00:55:59,465 --> 00:56:04,185
The land you can see to the left,
we'll head for that now.

944
00:56:04,185 --> 00:56:07,985
As James powered on, I was
discovering that Saint Tropez

945
00:56:07,985 --> 00:56:10,025
wasn't quite what I imagined.

946
00:56:11,265 --> 00:56:13,905
CAR HORNS BEEP

947
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:16,425
Oh, no, this isn't right.

948
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:19,065
Holiday homes for sale.

949
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:21,065
Burgers...

950
00:56:21,065 --> 00:56:22,625
Traffic.

951
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:27,265
The car's still brilliant,
but the world's changed.

952
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:32,465
I was just 15 miles
from the finish line.

953
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:36,985
15 miles at 45 knots is 20 minutes.

954
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:41,785
Mini golf.

955
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:46,465
If this car overheats...

956
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:49,505
Well, it will. It's old and Italian.

957
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:55,345
On HMS Carbon Khazi, we were flying.

958
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,665
61.

959
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:58,465
Ha-hey! 65!

960
00:56:58,465 --> 00:57:02,385
Wa-hey! 2.5 miles to run.

961
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:06,625
As I got closer to Saint Tropez,
the traffic started moving again.

962
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:11,905
And I was heading for the
finish line - a bar in the port.

963
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:13,705
Speed humps.

964
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:17,065
Speed humps in a Ferrari Daytona,
that's not right!

965
00:57:18,545 --> 00:57:21,825
Less than a mile. Beer! Beer!

966
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:23,265
Got to be close now.

967
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:41,825
This is it.
Sorry, everybody, about the car.

968
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,745
He's not here.

969
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:47,305
Oh, hang on.

970
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:51,345
Yes, yes, yes.

971
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:55,025
It's a pleasure to win.

972
00:57:55,025 --> 00:57:56,105
Do you know what? What?

973
00:57:56,105 --> 00:58:01,305
I don't care. Because I said it
was the perfect vehicle for the job.

974
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:04,385
I didn't say fastest.
I said perfect. And it was.

975
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:07,145
I mean, look at it here.
It's all over it.

976
00:58:07,145 --> 00:58:10,025
It's beautiful.
Tell me you don't agree.

977
00:58:10,025 --> 00:58:11,025
Bloody gorgeous.

978
00:58:11,025 --> 00:58:12,065
HE LAUGHS

979
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:15,305
There's something I want to ask you.
What?

980
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,465
Can I drive the car back?
I'm broken.

981
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,505
Please? Yes, you can.

982
00:58:33,105 --> 00:58:36,025
APPLAUSE

983
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:44,145
Can I just say, James -

984
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,065
man, you were green.
LAUGHTER

985
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:49,265
No, that was just the camera.
I was black and blue.

986
00:58:49,265 --> 00:58:50,705
LAUGHTER

987
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:54,265
Can I just say how nice
it was that, for the first time,

988
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:59,545
I got the comfy, luxurious option,
and it was just magnificent.

989
00:58:59,545 --> 00:59:03,065
Can I just say how nice
it was that you two

990
00:59:03,065 --> 00:59:06,065
got to spend some time together,

991
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:07,825
on the Riviera, in the sunshine,

992
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:11,025
because next week, I get to drive

993
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:14,545
a mid-range Ford Fiesta
in Basingstoke.

994
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:18,065
LAUGHTER
On that bombshell, it's time
to end. Thanks for watching,

995
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:19,145
goodnight!

996
