1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,320
Tonight, James goes racing in Finland.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,480
Richard tries out the future of motoring in Japan.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,360
And I cut up some wood near Godalming.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,880
APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,280
Good evening, hello. Hello, everybody.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,240
And welcome to what's a great show for me.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,360
Er, but first, OK, every year, Toyota, which, as we know,

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,120
makes everything from Formula One cars, to big desert bashing off-roaders for the United Nations,

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,080
says to its engineers, "Have a couple of weeks off, let your mind roam free, go mad.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,840
"Let's see what you come up with."

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,800
And what they've come up with this year is, as I've been finding out, amazing.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,240
To get to this new car, I had to go to Toyota City, which is a whole city owned by Toyota.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
Imagine Birmingham, but full of Toyotas.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,160
The car was held here, in their brand new fortress of excellence headquarters.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
So things were looking good.

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,280
Right. Er, here it is.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,480
There's no getting away from it.

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,720
What we have here...

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,240
is a chair.

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,800
It is quite a special chair, though.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,160
They have said I can drive it today, here, in this room.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,480
But they are quite nervous.

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,880
Put it this way, this is usually an office full of people, and desks.

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,560
It's called the iReal

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160
and Toyota are hailing it as the future of personal transportation.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,320
'Before I drove it, though, I was taken to meet its inventor.'

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,640
He explained the concept and the philosophy.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,960
(HE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE)

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,480
And then he waited for me to ask a question.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,800
The trouble is, it's a while since Top Gear has done a grown-up interview.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,760
Will you make a big one for fat people?

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Interview over.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,360
I was briefed on how to use the toggles that control the throttle, the steering and the brakes.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,960
LONG TONE

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Wow! That's the horn?

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
'And then I was off.'

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,080
They are very polite people, so I'm saying this quietly.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,600
We have had something similar in the UK for some time.

39
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,840
Called a wheelchair.

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,000
However, when no-one was looking, I left the room and discovered that it was so much more than a wheelchair.

41
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,160
In this mode, for example, the electric motors are trolleying me along at walking pace.

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,560
But if I want to go faster, I just press this button,

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,280
and then it drops down into sleek aerodynamic mode.

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,880
Top speed then - 20 mph.

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,600
Now, most creations like this are built just to get some coverage on motor shows.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,320
But Toyota aims to put the iReal on sale in 2010, for around £2,000.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,280
The plan is that we'll be using them for short journeys around town.

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,000
And don't think OAP mobility scooter.

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,280
Hip young things will forsake walking entirely and cruise around in these

50
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,200
at night, downloading tunes to their iPod from their iReal.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,320
And these machines can talk to each other, too.

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Say I want a coffee. Well, I can tell the machine, coffee.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,880
It will then find the nearest coffee shop.

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,640
Tap it again and it will tell other iReal users

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,720
in the area that I'm going for a coffee, ask them if they want to join me.

56
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,440
So I'm now sending the message out to other iReal users, I'm off for coffee.

57
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
Come with me.

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,280
So you'll have a whole community of futuristic wheelchairs, going around

59
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,360
talking to one another, communicating about one another, like a sort of Stephen Hawking Facebook.

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,480
So, there you are.

61
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
The future of motoring.

62
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Unless you're fat.

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
APPLAUSE

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
Well done, you.

65
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
Unfortunately, that means you can't have one, I'm sorry.

66
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,440
What? Because I've got too much dignity? No, fatty, you couldn't fit in it!

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,440
I'm not interested.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm not bothered about that because Honda has made an even better car, right. Here it is.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,440
Now check that out.What?

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,720
How does that work?Well, basically, the silver things kind of

71
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,560
move up and down, and operate your legs, so, for going upstairs, or even walking on level ground.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
Now guess who this is aimed at?

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,360
Well, I'm guessing people with disabilities, with legs, that's a clever piece of technology.

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,120
No, wrong, wrong. It's aimed at the able bodied.But why?

75
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,880
It's the Rotherham Robot.

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,600
You don't even have to walk to the chip shop anymore. Now you just go on that.

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,120
Well, what's the point in that?No, hang on, no, how fast does it go?

78
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,920
Dunno.I was at school in Rotherham and I could have done with that in cross country.

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,560
If you had one of those, mate, I'd love to have the remote control for it.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,400
Captain Blur, look at him go!

81
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Ha ha ha. James, not in the scissor factory, you'll hurt yourself!

82
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,000
Can you kick yourself in the nuts? Yes!

83
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,320
Many times. Bang, bang, bang.

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,680
We're definitely going to get you one of those.With a remote control. Yeah. Now.

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,360
Geoff Hoon, OK, is the Transport Minister, yes?

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,280
And he announced this week he wants to have more average speed cameras on the roads,

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,640
because he says they're good for safety and they reduce fuel consumption.

88
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Now this is the same Geoff Hoon who, when he was Defence Secretary, said, and I'm quoting,

89
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,640
"We know that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction."

90
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,560
So he must be right about the speed cameras as well, then.

91
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,880
Yes, absolutely. I tell you what he's done.

92
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Because he claims he goes on the M1 a lot in those roadworks.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,440
You know, around Junction 6, 8, they've been doing them since 1850.

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,720
Forever. Yeah. Average speed cameras on that.

95
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,480
And he says, there you are, there's hardly been any accidents.

96
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,320
That's because the roads are jammed up!Not moving.

97
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
You can't crash when you're stationary.

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Soon, though, we'll have that Tory transport bloke.

99
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,320
Whose name is?Er...

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,880
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Theresa Villiers. Who?

101
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Theresa Villiers.That's a funny name for a bloke.Theresa..?

102
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,840
Villiers.Villiers. Tory Transport Secretary.

103
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
How can you know that?!

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,520
LAUGHTER

105
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,120
He is Theresa whatever.

106
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
Because there's only a finite amount of space for information in your head.

107
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,840
So if he's got that in it, what's come out?

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,120
How to dress properly?

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,760
Well done. Theresa... So actually this man's a woman.

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,920
That's fascinating because she hasn't really got any policies across that we've ever seen.

111
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Not that we've heard of.So we've had to come up with some of our own.

112
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,480
A better system than the average speed camera, OK? Look at this.

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,760
So, this is real, this is in Denmark.

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Loo what they're doing there.

115
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,600
LAUGHTER

116
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
It's brilliant.

117
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
Give me one good reason why that won't work?

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,400
You'd slow down.I'd slow right down.

119
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,120
Once again, Top Gear rides to the rescue of the nation.

120
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,840
Er, what's next, guys?Yes, I want to talk about Aston Martin, brought out a new car, it's the One-77.

121
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Here it is.

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,400
It's a striking looking thing, I know. And I think it goes to show

123
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,520
just how in tune with the times Aston Martin are.

124
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,480
It really is a car for the moment.

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,680
7.3 litre V12.

126
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,280
Oh, I'm glad about that.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,960
I must get 100 calls a day from people saying, I've got to have at least 7.3 litres and 12 cylinders.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,680
That's what I want right now. Very much of the moment, absolutely.

129
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
Price - £1.2 million.

130
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,880
Oh, good thinking(!)

131
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,760
Literally this morning, 30 people called up, "I'm not spending a penny more than 1.2 mill on my next car."

132
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,040
Aston have got it bang on, because as we know, the world

133
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,800
right now is full of stockbrokers desperate for something to blow their enormous bonus on, and there it is.

134
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,480
Pretty soon, Aston Martin are going to be selling more keyrings than they are cars.

135
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,640
Or making more money from them at least.

136
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Actually, they say that 100 potential customers have written to them to express their interest.

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,280
A hundred?

138
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,480
Yeah. Written in crayon, I suspect!

139
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,440
Great news.

140
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,840
They've done an off-road version of the Dacia Sandero.

141
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,240
Don't be fooled by the Renault badge. That's the Dacia, that baby.

142
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
What the hell are you on about?

143
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a Dacia.

144
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,840
It's a Dacia. I know it says Ren... I've just said that.

145
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Have you got a beard in your ears as well?

146
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Why do ginger people always grow more of it on their faces? They don't!They do.

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,040
Can I just ask?

148
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,480
You see the show last week, Will Young was the guest.

149
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,480
And I don't know if anybody else noticed, but when he first sat down, Jeremy was not really bothered,

150
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,680
he didn't know his name, didn't know what to talk about.

151
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,960
Next minute, he's going all doe-eyed looking at him, talking...

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,520
Talking about interior design.

153
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,640
"Oh, Will, I love cushions as well, I'm having my house done up. Really?

154
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,600
"You had a Mini? They're lovely, Will."

155
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
(HE HUMS THE TUNE TO LOVE STORY)

156
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
Jeremy's in love!

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,120
Are you suggesting Will Young is gay?

158
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, yeah, he is.

159
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
You're kidding!Yes.Is he?

160
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,640
To be honest, it was beautiful to watch.

161
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,160
It's just my gaydar doesn't work as well as yours, obviously.

162
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,000
That jacket. How big was the bet? Pretty big.OK.

163
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,160
I want you to look at this. This is a field of unsold Range Rovers.

164
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,520
Do you know why they're unsold? Nobody's got any money.

165
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,480
No, look at the colours.

166
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,680
That the range of colour that Land Rover does.

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:03,680
Now if you go down to Homebase to paint your walls, you can have any colour you like for a fiver.

168
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,320
Actually you can go in with that jacket, well, maybe not, you could go in with this shirt and

169
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,440
you could say, I want that colour, but a bit more orange, and they'd scan it with a thing.Exactly.

170
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,200
It's just not good enough. Look at this.

171
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,440
What I've got here, is the Audi brochure for the A8, a £70,000 car.

172
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
Range of colours available.

173
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,920
There you go.They've printed it in black and white!That's it, OK.

174
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,200
For an extra £2,400, they will paint it in any colour you like, from that chart.

175
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,160
That's just a spectrum.

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,960
Yes."Oh, sir wants it in visible light, does he?"

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,760
If you want your car in colour, £2,400.

178
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
If you want it in black and white. It's just ridiculous.

179
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,200
Well, what you need to do is buy a BMW X5. Because they understand this problem.

180
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
They have a special range which they call "BMW Individual,

181
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,360
"the higher your standards, the less room there is for compromise."

182
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,280
As an upshot of that, they offer it in...

183
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,200
Black, silver, silver, and black!

184
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,520
Gentlemen, you're getting all hot under your tweed collars about this.

185
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,400
Can I just say, I know a little bit about this, and the reason that car manufacturers...

186
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,680
They have to plan their paint colours years in advance because they have to test that each colour works

187
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,120
on the plastic of, say, the bumpers, and on the metal of the body, on those two materials...

188
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,000
Rubbish.They do.You say it has to be the same colour whether it's on plastic or metal?Yes.

189
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,480
No, because I was painting my sitting room the other day, and the

190
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,120
paint was exactly the same colour on the wall as it was on the wooden skirting board and on my hand,

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,360
and on the sole of my shoe, and subsequently on the stair carpet, all exactly the same colour.

192
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,200
I really want to show you this.

193
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,560
This is the Mercedes CLK. Can you see down here? These are soft-top fabric, OK?

194
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Do you want to know what it says underneath? Cabriolet only.Ah!

195
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,280
I want to have it on my hard top!

196
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,360
Now, in a couple of weeks, James is doing his first ever supercar test out on our track. OK?

197
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,120
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,840
Now, shall we be honest?

199
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,680
James is not the fastest driver in the world and nor does he have the best sense of direction.

200
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,520
So, before letting him loose on our track in a very fast car,

201
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
we thought he should get some training.

202
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,720
So we said to him, "James, go anywhere you like for your training, just not Finland."

203
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,480
Finland.

204
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,920
According to a study by Leicester University, the sixth happiest country in the world.

205
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,240
Finns also top the world league table for coffee drinking,

206
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,760
and they borrow more library books per head than any nation on Earth.

207
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,320
Which is all very interesting.

208
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,920
But it doesn't explain this.

209
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,960
There's a popular saying in motor sport - "If you want to win, employed a Finn."

210
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
This sparsely-populated country has produced more rally champions, seven in total,

211
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,360
than any other nation. It has also produced more F1 world champions than anywhere else.

212
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,360
So, what's going on up there?

213
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,680
One of the reasons for Finnish driving prowess must be

214
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
quite simply they take driving very, very seriously.

215
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,640
Right from day one.

216
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,480
This is Petkr.

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,160
He's not a hoodie in a stolen a car, he's having a driving lesson.

218
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,640
And, like everyone else in Finland, he has to spend six of them on a skid pan.

219
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,680
He will also have lessons driving in the dark, and it will be three years before he gets a full licence.

220
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,360
It's all very strict.

221
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,280
And it needs to be, to be honest, because this is a typical Finnish back road.

222
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,720
It's full of sudden crests and hidden dips.

223
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,120
So as you drive along, you need to know about power on, power off,

224
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,240
feeling the car go light and the grip disappear.

225
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,440
You're going to become a racing driver.

226
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,400
So, to find out how the Finns wrap all this up into one big

227
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,400
bundle of skill, I went for a drive with one of the locals.

228
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,640
Unfortunately, the only person I could find was a retired bloke.

229
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,120
Mind you, he's still quite sprightly.

230
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,760
COMMENTATOR: It's Hakkinen. He's going through the left-hander.

231
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,440
Mika Hakkinen won the F1 World Championship twice,

232
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,880
on both occasions, beating the most successful driver of all time.

233
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,360
Michael Schumacher said you were the only driver he really feared.

234
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,600
(HE LAUGHS)

235
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,480
So where did you learn car control? Because they say the Finns

236
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,240
have an instinct for it that other nations on Earth don't have. You can just do it.

237
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,440
We start doing this sport very, very young.

238
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
So automatically we learn car control.

239
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,480
I give you an example. If you put a British person

240
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,760
learning to play cricket when he's 25 years old, it's too late to understand the name of the game.

241
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,080
Are you thinking through these corners or do you just feel it and you know?

242
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,880
No, honestly, what's going on now, we are going really slowly.

243
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,080
Are we?Yeah.

244
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Sitting next to Mika, you get a fantastic demonstration of Finnish car control.

245
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,760
But, if I was to learn more, I couldn't just be a passenger.

246
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,960
Tomorrow, in the interests of science, though probably more

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,680
for your entertainment I suspect, the office has entered me in an amateur race on a rally circuit.

248
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,040
Thankfully, though, Mika has offered to train me up.

249
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,880
There's something else about Mika. He's not just helpful.

250
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,280
He's quite modest.

251
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,560
Last year, I went out with Jackie Stewart and he won the

252
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,440
World Championship three times only, instead of just two! Wow!

253
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,640
He taught me to be quite smooth and fast on a Tarmac circuit.

254
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,600
But can you teach me to be Finnish fast on a loose surface, do you think?

255
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,480
I can indeed.

256
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,600
The first and most important thing Mika would teach me

257
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,720
was a cornering move known as the Scandinavian flick.

258
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,080
And because he didn't want his mate's rally car

259
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,880
wrapped around a tree, we started off with some cones.

260
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,720
When we come with the car, how to trace the back end to touching all of these cones to find a perfect slide.

261
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,200
OK, this is how we get the back end around.

262
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
Then it was my turn.

263
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,440
A little left, a little right, on the gas, get the back end loose.

264
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,520
That's not enough, is it?

265
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,960
Action!

266
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,000
Better than the first run.

267
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,560
And then, finally...

268
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,880
You did it! You did it!

269
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,880
That's the Finnish way.

270
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,320
After we demolished all his cones, I took Mika out on the proper course.

271
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
Which he found relaxing.

272
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,800
A second turn in. A bit of a flick.

273
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,880
That wasn't bad.

274
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,920
Whoa!

275
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,920
Sorry, I forgot which way to go there. OK, third.

276
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,000
And then, with Yoda's guidance...

277
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,160
Now, back end out nicely here. Stay on the gas. Yeah, good.

278
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Beautiful.

279
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,600
..it all came together. Oh-ho, good, excellent.

280
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,840
Lesson over, we stopped for a cup of hot reindeer blood

281
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,120
and talked about why the Finns are so suited to motor sport.

282
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,800
Tell me a bit about Sisu. What's Sisu?

283
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,960
Sisu in English means "courage".

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,080
What is to Finns is courage.

285
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,240
Let me give you an example. OK, climbing a tree and jump down from there, so that doesn't mean Sisu.

286
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,800
That is not courage.

287
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,040
That's stupidity.Exactly.

288
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,200
Sisu we can relate very much in motor racing.

289
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,600
For example, you drive a rally car in a forest, extremely really fast,

290
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,800
and you need courage to be able to brake late, to go throttle really early.

291
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,240
Go very close to the apex of the corners.

292
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,400
And also, they're quite reserved, the Finns.

293
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
I mean, you, famously, when you were Formula One driving, they'd ask you

294
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,400
a really complicated question, and you'd just say, "yes".Yes. That's right.Yes.

295
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,640
The reason I'm asking you is because I wondered if I might be

296
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,520
in some way a bit Finnish myself.

297
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,800
I don't like noisy people, so does that make me Finnish, do you think?

298
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
Yes. At home I quite like to have the

299
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,480
spanners in my tool box in order of size, so that I can always find the right one. Is that quite Finnish?

300
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Yes, it is, very much. Personally, that's what I do.

301
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,240
If you're talking about the tool box, everything has to be very organised.

302
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,040
I quite like to have the air vents on my car all pointing the same way exactly. Is that Finnish?

303
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,840
Er...

304
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,600
No.

305
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,040
The next day it was time for me to mix it with the Finns.

306
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,000
I'd been entered in one of their folk races, which are run on part

307
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,560
Tarmac, part gravel, and take place every weekend, all over Finland.

308
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,160
The Finns had kindly sorted me out with a typical folk racing car.

309
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,320
A 1967 Volvo Amazon.

310
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,640
In actual fact it has 200 hp, but in every other respect, it's scrap.

311
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,320
But there's a very good reason for this.

312
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,240
There's a clever rule in folk racing.

313
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,520
All the cars in the race are given a nominal and equal value, let's say it's 1,000 euros.

314
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,520
Then at the end of the race, you can go to any other competitor and say,

315
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,720
I want to buy your car, and he or she has to sell it to you.

316
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,080
It stops people spending too much money, getting sponsorship and generally taking it too seriously.

317
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,680
It also means that the cars stay equal and the racing stays close, which in turn sharpens the skills.

318
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,320
But frankly, when the other drivers arrived, I stopped worrying about their skills.

319
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,440
The bloke over there is about 85.

320
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,240
And alongside him, the grid featured some housewives...

321
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,120
a child, a teenager...

322
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,640
and Bill Oddie.

323
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,280
Surely this can't be that difficult?

324
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,360
That girl next to me should be doing her maths homework.

325
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,280
Here we go.

326
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,680
By the time we hit the first corner, it was obvious these were

327
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,360
no ordinary pensioners, children, housewives and Bill Oddies.

328
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,080
Ow!

329
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,360
After you, Granddad.

330
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,960
Have a Scandinavian flick, Finnish person!

331
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,560
Damn, damn, I've lost it.

332
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:04,440
'I'd forgotten what Mika had said, these guys start doing this as soon as they can see over the wheel.'

333
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm getting burned.

334
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,200
'I started to fight back.'

335
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:19,240
I've passed the BMW! That was an overtake on a Finnish person.

336
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
She's only 12 but that's not the point.

337
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,520
'But the 12-year-old wasn't having it.'

338
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,120
Oi!

339
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,680
Now normally I'd have been happy to stay there in the nice comfy ditch.

340
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
But that's not what Mike would have wanted.

341
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,000
It was time to summon up some Sisu.

342
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm going to have the Volvo.

343
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Opportunity for overtaking.

344
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,960
'Using Mika's training, I overtook a housewife.'

345
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,120
Chance for glory.

346
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,960
'And then Granddad.'

347
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,600
'But Bill Oddie was too much for me.'

348
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,360
'And in the end I finished somewhere near the middle.'

349
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,040
I think all my top level Finnish motor sport training has made me exactly average.

350
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,160
But that was average in Finland.

351
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
Anywhere else and I'd have been brilliant.

352
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
APPLAUSE

353
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,760
Are you ready then for your power time?Yeah.

354
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Let me get this right. To pass your driving test in Finland, you have to be able to powerslide a car?

355
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,400
Absolutely.That's brilliant. But not as brilliant as something I've just thought of.Oh, God.

356
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,840
No, no. We know that nobody is buying V8 cars anymore, OK?

357
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,920
And I find that very sad. I don't want V8s to disappear into the pages of history.

358
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,640
So, how's this for an idea?

359
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,440
If you're not going to use V8s to power cars, how about using them to power something else?

360
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,280
Like, for instance, a food blender?

361
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,440
This is what I've got here in essence.

362
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,320
This is the 6.2 litre engine that you would normally put in a Corvette.

363
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
I see no reason why you couldn't put it in a kitchen.

364
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,440
So, here it is. There's the drive shaft going under the petrol tank into the kitchen cabinet.

365
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,760
You'll have to take out the wedding presents, the fondue sets you don't want.

366
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:41,600
Because, in here, you've got the diff, which then sends the drive shaft up here, and into the blender.

367
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Very good. So what can you blend with it? I could blend you if I wanted to.

368
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:52,600
What I'm actually going to do, under this high visibility shield here, is blend some beef.

369
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:00,000
Beef?Beef, yes, beef. This is going to be a man's V8 smoothie that I'm going to make now.

370
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,240
So I'm going to plonk that in there like that.

371
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
Does that still have bones in it?

372
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes. And then...

373
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,800
I'm going to put some chillies in.

374
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,080
This is Bovril. Because that's a V8 man's drink.

375
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,800
That's a collection of manly ingredients.

376
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,160
Yeah, haven't finished yet. Tabasco. Nice touch.

377
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,840
That wasn't...Just a dash

378
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,240
of that in there. And I think, for added bite, a brick.

379
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,800
It is actually a brick.

380
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,120
Oh, it's broken, but there we are. Pop that in there. Now we pop the lid on.

381
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,120
Perhaps you could give me a hand with this, Hammond. Because it's quite complicated.

382
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,480
Yes, I'm the practical man.

383
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,680
Those go on here like that. So we do it up.

384
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,240
Is this going to work, or is the top going to come off and we'll have a really hard time explaining

385
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,800
to the ambulance people how he's got beef bone antlers stuck in his head?

386
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,640
Just worried.Relax.

387
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,320
Yeah, relax when you've got the keys to a V8 blender.Right.

388
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,440
This is the controls.Oh, God, tell me that's not an accelerator pedal! Yes.

389
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,200
Safety precautions.

390
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,480
Is it loud?

391
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,840
Is it loud, James? Of course it's loud. Are we ready?

392
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,240
Here we go! This is in the kitchen at home, yeah?

393
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,520
MOTOR REVS EXTREMELY LOUDLY

394
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,040
It does make a bit of a racket.

395
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,040
CHEERING AND WHISTLES

396
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,800
Some of it came out.

397
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,560
Yeah, some of it did.

398
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,520
Actually, on the noise, we're used to vacuum cleaners and things at home,

399
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,720
so I think you'd grow accustomed to that after a while.

400
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,560
The thing is, what I'd like to do is,

401
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,320
whenever my wife puts the Archers on, which she does roundabout 7pm, I'd fire up my food blender.

402
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,560
Nice.Can you get the thing off? I'll prepare the glasses.

403
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,760
So this is like a manly smoothie cocktail?

404
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Exactly.

405
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,760
This is the moment.Yes, yes!

406
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,320
Look at that!

407
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,960
That just is the business!Fantastic.

408
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,520
And delicious. Right, are we ready?

409
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,560
What a creation.Hmm. Here we go.

410
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,160
Get some of the bits. It needs a name.

411
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,360
We should give it a name. We should call it, um, Desperate Shag In A Skip.

412
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Try some of that.A Quick One Round The Back Of The Dustcart.

413
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,640
AUDIENCE GASP AND THEN LAUGH

414
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
I think he likes it.

415
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,400
I've got the name for it.What?

416
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,080
The Bloody Awful.

417
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,680
Have you tried it?Yeah.

418
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,960
You haven't. Have you?Yes.

419
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,320
Show me. Put it in your mouth. Because that will put...

420
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,080
AUDIENCE GROAN

421
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,320
That will put testes on your chest, that will.

422
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,000
It's put hairs on my eyeballs.

423
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm not sure this works.

424
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,720
Look.

425
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm not giving up with this V8 idea, OK? Next week, old people.

426
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,200
You can't blend old people.No, you know the Stannah stairlift?

427
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,880
Very slow. How about a V8 Stannah stairlift?

428
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,920
The old lady, she'll be on the bog in half a second.Yeah, that's it.

429
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,280
So I'll get working on that. But that's then.

430
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,560
This is now, and it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

431
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,520
Now my guest tonight has had an extraordinary life.

432
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,200
He's nicked a load of gold from the Iraqis.

433
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,960
He's nicked gold from the Italians.

434
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,840
He's shot Matt Damon in the face.

435
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,000
He's died when his trawler sank in a storm.

436
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,800
And he's had a very enormous penis.

437
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
LAUGHTER

438
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,760
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mark Wahlberg!

439
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

440
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,200
How are you?

441
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,920
How are you?Good.Have a seat.

442
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,120
Mark, don't drink that. Don't...! Don't put it in your mouth!

443
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,160
It's brick and beef. It's not gone well!

444
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
I've got a couple of questions. It's very rare we get big American actors.

445
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,400
It's because Ross isn't around at the moment, so you're here.

446
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
LAUGHTER

447
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,720
I was on that show with Andrew Lloyd Webber.

448
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,560
His face is on inside-out, have you noticed?It's so weird. It's my second encounter with him.

449
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,240
The first time I saw him, I was at a heliport, going to Birmingham with George Clooney,

450
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,800
and George Clooney goes up and tells him, "Mark Wahlberg's over there, he's a huge fan."

451
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,360
He comes over, talking to me for half an hour. I didn't know who he was!

452
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,560
LAUGHTER

453
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,720
I was like, you know, "Phantom of the Opera? What is that?"

454
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,360
He's never done any rap songs. No hip hop.

455
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,200
He's not really from the hood!

456
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,320
The new film. I want to talk to you about that, if I may, Max Payne.

457
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
What's it about?

458
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,240
I play a homicide cop, the title character, whose wife and child are brutally murdered.

459
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,200
And I basically get to go and destroy everyone else that's responsible, even remotely.

460
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,840
It's an edge-of-the-seat proper action movie.

461
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,600
A Sunday-afternoon, relaxing, fighty film, which is what you need.

462
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,400
We've got a clip of it.

463
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,280
This is Jim Bravura. What unit is responding to the exit call?

464
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,800
You mean nobody's called anything in yet?!

465
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,160
'Would you like to report something?'Yes!

466
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
We need to come in, now!

467
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,760
Not a chance!Clear!

468
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
He's gone!

469
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,200
Great job, boys(!)

470
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,840
You see what you did? You let him get away. Everybody's going to get a medal for this - great(!)

471
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,120
APPLAUSE

472
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,600
It's not an adaptation of a Jane Austen book, is it?No, this is not.

473
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,880
This is the real deal, working with John, who is definitely one of the best action directors out there.

474
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,320
He really pushed the envelope. He's here. John Moore.

475
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,880
He's The Stig.He is not The Stig.

476
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,960
He is The Stig!

477
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,200
Not unless he can pump himself up!

478
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,880
Next question I've got, and this is an important one, OK?

479
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,960
There's a girl in this Max Payne movie who's called Olga Kurylenko.

480
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,880
Yes, the new Bond girl.

481
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,920
She's in that Bond film, and James Bond doesn't do having sex with her.

482
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,720
In Max Payne, she's lying in your bed, wearing, let's be honest, not much, and you go, "Oh, no."

483
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,920
Why? Have we got a picture of her? I want you to see what these guys... This is her.

484
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,600
Has she got a beard or something? LAUGHTER

485
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,600
Another John Moore question, because we could have easily shot the sex scene and not put it in the movie!

486
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,320
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

487
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,280
There's many other scenes

488
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,400
that ended up on the editing room floor!

489
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,720
Are you the first action hero ever to have a side parting, here?

490
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,220
Obviously, you know, Michael Caine. So it was a big deal coming over here.

491
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,460
We wanted to make sure we could make a really cool movie.

492
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,700
To be honest, I thought it was a very cool movie.

493
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,340
I've heard there'll be a sequel to The Italian Job?

494
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,220
They've been trying to make a sequel for quite some time.

495
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,580
I don't want to do it for the sake of it. If we can't make it better, I don't want to do it.

496
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,100
They haven't been able to get the script in shape.

497
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,660
The worrying thing is the title.

498
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,540
The Brazilian Job?You see...

499
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,460
LAUGHTER

500
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,540
Does that translate?

501
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,820
That's a you know what...Yes. Have you got one?No.

502
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,500
You've got one?!Oh, I thought you were asking me!

503
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,140
Come on up here!

504
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,860
What's the most enjoyable film you've worked on, excluding Max Payne?

505
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Probably The Departed.

506
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,660
The talent in that one. There's you, DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon...

507
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,180
..Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen. What made it so much fun?

508
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,540
Because it was my neck of the woods.

509
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,580
I've had a lot of experience with the Boston Police Department!

510
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,860
LAUGHTER

511
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,060
And finally being able to put all that to good use, you know,

512
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,100
playing a cop instead of being arrested by them, was fun.

513
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,860
You did have... How can I phrase this? A wild...

514
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,740
A wild upbringing, shall we say? Is that fair enough?Yes.

515
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,940
Yes.Let's put it like this. Your first cars, you didn't buy them.

516
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,020
Not all of them.

517
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,740
Actually, the first one that I kind of owned, I bought from a friend.

518
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,460
I was 13 years old, I didn't have a licence. I wasn't registered insured.

519
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,900
But I stole quite a few cars in my day.

520
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,260
Did you steal the same guy's car a few...?I did. He was...

521
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,220
How many times did you steal his car?

522
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,020
Probably, like, 10 or 15.

523
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,980
I'd drive around, he'd find it or the cops would find it,

524
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,820
bring it back, I'd walk down the street, jump in the car,

525
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,540
pinch the window, unlock it and jump back in and start it.

526
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,460
He'd come running outside, chasing me. I'd be like, "Hey,BLEEPyou! See you later!"

527
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,060
I want to apologise. I probably cost him heartache.

528
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,300
He probably missed work because I went joyriding in his car.

529
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,660
You're what we call a petrolhead. I don't know what you call them over there? Rivetheads?

530
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,380
Gearhead.Gearhead. That's what I was looking for.

531
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
Your cars have been good,

532
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,420
looking back through the history. What was the first one? SL Mercedes?

533
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,220
Yeah, a brand-new car, that was the first one I bought.

534
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,940
And now you have...?A Maybach.

535
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,700
The big one, 62 inch.

536
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
LAUGHTER

537
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,500
On purpose, or was it in a cereal packet or something?

538
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,220
LAUGHTER

539
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,740
And then I have a Brabus Mercedes 550.

540
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,060
Tom Cruise is a Brabus fan.

541
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,140
I don't know.Do you not know him?

542
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,260
We attend different churches, so I don't.

543
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,900
LAUGHTER

544
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,380
APPLAUSE

545
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,220
I'm at the one with Jesus, baby!

546
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:44,380
You came down here, presumably, utterly bewildered that there's a bleak airstrip in the middle

547
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,540
of England with a man who won't take his helmet off called Stig,

548
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,340
who takes you out in a not-very-exciting car with the steering wheel

549
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,820
on the wrong side and a lever sticking up out of the floor.

550
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,900
Did that baffle you, by the way, the lever?It did. What was that?

551
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,580
LAUGHTER

552
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:06,620
Is that why you didn't treat our car quite as well as, let's say, other people treated it?I'm sorry.

553
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,460
Did you break our car? Ibroke a couple of them, I think.

554
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,620
I heard! There's a cameraman over there,

555
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,340
and some poo came out of him.

556
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,780
LAUGHTER

557
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,100
The crazy thing is, I went so far off the track,

558
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,980
and then next time around, he was in that same exact spot.

559
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,460
I thought, "He's got balls!"

560
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,740
LAUGHTER

561
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,060
I'd just like to see... Go on, sorry.

562
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm just glad this isn't how I make my living, because I would be broke!

563
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,940
We don't know. Shall we have a look at the lap?

564
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,740
AUDIENCE:Yeah! Let's play the tape.

565
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,660
'Here we go!

566
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,500
'That's an aggressive start!'

567
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,700
LAUGHTER

568
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,500
'Bloody hell! That's aggressively turned there! And there!'

569
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:51,260
This is a hunk of crap. 'That's... You've gone mad!'

570
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,260
You've got balls, standing there!

571
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,380
'That's cutting the corner, and that's cutting...

572
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,860
'Is he going to kill this one?

573
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,060
'Were you just aiming for the cameraman?'

574
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,980
ENGLISH ACCENT: Here we are on a race track in the UK, Mark Wahlberg.

575
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,500
'That's Jason Statham, who it actually is!

576
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,300
'That was quick. Close to the tyres, yes! Move those!

577
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,740
'Not quite so quick there, but that's a good line.

578
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,220
'That's not bad.

579
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,380
'Coming up to Michael Gambon corner, and we are across the line!'

580
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,340
APPLAUSE

581
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,260
This is the board.

582
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,500
Since we've had that car, these are the people, most of whom you won't have a clue who they are.

583
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,940
I don't know any of them, really.

584
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,660
Well, you know him, Simon Cowell?

585
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,580
Ray Winstone, I worked with him.Ray Winstone, obviously, The Departed.

586
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,700
Brian Cox.

587
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,460
Yes, he was really dreadful. You want to beat Brian Cox?Yeah.

588
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,660
I've got the time here.

589
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,940
You did it. It was a mad lap, got to be honest.

590
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,380
Super aggressive. You did it...

591
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
..in 1...

592
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,700
So you're better than Brian Cox!

593
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,740
..48.7.

594
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,660
So he's under the 1:50, give him a round of applause.

595
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,420
APPLAUSE

596
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,780
That's not bad. Somewhere in the middle.That's very good.

597
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,220
The steering wheel was on the correct side...

598
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,660
That's really good, and it's been an absolute joy to have you here.

599
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,100
Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Wahlberg!

600
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,220
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

601
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:46,700
Now, in these dark and difficult times, very few people can afford a Mitsubishi Evo.

602
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,100
Even the base model, the 300, is the best part of 30 grand.

603
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,540
However, the other evening, we decided...In the pub...

604
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,060
Some beer helped us to realise that whatever car you've got, you can

605
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,620
make it as fast as an Evo X, and at a fraction of the cost.

606
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,900
The producers said that sounded like a challenge for us,

607
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,180
so they said they would provide some sort of car, then we'd have two days to modify it

608
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:14,500
and try and make it faster round our track than a Mitsubishi Evo X. We were very excited about this,

609
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,780
as you can see from the way Jeremy arrives in someone else's Aston Martin.

610
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,100
'The three of us turned up on day one, not knowing what car the producers had bought.'

611
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,740
I reckon it'll be something like a Focus, but a really small-engine one.

612
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,030
We can't start with something like that and get it that fast - it'll be...

613
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,750
Have you met our producers?!Yes.

614
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:55,110
When was the last time they said, "Here's a job for you, and we've made it easy"?Never.

615
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,390
They're not going to now.

616
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,670
It'll be something...

617
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,110
It's not a Ferrari F430.It's not.

618
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,430
Here we go.

619
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,590
It is...

620
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,510
What that is is a Renault Avantime.

621
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,870
I wasn't expecting that.

622
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,790
Introduced in 2002, the Avantime was a monumental failure.

623
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:37,710
Only 435 were sold in Britain before it was dropped from the price list after just 18 months.

624
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,230
Weirdly, it's one of the few cars ever made that us three all like.

625
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,470
Right, so cars that we all like.

626
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,030
This.Yes.

627
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,750
Ford Mondeo.Good one.

628
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,230
This.Subaru Legacy.Yes.

629
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,070
Yes.It's not a big list!That's it!

630
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,910
The most impressive thing in the whole car is just, there's more air in here than there is in Montana.

631
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,550
It's very spacious!

632
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,270
Let's just have a systems check on everything. Heated rear window works.

633
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,230
Heated seats works. All lights working in the back?

634
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,710
I have a selection of lights working.

635
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,950
This is six years old and everything works, which is odd, because most Renaults...

636
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,630
Six minutes.

637
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,790
Then there's the Avantime's party piece. Give it a whirl.

638
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,310
Oh, yeah!

639
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,430
I'm outside!

640
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,310
Look at this!

641
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,110
This is what it's like being a dog. And there's more cleverness. Look at this.

642
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:48,350
To make getting into the back easier, the doors were very, very long.

643
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:52,430
You'd imagine that'd make it useless in car parks, but no, they fitted it with

644
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:59,750
clever double hinges that they called kinematic, and look, in a gap that big, wide open. Very clever.

645
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,390
This was a very intelligent, very unusual and very comfortable car.

646
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,590
However, while it can turn heads, it struggles to turn corners...

647
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,310
Ease it round here. Check it out!

648
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,790
..as The Stig will now demonstrate.

649
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,030
Three, two, one, hit it!

650
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,150
Even though that's the top-of-the-range model, the Privilege, had a

651
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,590
three-litre V6, know what the nought to 60 was? Nine seconds. What's an Evo? 4.5?

652
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,430
It's about twice as long.

653
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,550
Andthe suspension is for ironing out bumps, not smashing them down with a steel fist.

654
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,190
Not designed to corner level and flat.

655
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,430
Of course, we knew this front-wheel-drive box would be nowhere

656
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,070
near as fast as an Evo round our track.

657
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,870
But we didn't realise how nowhere near.

658
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,430
Go on.

659
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,190
This is the size of the challenge.

660
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,790
What was the Evo?1:28.2.

661
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,830
1:42.5.

662
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,950
The Avantime was more than 14 seconds slower.

663
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,350
Then, things got worse.

664
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:22,670
"You know you have two days to make your modifications, so now you need to know the budget.

665
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,590
"A Mitsubishi Evo X costs £30,000.

666
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,270
"You can spend half of that to make the Avantime as fast."

667
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,150
That's not bad, actually.15,000?

668
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,590
We could do loads with that. There's more.

669
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:42,630
"£5,200 was spent on buying the car itself, so you have £9,800 left."

670
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,790
How much do they spend in Formula One?

671
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,910
They say that, to cut a second a lap, it's £10 million.

672
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,910
So we need £140 million.

673
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,670
Is there anything behind it?

674
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,470
Just James, don't worry.

675
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:03,390
With a lot less than that, we backed the car into a borrowed workshop, and immediately ran into a problem.

676
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,990
There's a... How do you make it do it?

677
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,430
Where's the thing?

678
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,390
Shall I get a hammer? No, there it is.

679
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,830
No, it isn't. That's where the spring is.

680
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,150
It is it.

681
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:22,910
'Eventually, we got the bonnet up, and then immediately decided to have an argument.'

682
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,950
Look, guys, power.

683
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,870
Power is everything.

684
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,830
There's other stuff to deal with before we get to power.

685
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,630
The way it handles, the way it drives.

686
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,350
Why don't we just put nitrous on it?

687
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,510
Remember what happened to the first Stig?

688
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,510
He fell off an aircraft carrier. Yeah, we used nitrous.

689
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:42,590
Right, cornering is where it matters. We know from the track.

690
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,790
Look at the lap board.

691
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,150
The Lotus Exige, not a particularly powerful car, goes quickly because it goes

692
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:53,470
round corners quickly. GT Mustang, loads of power, slow, because they won't go round corners quickly.

693
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,870
That's more important than power. Where do we start?Brakes.

694
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,230
James insisted on buying new ones.

695
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,230
This is the standard front disc of the Avantime.

696
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,110
This is the one we're proposing to put on.

697
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,870
Bigger area, vented, keep it cool, make it more efficient.

698
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:20,430
'For sure, all this would mean The Stig could break later into the corners, but there was a downside.'

699
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,470
How much do these brakes cost?

700
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,150
£3,000.£3,000?

701
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,190
We've used nearly a third of our budget on the brakes?

702
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,910
It'll make a difference. Most important thing to do.

703
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,470
'While I wasn't helping, something began to worry me.'

704
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,950
Any minute now, Monkey and Wrench over there

705
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,550
are going to realise they've made a catastrophic mistake.

706
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,470
Hang on.

707
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,310
The callipers are too big for the wheels.

708
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,630
Ugh!

709
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:59,190
'So we had to blow more of our budget on bigger wheels and tyres.'

710
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,870
How much were they?A lot.

711
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,590
£600.

712
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,670
'As The Stig was inserted in for another lap,

713
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:13,830
'James and Richard were convinced it was money well spent.

714
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,310
We have learned from our racing experience, which we all share, and

715
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,790
we have applied it to this, and we have improved.

716
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,470
41, 42...

717
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,950
What?

718
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:39,430
What was it?1:42.5.

719
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:46,670
Is it broken or something? He's gone 2.1 seconds slower.

720
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,910
'This was baffling. We decided we had bought the wrong tyres.

721
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,630
'So we spent another 600quid on better ones.'

722
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:01,750
We've got some road-legal but very sticky track tyres.

723
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:05,790
Which could be worth several seconds.

724
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,710
BLEEP!

725
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,510
'The new rubber was sure to get us going in the right direction.'

726
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,470
If he can brake later and has more grip in the corners, he can get power sooner.

727
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,670
Better tyres will enable the brakes to work.

728
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,950
15 seconds, this'll be. The one thing I know about is tyres.

729
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,790
1:42.7.

730
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:44,190
So, with better brakes and better tyres we are travelling...

731
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,990
0.2 of a second slower than we were originally.

732
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,590
This doesn't make sense!

733
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,750
How does motor racing work?

734
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,390
We could try another driver.

735
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,870
'Having blown half our money and got nowhere, we decided we should

736
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,310
'spend a massive £2,000 on some new suspension.'

737
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,710
Hang on, Stig's still in it!

738
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,870
We haven't got time to get him out!

739
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,310
'Fitting the new suspension was a job for James and

740
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,470
'the boffins from the Top Gear technology centre,

741
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:18,430
'which left Jeremy and me looking for something to do.'

742
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,430
HE MUMBLES

743
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,710
What?

744
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,230
Shouldn't we lighten it?

745
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,310
What do you want to take out?

746
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,110
Seats. Take out just the back seats.

747
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,430
No, cos then it's a two-seater.

748
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,230
'Hammond, though, was right.'

749
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,590
Just feel this. That's how much we've lost.You bugger!

750
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,830
Yeah, that's...heavier!

751
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:47,310
The amount of fuel needed just to move an electric heated seat...

752
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:50,230
That would cost you a noticeable number of quid a month.

753
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,670
'In order to keep the Avantime as a family car, we borrowed two race

754
00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:00,430
'seats from our 24-hour BMW racer and two from Hammond's stretched MG.

755
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,070
'Then we set about replacing the heavy glass roof.'

756
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,550
It's four and a half hammers across.

757
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:13,990
'With our weight-shedding completed, I went to ask James about his suspension.

758
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,790
'Which was a mistake.'

759
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,430
The springs are stiffer and the dampers can be adjusted so the compression rebound changes.

760
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:25,670
If you alter that very finely, you can keep the tyre in contact with the road more of the time.

761
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:29,230
If the weight goes off or tyre bounces up, you lose grip, which lowers

762
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,630
your cornering speed and you know that cars are faster... You asked!

763
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,070
'With the car now lighter, lower, firmer, grippier

764
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:40,110
'and fitted with better brakes, it was time for another lap.'

765
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,750
Go!

766
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,270
'It was now almost the end of our first day,

767
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,230
'and we had to have something to show for all our effort.'

768
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,390
Come on, Stiggy.

769
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,430
Cornering flat.

770
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,870
He's better. This is faster.

771
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,510
Come on, come on!

772
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,350
Ooh!1:38.2.

773
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,430
Which means we're exactly 10 seconds away from our target.

774
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:15,470
I suppose at this point you two will kill me if I say power.

775
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,630
I dunno, what are you saying? Let's see.

776
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,030
No, look...

777
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,150
James, just old-fashioned tuning.

778
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:28,070
Cylinder heads, camshafts, inlet manifolds. You can get filthy dirty.

779
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,430
Think of that! An all-nighter in the workshop!

780
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,550
All those bolts you could name and line up. We won't interfere.

781
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:38,390
Put spanners back in order!And I promise, we wouldn't cock about.

782
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,990
We would do everything you asked us to do. I promise.

783
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,110
Anything?Anything.

784
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,430
Including leaving the workshop and not coming back until I finished?

785
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,990
Just leaving you alone all through the night. Can I have a bag of chips?

786
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,790
Yes, I'll buy you a bag of chips.

787
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,030
All right.Yes!

788
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,390
'Before James set about his all-nighter,

789
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:07,070
'we put the Avantime on a rolling road to see how much power it was

790
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:12,510
'producing after six years of hard graft.'That's astonishing.

791
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,230
That is astonishing, actually.

792
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,990
Are you sure that's right?Yep.

793
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:21,790
It started with 210. It's now got 157, as it turns out.

794
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:25,470
All our figures so far have been gained with about 150 horsepower.

795
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:29,310
We should be able to get it up to 210 with just, effectively, a good service.

796
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:37,150
'So, we filled James up with chips and left him to it.'

797
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:49,510
'Come the dawn, the engine had a new air filter, new injectors and a new inlet manifold.

798
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:59,350
'Once more, the Avantime went on a rolling road.'

799
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,150
Is that the HP?Woah!

800
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,630
That is 206, is it?206?!

801
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:13,870
'Hopefully, with all this shiny new power, our Avantime would fly.'

802
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,870
Listen to that power!

803
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,110
Some of your heart and soul's in that car.

804
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:25,030
We really are a bit stumped after this, because how much money have we got left?Only 300 quid.

805
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,230
Here he comes.

806
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,670
1:36.20.

807
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,710
Wow, all night!

808
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,030
And your face and...

809
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,710
Is there anything more to come out of that engine?

810
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,310
No, because I think the gearbox will just break.

811
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,110
Aerodynamics.

812
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,190
Did you say you bought a spoiler?

813
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,910
At a charity auction, yes. What sort of spoiler?

814
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,990
A Formula One one.Well, it is a spoiler. He has a point. It's a spoiler.

815
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,270
Fetch the spoiler!Let's see.

816
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:05,350
'Once it was on, though, James and I had our doubts.'

817
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,630
Look, spoilers make things go faster.

818
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,550
Fact. F1 Cars have spoilers on, they go like the clappers, ergo, success.

819
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:17,630
Among your friends with their baseball caps in Cheltenham, that is

820
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,590
a generally-held belief. If you think it's going to

821
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:26,830
push down onto the rear wheels, and this is a front-wheel drive car...

822
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:35,990
I think the word is...optimistic. I think the word is...ridiculous.

823
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:41,110
'Nonsense! This would be the final piece in the jigsaw.'

824
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:47,590
Yeah! 1:35...An hour of your life.

825
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:52,110
1:37.03.

826
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,710
Nearly a second added by the spoiler.

827
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:02,150
'However, while Hammond's spoiler was a dead loss, it did give me an idea.'

828
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:07,230
Remember when we did the brick car race and we had that splitter on the front?

829
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:10,350
When it fell off, we were two seconds a lap slower.

830
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,070
It made a big difference.

831
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,630
Why don't we put a splitter on?

832
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:20,590
'In theory, a well-designed splitter erases understeer, but ours wouldn't be well designed

833
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:24,190
'because Jeremy insisted he'd make it out of wood.

834
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,870
'So, it had come to this.

835
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:39,150
'All our hopes now rested on Jeremy's carpentry.'

836
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:44,150
That plywood has, in essence, on this lap, got to take off

837
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,270
eight and a bit seconds.

838
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,590
'But then...'

839
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,910
There's smoke. There's smoke.

840
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,110
It's on fire.Stig! Out! Out of the car!

841
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,830
Turn the engine off.

842
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,510
Your stupid plywood splitter has caught fire!

843
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,470
It's still on fire.

844
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,910
It is the splitter.It's on fire.

845
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,710
Wait a minute.

846
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,670
This is something I've wanted to do.

847
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,750
I have worked in television for 20 years and never had the chance yet, OK?

848
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,470
Back to the studio.That's my line!

849
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,990
That's what I wanted to say!

850
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:19,910
May, youBLEEP!

851
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:32,430
What I thought I'd do is put the fire out and then say...

852
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:35,510
Back to the studio. Ha ha!

853
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,430
APPLAUSE

854
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,110
Anyway, we failed.

855
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:51,470
But we decided not to give up, and in our spare time we kept working on the Avantime.

856
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:56,590
Little details, to see how fast we could actually make it go.

857
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:01,670
We didn't have any money left, obviously, so we spent our time fine-tuning adjustments, getting

858
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:06,070
the suspension, the brakes right, the camber on the wheels exactly lined up.

859
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:13,110
We even gave The Stig a plate of his favourite raw pork, for some heroics in our last do-or-die lap.

860
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,590
And here comes that lap now.

861
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,830
'And he's off! So, this is it.

862
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,750
'Come on, Stig.

863
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,710
'Look at that. It looks like a touring car!

864
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,750
'A French plastic one, but a touring car nevertheless.

865
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,310
'Look at that, look at the brakes, it shows they're working well.

866
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:33,670
'Brilliant-looking thing.

867
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,310
'Now, coming up to Chicago.

868
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,150
'Here he is. More brilliant braking.

869
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:43,350
'Taking that quite wide. Probably a Formula One line, that.

870
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,390
'Going down to the hammerhead, this is the real test.

871
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,630
'Look at it squirming under braking, very effective.

872
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:53,390
'Gets the tail out nicely one way, back the other.

873
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:59,230
'Understeer a bit, but the MDF aerodynamics keeping it on the tarmac beautifully.

874
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:02,230
'Now, come on, this is James's engine tuning here,

875
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,470
'coupled with my exhaust, obviously. Look at the power.

876
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:11,590
'Stig would be looking impressed if you could see his face - assuming he has one.

877
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,630
'Two corners left.

878
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,430
'He's lost it!

879
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:20,030
'No, wait, that's not out of control, it's drifting like an Evo X.

880
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,590
'It's impressive. Here he comes through Gambon, and across the line.'

881
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,310
APPLAUSE

882
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,750
This is what we're waiting for.

883
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,230
This is 1:28.2.

884
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,550
We did it in...1...

885
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,750
It's down here, it's a disaster. That is completely baffling, because

886
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:49,350
every year in this country we spend £906 million modifying cars.

887
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:53,030
As far as we can tell, it's money down the drain.All wasted!

888
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:55,070
And on that bombshell, it's time to end.

889
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,390
Thank you very much for watching. See you next week. Goodnight.
