1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,039
Hello and welcome to Top Gear!
We're back!

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,439
CHEERING

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,399
It's a brand-new series

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,839
and it's a very important one,

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,279
because this is a big year
for the Beeb.

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,479
It is. 2022 is the centenary.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,839
100 years of the BBC.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,399
Go on, the Beeb!

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,319
Go on, the Beeb.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,039
100 not out -
now, that's a big innings,

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,719
but we've got the weight of history
on our shoulders, boys.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,119
We have indeed, Fred.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,959
Did you see that trailer
they put out?

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,079
HE GASPS

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,439
All the greatest moments
of the BBC

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,959
from all over the years -
Attenborough, Strictly,

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,679
Line Of Duty.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,039
It was spine-tingling stuff.
Were we in it?

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,159
No, we weren't.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,439
LAUGHTER
But don't worry,

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,039
because we've put
our very own trailer together.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,039
Forget 100 years of history -

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,080
here's what we've got coming up
over the next few weeks.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,000
Open the taps, Christopher.
See what she can do.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,919
Oh, my Lord, it's fast.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,880
PADDY: Spin it, Fred!
LAUGHS

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,319
Yes!
LAUGHS

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,279
Where does that jumper start
and stop, and your chin finish?

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,879
Right, stop there.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,480
I have turned a Sinclair C5
into a bobsled.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
This is the one now - 12 into 13.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,279
This looks terrifying.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,119
Oh, my God!

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,159
Ohh-ohh...

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,960
BOTH CHEER

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,480
LAUGHS

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,600
Feels good!

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,399
Man, this is such a rush!

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Go on, we're there!
Go on, Chris!

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,799
Whoa-ho-ho!

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,319
Ohh!

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,199
ENGINE ROARS

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
That's my theme tune right here!

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,919
Look at me - when I grab hold
of that, do not pull it!

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
Have you got it? Yeah.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,359
Oh... BLEEP!

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,079
TYRES SCREECH

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,799
Oh! Oh!

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,880
Oh!
CHRIS LAUGHS

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
Oh!

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,080
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,520
OTHERS LAUGH
Howzat?

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,599
All that to come,

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,199
but tonight, we're kicking off
by talking about motorsport.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,439
Isn't that right, Fred?

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,759
That's right, Pad.

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,559
Because see here at Top Gear,
we love a bit of racing.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,959
But if we're being honest,
we've not had much success.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,719
We? It's you two. Not fair.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,559
Formula Off Road, Baja, the GT Cup -

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,319
barely ever a finish,
definitely no silverware.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,319
But we reckon the problem isn't us,

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,959
it's just we haven't found
the right race yet.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,599
Exactly. There's got to be
something we're good at.

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,399
So, the producers said, "Fine.

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,559
"You want to fail at a load
more motorsports? Go ahead."

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,679
And they packed us off
to a corner of the world

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,719
that just loves
a bit of wacky racing -

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,319
Florida!

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,240
MUSIC: Conga
by Miami Sound Machine

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,159
PADDY: Welcome to the sun-soaked
seaside playground that is Miami.

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,519
# Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga... #

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,559
Oh, yes. For a mission
to find a motorsport

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,519
we were actually good at,

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,160
there were definitely worse places
to kick off from.

78
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,919
Miami, baby!

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,119
FREDDIE: Tell you what,
it's all right, this, in't it?

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,759
Here to conquer
the world of motorsport

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,959
and get a tan at the same time,
Patrick! Oh, all over it!

82
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,959
Miami, Monaco...

83
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,039
..Morecambe.

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,199
It doesn't matter, boys,
because we're going racing.

85
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,359
Oh-oh!

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
Yes, we were.

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,959
And because
any professional race team

88
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
needs a slick, sophisticated way
of getting to the paddock,

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,719
I'd taken the liberty of sorting out

90
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
a proper F1-inspired team bus.

91
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,999
CHRIS: What is that?

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,879
I'm glad you asked.
This, my friends,

93
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,279
is the Holiday Rambler
Aluma Lite XL.

94
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,159
FREDDIE: Wow.

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,159
35ft of driving pleasure.

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,239
Ignore that. Right, let me talk you
through the old girl.

97
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,399
Ignore that?

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,599
Where have you got this from?

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,679
Is that wee coming out of there?
What's that?

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,200
Ignore that. Come round this side.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,159
ALL CHUCKLE

102
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,519
Come on in!

103
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,479
Here we go.

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,400
Fred, this feels like a crime scene.

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,080
Eh? Now, let me just talk you
through it.

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,679
Living area.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,439
Driving area. Yeah.

108
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,839
Dining table and...

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,719
You're going to love this, you two.

110
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,839
..your beds.

111
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,319
The kitchen turns into a bedroom.

112
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,399
You've got all this to yourselves,
you two. Ohh!

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I've looked after you!

114
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
Who gets the master suite, then?

115
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,159
PADDY: Finders keepers.

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,759
And anyhow, the boys were about to
get a little treat of their own -

117
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,839
two front-row seats on the Rambler's
maiden voyage down Ocean Drive.

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,679
MUSIC: Ocean Drive
by Lighthouse Family

119
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,519
THEY HUM ALONG AND JOIN IN:
# We'll live on Ocean Drive

120
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,439
# Don't know why

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,839
# You're so blue
So blue

122
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,599
# The sun's gonna shine
on everything you do... #

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,519
THEY HUM ALONG
# And the sky... #

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,519
Whoa!

125
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,039
PADDY: Oh, lively, Chris, innit?

126
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,719
I tell you what, Pad, you've chosen
a beauty. She drives straight.

127
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,679
Thank you. A lot of power.

128
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,519
Eh - 7.4-litre V8... 7.4?

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,959
7.4 V8, big block, straight
out of a Corvette Stingray.

130
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,440
It's got more grunt
than it's got brakes.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,879
So, we've got the idea that
we're going racing,

132
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,919
we've got our team,
we've got our team truck.

133
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,639
Race team. Now what we need is...

134
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,399
..team captain.

135
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,759
What are you thinking?

136
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,759
Well, we've got
an obvious candidate.

137
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,519
Which one of the three of us
has captained

138
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,239
an international England side?

139
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,079
I understand why
you're plumping for me,

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,519
but the captaincy...
Don't think of yourself

141
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,279
as a captain. Think of yourself
more of a sacrificial lamb.

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,359
Oh, my word.
Hands up Flintoff captain.

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,279
Hands up Flintoff not captain.

144
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,800
Outvoted. Get your arm down!

145
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,239
Miami, baby!

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,000
Here we go, road trip!

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,879
Open the taps, Christopher.
See what she can do.

148
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,119
ENGINE ROARS

149
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,039
FREDDIE CHEERS

150
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,920
Listen to that V8!

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,439
Do you know what, Paddy?
It's not what I expected, this RV,

152
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,879
but it's perfect. Thank you.

153
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,519
'80s Americana.

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,040
FLAPPING

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,079
What's that flapping about, Chris?
What's that noise?

156
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,399
That's that window...
Windscreen rubber.

157
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,639
Do you know what I like about
these '80s motors, like this?

158
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,559
They're proper. You get in and go,
"That's comfortable."

159
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,279
They did know how to make comfort.

160
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,079
I feel like Captain Kirk on the...

161
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,639
Is it the SS Enterprise?

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,199
Do you mean Kirk or Cook?

163
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,119
Kirk. Captain Kirk.
The one that sailed a boat

164
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,239
or the one that had a starship?
Captain Kirk.

165
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,199
In the middle on the starship,
sat in the seat...

166
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,319
The one that discovered
Botany Bay in Australia?

167
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,399
..weighing it all up.

168
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,720
That's near Chorley, that...
It is, yeah. ..Botany Bay!

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,559
CHRIS: At the risk of rambling
too far off brief,

170
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,439
it was just as well

171
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,719
that the first pit stop on
our motorsport map of Florida

172
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,919
was located just up the coast

173
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,240
at the Palm Beach
International Raceway...

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,439
Oh, Chris!
Wa-hey, boys, here we are!

175
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,679
..where we'd been told to get
stuck in to something called...

176
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,040
..donk racing.

177
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,759
It started on the streets
of Miami back in the late '80s,

178
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
taking the head-to-head, high-stakes
world of illegal drag racing...

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
..and giving it
a uniquely outlandish edge.

180
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,479
Donk racing has become so popular

181
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,440
that it's now a fully legalised
official motorsport.

182
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,319
A motorsport driven by a love of
big old '70s Chevrolet barges,

183
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,919
modified with huge horsepower

184
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,279
and simply enormous wheels.

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,439
Oh, look at this!
Look at these things, Pad.

186
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,759
Are you all right, lads?

187
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Some of the paint jobs
are unbelievable. Look at that!

188
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,679
ALL: Spinners!

189
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,520
Yay! Love a spinner!

190
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,119
ENGINE FIRES

191
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,399
How big are them wheels, Chris?
What size?

192
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,119
26.

193
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,639
Imagine if you hit a British pothole
in that. Wow!

194
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,839
This is proper Americana, though,
innit?

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,600
Noise! Power! That's what we want!

196
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,159
We weren't just here to spectate,
though.

197
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,920
We'd been invited to compete.

198
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,199
So, to see about some cars,

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,839
we tracked down
the big boss himself -

200
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,279
Sage Thomas...

201
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,799
How are you? What's up? What's up?

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,079
..otherwise known as...
How are you, boss?

203
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,999
..the Donkmaster.
Welcome to America, men.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,599
So, what's donking?

205
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,199
It's donk racing.

206
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,839
What we have here is the
National Donk Racing Association.

207
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,239
You act a donkey in a donk.

208
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,159
You see how flamboyant it is
and shiny it is.

209
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,479
No, you've lost me. What?
You act a donkey.

210
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,840
You act like a donkey.
You got to be wild!

211
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
So, a middleweight donk
has speakers, AC,

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,319
cruise control,
all this kind of stuff.

213
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,559
But it has to have that?

214
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,079
Yes, it has to have that.

215
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,519
And it has to have the 26-inch
wheels that you see here.

216
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,959
They call this one Gold Digger.

217
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,079
One question.
How big is the engine in this?

218
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,839
Seven litres.
BOTH: Seven litres?

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,479
This car here, it makes over
900 horsepower to the rear tyres.

220
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,199
So 0 to 60 - how fast would that be?

221
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,639
This'd go to 60mph
in under two seconds.

222
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,959
These can run about 150mph
in a quarter mile.

223
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,079
That's outrageous! Absolutely.

224
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,599
And better still, the Donkmaster

225
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,320
had been kind enough to
line one up for each of us.

226
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,119
This is a bit of me.

227
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,759
Is that you? That's me!

228
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,799
Chris? That one.

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,519
I'll go Gold Digger.

230
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,199
Have they all got the same power?

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,199
Nah. So, this one makes about
1,000 horsepower,

232
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,559
so you picked the right one.
That's what I want to tell you.

233
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,599
PADDY CHUCKLES

234
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,279
You ready for training?
Yes! Here we go.

235
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,359
1,000 horsepower.

236
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,879
In a straight line.
CHRIS LAUGHS

237
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,360
That's where he's worst - straight
line. It's where he's at his worst.

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,759
Suddenly very aware
that all that horsepower

239
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,999
sat inside someone
else's pride and joy,

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,119
before hitting the track,
we took a couple of minutes

241
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,760
to have a quick pootle around
the car park...

242
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
ENGINES ROAR

243
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,600
Whoa! That has just got
a mind of its own!

244
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,080
..which, unfortunately, was all the
time Harris needed in HIS donk...

245
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,479
..to kill it.

246
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
CLATTER

247
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,120
That broke.

248
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
That's gone.

249
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,519
So, that went well!?

250
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,439
The first time
I put the throttle down...

251
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,279
OTHERS: Oh, dear.
..the diff went bang.

252
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,759
Oh, no! And now this is the bit
that I don't like.

253
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,719
This is the bit... Racing driver...

254
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,799
BOTH LAUGH AND CHEER

255
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,119
Well done!

256
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,279
Pro driver! What happened, Chris?

257
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,599
You pair of...

258
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,320
BOTH CHEER

259
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,679
Am I not allowed to say anything?
Go on, then.

260
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,520
Um...
FREDDIE CHEERS

261
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,920
Suffice to say, with
the competition already under way...

262
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,839
..I would now have to share a donk
with Fred

263
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,999
who, as team captain, had
bravely volunteered to run first

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,800
and show the locals
what we were made of.

265
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,399
Thank you! Thank you! Thanks, lads.

266
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,880
Thanks for popping in.
Thanks for coming.

267
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm feeling quite nervous
for him here.

268
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,959
I'm up against it here.

269
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,840
I'm up against a bloke who does it
every day of the week.

270
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,199
My main concern -
not hitting a wall.

271
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,679
Keep it straight. Keep it straight!

272
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,879
The Donkmaster's telling me
to keep it straight.

273
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,520
That's what I'm thinking. Yeah.
That's what I'm thinking.

274
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,520
Let's go. Let's go.

275
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Light on the throttle.
Just...rrr-rrr! Mmm.

276
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,319
It's one of the most ridiculous
sights I've ever seen!

277
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,999
Come on, Fred! Take this fella.

278

Oh, you... BLEEP!

281
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,320
BOTH LAUGH

282
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,240
It spun out.

283
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,159
TYRES SCREECH

284
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,159
PADDY GASPS

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,039
Ohh!
CHRIS LAUGHS

286
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,399
Ah.

287
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,920
THEY LAUGH
What is he doing?

288
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,199
Who do you think won?

289
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,559
That was no good. No good.

290
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,359
Hell, when he went sideways,
my heart was beating.

291
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,359
LAUGHTER

292
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
I went at it too hard.

293
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,599
I wanted to go
and then was just too keen.

294
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,159
At what point did you realise
you were doing an 80mph burn-out?

295
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,039
I was enjoying it for a minute
and then I started seeing the wall.

296
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,319
Hey, there was a bit, it went
like that and we all went, "Ooh!"

297
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,239
Paddy, I'm here. I know.

298
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,879
You came second. You're allowed
to these days. You came second,

299
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,959
Where am I going here, now, then?

300
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,679
Uh... Am I reversing out?

301
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
Just go sideways up there
for 100 yards.

302
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,239
So, the captain was out,

303
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,399
and our American racing debut
was off to a rocky start.

304
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,679
Well done, sir.

305
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,559
I owe you $20.
THEY LAUGH

306
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,999
Let me tell you, the guy who owns
this car, his ass, about this big.

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,119
Was he not happy?
Listen, you were hanging the wall.

308
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,240
No, I was all right with it. OK.

309
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,679
But for the next race,

310
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,879
me and Harris had been drawn
against each other

311
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,679
which meant, as long as
we kept our noses clean,

312
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,600
at least one of us would be
through to the next round.

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,759
Woo! Yeah!

314
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on, boys.

315
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,760

Oh-ho-ho! Whoo!

319
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,879
Ohh! Chrissy Harris!

320
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,760
Woo! That's fast!

321
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,479
Woo! I think we might have
beaten him!

322
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,199
LAUGHS EVILLY

323
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
Paddy!

324
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,039
That is outrageous!

325
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Man, that donking's visceral.

326
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,479
Beating McGuinness had sent Harris
straight into the quarterfinals.

327
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,800
Win the next round, and we'd be
in with a shot at the podium.

328
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,760
The only problem was,
his next opponent...

329
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,480
..would be the Donkmaster himself.

330
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,120
The Donkmaster's car has a
parachute on the back of it.

331
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,319
I think you have to be
going quite fast

332
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,719
to require the services
of a parachute to stop.

333
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,839
Go on, Chrissy!

Yeah, of course.

Come on! Come on!

339
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,480
No idea what I'm doing at all.

340
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,079
Who do we come for for bets?

341
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,199
We're on the Donkmaster.
Who are you going on?

342
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,639
On the Gold Digger right here.

350
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,839
HISSING

351
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,359
Here we go, here we go!
Come on, Chris! Come on!

352
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
ENGINE REVS

353
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,279
I think I cheated.

354
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,359
He's cheating,
he's gone at red light.

355
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,640
CHRIS GUFFAWS

356
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,160
There he goes!

357
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,480
He didn't beat me by that much.

358
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,519
Woo! Ohh!

359
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,999
Have we won? Yeah.

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,159
Just clap.

361
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,079
SUBDUED CHEERING

362
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,559
Oh, no... I'll get dinner.
LAUGHS

363
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,479
PADDY AND FREDDIE GIGGLE

364
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,719
Oh, Chris, good effort, that.

365
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,079
Unlucky, Chris.
Well done. That was amazing.

366
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,559
But I jumped the start so
I was disqualified before I started.

367
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,959
But you had to try. Looked good,
though. You looked amazing.

368
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,639
It was like the Bristol Donker...

369
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,599
Look, we won!
WHISPERS: Shh! Not now.

370
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,239
Donkmaster won! Not now.
Thank you. Thank you.

371
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,879
So, our team spirit
needed some work.

372
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,519
And retreating back to
the Holiday Rambler,

373
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,399
it was time to conclude that
when it comes to donk racing,

374
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,839
we probably made better
spectators than competitors.

375
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,959
I were catching him at the end.

376
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,679
No, you weren't.
You nearly had me, Pad.

377
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,119
If it had gone on for another
six miles, you'd have caught me.

378
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,479
No, I reckon about another four.

379
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,279
Joking aside,

380
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,799
I think, for our first attempt
at something,

381
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,839
we all got through it in one piece.
Job's a good 'un.

382
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,679
That was a result. Job's a good 'un.

383
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,279
And we won $100, didn't we, Pad?

384
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
$100. Yes, we did.

385
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,400
Time to set our sights
on our next race...

386
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,479
..taking place the following morning
over on Florida's west coast.

387
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,719
To reach it, we'd be crossing
the enormous tropical wilderness

388
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,240
of the Everglades...

389
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,919
..which, in a highly
reliable vehicle,

390
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,639
driven by a highly skilled driver,

391
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,840
would be no problem at all.

392
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,239
Hang on, it just keeps...
It's cut out.

393
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
Have you got any power now? No.

394
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,559
None. Freewheeling.

395
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,479
What have you done to it?
I haven't...

396
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,599
You've been in it two minutes,
you've broken it.

397
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,679
Exactly. You've had it
for an hour-and-a-half...

398
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,159
No, no. It was absolutely fine.
Was it fine when I was driving?

399
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,639
Don't bring me into this.

400
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,839
Was it fine when I was driving?
Don't bring me into this squabble.

401
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,839
Are you scared of his physicality?

402
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,199
I'm having a nice time.

403
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,519
Do you know what
you're forgetting here?

404
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,119
I'm captain. OK. All right?

405
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,319
I'm beginning to understand
why it didn't work for you, Andrew.

406
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,479
You going to have a look
at the engine, Chris?

407
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,439
For what good it'll do!

408
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,839
Oh, there he goes. Oh, here we go.
Ohh, lovely.

409
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,919
Flaming heck!
Turn it off, turn it off.

410
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,719
I've got no hairs on me legs!

411
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,799
My God! What are you doing?

412
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,040
What are you going to do with that
now? The heat! It's hot.

413
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,359
Get that open.

414
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,119
Ooh, pristine, that, innit?
That looks lovely.

415
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
There's nothing wrong with that
at all.

416
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,879
No, spotless.
Put the lid back on it.

417
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,519
WHIRRING

418
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,159
Bit of throttle.

419
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,839
WHIRRING SPEEDS UP

420
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,879
Bit more.

421
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,719
REVVING

422
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,999
Not a lot of fuel there, Fred.
Have you not filled it up?

423
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,679
What do you mean, I didn't fill it
up? You've handed it to me empty.

424
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,640
Fuel gauge says full. Give it a...

425
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,759
What are you doing now? It's broken.

426
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,439
Put the fan cover back on.

427
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,599
You've been driving it
and you've not filled it up.

428
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,839
You've handed it over empty.

429
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,240
Let's just go and get
some petrol, for God's sake!

430
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,399
Since neither of the two clowns
had considered

431
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,319
a 7.2-litre V8 might
at some point need a top-up,

432
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,639
we limped along to
the next petrol station,

433
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,679
and soon had the Rambler
fully brimmed, back on track

434
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,200
and ready to head
straight into the Everglades...

435
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,120
..also known as alligator country.

436
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,600
That's Gatorsville in there, innit?

437
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,239
How much to swim across that?

438
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,600
$100.

439
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,719
I can't see... What's that
over there? Where?

440
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,719
There's something over there. Where?
On the other side of the river.

441
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,119
Where are you looking? Over there!

442
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
Oh, it's a heron.

443
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,559
Truth be told, the further
we rolled across the Everglades,

444
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,159
the more it looked like
the so-called alligator country

445
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,760
was missing a crucial ingredient.

446
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,319
Well, we've been in gator country
for several hours now

447
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,639
and I've not seen a sniff.

448
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,719
I've seen a heron,
both alive and dead.

449
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,439
We've seen vultures.

450
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,479
Snake! Snake! Is that a snake on the
ground there? Where? Where? Where?

451
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,839
What's that dead there? That?
THUD

452
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,360
That's a branch, Chris. Well done!

453
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,719
But the day was wearing on,

454
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,519
and it turned out the overnight
campsite we were booked at

455
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,560
was a bit more...

456
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,720
..rural.

457
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,279
Watch out on that tree.

458
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,519
LEAVES RUSTLE

459
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,800
Jesus!

460
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,919
Slow it down round here.
Yeah. Let's have a look.

461
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,360
Got to be summat.

462
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,560
There's one! Where? Where?
There, there, there, there!

463
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,680
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey. Hey!

464
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,039
Look at that lad.

465
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,839
Tell you what, it's bigger
than you think, that.

466
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,639
How big is that? Five foot?
No, it's bigger.

467
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,000
Is it? It's bigger than you think.

468
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,599
When it comes out of th'watter...

469
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,999
Can you speak in...?
"When it comes out of th'watter..."?

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,319
They live in water.

471
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,679
Whoa, Jesus Christ!
Look at this lad here!

472
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,319
Look at the size of this one!
In here!

473
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,639
Look at this! Crikey, he's large.

474
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,559
Oh, my God, this lad here!
Right here, Fred.

475
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
That's what I was looking at,
that one.

476
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,999
Flintoff, what are you doing?

477
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,599
That's it, Fred.
Just open the door, invite him in.

478
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,759
I'm straight in if he comes.

479
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,159
Tell you what, they go quick, Fred.

480
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,999
Do they? They come out quick, my
friend. Is that more than 6'1"?

481
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,560
That's a big lad.

482
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,480
Look, there's one there!

483
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,639
Oh, he's gone.

484
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,120
Oh, where's he going now?

485
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,239
With that in mind, we decided to get
to our campsite before nightfall.

486
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
So, we saddled back up...

487
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,600
..and hurried on deeper
into the wild.

488
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,560
RATTLING AND RUMBLING

489
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,199
Oh, no.

490
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,719
CLATTERING

491
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,000
Fred?

492
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,399
Right, Andrew...
Chris, I'm doing 20mph.

493
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,239
That is your first official warning.
I'm doing 20mph.

494
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,839
CLUNK

495
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,040
Andrew!

496
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,119
And thanks to Flintoff,
we were soon rumbling up to

497
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,320
the slightly unnervingly named
Trail Lakes Camp Ground.

498
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,399
So, we're camping at a place
with lakes full of alligators.

499
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,280
That's the one.

500
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
Keep that Labrador on a lead.
That's lunch!

501
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,000
Imagine bringing your kids here.

502
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,800
What you've got to do...

503
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,799
Apparently, their eyes are like
cats' eyes, they're reflective.

504
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,599
There's seriously alligators
in that? Yeah.

505
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,999
Proper big ones? Big 'uns.

506
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,199
Why would you want to camp
by a load of alligators?

507
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,280
Why are we doing that?
A bit of fun, innit?

508
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,839
We enjoyed the RV. Enjoyed it.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

509
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,719
Hey! And come on,
what do you reckon?

510
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
I know we've had
a few little technicals today.

511
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,319
It has done us proud.
Done us proud, hasn't it?

512
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,919
It's comfy. Extremely comfy.

513
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,679
I'm slightly nervous about
the sleeping situation.

514
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,999
You don't have to be. I've told you.

515
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,919
Master bedroom - that's mine.

516
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,719
Dining table - that's you.

517
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,239
Couch - that's you.

518
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,719
I'm not sleeping with him.

519
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,559
You're not sleeping with him.
He's in the dining room.

520
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,479
Have you seen how long he is?
It's the same room.

521
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,519
Why am I going to sleep on
a dining table or a couch?

522
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
You're on the couch. It pulls out.
Don't think of it as a couch, Fred.

523
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,399
Are you naked or are
you a pyjamas man?

524
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,640
Absolutely in the buff, mate. Sorry?

525
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,919
The next morning, we were
back on the dusty trail

526
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,159
where, having decided
we'd missed a trick

527
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,519
on the previous day's drive
through Miami,

528
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,000
McGuinness had generously opened up
his holiday wardrobe.

529
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,839
What do you think
of the outfit, boys, eh?

530
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,399
Miami Vice!

531
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,479
Have I pulled it out the bag
or what?

532
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,279
Not in Miami, Pad. You what?

533
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,119
We're not in Miami. Where are we?

534
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,639
Naples.

535
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,439
Near enough, innit?

536
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,639
Naples, baby!

537
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
How many days more of this
are there?

538
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,439
At least one, because we'd been
told our next motorsport test

539
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,319
could be found somewhere
in the nearby marshes.

540
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,560
And, so far, tracking it down
in the RV hadn't been easy.

541
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,279
Here you are, Chris,
what's this coming up here?

542
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,039
Whoa, whoa, Pad,
we've missed our turn, I think.

543
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,679
What? Down there.

544
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,759
How do you know that were it? Were
it signposted? Just listen to me.

545
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,559
Oh! Ohh! OK.

546
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,719
Don't worry.
I'll spin it round down here.

547
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,799
I don't want to get us stuck, lads.

548
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,999
I don't want to get us stuck. Nose
down there and go back in there.

549
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,119
I reckon you could drive
just round...

550
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,599
There she goes.

551
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,159
Oh... Don't worry.

552
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,479
CHRIS LAUGHS
Ohh!

553
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,159
We'll have a little run into it now.

554
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,640
This is perfection. Oh, my word.

555
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,199
WHEELS SPIN

556
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,639
And we are...

557
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,000
No, we're not.

558
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,079
Oh, dear, we might be.

559
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,879
I cannot believe
you've gone into wet sand!

560
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,519
We're in the middle...

561
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,359
We are in the middle of nowhere
dressed like three clowns...

562
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,719
On private land!

563
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,679
..on private land, where we're
going to get shot.

564
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,119
WHEELS SPIN

565
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,679
After a phone call to the nearby
race venue, wherever it was,

566
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,920
we were told someone had been
sent out to look for us...

567
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,800
..which left plenty of time for
a little more hopeless digging.

568
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,999
No. No, no, throw more power at it.
That'll help.

569
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
Shut up a minute. Shut up a minute.

570
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,079
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, Patrick.

571
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,399
And once we were
well and truly stuck...

572
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,959
Gino D'Acampo don't have this
problem with Gordon Ramsay.

573
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,239
CHRIS LAUGHS

574
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,119
..we decided to pass
the time some more

575
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,879
by settling down to a
friendly game of cards...

576
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,359
Play snap.

577
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,919
Snap it is!
Is that what we're playing?

578
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,799
..although, if you'd like
to play along at home,

579
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,759
we do not recommend
our optional house rule.

580
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,999
Snap! Whoa!
That's a nine and a seven!

581
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,439
Right, because you went early...
Yeah.

582
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,319
..you've got to let us give you one
of them on t'face.

583
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,519
Ow! That was a punch!

584
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,880
What about mine? Yeah, go on.

585
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,080
So you don't do that!

586
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,640
I'm taking me glasses off!

587
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,720
Ohh! He's out. He's out.

588
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,760
Ohh!

589
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,120
ALL CHEER

590
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,879
FREDDIE AND PADDY GROAN

CHRIS GUFFAWS

592
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,119
Ohh!

593
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,040
Ow! Ow!

594
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,759
Sadly, there was no time
for another round,

595
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,959
because the very American cavalry
had arrived.

596
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,399
Ha! One thing I will say,

597
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,879
I don't think it'll struggle
pulling us out. Look at it!

598
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,199
All it took now...

599
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,479
Oh, that's lovely.

600
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,519
..was a bit of good
old-fashioned teamwork

601
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,279
to get us hitched up...

602
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,719
You comfy in there?

603
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,399
I'm being the pilot.

604
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,279
I'm going to drive us
out of this thing.

605
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,679
..and a bit of good
old-fashioned horsepower...

606
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,239
Paddy? Yeah.

607
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,560
..to get us out.

608
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,239
ALL CHEER

609
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,520
Yes, boss!

610
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,279
Done well!

611
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,360
How deep? Such a helmet.

612
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,239
With the Rambler finally
back on track,

613
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,840
it was time to do the same
with our motorsport adventure.

614
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,599
And for our next taste
of Florida's unique take on racing,

615
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,520
we soon found ourselves arriving
at what could only be described...

616
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,520
..as a swamp.

617
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,520
Look at this, lads.

618
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,199
Oh! Oh! Swamp buggy racing!

619
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh, that'd be fun. That'd be good.
Oh, hello! Good Lord.

620
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,280
Swamp buggy racing,
as you can probably tell...

621
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,639
..sits firmly in
the specialist interest corner

622
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,999
of the racing community.

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,159
In fact, it is so specialist

624
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,040
that this is the only place
in the world that does it.

625
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,239
70 years of competition has seen

626
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,599
traditional Everglades
water transport

627
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,839
evolve into bespoke
high-performance machines

628
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,879
that generate up to
1,000 horsepower...

630
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,840

..on muddy water.

632
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,039
Fantastic!

633
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,359
Are we still happy
with the garments?

634
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,399
Hey, how cool do we look?

635
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,319
All we need is an explosion
behind us now as we walk off.

636
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,519
Look at these things. Look at 'em!

637
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,480
I've never seen anything like 'em.

638
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,919
And we were just in time to see how
the seasoned pros wade into battle.

639
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,599
Are you ready to see
some swamp buggy racing?

640
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,919

Let's go swamping!

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,359
Look at the state...!
Look at this thing.

644
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,999
Good God! Why would you
want to be strapped into it?

645
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
Here we go!

646
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,439
That's a tsunami!

647
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,760
Whoa!

648
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,719
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

649
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,319
Can you smell how angry they are?

650
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,120
Oh, he's took a bit of the bike!
Wow.

651
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
Yay!

652
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,079
Wowsers. Hey, guys. What do you
think of swamp buggy racing?

653
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,199
That's outrageous! That is mega.

654
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,999
What's the origins of it?
It's over 70 years of doing this?

655
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,959
Yeah. It started off
as hunting buggies

656
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,799
out of necessity to get into
the swamp and hunt for food,

657
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,559
and naturally, one guy's like,

658
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,079
"I'm going to get to camp
before you get there."

659
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,919
And they raced to camp. I love that.

660
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,159
Next thing you know...
That's how it all starts.

661
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,759
Can I just check, have we done
an alligator scan of the water?

662
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,159
Yeah. Are we alligator-free? Yeah.

663
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,999
Well, we scanned it. We didn't
say it was free of alligators.

664
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,279
Do you race and there are sometimes
alligators in there? Oh, yeah.

665
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,519
There's one that lives under...
If you're an alligator

666
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,719
and one of them comes towards you,
you're out of there.

667
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,839
He usually stays hidden
in his hole. Usually.

668
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,159
And with that, it was time
to get ready for the race...

669
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,479
Come on, guys.
Let's get you into the buggies.

670
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,559
Here we go. They're over there.

671
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,559
..where, presumably, with
our reputation at donk racing

672
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,079
preceding us,

673
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,919
it turned out we wouldn't be
competing in the top-level buggies

674
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,679
that the pros drive.

675
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,679
Instead, we'd be cutting our teeth
on something rather more...

676
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,360
..agricultural.

677
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,039
Yes, swamp buggy racers
begin their careers

678
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,239
in clapped-out,
jacked-up old Jeeps...

679
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,079
Look at these things. Look at 'em.

680
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,319
I'm not sure about this.

681
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,199
..complete with about
150 horsepower...

682
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,359

Let's race.

683
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,000
..and no brakes.

685
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,720
CLUNK
Look at his...!

686
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,879
I forgot you don't brake. I forgot!

687
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,439
Has he crashed into him?

688
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,520
What on earth are you doing?

689
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,759
The race itself would see

690
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,559
seven buggies competing
in a one-lap dash,

691
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,880
with the top three finishers
taking home silverware.

692
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,000
Here we go.

693
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,799
Seven cars in the field,
three of us.

694
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,719
This is our best chance of a podium.

695
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,920
One of us has got to get on.

696
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Here we go, then.

697
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,160
Swamp buggying, here we go.

698
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,080
Ohh!

699
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,040
LAUGHS

700
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,279
Now, I had got off
to a lightning start

701
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,080
and was leading the field.

702
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,000
Harris had found himself
stuck in the middle...

703
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,839
..and the big lad... Go! Go!

704
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
..well...

705
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,319
Ohh!

706
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,359
..he was busy getting
just plain stuck.

707
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,399
Come on!

708
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,799
So, that was the captain out...

709
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,919
ENGINE FAILS TO START
..again.

710
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,040
But we still had two horses
in the race.

711
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,759
And right up at the front,

712
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,640
I was locked in
a do-or-die battle for glory!

713
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
McGuinness is having a go.

714
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,480
McGuinness might win!

715
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,240
Go, Pad!

716
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,119
TANNOY: First, General Lee.

717
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,959
Second place - Mr Paddy McGuinness!

718
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,799
And third place...Captain Bridges.
PADDY CHEERS

719
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,399
CHRIS GROANS

720
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,560
Well, well, well...

721
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,879
Nearly won it!
First time I've ever done it!

722
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,279
Fourth place I'll take that.
I'm still alive.

723
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,559
That is unlike anything
I've done before.

724
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,359
PADDY GASPS

725
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,479
MAN: You OK?

726
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
Yeah, fine. That's how you dismount
a swamp buggy!

727
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,719
Oh, what a day.

728
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
I don't think I'm going to be
a swamp racer.

729
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,600
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

730
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,359
It's fair to say
that was an anti-climax.

731
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,279
I work with a gentleman, I'm going
to use one of his favourite sayings.

732
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,879
I was embarrassed for you.

733
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,279
There's plenty to go round.

734
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,719
There's plenty to...
You'll be next. Anyhow,

735
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,839
the main thing is...
We got on a podium.

736
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,759
We've got silverware.
We have got silverware.

737
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,239
We've got silverware, boy!
Second. Where did you come?

738
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,599
Fourth. Sorry.
Couldn't do any more than that.

739
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,839
Right, there's a podium to stand on.

740
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,799
I'm not sure there is, Pad. I think
you might be disappointed here.

741
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,080
I'll make one.

742
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,519
Having discovered, then,
that McGuinness's racing future

743
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,399
lay in a remote Floridian swamp,

744
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,319
we had our very first trophy.

745
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,399
TANNOY: Second place -
Mr Paddy McGuinness.

746
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,280
Thank you.
CHEERING

747
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,079
Once the hero of the hour
had taken the dubious honour

748
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,759
of joining the Queen of the Swamp
for the traditional dip...

749
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,920
What is happening here?

750
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,560
..and after another rummage through
his wardrobe for some dry clothes...

751
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,880
..we got back on the road
in the trusty Rambler...

752
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,679
That cap is actually...

753
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,999
It suits you.

754
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm very comfortable in my pink.

755
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,159
And this would have fitted me
in about 1993.

756
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,039
..which, as it turns out,

757
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,279
may also have been the last time
the Rambler had its oil changed.

758
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,279
She's making some odd noises now.

759
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,159
Yeah! Can you hear
that knocking noise?

760
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,039
I want the expert ear of McGuinness
on this. Ready? He'll go...

761
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,119
IMITATES JUDDERING

762
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,959
LOW JUDDERING

763
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,079
Be right.
Just needs a little breather.

764
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,519
Our great American adventure
is in jeopardy here. It's not!

765
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,760
Because this thing is knackered.
Nowt wrong with it.

766
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,920
Have the faith.

767
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,719
You two just don't have any
mechanical sympathy at all, do you?

768
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,159
Car park over there.
Oh, we're in a church!

769
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,680
Oh, God.

770
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,560
Oh, you can't say that now, Chris!

771
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,319
Are you going to stay in the car

772
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,439
and just oversee everything
and do nothing?

773
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,279
No, we're going to play Frisbee.

774
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,840
ENGINE RATTLES

775
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,639
Sounds awful.

776
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,440
O ye of little faith, Christopher.

777
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,079
So, your solution to this -

778
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,439
we've got a dead vehicle
and you're playing Frisbee.

779
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,639
You've got it.
What a shot, that, eh?

780
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,079
Are you seeing this, Chris?

781
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,919
To be fair, while the Rambler cooled
down enough to top the oil up,

782
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,519
we had to do something.

783
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,639
Do you want to join in on
the Frisbee? Might as well.

784
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,119
Although, on balance...

785
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,279
Lovely throw.

786
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,399
Oh, he's done it before.

787
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,799
..we probably should have just
played cards again.

788
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,799
Lovely. Ooh...
CRUNCH

789
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,320
Oh, what's happened?

790
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,159
Gone over, twist?

791
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,559
I landed right on it
and it did something very odd.

792
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,039
Ooh...

793
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,519
In fact, Harris had managed
to badly damage his ankle.

794
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,399
You get him in, Pad. I'll see what's
in t'freezer, get some ice on it.

795
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,559
Yeah, get in here, brother.

796
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,759
Oh, listen.

797
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,319
We should all know what happens
when middle-aged men do sport.

798
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,639
We shouldn't have done it.

799
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,839
Can you reach?
Right, put a towel on it.

800
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,839
Go. Now...

801
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,439
Mother...!

802
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,479
Ooh, ooh... You all right?

803
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,719
On the plus side,
the Rambler had cooled off,

804
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,760
and after a big slug of oil,
was soon feeling much better.

805
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,759
MUSIC: Take My Breath Away
by Berlin

806
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,239
I've got to say, boys,
she's purring. She's purring.

807
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,199
Here we go.

808
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,359
Do us a favour, Fred.
Cover his toes up.

809
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,639
They need painting, them!
What's wrong with my toes?

810
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,199
You got your nail clippers, Paddy?

811
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,400
I think that might be
the more serious job!

812
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,719
It had been an eventful day.

813
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,719
I mean, who'd have thought that
between 1,000-horsepower drag racing

814
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,679
and ploughing rusty jeeps through
chest-high, muddy swamp water,

815
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,920
that our only injury would come
from Frisbee in a church car park?

816
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,319
I'm not sure I'm going to be much
use for the rest of this adventure.

817
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,120
Well, what's new?!

818
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,319
But it wasn't all bad news.

819
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,679
I tell you what, though.

820
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,079
Once the children are out playing,
it isn't half peaceful here.

821
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,399
After all, we still had
one last race ahead of us...

822
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,839
BOTH: Wahey!

823
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,319
Wahey! Oh...! Oh, no, get it!

824
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,599
..and to stand any chance
of taking part,

825
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,159
the doctors have mercifully
prescribed taking a break

826
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,640
from Maverick and Goose.

827
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,760
# Take my breath away... #

828
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,800
Our last morning on the road...

829
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,079
..and having now reached the very
back of the McGuinness wardrobe,

830
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,320
all we had to do was nurse
the Rambler to our final race.

831
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,879
Don't ask too much of her, Fred.
Don't ask too much of her.

832
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,679
No, I'm just backing off
a bit there, Chris.

833
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,200
I get a feeling she's on
her last legs, this. Yeah, I know.

834
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,679
We never did sort out that
flapping windscreen thing, did we?

835
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,679
I know, listen to it. Part of the
character of the vehicle, that, Pad.

836
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,279
Yeah. What's your state of play,
here, Chris?

837
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,319
Are you...on the sidelines now?
Or are you...?

838
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,319
Are we going to try and get the
old sprained ankle into a boot?

839
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,840
No, but we're in a good place.
We've got one trophy. Yeah.

840
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,239
We can win another.

841
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,120
We'll find a way. We'll find a way.

842
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,119
And we needed to, because
after a few more hours of coaxing...

843
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,639
She is still running, boys.

844
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,039
I would not have had money on
this still running now. Yeah.

845
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,759
..later that afternoon,

846
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,319
we found ourselves
pulling into our last stop...

847
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,439
..at somewhere called
the Freedom Factory -

848
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,120
an old-school oval race
track with a twist.

849
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,439
It's the brainchild of YouTube
sensation Cleetus McFarland

850
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,719
who set out to build the kind
of place where anything goes

851
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,400
in anything that goes.

852
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,719
So, to see what madcap, made-up,
just-for-the-fun-of-it race

853
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,440
we'd be joining in on, the man
himself stopped by for a chat.

854
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,479
It's an Audi S3.

855
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,160
KNOCKING
Anybody home?

856
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,919
Hello. Whoa, come on.

857
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,719
Hello. Hey, guys!

858
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Nice machine you got here!
THEY WELCOME HIM IN

859
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,279
Wow.

860
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,959
How are you? How are you doing?

861
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,599
How are you? I'm Chris. Chris.

862
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,399
Nice to meet you. I'm Fred, nice
to meet you. Nice to meet you all.

863
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,199
Cleetus. Yes, sir, Cleetus
McFarland. That's the name.

864
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,359
What a great name. Yes, sir.

865
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,239
What are we racing today, Cleetus?

866
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,519
We're going to be racing
on the oval track

867
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,799
in one of the most
sought-after cars in America,

868
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,839
and that's the Ford Crown Victoria.

869
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,439
Yes! Police car? Yes.

870
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,079
Yeah, retired police cars. Yes!

871
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,839
Bought right from the auction,
and we put tyres on it...

872
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,320
Show us one. Come on, show us one.
Come and check it out.

873
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,679
All right. Look at these!

874
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,399
This is what we're working with,
guys. Yeah!

875
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,519
So, these things average
from 50 to 200,000 miles.

876
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,039
They're little beat up,
but we got them ready for you guys.

877
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,999
They got a roll cage... Love that.

878
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,559
..like I said, nitrous.

879
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,640
So, is it just the three of us
racing? No, sir.

880
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,160
We got 11 cars total racing tonight.

881
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,959
You're up against a bunch of the
best, finest team of rednecks...

882
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,840
Love it! ..we could come up with.

883
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,279
Just to be clear, then,

884
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,719
our great American motorsport
adventure

885
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,679
would be ending that night

886
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,119
on a packed grid of ex-police
V8 Crown Vics,

887
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,319
race-prepared and fitted out
with tanks

888
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,519
of performance-boosting
nitrous oxide

889
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,039
in a Nascar-inspired
floodlit oval race

890
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,960
called the Dirty 30.

891
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,319
And, if that wasn't quite
American enough for you,

892
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,159
before our turn in
the evening's main event,

893
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,159
there was still time for
a light hot dog supper

894
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,160
in front of the monster truck
tug-of-war.

895
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,799
I'm going blue.

896
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,239
Go on!

897
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,520
HE LAUGHS

898
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,959
Look at the little 'un.
He's not moving him.

899
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,440
Oh, he's going!

900
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,159
It's like watching two
chess grandmasters, isn't it?

901
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,959
Tactics.

902
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,319
With the crowd whipped up,

903
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,560
it was time to prepare for the race.

904
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,039
First, there was
the highly technical grid draw

905
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,119
where it looked like luck
might finally be on our side...

906
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,519
I got 11, dude. I'm in last!
LAUGHTER

907
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,479
Are you kidding me?!
I literally got the worst one.

908
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,399
..because, while
the big lad, Cleetus,

909
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,839
would be starting at the back,

910
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,959
I had taken eighth, Paddy fifth,

911
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,439
and Harris would be starting
all the way up in third.

912
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,159
You got three? Unbelievable.

913
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,880
This is the one guy
I've got to worry about!

914
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,439
# O say can you see

915
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,839
# By the dawn's early light... #

916
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,239
Chris Harris has drawn three.

917
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,079
Cleetus is desperate
to beat Chris -

918
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,599
he's worried about Chris,
I can see it in his eyes -

919
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,959
and Harris,
he's done his usual thing.

920
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,279
Building up to a race, he gets
a bit intense, a bit moody.

921
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,639
# And the rocket's red glare

922
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,799
# The bombs bursting in air... #

923
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,479
Well, I'm in...I'm in fifth
going out.

924
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,159
Er...

925
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,639
That will probably change
to about 11th by lap 29,

926
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,599
but we just want to get round
in one piece.

927
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:06,000
# O say does that star-spangled...

928
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,719
# ..banner yet wave... #

929
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,159
CHEERING

930
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,960
# O'er the land of the free

931
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:31,520
# And the home of the...

932
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,520
# ..brave! #

933
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,599
ANNOUNCER: Gentlemen, start your
engines!

934
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,439
ENGINES REV

935
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,600
Yeah!

936
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,679
Woo!

937
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,800
Brother! Come on, Chrissy!

938
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,559
ANNOUNCER: Chris Harris, battling an
injury, is on crutches in his car.

939
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,479
You know, maybe not
driving with them,

940
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,560
but he truly is using
crutches to get around.

941
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,239
Here we go!

942
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,439
Wow.

943
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,440
I've got to tell you,
the adrenaline is pumping!

944
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,119
This is a formation lap now,

945
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:27,639
side by side, and then,
we're just going to see

946
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,880
what happens when it goes green.

947
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,160
Come on, Chrissy Harris,
get the win, lad.

948
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,919
Dear Lord.

949
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,480
My ankle absolutely bloody kills.

950
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,559
Here goes to American racing.

951
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,319
The pace car is coming off
the track,

952
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,519
making its way into the centre
of the field.

953
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,559
Stay calm, stay smooth, stay safe.

954
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,519
ANNOUNCER: They are going
to be off and under way

955
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,439
here at the Dirty 30,
the very first lap

956
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,079
at the Freedom Factory.

957
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,119
Fire me up.

958
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,959
And they have the green.

959
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,440
We're off! We are off!

960
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,879
ANNOUNCER: I want to point out
the number 188.

961
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,279
That's Chris Harris.
And he's actually squeezing his way

962
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,439
right into second place
here in the first lap,

963
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,919
the first lap is not even over,

964
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,840
and the man with crutches
is in second place.

965
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,319
Going high to begin with.

966
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,399
Whoa!

967
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,959
There's one gone.
Nearly tucked in front of me there.

968
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,880
Oh, this is such a rush!

969
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,999
It's terrifying!

970
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,519
ANNOUNCER: So, Paddy and Freddie
are at the back of the pack,

971
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,799
but Chris Harris, now passing
lap traffic in the 188,

972
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,720
going through Turn 3 and giving
himself a clear, open shot.

973
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,999
Right...

974
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,199
I've got one right on my tail now.

975
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,720
I've got a bit of understeer.

976
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,759
ANNOUNCER: All these drivers
are here to race,

977
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,479
and there's been
some clean racing, too.

978
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,000
Come on, Pad!

979
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,400
Come on, Pad!

980
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,999
ANNOUNCER: Oh!

981
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,039
BLEEP!

982
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,599
Oh, Paddy!

983
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,720
Paddy just spun out.

984
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,319
Oh, I've knocked Paddy off.

985
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,759
He is going to be fuming!

986
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,639
Flintoff, you dick!

987
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,919
ANNOUNCER: He's facing
the wrong way!

988
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,119
We've got the car of Cleetus
avoiding contact.

989
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,839
Oh, my gosh.

990
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,279
The caution has come out.

991
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,800
That was a close call.

992
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,359
Under caution.

993
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,839
Oh, I gave Paddy a nudge there.

994
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,919
He is going to be after me now,
that lad.

995
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,879
Can you believe me own
team-mate rammed me off?

996
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,520
What a bell-end.

997
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,839
I'm now being rubbed by Cleetus.

998
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,000
That's a phrase I never thought
I'd say in my life.

999
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,919
ANNOUNCER: Here we go.

1000
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,560
And it's green.

1001
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,480
Who has the jump?

1002
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,759
Oh, here comes Chris.

1003
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,479
Oh, my gosh,
look on the back straight.

1004
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,239
Chris Harris transitions
into the first position!

1005
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,519
Is he going to be able
to hold it through Turn 3?

1006
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,679
And he does!

1007
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,519
Through Turn 4, Chris Harris
is now in first place.

1008
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,600
Woohoo-hoo!

1009
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,959
Come on, Chrissy Harris!

1010
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,439
I can see him up there! 188.

1011
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,560
He's our saving grace.

1012
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,479
Come on now, boy.

1013
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,359
ANNOUNCER: I think that was
a total vet move by Chris

1014
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,559
on a rookie, Zach.

1015
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,520
Just passed him real quick
and got up in front.

1016
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,559
Now we are halfway through
the race, folks.

1017
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,079
We are lap number 14, about to start
lap number 15.

1018
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,199
Oh!

1019
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,799
We have a spin-off.
Carson spins into the infield.

1020
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,279
We are still under green.
There is no caution.

1021
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,760
Man, this is crazy!

1022
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,879
Chris Harris fighting for his life

1023
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,439
to hold down the first position.

1024
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,600
The veteran Cleetus McFarland
coming up the inside in Turn 4.

1025
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,839
Is he going to be able to
get him on the main straight?

1026
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,239
Oh, door-to-door racing.

1027
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,560
Cleetus clinches
the first-place position.

1028
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,519
Whoa...

1029
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,559
Whoa! Going through Paddy.

1030
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,479
I'm taking another one, there we go.

1031
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,840
That's what I'm talking about!
Come on.

1032
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,759
ANNOUNCER: Oh, and it looks
like we have another spin-out.

1033
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,479
Payback's a bitch, baby!

1034
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,800
ANNOUNCER: Freddie,
Freddie Flintoff hits the gate.

1035
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,160
Paddy got me back there.

1036
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,240
HEAVY THUD

1037
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,639
ANNOUNCER: Oh, and there's
a car spun around in Turn 2.

1038
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,280
That's the menace, Freddie.

1039
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,240
I've got a flat tyre. Flat tyre.

1040
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,239
The blowout looked like
it had taken me out of the race

1041
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,519
with just nine laps to go.

1042
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,079
We're going in.

1043
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,999
ANNOUNCER: Unfortunately,

1044
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,519
Freddie has had to come off
the track due to car malfunction.

1045
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,960
Where are my team-mates?

1046
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,479
The red one back there...

1047
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,880
Where's the blue one gone?

1048
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,040
Did you see your buddy
blew a tyre and spun out?

1049
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,119
CHRIS CHUCKLES

1050
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,599
But this is Florida racing.

1051
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,799
Never had a conversation

1052
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,279
with the other driver
whilst I'm going round.

1053
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,120
And it turns out,
in the Dirty 30...

1054
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,800
..the show's not over
until you run out of wheels.

1055
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,159
ANNOUNCER: Freddie has
come out in a new car

1056
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,879
with orange spray paint on it,
with the orange number 11.

1057
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,159
It's the white Crown Vic
that has come out there.

1058
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,159
Rejoining the back of the pack,
though, by this point,

1059
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,439
a podium finish for me and
McGuinness was out of the question.

1060
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,480
The real race was all Harris.

1061
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,119
ANNOUNCER: Number 99,
he's very quick.

1062
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,200
He's driving very aggressive
as well.

1063
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,080
What's he going to be able
to do the inside?

1064
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,079
Looks like Chris falling
back to third place.

1065
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,480
Come on,
Harris has dropped to third.

1066
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,440
ANNOUNCER: These cars are
driving hot.

1067
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,919
Oh!

1068
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh...

1069
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,319
Bit of a tap there.
Got away with it, I think.

1070
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,719
ANNOUNCER: Did you see
Chris Harris avoid that?

1071
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,239
He shake left, shake right,

1072
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,559
came on the inside,
avoided the contact.

1073
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,040
And here he is able to close
the gap, potentially, on Cleetus.

1074
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,720
Two to go, come on. Keep it going.

1075
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,920
Ooh, Flintoff!

1076
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,280
Just a tickle on the wall.

1077
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,719
Woo! Man, this is knackering.

1078
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,719
ANNOUNCER: These guys are driving
on the wrong side of the car.

1079
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,919
Can we talk about that?
They are literally on

1080
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,360
a steering wheel on the
incorrect side of the vehicle.

1081
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,879
Ooh!

1082
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,239
Oh, contact! Oh!

1083
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,839
Paddy riding along,
he's smoking on the final lap.

1084
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,439
We're going to avoid a caution.

1085
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,479
Oh, that... That was intense.

1086
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,280
Paddy is completely broken down.

1087
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,399
Paddy is out. We've got Cleetus
on the back straight.

1088
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,919
This is the final lap.

1089
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,119
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chris and Cleetus

1090
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,919
coming across for the finish line.

1091
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,560
The race winner, Cleetus McFarland!

1092
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,760
Oh, second!

1093
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,479
LAUGHS

1094
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,119
ANNOUNCER: Second place
given to Chris Harris.

1095
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,679
What an amazing performance
from these guys.

1096
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,159
Wow!

1097
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,960
What an experience that was.

1098
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,039
The Dirty 30 was done,

1099
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,079
and with it was our voyage

1100
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,879
to discover some of America's
most brilliantly bonkers ways

1101
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,640
of going racing...

1102
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,599
..and, rambling home with
two trophies from three races,

1103
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,520
Team Top Gear was a failure no more.

1104
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,079
# I've never felt this way

1105
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,239
# Oh, show me heaven

1106
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,239
# Cover me

1107
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,279
# Leave me breathless

1108
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,039
# Oh-oh-oh

1109
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:35,359
# Show me heaven, babe

1110
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,840
# Leave me breathless. #
