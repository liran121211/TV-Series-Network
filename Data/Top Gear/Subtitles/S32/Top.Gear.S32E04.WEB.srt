00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

2
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,239
Hello. Welcome to Top Gear.

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,479
In tonight's show,

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,719
we've got every sort of car
you can imagine.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,399
We're rammed to the gills
with 'em.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,959
We've got dirt-cheap cars.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,519
We've got Italian supercars.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,839
We've got electric cars.
We've got pick-up trucks.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,479
And, ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,319
we've also got
a Vauxhall Agila!

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,719
Rrrrr-reee!
Agila! Agila!

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,839
Whatever your tastes,
whatever your budget,

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,679
we've got something for you
tonight.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,119
But we're kicking off with one of
the greatest names

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,480
in motoring.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,160
Maserati.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,879
The Italian sports car company with
a truly glorious history.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,919
COMMENTATOR: Stirling Moss in his
Maserati number 7 wins the race.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
There at the very
dawn of Formula 1,

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,319
this was the team that took the
great Juan Manuel Fangio

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,639
to his final F1 title

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,399
and went on to build

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
some of the most beautiful
race cars, and road cars,

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,080
ever seen.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,039
But in recent times,

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,919
the shine has faded
on the old trident badge.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,519
Yes, there have been
some decent saloons

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,479
and pretty coupes,

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,719
but the closest Maserati has
come to a real head-turner

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,319
was 2004's MC12,

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
which was just a Ferrari Enzo
with a body kit.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,919
For the last genuine
Maserati supercar

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,720
you've got
to go back to this...

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
..the beautiful Bora.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,639
This was the last genuine
Maserati supercar,

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,440
and it was built in 1971.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,720
So we haven't had a new one
in over 50 years.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,920
Must be time for a new one,
then.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,199
This is the all-new

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,879
Maserati MC20.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,640
It's got supercar looks.

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,440
It's got supercar doors.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,879
And with prices
starting at £190,000,

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,840
it's got a proper
supercar price tag.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,519
But after 50 years
out of the game,

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,159
what sort of a supercar
has Maserati built?

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,639
You might think

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,359
if you were building a
supercar from scratch

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,679
fit for the third decade
of the 21st century

50
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,799
that you'd go for some electric
hybrid plug-in thingy.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,079
But the MC20 is at heart
quite old school.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,959
No e-motor,
no regenerative braking,

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,519
just a turbo-charged V6
behind me

54
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,120
sending power
to the rear wheels.

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,520
That turbo-charged V6
makes 621 horsepower...

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,479
..which, in a car that weighs
just under 1,500 kilos,

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,160
is plenty.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,160
It'll do 0-60 in 2.9 seconds...

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,239
..and over 200mph flat out.

60
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,759
By any standards,
it's a very fast car!

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,920
You're not going to be late
for anything.

62
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,040
So, it definitely does the
whole supercar speed thing...

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,599
..but with a super-stiff
carbon-fibre tub,

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,719
and double wishbone
suspension all round,

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,159
where the MC20
really comes to life...

66
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,920
..is through the corners.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,599
This chassis can handle
really rapid direction changes.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,239
Wind the lock on, it's so fast

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,759
it darts around in a way
that no Porsche 911

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,399
could possibly hope to do.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,079
You've got to be
on top of your game.

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,200
That's the way it should be.

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,959
Good front-end grip. The back wants
to come round,

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,360
but it's nicely balanced.

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,080
This is, really, a massive
620-horsepower go-kart!

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,399
Issues?
Well, it's an Italian supercar.

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,799
Of course there are issues.

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,359
The brakes - they're effective,
but they take a huge push.

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,999
The pedal requires much, much more
effort than any rival car.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,959
Maserati's done this
deliberately to give it

81
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,280
a kind of race-car feel.

82
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,919
But the steering is so light
there's a bit of a mismatch

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,519
between the input required
for the brake

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,119
and the little delicate
steering inputs required

85
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,479
for the light steering.

86
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,199
I think the biggest problem
is the size of the fuel tank -

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,079
60 litres.

88
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,320
And this V6 likes a drink.

89
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,239
And then there's the question

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,760
of where on earth you're actually
going to put anything.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,439
Now, normally, when your engine's in
the rear,

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,600
you have lots of luggage
space up front.

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,319
Ah.

94
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,279
About enough room
for a pair of undercrackers

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,679
and maybe a sock.

96
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,399
However, there is more
boot space back here.

97
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,279
The trouble is,
it's right next to the engine,

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,039
which means it gets quite hot
- bad news

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,279
if you're transporting
ice cream,

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,519
very good news

101
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,440
if you're a high-speed
pizza delivery service.

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,440
Argh, that's hot!

103
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,479
But look,

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,999
it wouldn't be a Maserati
without a few...foibles.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,239
And in truth, it's just good
to have that badge

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,279
back in the supercar game.

107
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,159
Would I have this MC20
over a McLaren or a Ferrari?

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,759
You know what? I think I would.

109
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,439
I love the simplicity.

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,319
It's not trying
to be a clever hybrid.

111
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,599
I love the way it looks.

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,199
I love the way it drives.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,199
It's unlike anything else
on sale.

114
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,759
Will it provide a prosperous

115
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,919
and stable financial future
for Maserati?

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,719
Probably not.

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,480
But I'm so glad it exists
anyway.

118
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,479
Whoo-hoo-hooo!

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,560
Ha!

120
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,279
HE LAUGHS
Dip a wheel in the dirt!

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,720
Dip a wheel in the dirt!

122
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,080
I'll tell you what,
it's a really great car!

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,799
Welcome back, Maserati.

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,080
We have missed you!

125
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,359
Beautiful.

127
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,439
Look at that.

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,679
I love it. Last week Lotus,

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,759
this week Maserati -

130
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,279
those legendary names coming back
out the woodwork

131
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,079
and absolutely smashing it.

132
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,119
You wouldn't put your money
on it. This is Maserati,

133
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,839
and its track record
isn't great. When they say,

134
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,959
"We're gonna make
a carbon-fibre supercar

135
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,919
"from scratch,
including the engine,"

136
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,879
the correct answer is,
"Course you are, lads."

137
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,919
LAUGHTER

138
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,839
But actually, they've gone
and done it.

139
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,079
And it's good. And I believe
there's an electric version

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,879
in the pipeline. Is there, Pad?
Yeah, they're saying

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
there's a convertible and an
electric version

142
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,879
in a couple of years.

143
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,239
However, this is Maserati.
A couple of years could mean

144
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,799
four or five
financial implosions,

145
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,959
so we won't hold our breath!
But this is still a great car.

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,999
Well, now it's time to find out
just how fast the MC20 is

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,240
by putting it round our track
in the hands of...The Stig.

148
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,799
CHRIS: Here we go. The MC20, looking
menacing in black,

149
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,360
our test track looking
almost entirely under water.

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,360
The car stepping out of line at
100mph there on the straight.

151
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,720
Look at the standing water.

152
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
The MC20's carbon-fibre tub

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,239
made by the legendary
Italian race outfit Dallara.

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,520
This car is built
of the good stuff.

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,239
Stig working his way through
that eight-speed

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,039
double-clutch gearbox.

157
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,560
ENGINE HUMS

158
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,760
That V6, not the most exciting
sounding.

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,720
Into the Follow Through.
This could be interesting.

160
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,040
Stig getting his money out
of that steering wheel today.

161
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Holding it together there.

162
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,439
And across the line.

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

164
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,240
All right.

165
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,359
Straight away, off the bat,
it was a very, very wet lap -

166
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,199
tipping it down. So...
Yeah? The time was rock bottom.

167
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,159
1:30.4.

168
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,399
Ah. And not a good tyre
in the wet either. No, no.

169
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,999
So, when it dried out,

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,039
and just after
the cameras had left...

171
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,199
Oh.

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,039
..we sent The Stig out again.

173
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,479
On a dry lap,
what do you reckon?

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,199
So, 1:30.4 on a wet lap.

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,799
17 dead.

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,079
17? Ooh... Ooh. So we're down here.
Yeah. Ooh.

177
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,679
1:20. Higher.

178
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,999
Higher.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,439
I reckon... Higher.

180
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,679
About there. About...
Where are you thinking?

181
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,879
A bit slower than the GTS
AMG. Behind the Bugatti?

182
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,039
Not a million miles away.
Yeah?

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,479
1:16.6.

184
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,799
Oh.

185
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,039
It's faster than a Veyron SS!

186
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,400
APPLAUSE
Faster than a Veyron SS.

187
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,519
Look at that.

188
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,599
Unbelievable.

189
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,999
And now it's time to move on
and talk about money saving.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,159
Correct,
because we've all noticed

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,199
everything's getting very expensive
right now in the UK,

192
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,799
including cars.

193
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,599
In the last year, the average
price of a second-hand car

194
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,319
has gone up by five grand.
Wow.

195
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,559
But are there still
cheap, cheerful, reliable

196
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,479
used-car bargains to be had?

197
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
We decided to find out.

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,079
To see if you can still pick up a
dependable runabout

199
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,879
for not a lot of cash,
the producers had rounded up

200
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,400
a load of used cars
for us to have a look at...

201
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,159
..all bought for less
than 500 quid,

202
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,239
all with MOTs, ready to roll...

203
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
..in theory.

204
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,439
Wow. Well, I've got to say!

205
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,519
Do you know what?
Looking round already...

206
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,639
How are they this cheap?
Bargains!

207
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,639
They can't have
MOTs, can they?

208
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh. Challenge.

209
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,959
250 quid.

210
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,719
What, this? Yeah. These are great
cars, tough as you like.

211
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,839
Here you are.
Yeah.

212
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,279
"You have five minutes
to each choose a car."

213
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,599
"You may start the engine but you
may not move the car.

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,519
"Whichever car you're in
when the time's up" - oh! -

215
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,679
"is the one you're going
to be driving."

216
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,959
When does the five minutes start?

217
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,639
Don't know.

First things first,

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,039
rear suspension
I think's the problem.

221
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,679
That's quite solid.

222
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,159
This is the one that young Paddy
would have bought,

223
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,959

224
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,160

Paddy, what do you reckon?

231
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,319
A bit of headroom for you!

232
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,199

There's a little MX-5 here!

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,039
Have you seen the
rust on that thing, Paddy?

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,359
Rust? Oh, it's just a bit of...

238
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,399
Oh...

Oh, dear.

That's not good.

241
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,479
For 500 quid,
the Merc's got to be

242
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,239
the one that appeals,
hasn't it?

Oh-ho. No, out of that one.

I couldn't live with that, even
if it was the best car here,

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,839
Oh, my Lord.
That's had a bit of a life.

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,079
Did you have a look
at the Celica?

good, you know.

it was time to find out what
we'd actually ended up with.

288
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,519
And to do that,
we'd been given the run

289
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,640
of an empty
Army training ground...

290
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,119
..where, it has to be said,
the early news was...

291
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,639
Go on, the little Cooper!

292
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,119
Wahey!

293
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,639
..I had bagged a winner.

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,800
This Mini runs like

114 brake horsepower

296
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,360
£364.

297
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,839
Aside from a few warning
lights on the dash, it's mega.

298
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,359
And come on,
it might be 21 years old...

299
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,359
Whoa-oa-oa!

300
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,160
..but that classic Mini
styling still looks fantastic.

301
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,279
It were designed
by Frank Stephenson,

302
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,999
who had a hand
in designing the Ferrari F430.

303
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,519
Practically a supercar,
this thing.

304
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,600
Well, that's clearly not true.

305
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,519
But, if you're talking
about a super car,

306
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,119
for 450 quid...

HE LAUGHS

308
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,720
..my C-Class was a joy.

309
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,120
The W203, launched in 2000.

310
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,559
2.1-litre turbo-diesel engine.

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,039
I've got about 140
horsepower, a load of torque.

312
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,719
The fact is, I got seduced
by the rear-wheel drive

313
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,599
and I've done four slides
already.

314
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,839
This is, I'm sure,
the one to have.

315
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,159
Although, with all the fun
you'll get from buying

316
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,439
a turn-of-the-century
Mercedes like this one,

317
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,040
there are...certain risks
attached.

318
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,719
They're not that tough.

319
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,879
This is the era when
Mercedes-Benz rusted,

320
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,599
the engines
weren't that reliable.

321
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,919
But come on, look at it!
For the money,

322
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,439
I'm driving round
in a silver Mercedes.

323
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,400
It has to be the choice,
doesn't it?

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,439
Look at Harris.

325
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,560
He's loving life in that,
sliding it about.

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,319
I went for the Volvo V70.

327
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,000
Not sure it's the right car.

328
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,999
The Celica was calling me.

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,799
I think that might have
been more fun,

330
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,959
but I'm thinking £495, Volvo -

331
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,519
bulletproof, reliable.

332
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,679
This has done 193,000 miles,

333
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,880
which for a Volvo is nothing.

334
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,279
Look at Harris there, going
sideways. Nothing for me there.

335
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,639
What sold it in the end
was the seat.

336
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,959
As soon as I sat in it,
it was so comfy.

337
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,240
I'm just worried
I've gone boring.

Whoa! Thanks, Chris.

339
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,199
Lads, I've got to tell yer,

340
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,999
this Mini is driving
like an absolute dream!

341
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,079
That Mini looks far too good
for the money.

342
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,239
But I've got car envy
for the Volvo as well.

343
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,679
I know how good
those Volvos are.

344
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,319
It's the comfiest car seat
I've ever sat in!

345
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,679
There is an untold joy
in this type of car.

346
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,399
I just love the fact
that you feel like

347
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,879
you're beating the system.
You get in it and you think,

348
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,280
"Why would you want to
spend any more money?"

349
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,200
Well, it was time to find out.

350
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,399
Because to see if
our bargain-basement cars

351
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,519
were something you should
actually consider living with,

352
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,999
the producers had decided we should
drive them through

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,799
a tank test track.

354
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,959
SOLDIER: Stop!

355
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,319
Back!

356
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,999
Yes, allegedly simulating

357
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,479
a full year's wear and tear
on 'em,

358
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,919
first would be a strength test,

359
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,159
where we'd have to drag
a tractor tyre

360
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,879
up and over a very steep hill.

361
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,359
Then, suspension wear -

362
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,640
bouncing across
a series of very bumpy dips...

363
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,200
..before finally reaching
the water splash...

364
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,279
..a reliability-testing wade

365
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,680
through three feet
of murky water.

366
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,639
Now, the tank overcame
the three obstacles

367
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,759
in five minutes, 56 seconds.

368
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,639
Question was, working together,

369
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,919
how fast could we get
all three cars through?

370
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,719
Boys, remember,
never leave a man behind.

371
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,160

No!

528
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,119
Oh, no!

529
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,959
..we decided to give plan A
another good go...

530
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,199
Handbrake off. Neutral.
Get it whacked out.

531
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,519
Go on, push.
Speed, Chris! Speed!

532
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,399
No speed! No speed!
Speed!

533
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,039
Yes. Go on, son!

534
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,319
..and...
Right!

535
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,799
..once we'd concluded
that wasn't going to work...

536
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,919
Chris! Stop. Kill it!

537
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,079
..it was time
to break out plan B.

538
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,199
Right. Are you ready?

539
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,559
I'm gonna drop it
onto t'bonnet.

540
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,000
One, two, three.
All right.

541
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,759
There.
You...

542
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,159
You knob!

543
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,039
When I grab hold...
Oi... Oi, look at me.

544
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,519
When I grab hold of that,
do not pull it.

545
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,119
Have you got it?
Yeah.

546
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,599
Come...

547
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,599
BLEEP! You absolute...

548
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,719
I've got a bad knee! You absolute
tit! I've got a bad knee!

549
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,479
Do you know how cold this
is?

550
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,719
Has it escaped you
that we've actually got

551
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,359
to get out of here in time?
Come on.

552
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,879
Yeah, you've got a point.

553
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,479
So, once we'd successfully

554
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,159
teamworked the tow rope
onto the Volvo...

555
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,599
I can't feel me feet.

556
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,800
..it was just a simple case
of hauling it out.

557
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,919
Go on, Chrissy.

558
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Come on, the Merc!

559
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,719
She's out!

560
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,159
Argh!

561
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,239
You big BLEEP!

562
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,999
And, having successfully
demonstrated precisely

563
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,199
why it was called plan B...

564
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,999
You just fired a load of
bricks at me shins, you dick!

565
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,599
Let's get to the finish.

566
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,239
..just 100 metres short
of the chequered flag...

567
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,879
WHIRRING CLUNK
Oh, God, it's gone.

568
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,239
..our used-car bargains decided
enough was enough.

569
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,079
Oh, God, no.

570
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,920
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,439
Yeah, this is gone.

572
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,080
The Merc is dead.

573
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh, here comes Tank Man!

574
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,679
He looks smug.
Thank you.

575
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,200
Oh, it's the results.

576
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,319
"The tank completed the course

577
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,599
"in five minutes
and 56 seconds."

578
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,799
Oh.

579
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,759
"You did not complete
the course

580
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,039
"in 21 minutes and 23
seconds."

581
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,560
Well, no surprise
on the result there, really.

582
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,199
Where are you going?
Where are we going?

583
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,640
I'll tell you where
we're going - find another car.

584
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,320
I wanna dry me feet.

585
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,679
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

586
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,920
Ah!

587
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,279
Not a good start, is it? Three
cars driven, three cars killed.

588
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,639
Was that Mini dead, Pad?
Or was you being melodramatic?

589
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,839
A couple of dents. It still
looked very drivable to me.

590
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,239
I thought so as well. But it
turns out - common issue

591
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,959
with that generation
of Mini -

592
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,079
is when you drive over
a submerged telegraph pole

593
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
on an Army barracks, it rips
the radiator clean out.

594
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,519
I've heard that.
Very common.

595
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,239
I've heard that. Very common.

596
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,999
Anyway, we'll get back
to that film later.

597
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,279
Now we must move on to EVs.

598
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,399
We know everything
is going electric nowadays,

599
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,239
and for some types of car,
though,

600
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,159
it's not that much of
a leap from petrol, really.

601
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,279
Exactly. Little city runabouts
going electric,

602
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,719
it's hardly a big deal.

603
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,599
But some other corners
of the car world

604
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
might be a tougher nut
to crack.

605
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,920
The good
old-fashioned pick-up truck...

606
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,879
..which, here in America,
is big business.

607
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,839
Literally millions of these
are sold over here every year.

608
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,599
And they're not just bought
by farmers and lumberjacks,

609
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,799
they're bought by everyone.

610
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,199
So far, they've been
very much not electric,

611
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,799
very petrol.

612
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,119
But all that could
be about to change,

613
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,240
thanks to that lad.

614
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,879
It's called the R1T.

615
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,200
And it comes from an American
start-up called Rivian.

616
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,559
Yes, the race to launch the
world's first electric pick-up

617
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,240
has been won not by Ford
or even Tesla...

618
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,600
..but by a company
you've never heard of.

619
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,800
And they're doing things
a little bit different.

620
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,799
Your traditional pick-up truck,

621
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,599
well, they're generally
a bit rough and ready inside.

622
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,039
Not this one.
This is business class.

623
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,279
It's all big screens, recycled,
sustainable materials.

624
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,680
And because it's electric...

625
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,679
..it's quiet,
it's effortless to drive.

626
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,280
It's classy.

627
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,560
This is a good start.

628
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
But then it needs to be...

629
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,119
..because the world's
expecting big things

630
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,800
from this truck.

631
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,879
Last year, after Rivian had
built just a handful of cars,

632
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,040
the company offered up
a load of shares for sale.

633
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,839
They were so popular that
within just a couple of days

634
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,640
Rivian was worth...

635
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,200
..$127 billion.

636
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
Billion.

637
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,079
Which meant
that this tiny start-up,

638
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,079
that had never made a penny in
profit, was suddenly

639
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,520
more valuable than Kuwait.

640
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,439
What that says about the
world of stocks and shares

641
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,159
I have no idea,

642
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,039
but what it does mean
is that a lot of people

643
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,600
have got a lot riding
on this being good.

644
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,759
And let's face it,

645
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,800
you don't buy a pick-up just
to potter along the highways.

646
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,960
The Rivian needs to cut it
in the great outdoors.

647
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,399
And weirdly,

648
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,240
that's where electric
makes a whole lot of sense...

649
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,359
..because regular pick-ups
have the engine at the front,

650
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,559
sending power
to the four wheels,

651
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,999
with a lot of complicated
drive shafts and differentials.

652
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,240
But the Rivian has an individual
motor on each wheel.

653
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,240
And that means...
it can do this.

654
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Yes!

655
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,239
Oh, it sends just
the right amount of power

656
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,479
to whichever corner

657
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,919
needs it most,
so that means plenty of grip,

658
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,080
plenty of torque,
but plenty of fun!

659
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,039
Whoa-oh!

660
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,359
Get up. There we go!

661
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,359
Up the hill.

662
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,040
It just eats anything up.

663
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,440
Oh, yes. Look at you go!

664
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,040
Now I'm on the straight
and I'm just gonna go.

665
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,959
Oh, my word.

666
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,600
55, 60.

667
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,159
75. I'm off-road.

668
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,200
This thing, I'm telling you,
is a weapon.

669
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,199
And that's before
you find drift mode,

670
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,439
which shuts down
the stability control,

671
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,599
stiffens up the suspension,

672
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,080
and sends a whole heap
of torque to the back.

673
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,040
HE LAUGHS
Come on. Here we go.

674
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,080
Oh, yeah, go on, lad!
HE LAUGHS

675
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
HE LAUGHS

676
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,080
This is immense.

677
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,079
What a car!

678
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,519
So the Rivian will definitely
get you off the beaten track.

679
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,080
HE LAUGHS

680
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,719
..and a 300-mile range

681
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,080
should be enough
to get you back on it...

682
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,479
..but just like any EV,

683
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,720
that half-decent range
does come at a cost.

684
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,479
Because to get a 300-mile
range in a truck this size,

685
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,519
you're gonna need
a big battery.

686
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,680
A really big battery.

687
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,719
And that means this R1T
weighs three tonnes.

688
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,879
That's pretty much
three Ford Fiestas.

689
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,919
If this new electric-car era
is all about efficiency

690
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,159
and treading a little lighter,

691
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,400
I'm not sure a three-tonne
truck is the way forward.

692
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,239
But if Rivian's
going to succeed,

693
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,959
to be honest, it's not me
that needs convincing,

694
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,879
it's these guys -

695
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,040
traditional pick-up
petrolheads.

696
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,319
Now, this is gonna be
a big test,

697
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,400
getting the opinion
of the locals.

698
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,840
Oh, oh, they're having a look
already.

699
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,159
Afternoon, gentlemen.
What are we thinking?

700
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,119
What is it? What is it? It's a
Rivian. All-electric pick-up truck.

701
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,719
No way! What do you reckon?
Come and have a look.

702
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,879
Got their attention.
Here we go.

703
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,399
300-mile range.

704
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,839
Here's the cockpit.

705
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,959
Nice little one to start with,
lads.

706
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,519
Just push that there.

707
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,119
Just push that.
Go on, push that.

708
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,400
A nice little handy torch
for them outdoor evenings.

709
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,879
Here you go, lads.
Watch this, watch this.

710
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
Storage in there.

711
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,959
Hello.

712
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,919
Hey? Hello!

713
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,479
Look at this here.

714
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,079
Air compressor.

715
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,719
Blow your tyres up there?

716
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,919
Blow your tyres up.
Air compressor.

717
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,199
Hey? Look at you. Ha.

718
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,799
Underneath the console...
Pulls out.

719
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,000
MUSIC PLAYS

720
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,719
Now, you wouldn't have
thought the Rivian's portable

721
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,519
Bluetooth speaker would be
the thing to swing it...

722
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,719
60 grand, basic.

723
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,799
77, this one.
It's amazing.

724
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,719
..but this crowd were
definitely coming round.

725
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,839
MAN: Very, actually.

726
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,479
Look at the headroom
here. Look at this!

727
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,279
Holy crap. You've got like a foot.
This is a nice interior.

728
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,079
There we go.
Oh! Holy cow.

729
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,639
Wow.
Check that out!

730
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,039
Is this a cool box?
That is cool.

731
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,199
Fill this with ice,
put your beers in.

732
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,319
There's your plug -
drain it through.

733
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,799
MAN: Now you're ready to
party.

734
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,319
Huh?
Yeah. OK.

735
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,719
ENGINE REVS
Oh!

736
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,439
Right, thanks for that, lads.
I've got to go.

737
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,879
I think I've just been
challenged.

738
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,680
Uh-oh.
Here we go.

739
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,199
Oh, yes, when you take Rivian's
pick-up to the drag strip,

740
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,440
you don't have to leave it
in the car park.

741
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,239
That is a Dodge Viper,

742
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,159
one of the fastest,
most powerful

743
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,520
American sports cars ever made.

744
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,519
Its 8.4-litre V10

745
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,519
makes over 600 horsepower...

746
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,119
ENGINE REVS

747
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,479
..in a car that's less than
half the weight of the Rivian.

748
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,199
But what I've failed
to mention so far is...

749
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,359
..is that I've got
835 horsepower.

750
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,599
ENGINES REV

751
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,319
So I'm keen to race that.

752
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,199
Right, here we go.

753
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,159
Stick it into sport.

754
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,400
Reduce the ride height.

755
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,440
Let's catch me a Viper.

756
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,120
ENGINES REV

757
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,239
Ooh, I'm tense, I'm tense.

758
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,480
STARTING BEEPS

759
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,559
Oh, I'm off in the Rivian!

760
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,480
Come on! 0-60, three seconds!

761
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,079
Why am I shouting? It's so
quiet. Where's the Viper?

762
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,520
He's coming up.
He's catching, he's catching.

763
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,479
Come on, the Rivian.
Come on, the Rivian.

764
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,439
Go, go, go, go!

765
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,520
Come on!

766
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,480
And the win!
That is something else!

767
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,280
Wow!

768
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,320
Get me a form.
Sign me up. I am sold!

769
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,959
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

770
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,039
It's very slidey. Very slidey.

771
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,719
What a machine!
But, Fred, I thought

772
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,719
you weren't sold
on the old electric cars?

773
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,959
Honestly, I wasn't.
Every time I've driven an EV,

774
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,559
I found them a bit clinical.

775
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,119
And the Rivian - all right,

776
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,159
the peace and quiet
I found a bit weird...

777
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,359
Yeah?
But it worked amazing.

778
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,319
I think I'm on the turn.

779
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,679
I thought I could smell summat!

780
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,999
I tell you what, though,
the Rivian, I want one.

781
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,999
Problem is, Pad,
not coming to the UK.

782
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,479
If you want one, you're gonna
have to move to America.

783
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,359
Oh. I'll buy you a ticket.

784
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,439
HE LAUGHS
I'll pack your bags.

785
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,919
No need for that, is there?

786
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,919
Now, this might surprise you,
but I've got a slight issue.

787
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,799
Oh, here we go!
There's a bunch

788
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,719
of these American trucks
coming, and if Americans

789
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,319
want to cut their consumption,
that's one answer.

790
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,799
The other answer is just
to buy something smaller!

791
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,799
Why does it all have
to be so big and heavy?

792
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,559
You do know that this show
is on in America?

793
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,119
LAUGHTER
Fair point.

794
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,199
You've literally just insulted
an entire nation there.

795
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,639
Sorry.

796
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,560
Anyway, now it's time to get back
to our cheap-car adventure.

797
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,479
Right...

798
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,999
This looks like it might be
quite good.

799
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,519
..with our choice
of used-car options

800
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,879
becoming
increasingly limited...

801
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,439
Absolute dog!

802
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,959
..for another crack at proving
sturdy and reliable bargains

803
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,880
do exist, we'd each picked another
steed and hit the road.

804
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,479
I have lucked out big time
here.

805
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,519
Honda Civic. Reliability.

806
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,119
They're absolutely bulletproof,
these things.

807
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,559
1.6-litre five-speed manual.

808
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,679
Yes, it might have only had
four days left on its MOT,

809
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,639
but what a four days
they could be!

810
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,879
Bodywork's OK.
Engine sounds great.

811
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,279
It runs like an absolute dream.

812
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,960
God rest me Mini's soul...

813
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,800
..I think I might prefer
this one.

814
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,959
Lads, I'm...I'm gonna
miss the Mini,

815
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,399
but can you believe
the three of us are now

816
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,680
in little Japanese runarounds?

817
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,200
I have secretly always wanted
a Mazda 323.

818
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,519
Mazda, as a company
in the '90s, made such

819
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,679
beautifully engineered cars -

820
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,039
everyone thought
they were like a Ford,

821
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,439
but they were miles better.

822
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,159
And with a peppy 1.8-litre
four-cylinder engine,

823
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,999
mated to a silky-smooth
four-speed auto box,

824
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,640
250 quid feels like
an absolute steal.

825
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,999
The steering's lovely as well.

826
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,640
You know, this is a nicer car
to drive than that Mercedes.

827
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,519
I am gutted
for the Volvo.

828
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,720
The good news is, it gives me a
chance to drive the Celica.

829
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,879
When I was a kid,

830
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,759
the Celica round our way
was a bit of a legend.

831
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,519
You saw one of them,
oh, it was aspirational.

832
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,279
And you can see why.

833
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,079
1.8 litre.

834
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,359
Variable valve timing.
Six-speed manual.

835
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,359
It's every inch
the sports car...

836
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,840
..now...for just 450 quid.

837
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,639
Got to say, lads,

838
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,999
apart from having to rev
this one to death,

839
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,599
it's sweet as a nut.

840
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,719
Looking around, though,
it's dirty. It is not nice.

841
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,319
And a car of this age,

842
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,039
you always worry about touching the
steering wheel, don't you?

843
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,479
It always looks a bit...
DNAey.

844
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,599
Yeah, and a cloth seat
as well, Chris.

845
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,719
At least with leather,
you can just wipe 'em down.

846
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,399
You don't know
what's in this seat.

847
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,399
HE LAUGHS

848
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,759
We live in heady
times, though, boys.

849
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,719
Everyone's cars
are going up in value.

850
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,479
If you just buy a car now,
sit on it for six months,

851
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,879
it will probably go up 10%

852
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,999
because there's a shortage of
new cars coming through

853
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,119
and it's pushed
the values of all used cars up.

854
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,119
So if I sit on this for six
months, I might get 500 quid.

855
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,479
If you sat on that for six
months, all you'd get is TB!

856
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,960
HE LAUGHS

857
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,239
Now, to see
whether our second pick

858
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,679
of used-car bargains
could go the distance...

859
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,920
Ooh, look at this.

860
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,480
..the producers had
cooked up another test...

861
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,359
Deary me.

862
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,599
This is a fancy place.

863
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,919
..which, in a slightly
worrying development

864
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,960
for our cars, appeared to be
at a massive scrapyard.

865
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,639
Here we go.

866
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,319
We've come to your happy
place!

867
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,159
Have you ever seen
so many cars

868
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,039
in one place like that?

869
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,519
Look at this.
Wow. Oh, I'm happy here, lads!

870
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,119
Gonna have
a little mooch about?

871
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,159
Oh, yes. Right,
looking for parts now, boys.

872
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,919
If you find a V8 diesel Land
Cruiser, I need a dashboard.

873
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,479
LAUGHTER

874
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,039
We might find one an' all,

875
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,319
because this wasn't just
any old scrapper..

876
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,479
..this was one of the largest

877
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,280
vehicle dismantling yards
in Europe.

878
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,879
A 32-acre Aladdin's cave...

879
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,959
..of knackered old motors.

880
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,559
There's a Capri.

881
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,479
There's a Capri!
Where? Where? Where?

882
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,679
LAUGHTER
What a treat!

883
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,919
Look at that!

884
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,239
Which one is it?
Two litre, isn't it?

885
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,359
Did they sell them
on a D plate?

886
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,279
That must be one
of the last Capris ever sold.

887
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,079
Look at that there. That's...
That's nearly a minter.

888
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,039
Tell you what,
a new wing for the front...

889
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,799
Yeah.
..a bit of T-Cut, right as rain.

890
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,040
Look at this.

891
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,719
Ooh. "Rat in boot?"

892
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,159
Is that like a new panto I've
missed out on? Rats In Boots!

893
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,039
Can we see if the aforementioned
rats are living comfortably?

894
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,599
Where's the rats?

895
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,999
Argh! You...

896
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,880
LAUGHTER

897
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,799
As good as it is
looking at smashed-up cars,

898
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,480
what are we doing here?

899
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,240
To find out, we'd
have to wait until nightfall.

900
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,439
Because with the scrapyard
closed,

901
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,119
the producers had been
hard at work

902
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,359
turning it...

903
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,800
..into a racetrack.

904
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,919
Got to say, I love
what they've done with it.

905
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,479
It's like an '80s pop video.
Lovely, isn't it? Very nice.

906
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,319
I love the lights
and everything else.

907
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,519
Oh. Here we go.

908
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,519
Thank you. Challenge.
Yeah.

909
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,880
"Welcome to the Top Gear
Death Race.

910
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,999
"You and your cheap cars will
now race against The Stig."

911
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,039
Hmm.

912
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,719
Oh, no.

913
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,360
"Losing cars will be crushed."

914
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,879
Oh, no, no.
I'm attached to the Civic.

915
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,039
No, I don't want
the Celica crushed.

916
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,639
Right.
Who's up first?

917
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,719
Him.

918
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,639
Ho-ho. Go on, Chris,
save your car.

919
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,639
Yes, in a final bid to see

920
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,959
whether any of our used-car
picks were worth saving,

921
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,680
we'd now be racing...

922
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,400
..to the death.

923
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,879
And apparently determined to show
where we'd gone wrong,

924
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,919
Stig would be driving three
of the cars we'd rejected

925
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,119
the day before.

926
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,079
And now, starting on
opposite sides of the yard,

927
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,999
we'd be given
a three-second head start,

928
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,439
aiming to stay ahead
for two laps,

929
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,960
with the last to cross the
finish line getting crushed.

930
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,559
Oi, clown brothers.

931
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,319
Oi, you two, listen to me.

932
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,879
I've noticed that
the two big strapping lads,

933
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,359
combined height 72 feet,
and all the muscle,

934
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,599
you've pushed me
into battle first.

935
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,199
Well, yeah,
you're the pro racing driver.

936
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,079
We, even though we take
the mickey, we look up to you.

937
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,319
Well, we look down...up to you.
You know what I mean.

938
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,480
PADDY ON RADIO: So you've got
to set us an example.

939
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,679
And to take on Harris
and his Mazda,

940
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,840
Stig had lined up the Rover 25.

941
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,199
Are you ready, my mate?

942
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,719
Do it for the good of the
second-hand car market. Three!

943
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,319
BOTH: Two! One! Go!

944
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,960
Oh, he's got a good start.

945
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,239
'Ey!

946
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,920
Come on, old girl.

947
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,160
Where is he? Here we are.
Oh, there he is. Here he is.

948
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,999
Right, I'm struggling a bit
with the gearbox here.

949
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,519
I'm struggling a bit
with the gearbox here.

950
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,720
Who's on here now? Who is
it? This is The Stig.

951
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,159
Chris is on the back.

952
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,199
Lovely stuff.

953
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,279
You're doing fantastic, Chris.
Well ahead, pal!

954
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,320
Come on!

955
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,479
Got to carry more speed
through the corners, Harris!

956
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,480
Go on, Chris!

957
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,080
That's The Stig.
Smashed him. Well through.

958
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,160
Come on,
find me a gear, you old girl!

959
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,279
Go on, Chris.
Keep pushing, son.

960
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,799
Really throw it in now!

961
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,359
The Stig's going through here now.
He's got him.

962
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,639
Go on, Chris. Go on, Chris.
Up against the tyres.

963
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,119
Go on, son.
You've got this.

964
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,519
Go on, Chris.
No, he's not got him.

965
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,479
He's not got him.
Come on, come on. Push.

966
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,680
Trying to give it everything
but my gearbox is sticking.

967
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,600
That was close.
That was close.

968
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,799
Here we go, here we go!

969
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,999
He's got him. He's through.
Push. Come on, Chris!

970
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,199
BOTH EXCLAIM

971
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,879
Chris Harris.

972
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,239
That was the best I could do.

973
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,039
Oh!
Paddy...

974
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,479
That were tight.
Do us a favour.

975
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,279
Just humour him.
Oh, God...

976
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,039
You know when he starts?
Excuses. Just humour him.

977
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,520
This will go on and on.
Oh, it will.

978
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,399
PADDY AND FRED CHEER

979
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,839
Chrissy! Well done!
Is there some sarcasm here?

980
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,199
Oh, no.
Hey, I'll tell you what,

981
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,879
it was close, though.
You were close to him.

982
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,719
I had a bit of a mechanical,
lads, I'm afraid.

983
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,239
Oh! It happens in these cars,
Paddy. It does.

984
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,239
The Mazda's going
to the crusher, is it?

985
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,199
It's looking like it.
Do you know what?

986
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,079
After it did that to me in
that race, I'm not that sad.

987
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,319
What did it do, Chris?
What happened?

988
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,799
Oh, the old automatic went. Ooh.

989
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,319
So you've just thrown the Mazda
under the crusher? That's it?

990
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,839
Well, what am I supposed
to do with it? It didn't...

991
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,679
It didn't perform in
the race for me.

992
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,599
Well, don't be bitter. Glitter.

993
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,799
Now go on, off you pop.

994
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,559
Get yourself a cup of tea.
I don't know.

995
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,040
You did well. Well done,
Paddy.

996
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,239
Oh, yes,
with Harris's reputation

997
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,679
for snaffling out a bargain

998
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,479
now being reduced
to the size of a wheelie bin,

999
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,679
next it was time

1000
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,719
for the battle
of the sports cars.

1001
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,239
Because to chase down
Fred's Celica,

1002
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,199
Stig had chosen
the MG ZT-T diesel estate.

1003
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,919
I don't...

1004
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,959
Don't... Come...
Just come back breathing.

1005
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,039
All right.

1006
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,679
I was trying to say,
"Don't die."

1007
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,279
Don't say that.
I was just... Be alive.

1008
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,839
You've got this, big lad!
Come on, Fred.

1009
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,200
I'll put t'window up.
Yeah, that'll help.

1010
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,199
Here we go.

1011
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,799
Come on, the Celica.
Don't let me down.

1012
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,120
Best of luck, Fred.
Three, two, one, go!

1013
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,119
Well, it's a keen start.
Come on, the Celica!

1014
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,479
I like this. This works well.

1015
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,919
It's lovely.
It's brilliant.

1016
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,560
It's like a computer game.
Wzz-vroom! It's like Fred-vision.

1017
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,240
Ooh, that was
a bit close to them cars.

1018
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,320
This is The Stig.

1019
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,719
I think he might have him,

1020
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,919
cos I think that is a heavy
old boat, that estate car.

1021
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,439
A bit of a bump. Wahey!

1022
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,319
Here we are.
Come on. Go, go, go.

1023
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,719
He's ahead, isn't he?
Ooh.

1024
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,559
Last lap, Fred. Last lap. Keep
pushing, son! Keep pushing!

1025
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,760
Come on, the Celica!
Get round.

1026
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,239
That was close.
Keep going, Fred!

1027
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,439
You're doing a great job!
Oh, I missed it!

1028
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,599
I think he's just overshot it
and gone straight on.

1029
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,999
I missed it.
I was daydreaming!

1030
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,120
OK, so we're done.

1031
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,799
HE LAUGHS

1032
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,519
He's definitely behind...

1033
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,360
I think the old GPS failed!

1034
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,960
No! It was going so well.

1035
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,919
Here he comes.

1036
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1037
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,439
Jeez! One mistake cost me.

1038
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,399
How are we gonna play this?
Do the applause thingy.

1039
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,920
BOTH CHEER

1040
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,879
Fantastic!
All in one piece.

1041
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,599
Fantastic!
Well done, Andrew.

1042
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,479
Fantastic!
That was amazing!

1043
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,359
Thank you for
your patronising tones.

1044
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,719
PADDY AND CHRIS LAUGH

1045
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,519
Did you see The Stig
actually behind you?

1046
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,079
I just lost me bearings.
I was going straight.

1047
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,199
The Celica
is in one piece.

1048
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,359
And, more importantly,
so is he.

1049
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,359
And we're only 2-0 down.
Thanks, Pad.

1050
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,999
So... Oh, that's two cars
crushed.

1051
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,279
On you go.

1052
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,719
Oh. Go get 'em, tiger.

1053
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,399
Got to do it for the Civic.
Got to do it for the Civic!

1054
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,879
Yeah, that's three cars
crushed.

1055
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,599
CHRIS LAUGHS

1056
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,199
So, with Fred's Celica

1057
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,040
now off to the great track day
in the sky...

1058
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,599
..trying to stop the crusher

1059
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,479
from enjoying
a full three-course supper...

1060
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,359
..would be McGuinness
and his Civic.

1061
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,479
And in a clear statement
of contempt for his chances,

1062
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,239
Stig had decided to take him
on in the Vauxhall Agila.

1063
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,199
Paddy, we need you here.

1064
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,400
Leave it to the gaffer, boys.
Oh, here we go.

1065
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,839
Are you ready, Pad?

1066
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,519
In three, two, one, go!

1067
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,519
Go, Paddy. Go on, son!

1068
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,200
We're off.

1069
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,519
Oh, 'ey up.
This is a bit tricky.

1070
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,239
'Ey up. There we go. Wahey!

1071
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
Stig's got his eye in now. Look at
the speed he's going at here.

1072
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,120
There we go. Hey-hey!
He looks a bit slow.

1073
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,279
The Stig's round here now.

1074
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,679
Is he ahead?
Comfortably.

1075
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,319
Oh, he's killing him.
He's killing him.

1076
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,679
Oh, my Lord.
Come on, Pad.

1077
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,999
Man alive!

1078
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,039
Over the line. Over the line!
Keep going. Come on, Pad!

1079
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,959
That's one.
He's nowhere near.

1080
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,320
BOTH LAUGH

1081
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,880
Come on.

1082
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,960
Where's The Stig?

1083
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,319
What's McGuinness playing at?
He's here again, the Stig.

1084
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,839
Come on, Paddy!

1085
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,439
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Come on, come on, Pad.

1086
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,360
Argh! Come on.

1087
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,640
Go! Go, go, go!

1088
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,479
Oh, no. He's... Where is he?
Come on, Pad. Paddy!

1089
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,439
There he goes.

1090
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,719
Is that it?

1091
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,719
FRED ON RADIO: Paddy,
you've finished. Come in.

1092
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,760
Oh.

1093
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,399
He's no idea. He's no idea.

1094
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,959
Lost by about 200 metres.

1095
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,359
BOTH LAUGH

1096
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,439
Dear me. OK, ready? Ready?
Wait, wait, wait. Here we go.

1097
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,799
Big applause.

1098
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,639
CHRIS AND FRED CHEER

1099
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,999
Go get in!
Go on, son!

1100
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,559
Is it three for the scrapper??

1101
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,159
BOTH LAUGH

1102
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,519
Listen, you're too happy.
You're too happy.

1103
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,559
I take it that's me.

1104
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,319
You came second.

1105
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,959
That's the way we look at it.
See? Positive.

1106
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,920
Second place. Never mind.
So what does that mean?

1107
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,759
Well, first of all,
it meant the crusher

1108
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,839
had had a busy evening.

1109
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,240
Oh!

1110
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,999
Oh, no!

1111
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,399
No, no, no.

1112
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,239
Oh...

1113
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,600
Oh...

1114
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,479
My word.

1115
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,399
Me little Civic. Here it comes.

1116
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,599
ALL GROAN

1117
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,999
It's pooing out a Civic.

1118
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,400
What a shame.

1119
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,479
My gosh.

1120
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,119
What's more,
it was time to conclude that,

1121
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,999
while there may well be
a few diamonds out there

1122
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,519
in the used-car rough...

1123
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,880
Oh, dear.

1124
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,039
..over the last couple
of days of intensive testing...

1125
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,079
..we hadn't found them.

1126
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,679
Well, our sub-£500 cars

1127
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,399
reduced to furniture.

1128
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,079
I've go to tell you, lads...

1129
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,399
..I'm crushed!

1130
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,720
I'm cru...! Come on,
let's get a cup of tea.

1131
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,319
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1132
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,440
No, I'm not sure about that.

1133
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,919
So, the question was...

1134
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,999
..for less than 500 quid,
could you get something

1135
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,479
that will give you years
of reliable motoring?

1136
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,759
And the answer is yes -
well, as long as you don't go

1137
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,879
ragging it round
a tank assault course

1138
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,879
or race The Stig through
a deserted scrapyard.

1139
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,359
I thought it was horrible,
watching 'em get scrapped.

1140
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,319
That big claw coming in...
It was medieval.

1141
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,319
Hung, drawn and quartered.

1142
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,679
It was like Mad Max meets

1143
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,959
that grabby machine thing you play
with down in the arcade.

1144
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,119
I hate to see a car die.
But we have to say,

1145
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,719
all these cars were going to the
scrapper anyhow, all right?

1146
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,959
Exactly. If we hadn't
have bought 'em,

1147
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,639
the breakers would have. They
died so others could live.

1148
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,119
And at least we gave 'em
a bit of excitement

1149
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,879
before they finally kicked
the bucket.

1150
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,039
And look at this -

1151
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,519
we've got three beautiful
coffee tables, hey?

1152
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,359
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Ah!

1153
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,319
That's the end of the show
for tonight.

1154
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,799
We'll be back next week,

1155
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,679
when we're letting
Chris Harris loose

1156
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,399
in an actual World Rally car.

1157
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,199
CHEERING

1158
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,519
And we're gonna
go back in time

1159
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,119
to tackle motorsport
1920s-style.

1160
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,439
See you then. Goodnight.

1161
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
