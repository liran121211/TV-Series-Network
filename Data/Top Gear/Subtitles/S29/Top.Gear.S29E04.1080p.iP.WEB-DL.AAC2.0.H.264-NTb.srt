1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,016
Hello and welcome to Top Gear,

2
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,696
where tonight we are celebrating
the very best of British.

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,416
It's about time. Thanks very much.

4
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,696
Not you, son.
We're talking about British cars.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,536
See, as you may have noticed,
the world's

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,536
still a little bit shut down.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,456
We can't get abroad for a big road
trip, but that's fine because we've

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,056
got everything we need right here
on our doorstep, including the cars.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,296
Yes, if there's one thing Britain
does better than anyone else

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,296
it's grand tourers.
GTs - fast, comfy luxurious.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,176
So we each decided to pick our
own favourite new British GT

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,520
and take them on a little driving
tour right here at home.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,216
Who needs the south of France
or the Italian Alps

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,376
when you've got beautiful,

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
balmy Wales?

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,976
A country that has
all the ingredients

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,256
you need for a classic Grand Tour,
starting with the idyllic.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,160
Mediterranean-inspired
coastal village of Portmeirion.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,376
A sophisticated classical
backdrop for the most sophisticated

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,320
and classical of GTs.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,136
The Bentley Flying Spur

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,256
17 feet and Â£170,000 of
quintessentially British GT car.

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,216
You see, a grand tourer needs to
cover great distance at great speed

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,736
and in great comfort, and for that
task there's just no better car.

25
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,816
This thing is supremely fast,
supremely luxurious.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,816
It's supremely Bentley.

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,440
There is simply no better way
to grandly tour.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
As Mr Flintoff was about
to demonstrate.

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,320
I can't see a GT car.
I can see a McLaren.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,096
Andrew, you know what I'm going
to say. That is the McLaren GT.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,536
Literally, its name, I can't get
any more GT than a McLaren GT.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,016
Yeah, you can't just apply a name

33
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,976
to something and assume
it takes that role.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,696
If you call Paddy McGuinness
a doctor of physics,

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,216
he's still a budget entertainer
from Bolton, OK?

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,296
That's a sports car.

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,976
It's not very big, not very
comfortable. It's comfortable.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,336
It's the most comfortable McLaren
they've ever made.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
It's got a massive boot in the back.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,536
Look at that.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,376
What? All this.
Two sets of golf clubs in there.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,736
It's a fillet of a boot.
That's massive.

43
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,376
Surely GT is about comfort,
about distance,

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,416
time spent behind the wheel.
I give you comfort.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,376
Yes, but if I was going
to go on a tour driving,

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
I would want to drive that car.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,536
I'd want to sit in the back of that
one. Really? That's a limo.

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,816
Here we go.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,976
Hang on a minute.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,080
What is it with you two not
understanding basic instructions?

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,496
Gentlemen, what better way
to see this beautiful part

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,256
of the world than in the ultimate
grand tourer - the Aston Martin DBX?

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,216
I don't understand why
you've turned up in that.

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,576
Other than the fact that you are a
little bit taters and from Cheshire.

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,456
Other than that, why else?

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,416
That is spot on. He's spot on.

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,416
I'm fascinated by Aston Martin's
new car,

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,256
but this is not the right
vehicle for this test.

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,536
You see, it's a bit like

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,496
when you went in the shop
and bought that top.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,456
Is it a shirt? Is it a jumper?

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,536
Is it a coat? Is it a dishcloth?

63
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,496
We don't know. The main thing
is you're enjoying it.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,896
In the 21st century,
people are grand touring in these.

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,496
They should rename this car
the Aston Martin DBX GT.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,096
And listen - that's a limo,

67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,856
that's a sports car.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,176
I reckon, Pads, you know,
in the spirit of compromise,

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,256
why don't we agree that GTs
can come in all shapes and sizes?

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,816
Like Top Gear presenters.

71
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,456
Tubby, short, tall.

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,616
See? Something for everyone.

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,656
Tubby?

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,216
Now, lads, most importantly,
we've got

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,976
a chance to explore
the roads of North Wales.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,640
It's a playground for cars,
it really is. Get in, let's go.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,496
Now, the beauty of grand touring
in Wales, apart from the weather,

78
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,336
is that once you leave your idyllic
coastal village behind, the next

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,000
bit of scenery is only
just around the corner.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,280
Look at these views.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,080
This is stunning.

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,800
When you see roads like this,
why not just stay in Britain?

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,776
North Wales, I reckon, boys,

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,856
has some of the best driving
roads in Europe.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,776
They really are. For demonstrating
what a road car can do,

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,456
I don't think there's a better
place around than this.

87
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,760
Which is just as well,
because the DBX can do a lot.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,856
Aston Martin have dipped
their toe in the world of SUVs

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,200
and I've got to tell you - I think
they've got it absolutely spot on.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,416
160 grand buys you a four-litre twin
turbo V8 packing 542 horsepower,

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,240
which is enough to get James Bond
and his kids all the way up to 181.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,416
Aside from that, I love the inside
of it. It's so comfortable.

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,200
It's beautifully made,
beautifully put together.

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,320
If you're doing a Grand Tour,
this is what you want to be in.

95
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,960
Unless, that is, you want your Grand
Tour to be a bit more exciting.

96
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,120
My word.

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
This car wants to play.

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,176
It might not be the fastest McLaren,

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,160
but I can tell you it's fast enough.

100
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,240
It does 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds,
top speed 203 mph.

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,576
People will say,
"It's too supercar."

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,016
When has that ever been a problem?

103
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
It's a McLaren.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,456
Yes, it is,

105
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,800
but what it still isn't
is a proper grand tourer.

106
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,256
Historically, for a truly grand
Grand Tour, you needed 12 cylinders

107
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,976
and the Bentley has a W12 engine.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,536
In fact, this thing is just
an orgy of numbers.

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,176
626 horsepower,
664 foot-pounds of torque

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,776
pushing two and a half tonnes -

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,776
- two and a half tonnes!
- To 207 mph.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,816
How on earth do you get
something this big

113
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,256
and heavy to those kinds of speeds?

114
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,160
And it does 0 to 60 in under
four seconds. It's outrageous.

115
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,136
Beautiful now. This is nice.

116
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,576
I just can't believe that
Aston Martin allowed Ford

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,056
to basically nick its grill
design from the last 30 years

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,296
because now even a Fiesta looks
like the front of that Aston Martin.

119
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,760
I don't mean to be sizeist, but do
you have a booster seat in that car?

120
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,696
The only thing about seeing
Paddy driving that car,

121
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,576
I actually can't see him.
I can just see his hair.

122
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,680
You just blend in, Paddy,
to that colour.

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,216
Chris, are you going to tell us
where we're going?

124
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,736
Andrew, I've got a treat here.

125
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,920
I've booked us a little
place by the sea.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,576
A little place called.

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,616
Anglesey circuit.

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,976
The most picturesque
racetrack in Britain,

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,520
and also one of the best to drive.

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,160
Hey, hey! Good lad, Harris.

131
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,320
This is a proper day out now.

132
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,480
You'd want to go sideways
through the quick right-hander.

133
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,080
Big oversteer!

134
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,416
Wow.

135
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,136
I tell you what - the absurdity
of engineering a car this big

136
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,480
to behave like this on
a track is wonderfully silly.

137
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,536
This is so much fun!

138
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
It's unbelievable, this thing.

139
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,496
Here we go now. Turn her in.
So nimble.

140
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,760
This is what a grand tourer
should be able to do.

141
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
Whoa!

142
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
This is a slippy track.

143
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,560
There she goes. There she goes.

144
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,520
Ha-ha!

145
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,696
Before things got out of hand,

146
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,160
the producers decided it was
time for some proper testing.

147
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,096
To see which of our GTs
was quickest,

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,856
each of us would set the fastest
time we could around the track,

149
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,560
and it would be a staggered start.

150
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,056
Lads, why are we doing
a staggered start, anyhow?

151
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,600
I think it's to avoid a massive very
expensive first-corner accident.

152
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,896
That's a very good
point, Christopher.

153
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,016
OK, Paddy, in three,

154
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,880
two, one, go!

155
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,576
McGuinness looking good.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,920
He missed his apex,
but you can't have it all.

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,656
That's wet!

158
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,416
That's greasy.

159
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,376
OK, Chris, in three,

160
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,360
two, one, go!

161
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,840
Now she feels big.
Now she feels big.

162
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,376
OK, Freddie, in three,

163
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,520
two, one, go!

164
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,400
Come on!

165
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
Twitchy.

166
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,840
Use all the circuit. Use all
the circuit, catch McGuinness.

167
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,416
Come on! I'm torn here.
I really want to go fast.

168
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,200
I want to beat Harris,

169
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,160
but I don't want to crash the car.

170
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,016
Do you know what? I'm not using
this car to its full potential.

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm going off-road.

172
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,520
Let's get down here.

173
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,176
Come on, old girl.

174
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
There's a bit of speed to be had
through here if I really gun it.

175
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,280
No sign of McGuinness.

176
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
I've gone a bit fast on the corners,
taken a couple a little bit wide.

177
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,760
I enjoyed that.

178
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,600
Come on, old girl.

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,400
And over the line.

180
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,136
Coming round, coming round.
I've gone too fast!

181
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
Come on, hang on, hang on!

182
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,696
Lovely stuff!

183
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,096
Well done, son. In the SUV.

184
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,096
Thank you very much, Mr Flintoff.

185
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,616
I mean, I think I might be

186
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,376
the first person who's had
the backend out in a DBX.

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,816
You know this track like the back
of your hand, Chris.

188
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,896
You're a racing driver.
How have I beat you?

189
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,776
Because you're in a McLaren,
and I'm in a limousine.

190
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,000
He's not best pleased.

191
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,536
Let's be honest - how on earth

192
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,896
has he got within a second of me
in that car?

193
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,200
It's a tonne heavier.

194
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,536
More's the point -
how on earth Aston's SUV had got

195
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,216
ahead of both of us was because
its driver is a cheating snake.

196
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,616
I tell you something, though,

197
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,416
you come round this one,
you've got to be careful.

198
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,216
Ha, is that what you did, Paddy?

199
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,520
You've just cut out half the lap.

200
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,400
I was showing the car's
all-round abilities.

201
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,336
The only thing I can say in his
defence - he's using what he's got.

202
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,016
That's the first piece of thinking
I've seen from Paddy McGuinness

203
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,296
since I met him.
Thank you very much, sir.

204
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,776
I tell you, though, one thing -
these three cars on this track,

205
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,096
this is the best country
in the world. I'll agree with that.

206
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,576
You don't need to go anywhere else.
We've got it all here.

207
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,576
We are driving round this track in
the best of British, lads.

208
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,720
It's a day to feel very proud, this.

209
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,200
Up, what's going on here?

210
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
I don't know.
What IS going on here, Pad?

211
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,160
I'm going to go and investigate.

212
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,256
Right...

213
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,016
Portia Panamera Turbo S E-hybrid
Sport Turismo,

214
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,416
Mercedes AMG GT R PRO,

215
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,120
Audi RS Q8.

216
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,640
Thank you.

217
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,216
Britain isn't the only country

218
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,216
that builds great grand tourers.

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,720
So does Germany.

220
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,296
To find out who does it better,
your cars will now compete

221
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,080
against their German equivalents
in a series of challenges.

222
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,840
Who's driving them?

223
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,016
None other than one of the finest
German racing drivers of all time.

224
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,240
F1 legend Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

225
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,616
Lads, we're in a bit
of trouble here.

226
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,256
Those are very fast cars

227
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,400
and he's a very good
Formula 1 driver. How good?

228
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,336
Used-to-beat-Schumacher-type fast.

229
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,400
Hi. You all right?

230
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,416
God!

231
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
Lads, no disrespect here.

232
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,176
Bentley, McLaren, Aston...

233
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,736
No contest. You're sure about that?
No contest?

234
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,736
Challenge one...

235
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,496
A grand tourer must make life
easy on its driver

236
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,296
so you will now
compete in a cruise-control race.

237
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,256
McLaren versus Mercedes,

238
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,096
one lap of the circuit using
only the cruise-control buttons.

239
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
No touching the pedals.

240
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,856
Yes.

241
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,816
In this super GT shoot-out, it
would be Flintoff in his McLaren

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,776
against Frentzen
in a very potent Mercedes.

243
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,656
Capable of almost 200mph,

244
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,976
the GT R PRO packs almost as much
power as the McLaren

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,760
but with all the wings and fins
of a true track specialist.

246
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,816
So it was just as well, then,

247
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,800
that none of that would matter
in a cruise-control race.

248
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,136
Don't call him Herman.

249
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,936
Heinz-Harald.

250
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,656
So, remember you have to accelerate

251
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,936
and decelerate using
the cruise control.

252
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,856
If you put your foot on the brake
or the accelerator,

253
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,456
you'll get penalty points.

254
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,296
Roger. Understood.

255
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,496
Best of British to you, Heinz!

256
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,240
Three, two, one, go!

257
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,896
"Best of British to you, Heinz?"
Well, he's in our country.

258
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm giving him a warm... Heinz make
ketchup. HAI-NTZ. Who? He's HAI-NTZ.

259
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,056
He's going very quickly for
a man just on cruise control.

260
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,320
God, he's going fast.
How is he going to stop?

261
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,736
No, he's wound it up, he's got
it, he's wound it right back. Watch.

262
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,440
Brake lights. Brake lights.

263
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,216
No, he's not. Fair play to him.
Fair play to him.

264
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,496
What we are seeing here is
the subtlety and skill of a genuine.

265
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,056
F1 talent.

266
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,360
What are we deploying into this
competition? Ex-cricketer. Yeah.

267
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,376
Very well done, Heinz.

268
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,776
Well, we think we saw the
brake lights come on, didn't we?

269
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,776
At one point. Yeah, brake lights.

270
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,696
We saw brake lights. No. No way.

271
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,336
You've got your game face.

272
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,016
He is grinning. Look at that grin.
No way. No way.

273
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,376
Anyhow, this event was made
for Flintoff,

274
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,416
because he doesn't have
to touch a brake pedal.

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,136
Best of luck, Fred.

276
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,096
Three, two,

277
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
one, go!

278
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,880
Here we go. Get up to 30
and then get the cruise on.

279
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
Cruise. We're off. Yes!
He's under way.

280
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,160
Accelerating, it's not too bad.
Up to 55.

281
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,816
That was close.

282
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,176
I'm hanging on for dear life here.

283
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,800
I've done all right. Go on. Now out.
Out, out. Go on, pick up.

284
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,576
Go, go, go!

285
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,216
See, I think he's going too fast
there.

286
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,216
He's going to break here.
This is too fast.

287
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,616
I'm up to 88, I'm going to
slow down.

288
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,456
He's got to use the brakes.

289
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Down! Slow down! I'm going
to have to touch the brakes here.

290
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,016
Surely he must have known
he was going too quick.

291
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,160
I'm going into this at 43.
It's too slow, Fred, it's too slow.

292
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,176
Get on with it, Flintoff!

293
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,536
No.

294
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,296
Come on now, go, go, go!

295
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,776
Over the line!

296
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,120
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

297
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
And over the line.

298
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,576
So, our first battle was over
and, with the dust

299
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,616
falling on a typically balmy Welsh
evening, the results were in.

300
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,656
Heinz-Harald,
you went round in 2:19:1

301
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,840
and you didn't touch the pedals.

302
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,296
Freddie, you went round in 2:22:7

303
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,256
and you touched the pedal once.
Fred!

304
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,336
That's a one-second penalty,

305
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,216
so the winner is Heinz-Harald

306
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,296
and it's 1-0 to Germany.

307
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,816
Thank you. Well done.

308
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,240
A familiar scoreline.

309
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,136
What are you clapping for?

310
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,656
What... what are you clapping?

311
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,096
What are you clapping?

312
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,696
I can't believe you lost, Fred.

313
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,656
Yeah, but Heinz gave it the beans,
didn't he? God!

314
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,216
Come on, you can give me
that one. No. No? No.

315
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,976
Well, remember he's an F1 driver.

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,176
Stick him in the nets,
put a bat in his hand,

317
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,176
I'll lob a few down,
different story.

318
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,776
I have literally no idea
what you're talking about.

319
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,016
Cricket, Paddy, cricket. Yeah,
that one, yeah, the boring one.

320
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,736
Anyhow... We'll get back
to that film a little later

321
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,576
when the challenges
get even weirder.

322
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,776
But as we're all about the best
of British tonight,

323
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,176
time for a change of pace.

324
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,296
Earlier this year, Britain lost
one of its true greats - legendary

325
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,696
racing driver Sir Stirling Moss
passed away at the age of 90.

326
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,680
We wanted to pay our respects.

327
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,416
To most people,
Stirling Moss is a legendary figure,

328
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,576
a white-helmeted begoggled head
flashing past at around 150mph

329
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,360
against a background of the
international Grand Prix circuits.

330
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,456
Sir Stirling Moss was everything
a racing driver should be.

331
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,456
Moss is in the lead.

332
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,456
Speeding with his usual unruffled
skill towards the finish.

333
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,576
Sports car, F1 car,
even land-speed racer,

334
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,616
he was supremely fast

335
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,976
whatever he drove.

336
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,096
Perhaps the greatest single
phenomenon in the post-war

337
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,256
world of motor racing has been
the rise to fame of a British

338
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,160
driver called Stirling Moss.

339
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,136
He was also supremely competitive,
taking more than 200 victories

340
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,936
across a career that helped

341
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,880
to define what it meant to be
a racing driver.

342
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,856
I think if you look
back on the early racing drivers

343
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,016
and you look at the beginning
of the '50s, you know,

344
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,936
Stirling Moss stood out from that
crowd as young, focused,

345
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,120
the first professional
Grand Prix driver.

346
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,256
We met as two very keen
young drivers wishing to try

347
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,776
and make their way in motor racing
and we were

348
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,976
both very, very competitive,

349
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,336
but you appreciated that you were

350
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,856
taking your life in your hands,

351
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,616
and Stirling recognised it was

352
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,720
dangerous and was a professional
through and through.

353
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,976
But Stirling Moss was,
above all else, a gentleman,

354
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,136
a man of his word.

355
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,600
Just ask Ferrari.

356
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,736
In the early '50s,

357
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,800
Moss is the brightest young
thing on the racing scene.

358
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,856
A series of barnstorming
victories bring him to

359
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,320
the attention of the most powerful
man in motorsport, Enzo Ferrari.

360
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,336
In August 1951,
at the age of just 21,

361
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Moss gets the call from Enzo
asking him to drive for Ferrari.

362
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,936
It's a rare opportunity.

363
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,976
Ferrari is the biggest,
richest race team on the planet

364
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,880
and no Englishman has ever
driven for them before.

365
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,056
Imagine the excitement for
a young racer with their dream drive

366
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,936
so tantalisingly close.

367
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,616
I went all the way down to
Bari in southern Italy

368
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,936
with my father, being thrilled
that I had been offered to go

369
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,496
and drive for Ferrari.
I mean, this is really the thing.

370
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,296
But when Moss gets there, he finds
Enzo has reneged on their deal

371
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,336
and given the car to a veteran
Italian driver instead.

372
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,016
I found that the car had been
given to Taruffi.

373
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,776
Not that I felt anything about
Taruffi - I don't blame him,

374
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,736
but I think they might have
cabled me and said,

375
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,216
"Look, Mr Taruffi's got the car,"

376
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,056
and I was pretty annoyed.
This really hurt you, Stirling?

377
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,616
I wouldn't say it hurt me,
but it sure got me fired up.

378
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
Boy, did it!

379
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,640
1955 - the Mille Miglia.

380
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,336
A thousand-mile nonstop charge
around Italy's public roads.

381
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,496
It is Moss's first opportunity
to exact his revenge on Enzo's

382
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
ungentlemanly conduct.

383
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,696
One of the most dangerous races
on the calendar held in Ferrari's

384
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,176
own back yard, it is considered

385
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
all but impossible to win
without local knowledge.

386
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,176
Ferrari are heavy favourites,
but Moss - driving a beautiful

387
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,056
Mercedes 300 SLR - has a secret
weapon - well, two secret weapons.

388
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,696
The first - a fearless
navigator in the form of eccentric

389
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
motoring journalist Denis Jenkinson.

390
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,576
The second was this.

391
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,456
Moss called it the bog roll

392
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,696
a detailed guide to every corner

393
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,336
and every hazard
on the 1,000-mile route.

394
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,056
Basically prototype pace notes.

395
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,416
As Moss drove like a madman,
Jenkinson would scroll through this

396
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,936
and translate the notes into hand
signals for Stirling to understand.

397
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,120
Talk about trust.

398
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,176
To maintain the schedule
of the Mille Miglia,

399
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,936
cars travel at up to 180mph,

400
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,520
often on bad roads with additional
hazards from crowds of spectators.

401
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,376
Covering the 1,000-mile course
in ten hours and seven minutes,

402
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,056
Moss doesn't just beat
the Italians - he obliterates them.

403
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,856
Can you imagine driving
the roads of Italy for 1,000 miles

404
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,016
at an average speed of 99mph?

405
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,656
Even if they closed the roads today,
that would be somewhat challenging.

406
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,016
In the end, Moss finishes
over half an hour ahead

407
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,480
of the second-placed Ferrari.

408
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,016
It is the greatest feat of
endurance driving in history.

409
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,096
A superhuman effort.

410
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,616
And after celebrating
the win with his team,

411
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,696
he doesn't turn in
for a well-earned kip

412
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,856
no, he drives through the night,

413
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,016
across the Alps to Germany

414
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,680
to meet a girl... for lunch.

415
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,520
Moss may have played hard against
Ferrari but he also played fair.

416
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,616
At the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix,
stewards disqualify Mike Hawthorne.

417
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,176
Moss's closest title rival -
for restarting his stalled Ferrari

418
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,680
by pushing it the wrong way
back onto the track.

419
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,536
Moss wins but is incensed.

420
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,336
He complains to the stewards,

421
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
insisting his rival
has done nothing wrong.

422
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,976
Convinced by his argument,
they reinstate the Ferrari

423
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
driver's points and he joins
Moss for the winner's lap of honour.

424
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,696
It was very, very
sporting of Stirling to defend Mike.

425
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,736
I don't know
any other driver, frankly,

426
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,240
who would have done
that for anybody.

427
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,296
That year, Moss loses

428
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,176
the championship to Hawthorn
by one single point,

429
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,416
the fourth year in a row
he's finished second.

430
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,800
If it wasn't for his sportsmanship,
he'd have won the title.

431
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,056
Moss didn't just live for the win

432
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,480
he lived for the challenge

433
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,336
again and again getting
behind the wheel of underdog cars

434
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,096
just to see if he could embarrass
the bigger, better-funded teams.

435
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,936
If you can take a private car
and then beat the factory

436
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,280
with their very latest cars,
it is far more exhilarating.

437
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,376
And, as if the challenge
wasn't already great enough,

438
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,936
this was his attitude during
Formula One's most lethal era.

439
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,856
Imagine barrelling around a street
circuit at 100-and-something mph

440
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,296
between buildings and lampposts,
knowing that the slightest

441
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,680
mistake could be the end of you,
wearing only these for protection,

442
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,280
and driving this.

443
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,336
The Lotus 18.

444
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,440
A fragile spindle of metal
weighing less than half a tonne.

445
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,496
A machine dedicated solely to speed

446
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,760
and lightness
with no concession to safety.

447
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,216
Crash protection? Forget it.

448
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
Stirling didn't even bother
with side panels.

449
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,336
But it was in this very car
that Sir Stirling gave us

450
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,176
his greatest F1 drive of all.

451
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,576
One of the great sporting
performances of all time,

452
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,440
at the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix.

453
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,016
All around the twisting,
turning 1.9 mile circuit

454
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,496
spectators are gathered.

455
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,336
Up the hill from Sainte Devote,

456
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,456
Moss keeps the veteran Lotus
well up amongst

457
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,696
a field of brand-new 1961 models.

458
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,536
Though a competitive car
the previous year,

459
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,880
by 1961, Moss's Lotus 18
is hopelessly outdated.

460
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,736
Up against a trio of powerful,
new sharp-nosed Ferraris,

461
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,936
he isn't expected to make
the podium,

462
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,360
let alone challenge for victory.

463
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,600
But Moss, typically, decides to
prove a point to old Enzo.

464
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Even though he was way down
on power in his little Lotus.

465
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,640
Stirling took the lead early
and he refused to give it back.

466
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,976
With the Ferrari
as his constant shadow,

467
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,416
Stirling demonstrates what happens
when an irresistible force

468
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,296
of Ferraris meets
an immovable object like Moss.

469
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,336
Those two Ferraris took turns
trying to catch him

470
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,056
but he held them off
for the whole race,

471
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,120
wringing every ounce of performance
from this tiny racing car.

472
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,696
It's so delicate and light
and responsive.

473
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,536
The steering just takes tiny inputs

474
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,520
and it just squirms around
in your hand.

475
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,336
Edging to a 1.5-litre Coventry
Climax, about 150 horsepower,

476
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,880
but this thing weighs under 450kg!

477
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,440
For the race, he had the side panels
removed for more ventilation.

478
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,256
And the sense of exposure
is humbling.

479
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,400
I mean, I can stick my arm out.
Look at that.

480
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,416
And look at my seatbelts.

481
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,640
Well, you can't look at my seat
belts, because there aren't any.

482
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,760
And you, Chris, just for ten
minutes, can be Stirling Moss.

483
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,120
This is my childhood fantasy.

484
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,960
Hoo-hoo!

485
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,456
On days like these, Chris,

486
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,800
on days like these...

487
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,080
I think I'm a bit teary.

488
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,800
And the flag falls
for Stirling Moss.

489
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,656
Moss, against all the odds,
drove one of his greatest races.

490
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,576
Through the tight streets of Monaco,

491
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,256
he held them off for three hours,

492
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,040
winning the race by three seconds.

493
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,880
What a performance.

494
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,480
What a machine!

495
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,176
Moss's Monaco drive wasn't just
one of the greatest of his career

496
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,536
it was enough to make
the famously stubborn Enzo Ferrari

497
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,976
finally swallow his pride.

498
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,056
He invites Moss
to Ferrari's headquarters

499
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,736
and lays on a reception
fit for the Pope.

500
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,896
"I need you," Enzo tells Moss.

501
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,176
"Tell me the car you want
and I'll build it for you."

502
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,736
"OK," says Moss,
"I'll drive a Ferrari,

503
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,856
"but not a red one -
paint it blue - like my Lotus."

504
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,816
The deal is done.

505
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,136
The fastest driver on the F1 grid
will drive the fastest car

506
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,216
on the F1 grid.

507
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,360
The World Championship
will surely now be Moss's.

508
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,856
But before Stirling can make his
debut for Ferrari,

509
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,616
disaster strikes.

510
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,496
In early 1962,
before the start of the F1 season,

511
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,176
Moss is racing heat at Goodwood
in a Lotus when he has a crash,

512
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,416
right here on this corner.

513
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,040
A huge crash.

514
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,056
I had had a stop, I'd lost time,
I was passing,

515
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,256
as far as I can understand it,

516
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,616
a place that I would never consider
passing under normal conditions.

517
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,200
I wasn't dicing for the
last corner of the last lap.

518
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,296
All I do know is that
I went off the road in a place that

519
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,640
I never should have gone off.

520
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,776
The impact is devastating,
smashing Stirling's back, his skull

521
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,280
and both legs.

522
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,536
World reaction staggered even
his closest friends and admirers.

523
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,960
The burning question became -
would he ever drive again?

524
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,816
In a coma for a month,

525
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,976
Moss's condition isn't just
national news,

526
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
it's international news.

527
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,616
Frank Sinatra regularly calls
the hospital to find out how

528
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,480
the English racing driver is doing.

529
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,216
Moss survived, but the crash
didn't just end his season

530
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,736
it ended his career.

531
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,376
Once he'd recovered his fitness,

532
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,416
he discovered he'd lost
that racing edge,

533
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,216
those whip-crack reactions,
and he retired immediately.

534
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,336
At the age of just 32,

535
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,616
Stirling Moss' F1 career was over,

536
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,880
and he never did get
that F1 drive for Ferrari.

537
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,496
So, motor racing loses
one of its brightest stars.

538
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,936
We salute a great driver.

539
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,096
Moss would always be known
as the greatest racer never to win

540
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,000
the F1 drivers' title.

541
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,536
Somehow, in terms of Stirling Moss,
that doesn't mean much.

542
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,096
He has established a new
set of values in motor racing

543
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,696
and he is the standard
by which motor racing is judged.

544
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,096
He was someone
that embraced commitment,

545
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,616
bravery,

546
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,256
and was modest to the end.

547
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,496
He always had my admiration

548
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,816
and I will admire Stirling

549
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,400
to the day I die.

550
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,736
And maybe, after all,
Moss was lucky.

551
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,736
In the '50s and '60s,
if you raced in F1 for five years,

552
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,656
there was a 75% chance you'd die.

553
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,960
Moss managed ten years, so by rights
he should have been dead twice over.

554
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,816
Retirement almost certainly
robbed him of the world title

555
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,856
he so richly deserved
but it meant we could enjoy

556
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,720
the company of this brilliant man
for another 60 years.

557
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,216
In our minds,
we shall always remember him

558
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,656
immaculate in blue
with white helmet,

559
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,680
an air of calm serenity masking
an all-out tense, tense effort,

560
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,120
and going like
the hammers of hell.

561
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,736
Sir Stirling Moss wasn't just
one of our greatest racing drivers

562
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,296
he was one of our greatest men.

563
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,960
The very best of British.

564
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,136
He was one of a kind. There will
never be another one like him.

565
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,296
Really sad. True sporting legend.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

566
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,096
And now it's time to get back
to our grand tourer showdown, where,

567
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,216
as you'll remember, we were
taking on the might of Germany.

568
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,176
Fred had lost
the first head-to-head,

569
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,360
but there was still
plenty more to play for.

570
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,576
Day two of our Welsh Grand Tour
and our battle against our German.

571
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,440
GT rivals continued at
the magnificent Plas Newydd estate.

572
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,416
Next up, it would be Bentley versus
Porsche in a trial of comfort,

573
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,016
each taking a willing test dummy
hooked up to a heart rate

574
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,680
monitor for a relaxing
ride in the passenger seat.

575
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,320
Well, "a" passenger seat.

576
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,080
Dear.

577
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,216
Dear, dear.

578
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,896
Now, you've seen some things in your
life, but you've never seen that.

579
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,096
Don't want to stress him, Chris.

580
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,296
It's about keeping
his heart rate down.

581
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
Which would be easier
said than done.

582
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,336
Because, in a timed lap
of the grounds, each car would have

583
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,656
to negotiate twisting gravel tracks,

584
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,896
a steep descent whose run-off
area is the sea,

585
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,920
plus a smattering of bushes,
branches and low-grip grass.

586
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,936
But the passenger whose heart rate
spiked the highest

587
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,816
would cost their team
a time penalty.

588
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,456
So, reassuringly,

589
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,800
smoothness would be as important
as speed in this test.

590
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,496
How are you feeling?

591
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,416
There's a safety aspect to this.

592
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,200
The thing is,
I do feel like a massive jockey.

593
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,976
Yeah, on a very comfortable horse.

594
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,416
Should we have the flying B
up or down? Always up.

595
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,936
Because the Germans can't do that,

596
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,736
they can't say, "Do you want your
Porsche badge up or down," can they?

597
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,456
No, exactly.

598
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,456
Fantastic.

599
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,576
You've just put that up, it's
something else to impale myself on.

600
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,856
Right, gentlemen,
are you ready? Yeah.

601
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,016
We're 1-0 down. Best
of British to you. We need this.

602
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,680
Three, two, one, go!

603
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Go on, Harris!

604
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,896
God.

605
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,256
Go on, Chris, as fast as you want,
son, I don't mind. This is amazing.

606
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,616
Fred, you are a lunatic!

607
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,336
Why would you tell him,
"Go as fast as you want"?

608
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,416
Now, a normal person should find
this kind of thing at least

609
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,536
a little bit unsettling.

610
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,936
I would not want to be up there.

611
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,056
But good news for Team Britain.

612
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,600
Flintoff is not normal.

613
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,240
Actually, I think he'll be fine.

614
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,200
Cos Fred's got the resting
heart rate of a blue whale.

615
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,136
This morning, I had to put a mirror
under his nose to check

616
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,496
he were breathing.

617
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,000
Come on, Benters.

618
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,440
Just pottering round
a country estate.

619
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,280
What does that feel like up there?
What does that feel like up there?

620
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,720
The air suspension just glides.

621
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,760
Mind the tree.

622
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,320
This is so narrow.

623
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,680
Silence. He's either crashed or

624
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
he's put it into comfort mode.

625
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,560
Yes, he's going sideways.

626
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,960
It's like we're driving
into the sea.

627
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,840
Please stop. Please stop.
Right in the ABS. It won't stop.

628
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,896
King of the world!

629
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,696
Ho, ho! Don't want to stop.

630
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,360
It's so big.

631
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,800
It's quite a treat, this.

632
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,280
Bottomed out.
Go on, Chris, give it some.

633
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,520
He's encouraging me to go faster!

634
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,920
Whoa.

635
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,760
Proper tight down here.

636
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,840
Here we are.

637
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,136
He's been eating a banana.

638
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,096
Nicely done, Chris. What do you
reckon, Fred? What do you reckon?

639
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,096
I tell you what - it was bloody
lovely up here, Chris. So smooth.

640
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,240
Well driven, mate.

641
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,816
I'm glad you had a bit of fun, lads.

642
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
Nice to see you're happy.

643
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,336
I were going to say go and chill out
but you look quite relaxed.

644
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,096
I'm so happy. This air suspension
and Chris Harris,

645
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,696
it's a lovely fusion.

646
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,680
Right, next up's the Porsche. Well,
who's going on the roof of that?

647
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,440
I've done mine.

648
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,696
Yes, McGuinness was up.

649
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,160
And strapped to the top of one
of Porsche's fastest Panamiras.

650
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,616
You all right?

651
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,256
With nearly 50 horsepower
more than the Bentley

652
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,560
and better acceleration, Germany
looked to have the upper hand.

653
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,616
Especially since McGuinness
had raided the big house

654
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,400
for a comforter
in a surprising bid to play fair.

655
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,856
Now, listen, lads,
I know we're all on the same team,

656
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,416
but the world's watching and
we've got to show what Britain

657
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,776
does best,
and that's being sportsmanlike,

658
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,056
so I'm trying to
stay as calm as possible.

659
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,376
Is the roof supposed to

660
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,456
have all those creases in it
where the sucker cups are?

661
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,976
I wouldn't know. It's not something
I've done that often.

662
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,056
Have you noticed there's a lot fewer
sucker cups than he had for his run?

663
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,016
Like half as many. Yes. Yes.

664
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,496
Listen, I appreciate you're trying
to get my heart rate up

665
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,776
and I'm on your team, essentially.
I want you to win, but...

666
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,696
What else makes him get wound up?
Hair. Yeah.

667
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,296
I'm not getting involved.

668
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,336
Second funniest man from Bolton,
maybe third because Peter Kay...

669
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,456
I'm sat at home as a young child
on my bed cuddling my teddy.

670
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,736
No, you're not - you're looking at a
long straight before a stately home.

671
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,160
That thing could be doing 90 by
the time you get there. 90, Paddy.

672
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,640
Heinz, you OK? Yeah. Yeah?
Alles Gute.

673
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,416
Don't do the German accent to him

674
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,376
before he's got to drive
with me on the roof.

675
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,560
OK, I think we're ready to go.
OK, are you ready?

676
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,056
Drei, zwei, eins... Los!

677
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,096
Auf Wiedersehen!

678
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,016
Did you see it go?

679
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,160
My God.

680
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,216
No.

681
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,856
No, no, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no. He's like a rag doll.

682
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,880
A ragdoll working
well for Team Britain.

683
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,776
That's a tree!

684
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,656
That's a... My...

685
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,736
And while I had been
at least a little bit

686
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,040
concerned about
my rooftop passenger

687
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,200
it turned out Frentzen...
Teddy... wasn't.

688
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,200
Heinz, he doesn't really care,
does he?

689
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,616
He hasn't come all the way here
from the Fatherland to basically

690
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,696
come second, has he?

691
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,920
No. No.

692
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,960
Nein! Nein!

693
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,136
Do you know what? If I didn't live
in England, I'd live in Germany.

694
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,456
I love Germany.

695
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,096
Right.

696
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,776
Slower, Heinz! No! God.

697
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,376
And I do love a sausage.

698
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,856
Me too, but I'm not moving
all the way to Germany for one.

699
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,416
Yeah, but their sausages are great.

700
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,136
Not when you can get
a Richmond in Asda.

701
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,640
Slower!

702
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,696
Pffffff!

703
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
I think I just swallowed
a bluebottle.

704
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,936
A Cumberland wheel.

705
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,536
I do like a Cumberland wheel
with a stick through it.

706
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,720
Yeah? Yeah.

707
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,040
This is not good!

708
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,216
Nein! Nein!

709
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,936
Nein!

710
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,680
Jesus, the backend's out.

711
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,496
God!

712
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,120
Aaaaaaaaah!

713
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,320
All good?

714
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,696
What?

715
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,856
In the list of unpleasant things
you've done, how high up was that?

716
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,416
That's, just under
the Wall Of Death

717
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,056
and just above vasectomy.

718
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,576
So, yeah, not nice.

719
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,056
The question was, though,
which team had come out on top?

720
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
Well, the results are in, gentlemen.

721
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,376
Team Britain...

722
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,856
Yes. That's us, isn't it?

723
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,016
Two minutes 20.7.

724
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,376
No idea if that's good or bad.
It felt fast.

725
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,600
Team Germany...

726
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,736
Two minutes... Yep... 20.7. No!

727
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,496
Shut up! No way. Exactly...
Exactly the same.

728
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,136
Shut up.
I don't think I've ever seen that.

729
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,976
Do you know, the thing I like is
the difference in reactions.

730
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,040
Chris is really happy,
Heinz-Harald not so.

731
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,616
So, lads, it all comes down
to the heartbeats.

732
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,416
It's me versus the blue whale.
Here we go. OK.

733
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,936
Freddie, you peaked at 160bpm.

734
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,576
Really? That's high.

735
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,776
That's high.

736
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,216
I peaked at 16... 9 bpm. Wow.

737
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,776
It's a win for Team Britain.

738
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,096
Nine beats, Heinz-Harald,
that's not much.

739
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,056
I'm sorry, I've let you down, son,
I was trying my best to stay calm.

740
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,056
I couldn't drive any slower.
Come on!

741
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,440
It didn't feel that slow
when I was up there.

742
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,056
Excuse me.

743
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,896
Well done, boys. Well done,
your heart rate. Good lad.

744
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,936
It's come in handy, that.

745
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,000
Right, 1-1. It's all on the decider.

746
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,136
How many people can say,

747
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,440
"I sat on top of a Porsche
driven by Heinz-Harald"?

748
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,520
Yeah, you're certainly
in a select group.

749
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,400
I don't know how many people can say
they've sat on top of Chris Harris.

750
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,400
There's a long queue there,
Fred.

751
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,240
I'm not going to lie -
it was an absolute treat.

752
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,376
Before we could explore that
little road any further,

753
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,840
it was time for the last
of our grand tourer showdowns.

754
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,496
And the decider would play
out against the spectacular

755
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,720
backdrop of Penrhyn Quarry.

756
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
What have we got here?

757
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,840
A challenge.

758
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,256
A great Grand Tour should be
quick in the hands of even a novice

759
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,416
driver, no matter
the road conditions.

760
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,936
It's time to see if the Aston
has what it takes in a time trial

761
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,536
hill climb. There's only one Aston
driver, isn't there?

762
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,976
I have every faith in you.
Thank you, sir.

763
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,976
And, also, one little note, Fred,
your reading's getting better.

764
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,160
I don't know -
I stumbled over "tourer".

765
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,560
It's getting there, though.
You got the gist. You got the gist.

766
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,976
That's pretty nippy, though,

767
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,296
and it's got
Heinz-Harald behind the wheel.

768
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,776
I was going to say - that's
no novice. No. That's no novice.

769
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,096
Although I don't think
his speciality is quarry skidding.

770
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,856
Is that yours, though, Paddy? No,
not really, but we'll give it a go.

771
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,056
Paddy, Paddy, Paddy, it's 1-1.

772
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,456
It's the best of British.

773
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,760
It's all on you, son.

774
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,656
Yes, to see if the Aston could
make even a driver like McGuinness

775
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,416
quick over a challenging road,

776
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,560
our final GT test would be
a hill climb with a difference.

777
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,736
In a timed run up a winding gravel
track to the finish line

778
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,136
at the top of the quarry,

779
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,656
Frentzen would set off first
in Audi's devastatingly quick

780
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,976
592 horsepower RS Q8,
with McGuinness following a few

781
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,056
seconds later in his slower,
less powerful DBX.

782
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,136
And to prove the Aston's worth

783
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,096
in this true uphill battle,
Paddy would have to finish

784
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,136
within ten seconds
of Frentzen's time, which,

785
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,736
as the producers were keen to point
out, was one second for every

786
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,376
year the German legend had spent in
F1, at the pinnacle of motorsport.

787
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,016
But, whatever the result,
the winner would be rewarded with

788
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,000
the quick way back down the hill.

789
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,416
The one thing he will do, Paddy,
he'll push. He'll push it so hard.

790
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,680
He is competitive. Yeah.
He'll risk going off the side.

791
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,296
OK, Heinz-Harald,

792
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,080
in three, two, one, go!

793
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,120
You can see him here. Look at him -
he's going, he's going.

794
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,816
And Paddy McGuinness,

795
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,160
in three, two, one, go!

796
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,320
Come on!

797
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,840
Look at that. Go on, here he is.

798
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,080
Woohoo!

799
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,696
It sounds good. Noisy.
It sounds good.

800
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,760
Whoa, there's still dust down
from Heinz's run.

801
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,080
Got to get within ten seconds...
Of Heinz Harald. Come on, Pad.

802
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,840
This is... sketchy!

803
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,376
Bad news for Team Britain - if
Frentzen wasn't a quarry specialist,

804
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,536
he was doing one hell of a job
at faking it.

805
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,136
Wow.

806
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,056
Do you think he's got a chance?
Well, it looks bloody fast.

807
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,920
Look at the rooster tail of dust
coming off the back of it.

808
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,360
Come on.

809
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,136
McGuinness was giving it his all.

810
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,816
I am doing a bit of rallying

811
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,400
in a Â£160,000 Aston Martin DBX.

812
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,336
But approaching the halfway mark,
to stand any chance...

813
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,936
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

814
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,160
He'd have to find another level.

815
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,096
Would you describe
Paddy McGuinness as a brave man?

816
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,376
I've always said there's a fine line
between bravery and stupidity. Yep.

817
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,280
Paddy had never treaded that line.
He's stupid. Yeah.

818
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,456
Again, again, again,
go on, go on, go on.

819
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,680
Come on, go, go.

820
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,816
I'm doing it for Gareth Southgate,

821
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,416
I'm doing it for Stuart Pearce.

822
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,056
I'm doing it for Chrissie Waddle,

823
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,536
Darius Vassell.

824
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,040
This is for you, boys!

825
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,200
Come on. Where are they? Where are
they? There they are, see? See?

826
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,016
Left turn, left turn, left turn,
let's go, go, go, go.

827
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,976
That's going to cost me
a few seconds.

828
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,056
I think he's more than ten seconds,
don't you?

829
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,440
I think he's struggling here.
Come on, Pad.

830
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
So slidy.

831
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,280
Come on.

833
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,920
As Frentzen barrelled
across the finish line...

834
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,856
Come on!

835
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,760
McGuinness had just
a ten-second window to win.

836
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,200
Where are they?

837
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,896
Ho, ho!

838
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,496
Ha!

839
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,800
Are they done?

840
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,480
I have literally
no idea how I did then.

841
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,696
So, with both cars safely to the top
of the climb,

842
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,456
the only question now was

843
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,680
had our novice driver and
his underdog Aston done enough?

844
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,376
I think we're going to get
the news imminently.

845
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,696
This is like when they deliver

846
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,176
the Eurovision results, you know,
you're just waiting.

847
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,640
"It was slippy, lads. I couldn't
see." Here we go, here we go. Go on.

848
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,160
Not good news, I'm afraid.

849
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,376
One of you is going to have to
get your hands in your pocket,

850
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,376
get down the off-licence
and buy us some champagne,

851
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,520
cos we did it, boys!

852
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,576
Well done, Paddy, my son.

853
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,136
I've got to tell you - the position
I'm in at the minute,

854
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,120
Chris, I don't feel like a winner.

855
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,456
Ho, ho!

856
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,880
My God!

857
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,376
There he is. I've got him. I've got
him here. He looks like a meteor.

858
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,736
Woo!

859
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,936
I am flying!

860
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,336
He's lit up. He's like
a rubbish Halley's Comet.

861
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,496
Woo!

862
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,096
Here he comes.

863
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,240
Yes, boys, we've done it!

864
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,776
Jesus.

865
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,736
Go on, Paddy, lad.

866
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,776
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

867
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,976
That got the old bottom twitching,
boys - let me tell you.

868
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,656
Paddy, that is a great effort
and a great result for Team GB.

869
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,936
A great result.

870
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,576
Paddy, I'm not going to say this
very often, but I'm proud of you.

871
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,376
Thank you, boys. Well done, Paddy,
lad. We did it, brothers. We did it.

872
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,120
Well done, mate. Come on, let's go.

873
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,176
Boys?

874
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,280
Lads, what about Team GB spirit
and all that?

875
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,520
Boys?

876
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,560
Boys!

877
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,040
I can't feel my legs.

878
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,920
I'm getting pins and needles, lads.

879
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,016
Finally, 2-1.

880
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,136
All right. All right.

881
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,176
2-1.

882
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,256
Yes!

883
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,960
2-1 to Britain! Finally, we beat
the Germans in a penalty shoot-out.

884
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,736
And it's all thanks to
these beautiful British cars.

885
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,136
Look at them.

886
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,096
Is now a good time to mention
that Bentley is owned by a German

887
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,056
company and the Aston is
kind of full of German bits?

888
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,016
Why do you always have to ruin it?
It's facts.

889
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,240
These cars are as British as
Marmite. Invented by a German, Pad.

890
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,496
What, Marmite? Yes. Really? Yes.
News to me, that one, as well.

891
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,096
To be honest, they can keep it.

892
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,136
Let's focus on
what's important here.

893
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,656
I just beat a guy with three -
three - Formula 1 wins.

894
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,760
That officially makes me
an F1 legend. Thank you.

895
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,016
Thank you. Shush.

896
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,816
Paddy, stop it. Paddy,
it's not conkers, Pad.

897
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,176
You don't take all
the wins of someone you've beat.

898
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,176
And you didn't even beat him - you
just managed to keep up with him.

899
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,136
Can we talk about
the cars now, lads?

900
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,496
Normally, this is the point
where we have a big argument

901
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,736
about which is best,

902
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,016
but actually all three of them
are pretty wonderful.

903
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,936
We're all in agreement.
If I could hug you both, I would.

904
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,576
This doesn't happen
very often here. Fantastic.

905
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,016
Three brilliant British GTs.

906
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,256
Two of them aren't technically GTs,
but you know...

907
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,336
Have a day off, Chris,
will you? Geez.

908
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,296
That's it until next week, which is
the last show of the series,

909
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,936
and get your tickets early
because it's a blockbuster.

910
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,976
Strictly, eat your heart out.

911
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,160
Top Gear's doing Blackpool!

912
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,160
See you, then! Good night!
