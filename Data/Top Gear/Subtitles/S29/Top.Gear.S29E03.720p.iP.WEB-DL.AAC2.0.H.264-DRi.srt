1
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,120
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,240
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,200
Hello. Welcome to Top Gear.

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
We're still outside with
our fantastic studio audience.

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,880
There's some absolute beauties
out there, Fred.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,760
I know. Look at this down here.
An old Mercedes Pagoda.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,160
Absolute mint condition.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,680
But that's caught my eye over there,
Paddy. TVR Tuscan.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,320
I tried to buy one when I was
younger but couldn't get it insured.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,200
Something for everyone out there.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,080
Especially... Look at him! Look
at the eyes on him. Look at him!

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,400
I can't get enough of it.
I can't get enough of it.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,320
Look what we've got
out here, people.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
We've got everything from a TR7...

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,560
We've got a G Series
911 Speedster

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,640
and one of 26 Jensens made
in the mid to late '90s.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,560
I mean, it's rocking horse poo,
that stuff. Paddy?

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm in heaven. Very close to heaven.
BBC One, to be precise.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,720
And they're spoiling us as well!

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,760
Gary Lineker doesn't get
a big stage.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,800
No, but he does earn some money,
though, doesn't he, Padd?

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,040
In fact, BBC One, if you're
watching, keep the stage.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,920
We'll have Gary's wages.

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Tonight we're talking about
the greatest cars of all.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
Not supercars, not sports cars,
but hire cars.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Drive 'em like an idiot,
hand 'em back when you're done.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,920
You know what they say -
"Don't be gentle, it's a rental."

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,720
So way back in February,
to celebrate the humble hire car,

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,000
we decided it was time the three
of us went on a mini break.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,240
Cyprus.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,480
The balmy Mediterranean island

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,040
that's home to white,
sandy beaches,

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,640
craggy peaks,

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,120
and officially the cheapest
hire cars in Europe.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,800
The perfect place, then,
to celebrate the joy of rentals.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Cyprus!

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Why have you got so much stuff?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
What have you got in them bags?
We're on holiday.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,720
They said a couple of days away.

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,680
Right, lads, here we go.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,800
We're here for two days.

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,880
In here is the money
to rent your car.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,920
Thank you.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,640
30 euros.

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
Hang on, so you get 15 euros a day?!

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah. To hire a car? Well done,
Paddy. Thank you. Well done.

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
I reckon we go Budget, then,
there. Look, Budget.

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,040
You either go big-name corporate or
you go local. I'm going local, boys.

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,080
Always go local
cos you can haggle.

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,160
You can't haggle with Mr Avis.
He's a corporation. Haggle.

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,640
Leave this to me.
Leave this to me, boys.

52
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
Yassas. Hello.

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Hello. I like that.
Hello there. Welcome.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,960
Right. Chaps, I've got 30 euros.
Have a look at me.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,120
I want something stylish and
refined. For 30 euros? For 30 euros.

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
30 euros, right.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,960
We'll start with that one.
About 86 euros.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,120
No, no, no, no, no, no.

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,960
30 euros, I'll need something
for two days.

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,120
A little cabriolet would be nice,
wouldn't it? For 30? For 30 euros?

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,640
Well, what're you saying?
Let's haggle. Let's haggle. Come on!

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,120
What insurance do you want with
that? Do you want it full covered?

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,040
How much is that? It's an extra 20.
Forget the insurance.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,640
Don't worry about that. We're very
careful, very good drivers.

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,240
Well, two of us are.

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,800
I've only gone and done it, boys.
Your turn next. Thank you!

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,640
With the haggling bar
set very high...

68
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,280
Hurry up! What's the excess on that?

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,200
1,500 euros. Aw, Jesus.

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
..Flintoff and Harris decided
they'd attack the desk together.

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,800
I want something big...ish. Yeah.
Quite rugged. 30 euros as well.

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,760
Like that pick-up.
How much is the pick-up?

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,720
Pick-up is about 90 euros
for two days. About 90.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,880
What're you looking at? I just
want something small and nippy.

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,360
OK, so you're two days as well?

76
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,560
Yes, please. Small and nippy.

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,720
Lads, top tip... Give me your
licence and your credit card.

78
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,720
There you go. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,160
Coutts. The Queen's bank?!

80
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,120
Ho-ho! May I touch this card?

81
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,200
Put us all on the Coutts card.

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
Lovely.

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,080
So three deals done,

84
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,520
Harris posher than ever,
and with keys in hand,

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
next we headed to the car park

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,800
to see what treasures they'd unlock.

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,080
You don't look clever doing that.

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,880
Hang on, I can hear summat.

89
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,240
There she blows!

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,320
Not that thing. I've got myself
a beauty. Thank you.

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
Kindred spirits!

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Paddy, are you on a retainer
from Henry Ford?

93
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,760
The old Focus CC.

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,680
I mean, that is the worst looking
car.

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,200
Fred, do you think this is the one

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
of the most awkward-looking cars
ever made?

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,640
It's horrible. Excuse me.
Do you know who styled this?

98
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,960
Pininfarina. Pininfarina,
thank you very much!

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,920
Who styled what, Chris? Everyone has
an off day. What, Chris?

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Everyone has an off day. Who were
they associated with, Chris?

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
The odd Ferrari. Ferrari.

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,800
I tell you what -
I am living the dream here, boys!

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
It's always reassuring
when the black rubber bits

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,280
have got body-coloured paint on it.

105
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,560
Dear God. Is that all the damage?

106
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,040
Right, you better click yours.
I don't have a clicker.

107
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,560
That is old school. Look at that!
We have to find it. It's a Suzuki.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Suzuki! I like a Suzuki.
So it's one of two things.

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,360
It's either a very small city car...

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
Ey'up.

111
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,320
..or that.

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,160
It is the Jimny.
You like a Jimny?

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,560
I love a new Jimny.
I've never driven the old one.

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,360
You're in for a treat.
It's 15 euros a day.

115
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
That's a bit of a worry.
This here's not quite down, is it?

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't worry about that.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
I think if you applied that
level of detail to it, Fred,

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
you might be disappointed.

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,880
I'm happier with that than yours.

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Please. No? This is not even allowed
on the same car park as mine.

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Shut up. It's a Jimny. But we're
on holiday. I'm in a good mood.

122
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm not going to go there. Come on,
Chris. What you got? Right, lads.

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,160
No clicker. Please, Paddy.
Paddy. Paddy, please.

124
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,640
Now, I've got...
I don't know what's coming here.

125
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,280
Please, please. What is the reg?
Please say ZK. Please.

126
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Z. Z what? K? K? K. ho!

127
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,000
# Saturday night
I feel the air is getting hot. #

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
It's a Kia Picanto, isn't it?

129
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,040
# Like you baby. #

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Right, lads. Come on, talk us
through it, Chris. A Picanto.

131
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,360
A hire car - small, nimble,
park it anywhere.

132
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
This is the one.

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
Come on. You're trying to take
the positives out of this.

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,120
You do not like this car.
Now, look here.

135
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
What happens when Brits arrive on
holiday? They get the convertible.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
First day, they put the roof down
and they blister. I've got a roof.

137
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
First thing - always have
a roof on your hire car.

138
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
That's the first...

139
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,880
When you go to anywhere sunny,
I always request I must have a roof.

140
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,720
I do as well. Yeah.
I don't want to see the sun.

141
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,320
This will have air conditioning.

142
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,560
Please have air conditioning.
Please have air...

143
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,240
It's not got air conditioning,
has it?

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Doesn't have air conditioning. No.

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,800
It's got a vinyl seat there as well.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,080
Lovely touch. This is going to be...
Moist is the word.

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,680
Get yourself in there, son.

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,760
Right. Pininfarina, let's go.

149
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,400
One More Time
by Daft Punk

150
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,640
Flintoff's stalled it already.

151
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,320
Not just once, Chris, but twice.

152
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,080
# One more time. #

153
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,360
Lovely stuff.

154
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
I tell you what, gentlemen.

155
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,760
You can keep your Rolls-Royces
and your Monte Carlos.

156
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,720
I'd sooner be driving my hire car
along the beachfront in Cyprus.

157
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,520
Look at this! Tell you what -
I like it down here, lads.

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,960
I am so happy. For 15 euros a day,
I've got myself a Suzuki Jimny.

159
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,280
The thing about the Jimny is don't
be fooled how cute they are.

160
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,160
These are proper machines.

161
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,200
Four-wheel-drive, brilliant
off-road. They're nippy around town.

162
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,280
All right, it's a bit dirty inside.
There's a bit of rust.

163
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,120
Roof's not the best.

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,920
But I'm happy.

165
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,840
How's the cars running, boys?

166
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,640
Mine is running sweet as a nut.

167
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
It's really, really tight.

168
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,840
118,000 km.

169
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,440
Could easily be 40,000.

170
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
That's a lie.

171
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,720
The Picanto has a few issues.
She's steering really nicely.

172
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,480
Suspension's good but the clutch
has got a horrible lump in it.

173
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
So it comes off the floor slowly

174
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,360
and then you've got that
sort of big, springy reaction.

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,800
You know what I mean.
You've all driven one like it.

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,000
This is not helped by the fact

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,280
that the throttle is effectively
an on-off switch.

178
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Suddenly you get everything.

179
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,320
So this is not an easy car
to drive smoothly.

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Do you know, it's lovely.

181
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Plenty of room, smooth ride.

182
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,880
I've got the biggest engine
out of the three.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,760
1,600, this.

184
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,640
Aircon, cabriolet, hard top.

185
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,560
Nothing this car can't handle.

186
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,120
Straight off the bat, lads.
Car's running lovely.

187
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,800
It doesn't look lovely
from the rear, Paddy.

188
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
Like you, Chris.

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,160
It's quite the eyeful in
my windscreen, to be honest.

190
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,280
A little yellow Kia with a little
bald head popping up and down.

191
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,440
You look like a Poundland
transformer.

192
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,440
Truth be told, though, for the price
of a London gin and tonic,

193
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,040
none of us had much
to complain about.

194
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,080
Go on, boys!

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,600
We'd managed to bag
three absolute bargains.

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,040
And it got us thinking about
the lost art of the haggle.

197
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,080
Right, Flintoff, your whole life
is one haggle.

198
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,720
You won't even buy a packet of
Wine Gums without asking 20p off.

199
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
You're right, Chris.
What I do with things,

200
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,000
I have a price I'm prepared to pay,

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,560
and I'm prepared to walk
away from anything.

202
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, for someone
like yourself, Chris,

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
haggle's probably
a new thing to you.

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,360
Cos obviously you bank at Coutts,

205
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,560
you've never haggled
for anything in your life.

206
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,400
I haggle more than you two
put together.

207
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,640
Aw! You're dreaming, Chris.
You're absolutely dreaming.

208
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,360
Please don't start with the...

209
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,920
Put your hands up if you've been
asked to leave John Lewis

210
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,560
because your haggling technique
was too aggressive.

211
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,080
Hands up if you've ever said a more
middle-class statement in your life.

212
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,120
"Hey, have you ever been asked
to leave John Lewis?"

213
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,520
I mean, come on!

214
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,560
"Bloody hell, Paddy.

215
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,120
"They don't like haggling
in Selfridges neither."

216
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,360
Since actions speak
louder than words,

217
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,920
it was just as well we'd been told
to head to Cyprus' only racetrack

218
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,480
so we could start figuring out who'd
really haggled the best hire car.

219
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
Look at this!

220
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,960
This is superb!

221
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,320
Yassas!

222
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,280
Electric windows,
still functioning. Thank you.

223
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,400
Lads, we've got a challenge here.
"Time for some hot laps.

224
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,840
"To see how your hire cars
handle summer temperatures,

225
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,920
"their interiors will now
be heated to 40 degrees.

226
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,440
"Windows up, fastest lap wins.

227
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,040
"And watch out for
the local traffic."

228
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,760
40 degrees.

229
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm wearing the heaviest denim

230
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,360
you can actually buy in
the shops at the moment.

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,600
Two words - ball soup.

232
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,800
Yes, to see how we'd cope with
the classic holiday hire car hazards

233
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,680
of boiling interiors
and unpredictable traffic,

234
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,120
the producers would now
superheat our cars' cockpits

235
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,760
before sending us out to set
the fastest time possible,

236
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,640
all while avoiding the traffic

237
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,840
heading the wrong way
round the track.

238
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,360
Imagine how chuffed I was, then...

239
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
Bloody hell.

240
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,120
..that I was up first.

241
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,240
You warm in there?
It's absolutely roasting.

242
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,600
Can we crack on with this, please?
It's a bit close out here as well.

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Right, Mr Harris will be timing you.

244
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
You're going to have traffic coming
the opposite way so do be careful.

245
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,920
You're in quite a high-sided
vehicle there.

246
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,000
You're going to set off
on the green flag.

247
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm off...in the Jimny.

248
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,840
This is not the car for this job.

249
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,080
The thing with this Jimny,
it's high-sided.

250
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,000
He's high-sided naturally.

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,280
Don't clip the kerb.
Don't clip the kerb.

252
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,040
Just feel it all going over!

253
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,840
Stay up, stay up, stay up!
No, no, no!

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,200
So hot.

255
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Here come the other cars.

256
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,400
Bloody hell!

257
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,040
Look at that. Dear.

258
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
My word!

260
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,640
Mitsubishi just came from nowhere!

261
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,880
Dear, dear, dear.

262
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,120
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Go, go, go!

263
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

264
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,240
Ooh.

265
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,680
He's tried the handbrake. It's never
going to happen on this Jimny.

266
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,040
You glad to be out?

267
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,120
Horrible. It is warm in there,
I'll give him that.

268
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Can't imagine that was fast at all.
Well, we don't know, do we?

269
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,920
But you did it in 3:15.

270
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,760
That's the time to beat. Looked
pretty good to me. Did it? Yeah!

271
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm not going to beat that
in the Picanto, am I?

272
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,160
Get lost. This is horrendous.
I can't even hold...

273
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,520
I basically can't breathe in here.
It's horrendous.

274
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,760
And anything that's metal,
I can't touch.

275
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,080
I do feel for you, because not only
is it 40 degrees in that car,

276
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,680
but you've got all that hair
on your back as well.

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,560
Can we get on with this?
I genuinely...

278
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,760
I won't last long in here like this.
It's horrendous.

279
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,400
Absolutely horrendous.

280
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,840
What's the time to beat, Fred?

281
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,880
I don't know. What is it?
3 minute 15?

282
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,080
Was it 3:15? The time?

283
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,760
Was it 3:15? Yeah. Think it was.

284
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't care about his time!
Just let me go!

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
Pipe down. You're going
to make yourself hot.

286
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,960
Look at him. 3 minutes 15 seconds
to beat. You go on the green flag.

287
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,120
Best of luck.

288
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
The flag'll be going
any minute, Chris.

289
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,960
Can't even hold the cocking
steering wheel!

290
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,200
Go! Look at that!
Little wheel spin.

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,960
The little wheel spin
on the Picanto!

292
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,840
This is horrible in here.

293
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,320
I can't change gear cos
it burns my flipping hand.

294
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,680
It's an angry lap, this,
by an angry man.

295
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,600
Come on, the Picanto!

296
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,760
He's showing off now.

297
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,240
15 quid, that car! You don't
want to be doing that!

298
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,480
Whoa, got to be careful here.

299
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,800
Please stay on your side
of the road, minivan.

300
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm not losing to Flintoff...

301
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
..in a bloody comedy off-roader.

302
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,560
What we on here? 2:30.
What is it, 3:15?

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,440
No!

304
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,760
I was anxious
watching that, Chris.

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,680
Do you want the good news
or bad news?

306
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,040
Can I have the bad news?

307
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,360
Bad news - fantastic handbrake
turn in the Picanto.

308
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,000
Cameras weren't on you,
but we enjoyed it. Yeah.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,400
There wasn't a single camera?
No, but looked good.

310
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,480
That's the bad news.
So the good news?

311
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,560
Good news is you beat me.
You beat the Jimny.

312
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,120
By how much? Just over ten seconds.

313
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
3:04:56.

314
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,080
Over to you in the Penis-farina.

315
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,360
Wow. He's been thinking of that one
for three minutes, four seconds.

316
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
Thank you very much.

317
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,440
I'll make sure the cameras
are on me for my handbrake.

318
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,080
Are you going to do one? Was there
really no-one on that? No-one on it.

319
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,840
Nevertheless, the Picanto
was still the car to beat

320
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,880
as finally McGuinness lined up
in his very hot Focus.

321
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,280
No. Here we go.

322
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,880
Time for the vest. Look at
the state of him. Right, Patrick.

323
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
You've got 3:04 to beat,
which is probably unlikely,

324
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,840
so you might want to aim for 3:15.

325
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,360
That's probably more your level.

326
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,440
Ooh!

327
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,200
Ooh!

328
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Ready when you are. Pathetic.

329
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,040
"You ought to aim for 3:15."

330
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,720
Right, Paddy.

331
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,880
He's off.

332
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,080
God, the car is so heavy!

333
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,760
The trouble is, with the Focus,

334
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,880
it looks lovely but it drives
like a bag of spanners.

335
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
That doesn't look too quick, that.

336
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,960
Aw, the understeer's ridiculous!

337
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,040
It's a curiously ungraceful thing,
isn't it? It's horrible.

338
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,400
Where's he going?! Out of the way!

339
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,800
No. Ooh!

340
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,000
The understeer!
Nearly went into the Mini.

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
It isn't nice when they're coming
and you're just drifting out.

342
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,760
Out the way!

343
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
Jesus!

344
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
What is that?!

345
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
Idiot!

346
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
It's going to be tight.
It's going to be tight.

347
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
Whoa!

348
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,800
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

349
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,360
So what's our strategy
if he does win?

350
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,600
Cos he'll do that,
"Aw, look at me! Aw! Aw!"

351
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,240
That'll do.

352
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
And stop.

353
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,520
You've stopped it? Yes.
Right, got it. Good lad.

354
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,040
Good lad, Fred.

355
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
Look at him.
He's so happy with himself!

356
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,000
Dear.

357
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,880
What's he done?
I'll leave it here.

358
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,280
I feel like I know what a tomato
feels like in a greenhouse.

359
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,000
You want the good news
or the bad news?

360
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,480
I know what you're going to say.

361
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,920
The good news - they got
the handbrake turn.

362
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,960
No, no, no. Bad news -
wasn't quick enough.

363
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
The good news is you exceeded
all expectations.

364
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
Thank you.
We thought you'd be miles off.

365
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,400
The bad news is, you were three
tenths of a second slower than me.

366
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,720
My God, no!

367
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Three tenths of a second.
So, if you hadn't...

368
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
If you'd gone one corner slightly
quicker, you'd have had me.

369
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,880
Who was in charge of the timer?
Paddy, Paddy, Paddy, I'll stop you.

370
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,640
I feel a little bit conflicted
as an ex-sportsman. Right.

371
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,760
I don't like to cheat. Right.

372
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,400
Chris made me add another second on.

373
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,560
Was there any need for that?

374
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,000
Was there any need for that?
I had to come clean, I'm sorry.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,160
It's this whole North-South thing,
isn't it?

376
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
The whole northern thing.

377
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,240
Can I just say, that's what it's
all about in this game. Cricketers.

378
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,840
Sportsmanship.

379
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,240
Right, I'm just going to go
and give myself a quick wet wipe.

380
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,600
I thought we had...
I thought we were down. I couldn't.

381
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,800
I thought we were down.
I was feeling bad. I was guilty.

382
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,400
It stopped him doing the big
celebration, though, didn't it?

383
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,360
He didn't do the big... We're onto
something there, aren't we? Yeah.

384
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,680
Actually, sorry. I think
he's a better man for it. Yeah.

385
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,040
I forgot something. Yeah, what?

386
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,160
Yes!

387
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,240
I can't deal with it. Have it!

388
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,760
I should have lied. Have it!

389
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,400
Give me them wet wipes out.

390
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,520
Chris?

391
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,240
I hope they've been in the fridge.

392
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,960
So, the mighty Focus
had taken the win,

393
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,600
and it was time to celebrate
with a bit of top-down motoring.

394
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
This is living.

395
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Better yet, for our next test,

396
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,560
we'd been told to head to
a local reservoir.

397
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,680
I think I spy a gravel road ahead,
lads.

398
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,920
And reaching it meant it was
time for a bit of

399
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,760
hire car driving heaven.

400
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,200
Come on, then, Jimny,
a bit of off road.

401
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Now this is what rental car-ing
is all about.

402
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,880
Exactly.

403
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,040
When you take it back, yeah,

404
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,680
they look round it with
a fine-tooth comb,

405
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
but they never look underneath it,
do they?

406
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
This is fun.

407
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,240
A bit of a hump.

408
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,760
Yes.

409
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
The Picanto's got 65 horsepower,

410
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,080
but suddenly, off-road, it feels
like it's got about 300.

411
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,080
Love it.

412
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,480
Unfortunately, though, it didn't
take long for the two...children

413
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,320
to get overexcited.

414
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
He's going.

415
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,800
This will be
bread-and-butter for the Jimny.

416
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,640
Whoa!

417
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,240
The Jimny's here.

418
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,040
I can see the Jimny.

419
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,360
Come on, Paddy!

420
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,320
It's a tough little
bugger, this.

421
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,520
He's got me.
Need a bit of flat.

422
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,160
Here we go. Shunt!

423
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,480
Whoa!

424
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,600
Whoa!

425
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,280
We're supposed to be
looking after these.

426
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,680
The front of your car's taken
a battering, mate.

427
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,440
A few hundred quid, I reckon, Pad.

428
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,960
It's all right for you, Mr Coutts.

429
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,480
The rest of us are in normal banks.

430
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,720
Fred, the bodywork were all right
until you cut me off.

431
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,480
Cut you off? You hit me.

432
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,760
Half of your car went missing
when you went through a big puddle.

433
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,200
And then you just decided to
drive into me.

434
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
In me defence, and I don't know
if this is an argument you can have

435
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
with the car hire people,
but if I say,

436
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,840
"Look, lads, it were a gravel road,"

437
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,920
they'll forgive me for that,
won't they?

438
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,760
Unlikely.

439
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,560
Still, before McGuinness could
rearrange any more of his

440
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,920
dreadful Italian styling, we
arrived at the reservoir.

441
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
I see a challenge there, lads.

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,480
Challenge!

443
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,960
Here we go, then.

444
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,920
Time for a drag race.

445
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,640
"To test the performance
of your hire cars,

446
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,480
"they will now drag you on water
skis across this lake."

447
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,680
How? Hang on a minute.
Have you ever water skied?

448
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,840
Once, for about ten minutes.
Whatever. Seriously.

449
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
Have you?

450
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,720
Of course he has. He was brought
up in the Caribbean.

451
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Here we go. All that, "Wey!"

452
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,680
"Faster, Daddy, faster."

453
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,520
He's going to be good at this. He
might have found something. God.

454
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,680
Come on, then. Let's get down there.

455
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,040
There's nothing better than watching
a rookie water-skier swallow water.

456
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,560
Again, you're off with
your middle-class statements again.

457
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,920
Especially a gobby one with
stupid ears.

458
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,840
"Nothing better than a rookie
water-skier."

459
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,200
Who says that?
Try and talk your way out of this.

460
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,840
Right, in what has to be the worst
possible way to test performance,

461
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,600
our hire cars would now become
water ski tow ropes.

462
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
Yep, jacked up,
with a front wheel removed,

463
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,360
you simply hit the accelerator
to reel in the skier.

464
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,880
And since we'd be the ones
in the water, to make things fair,

465
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,600
local pro George will be
taking the wheel.

466
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,920
Hang on a minute, I think I've
just spotted Gollum's stunt double.

467
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,680
Here he is. My word.

468
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,080
When they show this on the telly,
they'll have that music,

469
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,960
like when Daniel Craig comes
out of the sea.

470
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,280
No, no, what they'll play is the
theme tune to the Lord Of The Rings.

471
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,400
Yeah, I don't know where
I should be looking,

472
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,120
but where I am looking,
I shouldn't be.

473
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,480
This is George. Hello.

474
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Hello, George, how are you?
I'm good.

475
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
Very experienced
in the old water-skiing.

476
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,120
I've done it once before. Don't
start that. That's excellent.

477
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
Now, he's been saying how good
he is. Grew up doing it.

478
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
How different is it to being
towed by a boat?

479
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,760
A lot.

480
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,080
Now, to give us a fighting chance,

481
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,200
we'd each be given three goes to
record a speed.

482
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,880
And since he's
so keen on his watersports,

483
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,920
first up was the Hobbit
and his Picanto

484
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,120
to show us all how it's done.

485
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,240
Are you ready, George?

486
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,000
He's off, he's off.

487
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,920
He's up, he's up.
No!

488
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Fantastic, Chris!

489
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,600
Take two! He's up, he's up.
Go, go, go.

490
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,040
He's doing it again.
Go on, Harris! Go on, Harris!

491
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Two goes down
and no results on the board.

492
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,720
Come in, Chris,
this is embarrassing.

493
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,160
Right, we're going to get it.

494
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,160
The pressure was on for Harris's
final attempt.

495
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,480
Ay oop.

496
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,760
Go on, Harris!

497
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,400
He's still going.
Ay oop.

498
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,840
That's a good effort.

499
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
Here he is now.

500
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,360
Come on, George, come on!

501
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,480
Brilliant, Chris, brilliant.

502
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Hey, you're a natural.

503
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,880
The speed was 15mph, one-five.

504
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,160
No need for that.
Absolute weapon.

505
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,840
With a score now to aim for,

506
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,080
McGuinness was next out
the changing room.

507
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,600
My word.

508
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,680
Safety first with them goggles,
Pad?

509
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,920
Contact lenses, Fred.

510
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,520
Is that what it is? You can never be
too careful in this game.

511
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
I might borrow them for mine.
My...

512
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,200
What are those?

513
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,720
These? Yes.

514
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,440
I've seen you lot in Monte Carlo.
I know what you wear.

515
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,840
Hang on a minute, you what?

516
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
What?!
Him, him. You what?

517
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,360
Him and his family.

518
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,400
Rubbish trash talk out of the way,
the Focus was lined up,

519
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,160
while Paddy headed out on the water.

520
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,760
15's the time to beat.

521
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,840
You know what's going to happen
here, don't you?

522
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,920
He's going to get up first time
and smash it.

523
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Or then again...

524
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
..maybe not.

525
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,440
Hey-hey-hey!

526
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
Come on, Padd, keep going, son!

527
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
Come on. This time.

528
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

529
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,800
Going, Padd. Go on, lad!

530
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,520
He's doing it. He's on.
No, he's not.

531
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,160
Lads!

532
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,360
Yeah?

533
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,920
I think I'm going to go to plan B.

534
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,640
What was plan A?

535
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,520
I don't know.

536
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,920
I know one thing. What?

537
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I've definitely got gastroenteritis.

538
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,240
Here he goes, here he goes, here he
goes. Come on, come on, come on.

539
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,080
Go. Flat out!

540
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,640
It's going to rub his hair off,
this.

541
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
Ha!

542
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,440
What's next, plan C?

543
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,680
You got all these big guns

544
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,840
and you've got
the arm strength of four-year-old.

545
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
I couldn't breathe, you dickhead!

546
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,160
Thanks, Paddy. Thank you.

547
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,320
Do you want your speed?

548
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,960
It says here you got 3mph.

549
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
Three-zero?

550
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Three.

551
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,920
So, with the Picanto
well in the lead,

552
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
all we had to do now was wait

553
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,920
for McGuinness to get out
of the water...

554
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,600
I used to be a lifeguard.

555
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,080
If any of you get in trouble
in the water, give me a shout, boys.

556
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,280
..and then wait

557
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,280
to see what the world's
most competitive man could do

558
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,640
with his Jimny.

559
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,680
He's just holding on for dear life.

560
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,960
He's up. I told you he'd do it.
I told you he do it.

561
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,760
Is he in? He's in. He's down.

562
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,480
We're on again. Come on, lurch!

563
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,160
Here he goes. He's up again.

564
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,520
He's in now. There he goes.

565
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,320
No. There he goes.

566
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,040
There he goes.

567
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,120
You all right? He keeps stopping.

568
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah, that's cos you've fallen in.
Tell him not to stop.

569
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,200
Give it the berries, George.
Just rip his arms off. Yes.

570
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,600
You've seen the size of him.

571
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,720
This is the big one now.

572
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,080
Come on, here we go.

573
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Come on, see if we can get up.

574
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,360
Here we go, we're moving.

575
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,200
He's up, he's up.
Here he comes now. Here he comes.

576
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,720
# How d'you like me now? #

577
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,840
He's going, he's going, he's going!

578
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,400
# How d'you like me now? #

579
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,720
Yes!

580
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,200
You've not timed him. I have.
What did I get?

581
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,880
12. Shut up!

582
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,040
I was flying down there.

583
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,480
Right, come on,
let's get you dried off.

584
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,880
Cos I was a lifeguard,

585
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
do you want me to show you
how we do the eggbeater leg kick?

586
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,960
I'll save you. Come on.
Hold on to them. The what?

587
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,240
Help.

588
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,040
Don't worry, I'm here.
I've had a freak skiing accident...

589
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,240
This is what we used to do...
..with a Suzuki Jimny.

590
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,680
..when I was
at Horwich Leisure Centre.

591
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,600
Stay still. Don't panic.

592
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,120
Don't panic.

593
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,120
OK.

594
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,560
He's a bit bigger than my normal...

595
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,840
Ooh, I've hurt me foot on a ski.

596
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,680
Did you? You kicked it then.
Hang on.

597
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,440
We're going to get you
on the side, sir.

598
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,240
Give you mouth-to-mouth.

599
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
You worry about that
when you're there.

600
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,080
Grab his hand, Mr Harris.
No, I'm not touching him.

601
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,440
He'll drag me in.

602
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,760
He's going to drag me in.
I'm not getting dragged in.

603
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Mr Harris. No.
This man's drowning! No.

604
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,280
Come on!

605
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,840
Get hold of him.

606
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,200
OK. If he drags me in...

607
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
Hurry up!

608
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,320
Get hold!

609
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,600
No, no, I don't...

610
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,400
I hate you!

611
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,440
What can I say, boys?

612
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,520
Some of us are born
natural sportsmen.

613
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,000
Some of you aren't so lucky.

614
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,480
It's not even a sport, mate.

615
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,320
You were water-skiing 15mph.

616
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,520
I can do that on a pedalo.

617
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,920
He wasn't even water-skiing.
He was just dragged...

618
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,560
It was like landing a pilchard!

619
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,400
A pilchard.

620
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,960
Stop deflecting, you. You've already
crashed a Lamborghini.

621
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,680
This week you've crashed
another car.

622
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,160
You're a serial crasher.

623
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,640
You are a pilchard.

624
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,280
OK, we'll get back
to our big hire car adventure

625
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,120
a little later in the show,
but before that a question -

626
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,720
money's no object -
what's the ultimate family car?

627
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,680
Well, I reckoned I knew the answer.

628
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,160
As did I.

629
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,560
So the producers ordered these two
to report to the Top Gear test track

630
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,000
for an argument.

631
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,160
Right, the ultimate family car
can only be an estate.

632
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Specifically, this estate.

633
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
The new Audi RS6 Avant.

634
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,560
92,000 angry-looking pounds worth

635
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,600
of big-booted four-wheel-drive
practicality...

636
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,080
..strapped to the back
of a 600 horsepower twin turbo V8...

637
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,960
..rocket.

638
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,400
0 to 60 a little over three seconds.

639
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,640
Top speed 190mph.

640
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,360
Wow.

641
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,480
Little boost gauge flickers
and then it just goes!

642
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,560
So it's stinking quick

643
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,480
but stinking quick Audi estate cars
are nothing new.

644
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,800
Now, what's new is this one is
actually quite good fun to drive.

645
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,440
There's something inherently naughty
about a car that's shaped like this

646
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,760
for carrying dogs
and family and clobber...

647
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,120
..that will do this.

648
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,480
What a weapon! What a weapon!

649
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,320
Ultimate family car!

650
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,080
You'd have to be an idiot
to consider anything else.

651
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,680
The ultimate family car, you say?

652
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,280
For me, it's got to be this.

653
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,960
The Lamborghini Urus.

654
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,160
Yes, folks,
Lamborghini have done an SUV...

655
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,840
..and it's the absolute business!

656
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,800
You see, boxy estates are
the old answer to the family car.

657
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,640
These days, everyone wants an SUV,

658
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,760
and the Urus might just be
the most exciting SUV ever made.

659
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
It costs 160 grand.

660
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,480
It's packing 641 horsepower.

661
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,160
And as the Italians say,

662
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,960
it goes like cacca off a pala.

663
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
It's fast!

664
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,160
How the hell...

665
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,600
..have they got a car of this size
and weight to perform like it does?

666
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,680
I mean, the engineering
on this thing is unbelievable.

667
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,880
It's Hogwarts level, it's magic!

668
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,320
Look at it, it's an SUV
and it's driving like a supercar!

669
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,320
And there's loads of room in it

670
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,080
for your expensive family

671
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,600
and your expensive dog.

672
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,280
I mean, come on.

673
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,680
If you're talking the ultimate
money-is-no-object family car,

674
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,360
this is the answer.

675
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,640
But since Harris would have you
spend your hard-earned elsewhere...

676
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,120
Wow.

677
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,280
That is just horrendous.

678
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,960
..we thought it best to talk it out
like grown-ups.

679
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,080
Predictable. Boring.

680
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Before we get onto the cars,

681
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,000
what the hell are them on your feet?

682
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,520
Those are style.

683
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,800
You literally look like
that bloke in accounts

684
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,600
who thinks he's a bit wacky by
putting on pink socks.

685
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,800
That's what you are today.

686
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,040
You're an accountant

687
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,280
with pink socks

688
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,840
in your estate car.

689
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,880
OK, look, first of all,
Urus, what's an Urus?

690
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,760
It sounds like an orifice, mate.
It sounds like an exit hole.

691
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
Listen... It is a terrible name.
I can't argue with that. OK.

692
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,720
That's the one thing
I can't argue with.

693
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,640
Also, SUVs, in general, are wrong.

694
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,160
They're bigger than they need to be,

695
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,440
heavier than they need to be...
Whoa, hang on a minute.

696
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,560
You sit too high,
high centre of gravity... Listen.

697
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,200
No... The physics are all wrong.

698
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
I see a person going in a showroom
buying an estate

699
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
as someone in a grey suit
with grey socks,

700
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,960
grey face, grey hair.

701
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,320
Is there anything that thing can do
that this can't?

702
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,120
Plenty. What?

703
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,560
You can say it's a Lamborghini.
Great.

704
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,160
OK, look, we need to settle this
once and for all

705
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,720
and we're going to deploy science.

706
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,440
Now, as these are family cars,

707
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,800
their primary function in life is,
of course, the school run.

708
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,160
The average school run
in the UK is 1.6 miles,

709
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,440
so with a few cones laid out to
create a 1.6 mile handling course,

710
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,160
it was time to see which of our cars
was fastest door-to-door.

711
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,240
Quick question.

712
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,000
If home's there... Yeah.

713
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,120
..and school's there... Yeah.

714
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,240
..why are we driving
all the way round there?

715
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,960
Is it not just easier
to walk across?

716
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,120
That's why the icecaps are melting,
people like you.

717
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,520
Unnecessary journeys.

718
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,160
Look at that, straight across.

719
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
If I show you how it's done,

720
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,400
do I have to not listen to you
any more?

721
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,760
Great. Right. Off you pop.
Here we go.

722
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,280
OK. Three, two, one, go!

723
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,160
Off the line,
it just goes like a lunatic.

724
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,000
Ooh, that kicked off nicely
from there

725
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,040
with the agility
of that four-wheel steering.

726
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,240
It's fast coming up to the chicane.

727
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,680
Let's have a look.

728
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
That's quick through there.

729
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,840
So agile and fast.

730
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,480
Listen to that.

731
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,120
Cor, these big, fast estate cars
are so capable.

732
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,520
Come on, Audi.

733
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,560
It's gone well out of there.

734
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,000
Coming up to a minute now.

735
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,920
This would be a lively school run.

736
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,760
I think the children would now be
chundering quite hard.

737
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,040
Ooh.

738
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,600
Ooh!

739
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
Come on!

740
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,360
And over the line!

741
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
No way McGuinness is beating that.

742
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,280
What do you reckon? I've no idea.

743
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,320
Have a guess. One minute, 20.

744
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,600
Are you psychic? What is it?

745
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,960
One minute, 20! Yes!

746
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,760
Good lad!

747
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,400
1:20.28 to be precise.
That's the time to beat. Well done.

748
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,080
Right, you get in your horrendous
truck and try and beat that.

749
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,120
I've just been nice to you. I know.
Just try giving a bit back.

750
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,040
OK. I like your...gilet.

751
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,600
I tried.

752
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,840
Ready?

753
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,200
Three, two, one, go!

754
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
Now we're going!

755
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,480
Come on, let's do it for the SUVs.

756
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,080
However many times you see it,

757
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,800
something that big and heavy going
that fast is shocking.

758
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,560
Past all the other parent
in their estates.

759
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,320
Get out the way!

760
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,280
It's just a terrible looking
vehicle, isn't it?

761
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,160
And I hate to say it,
they're driven by terrible people.

762
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,880
Argh!

763
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,800
Ha-ha! He's on the grass! Come on!

764
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,920
This is not quick enough.

765
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,440
15, 16. 17.

766
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,240
I think Harris has got me
in the Audi.

767
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm safe. The honour
of the estate car has been saved.

768
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,360
He's going to love this.

769
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,160
Not good. What do you think?

770
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,920
1:29?

771
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,440
No, much quicker. Really? 1:24.6.
That's surprised me.

772
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,520
For a man of your skills
in a Lamborghini, that's damn good.

773
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,240
Thank you, I'll take that as praise.
Two differences. Yeah.

774
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,680
Lower centre of gravity,
proper car, truck, and...

775
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,880
..if you'd had these on,

776
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,600
you'd have gone a second quicker.

777
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,440
I'll take the second slower, thanks.

778
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,520
Anyhow, the fact of the matter is
you designed that course

779
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,320
and we need a test that reflects

780
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,360
what these cars are
actually used for.

781
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,560
What, your car? Yes.

782
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,000
Driving slowly around town
looking like a wally?

783
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,680
See you in a minute.

784
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,400
Let's face it,

785
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,760
the biggest test of any family car
is going away on your holidays...

786
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,880
..which means there's one thing
that matters above everything else.

787
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,400
Caravans?

788
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,360
That's right, son. You need to
get out in the real world.

789
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,800
This is what people are using
family cars for now.

790
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,560
When's a Lamborghini Urus
ever going to tow a caravan

791
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,360
apart from now?

792
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,160
Anyhow, very simple, this one -

793
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,600
straight drag race to the bottom,

794
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,280
first over the line wins.

795
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,040
What's your 0 to 60?

796
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,960
3.6 seconds. Same here.

797
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,480
What's your peak torque output?

798
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,920
It's got a Lamborghini badge
on the front.

799
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,760
Is that the answer
you're looking for?

800
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,880
Three, two, one, go!

801
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm just ahead!

802
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,840
It's got the legs,
it's got the legs!

803
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,040
Bye-bye!

804
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,760
McGuinness has done me.

805
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,480
What a machine!

806
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
100mph.

807
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
I mean, it's just ludicrous.

808
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,520
I can't even see him.

809
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,840
Easy meat. 120mph towing a caravan.

810
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,360
Wow. So quick.

811
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,480
Enjoy your caravan holiday, folks.

812
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,680
Too much torque in that bad boy.

813
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,200
What is he going to be
saying now?

814
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,600
So what you've proved is that
a car that will never ever tow

815
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,760
is good in a towing drag race.

816
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,160
A win's a win.

817
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,800
OK, I'll concede that you won
that one, so it's 1-1,

818
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,560
but there's no doubt

819
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,320
which one makes the driver look like
a complete arse though.

820
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,040
Says the man
in Keith Lemon's trainers.

821
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,560
Fantastic.

822
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,040
So you spent the entire day
messing about on our track

823
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,160
and still failed to reach
a conclusion? Yes. That is correct.

824
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,600
Well, it's lucky I'm here to help.

825
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,320
We're going to settle this
family car debate once and for all

826
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,040
with some Stig laps. Ooh-hoo-hoo!

827
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,960
Yes, earlier today,
we handed both of these cars over

828
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,680
to our tame racing driver to see
which was fastest around our track.

829
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,640
Do you want to see what happened?
Yes, I do. Let's have a look.

830
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,040
It's a split screen, isn't it?

831
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,440
There we go, RS6 versus
the Lamborghini Urus. Head-to-head.

832
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,080
Built ultimately
by the same company,

833
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,480
very similar engine,

834
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,000
but the Lamborghini, crucially,
has 50 horsepower more

835
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
and the estate car is
only 100kg less.

836
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,160
This will be close.

837
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,760
Immediately, look how little roll
there is in the Lamborghini

838
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,840
but the RS6 is a bit softer sprung -
it's really rolling.

839
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,080
Hopefully looking for grip

840
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,320
so that it can annihilate
and humiliate

841
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,680
that horrible yellow thing.

842
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,040
Going into Chicago.

843
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,800
Braking performance pretty good.
Both look stable.

844
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,720
Again, the Audi looks
a bit more sluggish.

845
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,000
It's rolling more, isn't it?

846
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,480
They've both come out of here
like stabbed rats, though.

847
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,880
They're fast, so fast,
for big, heavy cars.

848
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,560
Braking into hammerhead.

849
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,280
What does it look like? Looks good.

850
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,360
Again, the Urus's initial turn
looks better.

851
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,960
The Audi has four-wheel steering,

852
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
it's got all the tech book,
that Audi,

853
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,040
even more than the Lamborghini,

854
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,680
but I'm not seeing much difference.

855
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,400
Stig using all the road
and a little bit more as well.

856
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,120
Now, this is the quick section.

857
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,600
This is where he demonstrates

858
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,040
the size of his or her
or whatever it is berries.

859
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,760
They both look really quick,
the tyre wall juddering

860
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,920
with the wash there
and the wake of the air.

861
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,480
Second to last, the most difficult
corner on our circuit.

862
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,320
He's looking neat and tidy
through both.

863
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,640
You can't split them, can you?

864
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,560
I hate to say it, at this moment
in time, it's too close to call.

865
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,880
Over the line.

866
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,720
Right.

867
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,080
Proper grudge match, this. Yeah.
Proper grudge match.

868
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,520
I've got the times. Go on.

869
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,440
Put your neck on the block, Chris.
Which one's going to be faster?

870
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,160
I really hope it's the Audi,

871
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,720
but the Lamborghini looked
worryingly flat and fast,

872
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,480
and also that's got more power.

873
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,520
We're starting.

874
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,240
We're starting with the excuses.
Shut up, McGuinness. Shut up.

875
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,600
First up, the Audi RS6 Avant.

876
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,680
Where do you think
we're looking at, Chris?

877
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
It's big, heavy,
and it's not on the best tyres,

878
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,600
so it's in this range.

879
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,760
I reckon we're looking at
Alfa Giulia, Tesla Model 3 region.

880
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
Yeah? Yeah, go on.

881
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,960
Well, I can tell you
the Audi RS6 Avant went round

882
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,600
in one minute...

883
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,440
..21.9,

884
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,000
which puts it just behind...
He's struggling again.

885
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,520
..the Jaguar F-Type R. Ooh.

886
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,760
OK, so that's not as quick
as I thought it was going to be.

887
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,160
This is not helpful.
That is quite low down, Christopher.

888
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,960
Anything that adds credence to
McGuinness's argument is a problem.

889
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,040
So next one.
And now the big one. Yeah.

890
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,000
The Lamborghini Urus. Come on, Fred!

891
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,640
It is you in car form.
It's totally tasteless.

892
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,840
Look how excited Paddy is. It is!
Paddy...

893
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,080
They could have called it
the Lamborghini McGuinness.

894
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,040
Are you ready, Pad? Yeah. Yes.

895
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,040
The Lamborghini Urus went round

896
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,440
in one minute...

897
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,840
21..

898
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,600
..point...

899
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,720
..7! Paddy, lad, Look at that! Yes!

900
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,600
It's faster than the Audi! Yes!

901
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,920
My word. Yes!

902
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,800
The end of civilisation
as we know it.

903
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,000
Yes! No!

904
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,320
Thank you!

905
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,200
God.

906
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,760
Now it's time to get back to
our big Cypress adventure,

907
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,520
where we're discovering just how
much adventure 30 euros could buy.

908
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,160
Day two of our 30 euro road trip

909
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,200
and we'd been told that there
was more in store for our rentals

910
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,080
up in the Cypriot mountains...

911
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,520
..which, to be honest,

912
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,080
didn't really have the kind of sunny
holiday hire car vibe we'd come for.

913
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,360
Lads, what's that white stuff
over there on the right-hand side?

914
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,880
Snow.

915
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,480
But we're in Cyprus.

916
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,240
Whoa, look at that.

917
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,600
Like we're in the Swiss Alps.

918
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,560
I'm dressed for Ayia Napa here.

919
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,720
Yes, not only does Cyprus have snow,

920
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,560
it's got a ski resort,

921
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,440
which was exactly
where we'd been told to head

922
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,320
for our final challenge.

923
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Good work, Jimny. Lovely stuff.

924
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,760
This is Cyprus!

925
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,840
Are we in the same country, lads?

926
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,960
I've just driven past the Ski-Doo.

927
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,920
Do they have those in Ayia Napa?

928
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,040
I've not seen a beach or a glass
of ouzo since I've been here.

929
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,280
Nothing. It's bonkers.

930
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,000
What? There's a...
There's a bloke skiing here!

931
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,560
Thank you.

932
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,840
The card's cold.

933
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,480
Just going to
wind the window back up.

934
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,960
Hire cars aren't just for summer,
they're for winter too.

935
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,800
To test your car's
cold weather performance,

936
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,360
you will now race
around the Mount Olympus ski resort.

937
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,600
What?

938
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,080
We've already had enough damage
on these cars.

939
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,560
I'm telling you now,
this is a recipe for disaster.

940
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,760
We can't afford any more damage.
We'll never get home.

941
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,160
Luckily for us, though,
the producers have thought of this

942
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,200
and laid on a selection
of hastily cobbled together

943
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,360
protective measures.

944
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,440
McGuinness had gone for

945
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,640
the lightweight
zero functionality choice

946
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,600
of li-los.

947
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,240
Flintoff had inexplicably gone for

948
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,120
the heavier, more potentially
damaging boat buoys.

949
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,440
While I had chosen the all-round
total-coverage solution

950
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,760
of bubble wrap.

951
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,800
Is that going to do anything?

952
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Bubble wrap seems the right balance
between protection and weight to me.

953
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,960
Yeah, but what you've done,

954
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,000
you've not even gone for
the premium bubble wrap.

955
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,520
You've gone for that stuff that
they whack in your parcels

956
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,600
coming to your house.

957
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,680
If you go to the till
at a supermarket,

958
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,760
you buy yourself a couple of cups,
that's what they wrap your cups in.

959
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,080
Should have got the big bubbles,
shouldn't he?

960
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,320
And let me get this right,

961
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,960
Fred's going down the slopes
with a car surrounded by buoys.

962
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,160
Right, the title of best winter
rental would now be decided

963
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,080
with a two lap race down
the main piste slalom run.

964
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
And with a snowcat waiting
at the bottom

965
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,800
to drag us back up to the top,

966
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,640
whoever reaches that first,
will be the front of the queue

967
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,760
for the final run down
to the finish line.

968
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,360
And what all that really meant was
it was time to get the elbows out.

969
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,240
I'm going to set off
a little bit slower in this

970
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,600
because those two will be
off like lunatics.

971
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,640
They'll start
smashing into each other.

972
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,280
It will be a total disaster
and I will just...

973
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,760
..slalom past 'em.

974
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
Boom. Ski Sunday.

975
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,480
Here we go.

976
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,960
Three, two, one, go.

977
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,320
We're off.

978
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,680
Flintoff.

979
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,000
I've got Harris all over me.
I'm just all over the shop. Come on.

980
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,240
Flintoff's going well.

981
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,960
The Jimny's killing it.

982
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,400
Oi.

983
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,000
He rammed me!

984
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,720
I've done it, I'm front!

985
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,080
He's going the wrong way.
They're cheating.

986
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,520
You can't be having that.

987
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,960
# Da-da-da, da-da-daa
Da-da-da-da-da-da-daaa

988
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,480
# Da-da-da-da-da-da-da. #

989
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,920
Hey!

990
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,400
First place! Wonderful.

991
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,360
Get back, Harris,
you cheating BLEEP.

992
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,360
Hook me up, boys, hook me up.
No way.

993
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,040
No way, I was first! I was first!

994
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,600
You cheated! You didn't go through
the gate. He rammed me!

995
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,440
I were first!
You didn't go through the gate.

996
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,560
Paddy, next time go through
the gate, or at least try.

997
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,520
The level of...skulduggery.

998
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Chris has just jumped the queue.
Paddy didn't go round the bollards.

999
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,640
Technically when they look
at the replay of this,

1000
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,840
I should be in first place.

1001
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,320
Well, since we've got
a bit of time to kill

1002
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,280
while we wait for the lift,
let's have a look, shall we?

1003
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,680
Here you can clearly see
the mighty Pininfarina

1004
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,160
easing its way through the field.

1005
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,000
Then, Harris completely
loses control

1006
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,920
and Flintoff goes
the long way round -

1007
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,400
none of which was my fault.

1008
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,560
He hit me hard.

1009
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,160
Now he's moaning.

1010
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,400
"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
I was there first."

1011
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,080
He didn't even attempt to go through
any of the gates!

1012
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,320
He's done this kind of thing before,
racing on snow and all that.

1013
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,640
He came in last - accept it!

1014
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,520
You didn't go through the gate!
I were first!

1015
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,240
While the other two were
still whingeing on, though,

1016
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,360
we had reached the top of the slope

1017
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,240
and me and the Jimny...
I'm going. ..were ready to pounce.

1018
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,240
Where are the boys?
I'm not losing to Flintoff.

1019
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,400
This is horrendous.

1020
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,320
It's an exhibition
from the Jimny.

1021
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,680
Better still... Come on!

1022
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,080
..McGuinness was struggling...
Bollocks!

1023
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,160
..to even get off the lift.

1024
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,400
Come on, the Picanto!

1025
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,000
Here comes Harris. Here he comes.

1026
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,680
The Suzuki Jimny for the first win
of the trip.

1027
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,200
He's coming through the line!

1028
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,800
Unbelievable.

1029
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,280
Second.

1030
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,800
There we go, Harris.
I'm going to get him back.

1031
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,840
That serves you right, son.
Payback, Harris.

1032
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,880
So that was
first and second place sorted,

1033
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,560
which just left one question.

1034
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,560
Where's McGuinness, then?
I think he's stuck.

1035
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,480
Once I do get this chain off,

1036
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,080
what I'm going to do is just
enjoy the focus

1037
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,760
and enjoy the slopes to myself.

1038
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,000
I don't have to be going down
with two absolute tools.

1039
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,800
Shall we see where he is? Yeah.

1040
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,280
And we're off.

1041
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,200
Here we go. This is pleasant now.

1042
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,160
Cue the Ski Sunday music.

1043
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,960
Here he is.

1044
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,400
Woohoo!

1045
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Lovely!

1046
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Better without them two.

1047
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,080
Doesn't sound good, does it?

1048
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,760
It's just gone from the top -
urr, urr, urr - making noises.

1049
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,920
Hey-hey!

1050
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,040
Come on.

1051
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,200
Look at that.

1052
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Here he is.

1053
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,920
You came third.

1054
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,840
I've got to say,
that were a lot of fun, lads.

1055
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,360
Loved that. Wonderful.

1056
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,720
The slope to myself...

1057
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,560
What do they call it, off piste?
Can you explain why you came third?

1058
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,680
Sorry? Can you explain
why you came third?

1059
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,640
Are you still talking
about the race? Yes. Yes.

1060
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,120
I've forgot about that now cos...

1061
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,480
When you win, you ceaselessly
go on about it for hours...

1062
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,640
No, I did, I did win.
..and then when you lose,

1063
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,720
it's just about having fun, is it?
No, no, I won,

1064
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,200
and then you went in front of me...

1065
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,000
You won?
..and then he went in front of me.

1066
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,920
Stop your bickering for a second.
I don't know what you're on about.

1067
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,320
Stop cos I think in this scenario,
there's actually no winners.

1068
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,040
These cars have got to go back
to the airport and pay excess.

1069
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,760
Look at yours. Look at it.

1070
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,240
Flintoff was, of course,
absolutely right.

1071
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,040
Because let's face it,
we could probably have agreed

1072
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,240
his 4x4 off-roader was
the best rental for winter

1073
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,480
without crashing all three of them
down a ski slope.

1074
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,520
And as we made our way back
to the airport

1075
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,120
to drop off
what was now left of them,

1076
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,640
rental return anxiety
had fully taken hold.

1077
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,080
I feel terrible.

1078
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,600
It's like when I was younger
and you have a party at your house.

1079
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,960
You know, your parents are away,
you have your mates over

1080
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,840
and someone always breaks something

1081
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,640
and you have to explain it after
and you feel so guilty -

1082
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,760
that's how I feel now.

1083
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,120
If I'm honest with you,

1084
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,120
I've never handed a car back
in this condition before,

1085
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,000
and I'm in a much better situation
than those two.

1086
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,640
They don't look good
in the rear-view mirror.

1087
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,400
They look like they've just done
the Dakar Rally.

1088
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,200
The brakes have gone,
the front-end's hanging off,

1089
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,720
I've lost a panel from the side,
the backend's dented.

1090
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,040
This car has taken
an absolute battering.

1091
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,000
Looks good that side.

1092
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,800
Other side's knackered.

1093
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,840
I don't know what I'm going to say
to the bloke.

1094
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,360
I mean, I don't think he's ever had
blokes returning cars saying,

1095
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,760
"Ooh, sorry, I was doing
some slalom skiing in it."

1096
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,320
I think in this case, Paddy,

1097
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,640
the truth might not be
the best policy.

1098
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,240
Well, it was time to find out
because all too soon...

1099
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,920
Hello. Ha-ha-ha.

1100
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,560
..we limped up to the airport.

1101
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,320
Here we go.

1102
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,480
Is he there? Not seen him.

1103
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,680
Here he comes. Geez.

1104
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,360
I can't even hide that, can I?

1105
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,680
What did you do?

1106
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,000
Erm...

1107
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,480
Can I just point out a couple
of positives?

1108
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,200
Wasn't me, that. Yeah?

1109
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,920
You just come round here.

1110
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,600
We've retrofitted a roll bar
on there.

1111
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,640
Does the roof still work? Hey...

1112
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,360
Does the roof still work?

1113
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,640
Let me just...

1114
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,160
That...

1115
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,760
He's picked on one of the things
that DOES work.

1116
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,280
I don't know if you know much
about the Ford Focus CC,

1117
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,840
it does take a while to come up,

1118
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,320
that's nothing to do
with the damage.

1119
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,240
It's just the design of the thing.

1120
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,120
Smooth as silk.

1121
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,560
Look at that.

1122
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,560
It's impressive that, Padd.

1123
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,320
That's...
He's made it look a bit better

1124
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,600
cos it wasn't a good-looking car
from the front, was it?

1125
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,880
No, no, that's the wrong... Sh.

1126
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,400
Your one's just this?

1127
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,600
Go on. Mate, the back as well,
if I'm being honest.

1128
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,720
Bit round here.

1129
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,440
And the yellow one?

1130
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,640
I think you caught that
with your leg

1131
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,960
cos that was fine when I came in.
He's winding him up.

1132
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,600
Chris, will you stop it?

1133
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,440
Can I just say,

1134
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,400
your eyes are piercing
in this light.

1135
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,040
Beautiful. Beautiful. Lovely eyes.

1136
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,360
Yeah.

1137
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,080
Lovely eyes.

1138
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,600
Um...

1139
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,200
We all declined the full insurance
as well, yes?

1140
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,880
Well, I tried to take it,

1141
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,480
but Paddy declined it on my behalf.
Excuse... I did.

1142
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,400
He said, "Do you want insurance?"
I said, "Yeah." You go, "No, no."

1143
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,240
I didn't think we were water-skiing.

1144
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,720
I didn't think we'd be skiing.

1145
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,640
I didn't think we'd be
doing anything.

1146
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,520
That was him, that. Whoa.
That was you.

1147
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,280
That was you. That's out of order.

1148
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,280
That's not how you treat a vehicle,
is it?

1149
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,880
Anyhow, one of us has left
a Coutts card,

1150
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,120
put it on that.

1151
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,160
That's you, Harris -
that's your card, isn't it?

1152
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,520
All of them, yeah. Cheers, Chris.
Thanks, mate. Sorry.

1153
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,320
I'll sort it out with you after,
send you the invoice.

1154
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,880
Oi! I'm not...
I'm not paying for that.

1155
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,120
What? What?
I'm not... You've wrecked my car.

1156
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,160
He won't even notice it
out of a Coutts account.

1157
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,120
I didn't cause any damage
to that car...

1158
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,640
Ooh.

1159
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,680
It wasn't our finest moment,
was it, boys?

1160
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,560
They're beeping over there.
I feel quite bad.

1161
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,320
I hate damaging cars, but at least
mine wasn't as bad as yours.

1162
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,160
It was an absolute mess -
big repair job there, Patrick.

1163
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,640
Well, you say that.

1164
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,800
Not as expensive
as what you thought, erm...

1165
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,160
..cos they scrapped it.

1166
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,920
But on the plus side,
it's now a lovely coffee table.

1167
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,880
So the moral is -
do be gentle, it's a rental.

1168
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,120
Correct, Fred.

1169
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,640
And that's all for tonight.

1170
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,120
We'll see you next week
when we take a Bentley, a McLaren,

1171
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,280
and an Aston Martin on a road trip
to beautiful Wales.

1172
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,800
Thanks for watching, goodnight.
