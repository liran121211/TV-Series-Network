00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,496
Hello, welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,136
Yes, we're still out on the
runway with our Covid-compliant,

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,736
socially distanced
classic driving show.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,616
I've got to tell you, there's a
white Transit van at the back

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,696
there with the windows
steamed up - he's started early!

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,136
But as long as he's in the
same bubble, why not? Go for it.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,696
Have a bit of fun.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,936
Knock yourself out.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,496
Talking of steamed up,
Chris Harris, look at this,

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,936
no wonder you're excited,
this is a car spotter's paradise.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,576
This is my happy place.
Look at the tackle on offer here.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,896
XTS Convertible. Fantastic.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,256
Look at this here

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,416
a Rosso Dino 308.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,656
BMW Z1... Chris, Chris,
we don't have time for this.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,176
The 550's got a
burgundy interior!

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,576
Quiet, because we've
got a packed show, folks.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,016
Later on we're going to be
taking on a massive wall of death.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,376
What were we even thinking?

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,296
Never mind that, cos also
tonight, there's a massive crash.

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,016
The best news is - it's not me!

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,256
Get in! Get it!  .

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,576
We'll move on, because we need
to talk about cars that do 200mph.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,936
Isn't that right, Christopher?
That's right, Patrick.

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,336
See, it wasn't so long ago that
200mph in a road car seemed

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,776
unreachable, beyond
the limits of physics.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,576
But then 30 years ago, a
bunch of supercars rocked up that

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,896
not only smashed passed 200,
but looked awesome doing it.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,656
So to celebrate the coolest
supercar era of them all,

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,336
the producers told us to pick
our favourite 200mph pioneer

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,280
and head to the glorious north.

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,936
If you're talking 200mph
pioneers, frankly,

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,816
there's only one choice.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,776
The original, the greatest,

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,080
I give you the Ferrari F40.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,960
I haven't driven one
of these for a while.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,816
Introduced in 1987,

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,520
the F40 was the final car to be
overseen by the big man himself

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,736
Enzo Ferrari

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,680
who was, above all
else, a man of ambition.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,776
You see, the race to 200mph
for a road-legal car in the '80s

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,176
was a bit like the
space race in the '60s

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,296
massive budgets,
genius engineers,

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,160
all to be the first
to make that claim.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,616
And the F40 was the
first road car to get there.

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,320
This is the Apollo
11 of supercars.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,880
This is the giant
leap for car-kind.

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,456
But the real genius
behind the F40

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,056
is that in building
his rocket ship,

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Enzo kept things

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,080
beautifully simple.

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,816
Ferrari could have gone
down a technology route,

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,536
but instead it just made a
very light, tubular steel chassis,

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,376
added some Kevlar bodywork

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,856
and then added a
huge amount of power

56
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,960
478hp, from a twin
turbo-charged V8.

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,960
It's just a massive go-kart.

58
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,536
It's light, it's immediate,

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,976
there's no power
assistance to anything.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,776
The pedals take a massive push,

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,376
the steering takes a heave,

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,736
the gear shift, well, you have
to nudge it from your shoulder.

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,080
It's just brutal, but sublime!

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,896
This isn't just the
greatest 200mph car,

65
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,976
this is the greatest
road car ever.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,216
For me, there's no debate.

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
No debate. It's the greatest.

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,736
It's a good effort, but wrong.

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,536
If you want THE classic
200mph supercar,

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,016
everyone knows
you've got to buy British,

71
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,680
or at least borrow British.

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,480


73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I give you the Jaguar XJ220.

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,920
My word!

75
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,080
It doesn't get much
better than this.

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,576
The mightiest
road-going Jag ever made

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,016
first landed as a
concept in 1988.

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,480
And it was spectacular.

79
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,936
I remember seeing this
car for the first time as a kid,

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,656
I'd have been, like,
11, 12 years of age.

81
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,896
It just looked like something
I'd never seen before.

82
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,336
And now here I am driving one.

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,456
The first thing you need
to know about the 220,

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,760
though, is that to a lot of people
it's considered a bit of a failure.

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,176
That's because Jaguar,
they promised a V12,

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,976
they promised scissor doors,
they promised four-wheel drive.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,376
But when they came to make it,
they discovered that all that was,

88
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,256
well, a bit complicated,

89
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,736
and a bit expensive.

90
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,896
So it ended up two-wheel
drive, normal doors,

91
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,480
and the engine from a V6 Metro.

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,376
But disappointing
though that may sound,

93
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,320
the XJ220 still had a
top speed of 217 mph.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,360
Compared to the F40,
it was in another league.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,016
I think that is genius. I think
that is the best of British ingenuity.

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,896
"We'll make do with what
we've got. Stick it in there."

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,656
- It still goes 217 mph.
- That is not a failure.

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,736
And besides, just
have a look at it.

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,040
Just look at it!

100
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
Don't be fooled
by that face, though

101
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,440
underneath it's a wild animal.

102
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,816
The strangest thing about
this car is you're driving it,

103
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,896
and nothing's
happening. Nothing.

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,760
And then all at once,
the turbos kick in.

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,160
- It's like a Tarantino movie.
- Everything just happens!

106
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,520
My word! I'm tense. I'm tense.

107
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,616
What is the...?

108
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,960
Good morning, Chris.

109
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,936
What are you in, Fred? XJ220?

110
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,696
Congratulations,
that is you in car form

111
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,056
big, British, not
as fast as claimed.

112
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,016
Chris, it did 217mph, this car.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,016
You can't have a go at it.

114
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,016
And they called it the
XJ220, and it only did 217?

115
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,456
They called the Ferrari
the 812 Superfast,

116
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,336
it doesn't go 812mph.

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
But it's superfast.

118
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,760
Buongiorno!

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,296
Dearie me, Fred. Dearie me.

120
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,376
How's about that, boys?

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,176
Where's your
sense of patriotism?

122
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,456


123
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,936
Ignore those two squares.

124
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,896
I like my 200mph supercars
a bit more unhinged.

125
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,616
Man, this car!

126
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,920
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you the Lamborghini Diablo.

127
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,016
I mean, supercars are supposed
to be a little bit mad, aren't they?

128
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,256
They're supposed to be bonkers.

129
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,136
And the Diablo is
definitely bonkers.

130
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,576
I mean, look at it, the seat
belts go the wrong way,

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,016
the dash looks
like it's off a lorry.

132
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,656
The stalks are from
a Morris Marina.

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,696
It's bonkers, but what it does have
is that great big, stonking, lovely.

134
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,696
V12 right behind you

135
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,520
that will get you to
70mph in first gear.

136
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
First gear.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Listen to her! .

138
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,136
Come on!

139
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,536
Work your way up the gearbox,

140
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,880
and the 485hp Diablo
would top out at 202mph.

141
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,256
It scares me, this
car as well. I like that.

142
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,856
There's no power steering,
no traction control, nothing.

143
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
Nothing that's in a modern car
that makes you feel comfortable.

144
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
It's just pure driving
ability. I love it.

145
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,576
Now, we'd been told to head to
a nearby airfield for the chance

146
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,776
to put our cars
through their paces.

147
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,936
However, first, that
did of course mean

148
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,000
reaching it.

149
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,560
Woohoo!

150
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,600
Ho!

151
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,176
Hoo-hoo!

152
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,016
Whoa! .

153
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880


154
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,456
So, while McGuinness had
made an unscheduled stop,

155
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,040
we arrived at the airfield
where all we could do was wait.

156
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,536
Do you know, on an
F40 the paint is so thin

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,976
that you can see the Kevlar
weave through it? It's amazing.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,656
Yeah? All the way through here

159
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,336
you can just see the
weave of the Kevlar.

160
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,800
In fact, one of the ways to
spot... APPROACHING LORRY.

161
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,520
My God.

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,016
Paddy...

163
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,416
You all right? Neck
all right? Head all right?

164
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
Gutted.

165
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,536
Talk us through what
you did. What did you hit?

166
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,176
It must have been a little bit of
oil on the road or something...

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,936
Yeah, yeah, cos I've
been driving up and down

168
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:48,696
that road all day and
that oil really got me.

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,256
You hadn't been on that spot
in the torrential rain, had you?

170
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,456
Did you hit that oil as well?

171
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,976
Yeah, I must admit, I just backed
off a bit in that torrential rain. Yeah.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,696
It was just on a little
bit of a bend, that was it.

173
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,360
No more than 40.

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,280
But it really surprised me
how quickly it just goes from.

175
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,656
"Isn't this lovely?" to...

176
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,016
It is amazing how quickly
you can run out of talent.

177
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,656
Tsch.

178
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,416
Ambition's a great thing, Chris.

179
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,616
But you've got to temper it.

180
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,160
Anyhoo, what can you do?

181
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm having a butty.

182
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,576
The Diablo had shown
just what a handful

183
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,576
a 30-year-old supercar can be.

184
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,520
And it had paid
the price doing it.

185
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,960
However, two of our
cars still had work to do.

186
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,016
Because the
airfield we'd come to

187
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,240
was Elvington.

188
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,256
Boasting one of the
longest runways in the UK,

189
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,760
it was time to see what our
old pioneers still had in the tank.

190
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,720
It was time... for a good
old-fashioned drag race.

191
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,336
The race is as follows.

192
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,336
A rolling start, we want to be
kind on these old driveshafts.

193
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,296
So 40mph through
the green flags,

194
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,336
the moment you go through the
green flag, you give it the beans

195
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,576
and you stop at
the chequered flag.

196
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,056
Can you just confirm
you've heard that instruction?

197
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,496
We've had problems
here with you before.

198
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,816
I can't stop!

199
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,296
Ha-ha-ha!

200
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm running out of runway!

201
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,576
I'm not going to lie, Chris, I'm a
bit apprehensive. I'll give it a go.

202
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,736
I mean, you should be quicker.
That is a faster car, Fred.

203
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,176
Hello, boys!

204
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,456
My word.

205
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,776
What are you doing?

206
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,136
I thought you'd gone home.

207
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,280
You can't keep me
out the race, pal.

208
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,736
Green flags are coming, boys!

209
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,816
Here we go, here we go.
I'm nervous, I'm nervous.

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,280
Go!

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,760
My word, look at that Ferrari!

212
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
They are gone!

213
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,840
Whoo!

214
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,496
130.

215
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,560
140.

216
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,216


217
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,656
There seems to be
two dots in the distance.

218
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,376


219
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
What a weapon!

220
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,096
Wow. She's still got it.

221
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,896
She has still got it.

222
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,736
Wow.

223
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
Whoo!

224
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,936
What did I do then? 170? 175?

225
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,936
That is speed like I've never
experienced. That was different.

226
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,720
That was so different.

227
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes!

228
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,520
It's nice to get out.
That's the main thing.

229
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,296
Fred? Chris.

230
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,296
They are a proper
handful, aren't they?

231
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,016
This is moving
all over the place.

232
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,136
I got over just 150,

233
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,416
but this car has got
so much more, Chris.

234
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,256
So much more.

235
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,016
I would love to get to 200.

236
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,536
Yeah, I think you're
on your own there, Fred.

237
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,776
If you want to go and seek 200,

238
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,280
I'll happily be an observer.

239
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,576
Yes, deciding fate hadn't been
tempted enough for one day,

240
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Flintoff now wanted to
take a shot at the big one.

241
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,376
All right, how are we
going, Fred? Are you OK?

242
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,336
I'm just turning round right
at the end of the runway.

243
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm trying to give
myself so much room.

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,536
And make no mistake,

245
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,936
hitting 200mph in a
Jag that's 30 years old

246
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,000
would be a big ask.

247
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,656
Best of luck, Andrew. Thank you
very much. I'll see you in a minute.

248
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
I hope.

249
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,000


250
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
He's off.

251
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,760
Come on.

252
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,976
He's building. He's building.

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
He's doing a tonne already!

254
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm going. I am travelling.

255
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,936
He's missed a gear change
there, he won't do 200 now.

256
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

257
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,976
The foot is down. I don't
know how fast I'm going.

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,616
I'm not even looking.

259
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,280
160.170.

260
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,216
I'm trying to keep
my hands loose.

261
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,120
But it's becoming
increasingly difficult!

262
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,280
190.

263
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,600
Please stop.

264
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Please stop! Please stop!

265
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,920
My word.

266
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,416
Ho-ho!

267
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,376
Right, how quick do
you reckon you went?

268
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,256
I think it's the fastest
I've ever been in a car.

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,696
I had a glance down at one point,
I was 180, and I was going faster.

270
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,136
I think you did 195, I don't
think it was 200, though. 195?

271
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,176
I think it was 195.
That was a warm up!

272
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,536
That was a warm up.

273
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,896
I think you get straight
back in, get out there.

274
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,296
I've just got to let
it cool down, Pad.

275
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,256
I tell you what... We've
never seen him like this, ever.

276
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,496
Do you know what, I'll
tell you how that felt, right?

277
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,816
You know when you go
out to bat at cricket? No.

278
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,296
No, I don't. And I'm nervous,
I'm going out, and the closer

279
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,576
I get to the wicket, everything's
coming alive, and I love it.

280
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,536
That was like that times ten.

281
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,136
The faster I was going

282
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,736
I was going, I was,

283
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,856
"Come on, come on, come on!" You
feel every mile per hour in that one.

284
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,296
I tell you, if I trusted you,
I'd give you a go, but I can't.

285
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,936
It's like... That burns. Do
you know what? That burns!

286
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,296
This is the first time
he's not crashed anything

287
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,416
and look at him,
he's like all the time.

288
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,656
Whoa, whoa, he's still got
another run to go. Yeah, that's true.

289
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,736
I reckon, I think if I go
again... Have a run round.

290
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,336
I'm going to slingshot it,
cos there's a bit of a run on.

291
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,376
Yeah, I think you'll do it. I reckon I
can get on the runway at 70. Yeah.

292
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,936
So just 5mph
short of the big 200,

293
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,120
Flintoff lined up
for one more go.

294
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,960
This time, with an
even bigger run up.

295
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,616
I'm still thinking about
this cricket thing he said.

296
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,416
About going out to bat?
Did you feel that? No.

297
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
The last time you had a bat you
did an off-licence over. Here we go.

298
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,840
Coming round. Coming round.

299
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,360
Here we go, 70. As soon
as I get straight I'm off.

300
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,576
Am I good to go, Chris?

301
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,496
In your own time.

302
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,120
Godspeed.

303
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,560
Come on.

304
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,336
Good Lord. Look what
it just did 70 to 90 in.

305
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,640
Into fourth. Come
on. Four, four, four.

306
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,456
That was a better gear change,
that was a better gear change.

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,616
Yeah, yeah, here we go.

308
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Just got my foot
right on the floor.

309
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,216
Go on. He's doing 140, he's not
even in sight and he's doing 140.

310
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm a little bit all over the
place. I'm feeling everything.

311
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
170. He's going quick.

312
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,216
The car's making noises.

313
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,280
As I'm going fast, I can't push
my foot through any further.

314
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm giving it beans.

315
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,096
190.

316
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Going up! Going up!

317
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,400
195...

318
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,776
That was close.

319
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,760
That was so close.
It must have been.

320
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,696
Did I, did I do it? How do you
do a social distancing high five?

321
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,296
Don't wind me
up. Did I do it? Yes!

322
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,496


323
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,896
We did it! Yes!

324
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,336
Give me that one.
Give me that one.

325
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,896
I never scored a double
hundred as a batsman!

326
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,096
Can I have it in this though?

327
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,296
What was it like? It's like nothing
else I've ever driven or done.

328
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,136
Do you know what got you over
the 200? Brake late. You brake late.

329
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,456
I did, yeah. You took the mickey.
You ignored the brake boards.

330
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,696
So we've got the health

331
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,638
and safety man over
there about to have a chat

332
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,496
with you. No, no,
no. I'll chat to that lad.

333
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,056
Because see, the other
thing I had in my favour...

334
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,336
I know what's at the end.

335
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,016


336
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,856
It's fine. Well done, mate.

337
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,520
I can't believe how happy I am.

338
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,240
What a machine.

339
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,400


340
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,136
200mph in an old Jag.

341
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,616
You, my friend, have got some
Scotch eggs on you. It was surreal.

342
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,696
It was the week they
eased lockdown a bit,

343
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,296
so I went from sitting on me couch
in me undies to driving this 200mph.

344
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,616
It was the best thing I think
I've ever done in a car. Amazing.

345
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,936
But let's be honest, it's
not about me, is it? I...

346
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,376
I feel there was
something missing here.

347
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,616
What? Well... That beautiful
Lamborghini that you crashed.

348
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,936
On a straight. Firstly, I didn't
crash it. What did you do?

349
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,416
What's the definition of a
crash, then? There's an hierarchy.

350
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,856
You can have a bump and a
prang and a crash and a shunt.

351
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,776
Mine was in between a crash
and a shunt. It were a crunt.

352
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,216


353
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,776
You, that's the first time
you've not crashed a car.

354
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,816
Yeah, but I've never crashed a
Lamborghini. And fair play to you.

355
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,416
If you're going to go, go
big, Paddy lad. Go big!

356
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,736
Honestly, I was genuinely
gutted. I am really sorry.

357
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,976
I'm sorry about the car,
I'm sorry to the owner,

358
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,776
he's over there, I'm
sorry to the insurance

359
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,536
company for telling them
that you were driving, Fred.

360
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,416
I'm just sorry, so please, can
we now move on from this?

361
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,056
No, I think we should carry
on talking about you crashing

362
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,656
a Lamborghini and your little
face when you went, "I crashed it!"

363
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,456
"It's got some power, this."

364
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,656
When you put your
foot down. Shut it.

365
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,856
What are we talking about next?
You're not going to believe this.

366
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,536
Crashed cars is the
next subject. Great. Great.

367
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,176
Because we reckoned we might
have found a way to buy a fast,

368
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,136
interesting car for the
price of a slow, boring car.

369
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,136
Insurance write-offs.

370
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,016
Cars that had been in a bit of a
scrape and the insurers have decided

371
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,496
they won't pay for the repair.

372
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,176
But if you're happy
with a doer upper,

373
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,576
there are some
absolute steals out there.

374
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,656
So we convinced the producers
to give us each six grand

375
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,880
and we went out to
bag ourselves a bargain.

376
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,736
To show off our
high-performance write-offs,

377
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,056
we've been told to meet
up at the Top Gear track.

378
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,976
And let's just say,
for less than six grand,

379
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,720
I'd picked up an
absolute belter.

380
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,400
This is my insurance write-off,
the Porsche Cayman S.

381
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,296
This car, this
age, this mileage,

382
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,736
you're looking at
around about £10,000.

383
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,616
I got it for five
and a half grand.

384
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,856
And this is the trouble with
insurance companies now,

385
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,696
they're quick to write things off. They
can't be bothered with the paperwork.

386
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,456
But have a look round here.

387
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,656
Little bump on the front,
bit of teacup, buff it out,

388
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,816
it'll be good to go.

389
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,176
Now, technically
this car's a write-off,

390
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,896
so I can't drive it
on the public roads,

391
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,376
but in the right hands with a
bit of TLC, get an MOT on her,

392
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,520
you've got yourself a
Porsche at a bargain price.

393
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,576
Who's this?

394
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,136
Now, if you prefer
something Italian...

395
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,776
Maserati?

396
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,160
Quattroporte. Very nice!

397
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,376
The next bargain out
the blocks was Flintoff's.

398
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,760
Turning up backwards,
for some reason.

399
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,256
Now, firstly, I've got to stop
you, because this is a minter.

400
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,896
You have not got this for less than
six grand. These, new, 80 grand.

401
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,056
Yeah.

402
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,976
A good 'un. Yeah.
15 second-hand.

403
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,176
This, my friend, £5,750
for a Maserati Quattroporte.

404
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,336
It is mint. Beautiful!

405
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,496
There is a little bit of
damage at the front, but...

406
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,496
Little bit at the front. Let's have
a look. Won't really notice it, Pad.

407
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,656
It's a scratch. Yeah.

408
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,016
Nothing that can't be buffed
out. New bumper, a new bonnet.

409
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,400
A few hundred quid, max.

410
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,376
Got yourself an
absolute bargain.

411
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,776
You see, mine's had a bit of a
shunt at the back there, but, again...

412
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,776
You can live with that. You can
live with it. You can, it's a Porsche.

413
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
It's a Porsche. Five and a half
grand. For a Cayman S. Cayman S!

414
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,000
Here he comes.

415
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,016
Morning, boys.

416
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,056
Now, you know I love a Ford,
but I've got to say, this particular

417
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,176
challenge, I think a Porsche and
a Maserati is a much better choice.

418
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,536
Gen one Focus RS is one of
the most special low-volume

419
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,936
sports cars ever made. Should
be 15 grand. Yeah? Five grand.

420
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,136
And I've saved a classic from
the scrapheap. But... It looks mint.

421
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,096
There's a couple of scratches
on it. What's wrong with it? There.

422
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,296
Is that it? The front wing. A little
bit of suspension. And that wheel.

423
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,336
That's it. That's it?! Yes.

424
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,376
Let's have a look at yours,
boys. Yeah, look at that!

425
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,736
Look at this, special, Cayman S.

426
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,736
Little bit of a nick
on the front there.

427
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,176
God.

428
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,096
A little bit of a nick? It's a
graze. A rash, they call it. A rash.

429
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,496
Gravel rash. Gravel rash. You've
had a go at this end as well?

430
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,536
Well, technically not me. I
bought it in this condition.

431
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,576
So, how are you going to repair
that? The parts are so expensive.

432
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,576
It's just unrepairable, that.

433
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,976
Let's have a look at this one.
This looks mint. What's this, Fred?

434
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,736
Quattroporte? Quattroporte!

435
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,256
They are beautiful cars. One
of the best-looking saloons

436
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,128
ever made. Where's the
damage? It looks pretty

437
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,960
good to me. You have
to look hard to find it.

438
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,616
Yeah, but... A few hundred
quid, get a bumper, new grille.

439
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,656
How many Quattroportes
did they sell in the UK, Fred?

440
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,656
Are you expecting an answer? I
think you can count them on two hands.

441
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,576
What's with the negativity? I'm not
being negative, I'm being pragmatic.

442
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,456
Yeah, you are. No... Mr Nasty
Negative. You've gone out there...

443
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,816
We've got a Maserati and a
Porsche for under ten grand!

444
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,216
Fill your glass up.

445
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,696
You've bought an
absolutely shambolic Cayman,

446
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,496
and you've bought a car that
you intend to fit with used parts,

447
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,496
of which there might be one other
that you can strip from in the UK.

448
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,560
I've got to be honest, I
think... Hello. Thank you.

449
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,656
"Time to test how confident you
are in your so-called bargain fast cars.

450
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,096
"Using the whole runway,
please find out how fast they'll go.

451
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,856
"If you go off the
tarmac, you're out.".

452
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,016
That Porsche is going to win
hands down on this tarmac.

453
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,696
I don't understand what you're
saying. Did you say hands down?

454
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
Hold that. Sorry. In
the cars, here we go.

455
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,456
Yes, to test how mechanically
sound our so-called write-offs were,

456
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,616
we've been given the
entire length of the runway

457
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,176
and a fancy GPS speedo to
find out which would go fastest.

458
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,400
Or, to put it another way, see
what order the other two would lose.

459
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,416
Three

460
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,776
two

461
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,096
one...

462
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,880
Go!

463
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,920
The Maserati's away!

464
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,616
Look at the Maserati go!

465
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,776
But the Cayman's coming back!

466
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,720
Here we go!

467
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,040
Here comes the Porsche.

468
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,440
Already up to 120.

469
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,096
Can't even see Harris,
he's that far back.

470
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,320
Come on, the Ford!

471
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,776
We are living the dream now!

472
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,656
This is fast, and!

473
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,320
Going to crash!

474
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

475
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,936
McGuinness is off!
McGuinness is off!

476
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,560
All right, Pad?

477
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,536
I think I've overshot.

478
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,936


479
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,856
So, 141.6.

480
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,896
Fast.

481
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,056
135.8. But died.

482
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,256
What did you get, about 62?

483
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,616
125 and I didn't do
the decimal point,

484
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,000
cos there was no point,
cos I was below you.

485
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,416
Wow. But I still won, because I
didn't go on the grass. I mean...

486
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,776
What?

487
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,096
What are you on about? The
challenge was top speed. No.

488
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,256
It was and it wasn't, wasn't it?
Did you not remember the words?

489
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,376
Well, I read them. You
had to stay on the runway.

490
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,056
This is not part of the
runway, therefore I won.

491
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,336
Do you know what? What?
You're right. I know. And I read it.

492
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,416
Thank you.

493
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,456
More than two thirds of UK cars
have been damaged in car parks.

494
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,656
To see how your write-offs
handle this dangerous environment,

495
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,120
time for a round of Parking
Space Musical Chairs.

496
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,920
Yes, to test our
car's low-speed agility

497
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,376
we'd now play a four-wheeled
version of one of the all-time

498
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,240
great children's party games.

499
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,176
Parking Space Musical
Chairs takes one busy car park,

500
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,016
one space fewer than
the number of cars playing

501
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,816
and a big air horn
to start and stop play.

502
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,296
As you'd expect, if you dash
for a space and don't find one,

503
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,640
you're out of the game.

504
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,936
I'm not sure about this, boys.

505
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,416
I know this Focus RS
has been written off,

506
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,376
but I get the feeling there
might be some contact

507
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
and I don't want
contact in this Focus RS.

508
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,336
Worryingly, though, to
ramp up the competition,

509
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,376
it wouldn't just be us racing for
the spaces - we'd be up against

510
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,056
a trio of Toyota Priuses,
officially Britain's most crashed car.

511
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,200
There they are. Ho-ho!
It's the Prius army.

512
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,336
All of them driven by
Britain's most reckless drivers.

513
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,320
Stig's teenage cousins.

514
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,696
Chris, I've just
thought of something.

515
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,800
If you get in the car with me, I
can use the parent and child spot.

516
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,320


517
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,216
See a gap, see a parking
spot, get in it, that's it.

518
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
We're off. Come on!

519
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,040
He's ing me
already, the Stig.

520
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,016
I don't know what to do,
whether to go slow... Hey!

521
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,200
Get out the way, Paddy.

522
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,776
What's the strategy?
What's the strategy here?

523
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,120
Chris!

524
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,856
Take your time, take your time.

525
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
I've got to get round quick now!

526
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,816
Take my time again,
take my time again.

527
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,576
Where's the klaxon? Where's
the klaxon? I'm getting tense!

528
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,680
I'm in!

529
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
I'm in! I'm in!

530
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,680
Get in here. Get in. I'm
in. Yes! It's a better spot.

531
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,760
Are we all in, gents?
Never in doubt.

532
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,640
So, first round over
and a Prius eliminated

533
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,880
one space would now be
filled ready for round two.

534
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,056
Five cars, four spaces.

535
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,616
Don't know about you, but
I'm nervous, I'm anxious.

536
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,336
Paddy, do you need someone
to explain that math to you?

537
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960


538
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,360
Here we go again.

539
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,176
Hey!

540
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,160
You little BLEEP.

541
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Get out my way.
Where are you going?

542
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,216
You can go ahead, mate.
Try and block me all you want.

543
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,936
Flintoff's here in that bloody
Maserati. McGuinness.

544
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,400
Get out. What is he doing?!

545
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,936
No!

546
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,456
Ha-ha, McGuinness!

547
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,440
No!

548
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,640
Go on, go on, go
on. Same spot. Get in!

549
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,816
Is there one there? BLEEP.

550
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,456
No! I'm out!

551
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,656
To be honest,
I'm glad. I'm glad.

552
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,760
I can keep the
damage to a minimum.

553
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,456
Me and Harris were pretty
pleased too. McGuinness was out...

554
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,216
Next up was round three...

555
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,736
Come on, come on.

556
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,880
And let's just say
we sailed through that

557
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,856
without a hitch.

558
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,920
Bloody Prius!

559
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,816
What a dick.

560
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,800
Heading into round
four... Where's Flintoff?

561
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,896
There was now just one
Prius left standing between us

562
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,160
and a showdown.

563
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,696
He's going to put me
in the bollards here.

564
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,456
Flintoff's off again.
Flintoff's off again.

565
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,296
There's... Harris has
lucked out again here.

566
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,696
We're in. Ha-ha!

567
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,240
Where's the spot? Where is it?

568
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm in! I'm bloody in.

569
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,120
Stig's out. Stig's out.
There you are, Stig.

570
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,200
BBC One.

571
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,336
This was it, then.

572
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,400
Car Park Musical
Chairs - The Final.

573
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,000
And then there was two,

574
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,320
and one space.

575
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,256
You and me, Fred,
it's you and me.

576
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,216
I'm willing to
take this quite far,

577
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,560
but if it gets to a critical
situation, I'm bailing.

578
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,800


579
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,616
Here we go!

580
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,216
Where is he?

581
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,776
He's creeping. He's creeping.

582
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,616
Come on, Chris, where are you?

583
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,720
Come on, Chris.

584
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,360
No, it's a disaster!

585
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,920


586
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,760
Dear, that's not good.

587
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,176
See, Harris won't
nudge Flintoff,

588
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,800
and he knows Flintoff will
completely wipe him out.

589
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,080
Now come and get me, Flintoff.

590
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Flintoff! No!

591
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,536
Sorry! It's not really
worked out, that. He's round.

592
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,680
He's coming round,
Fred, and he's angry.

593
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,336
It's on, boys!
Come on, get round!

594
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,280
No! Flintoff's gone
too wide! Harris is in!

595
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,160
No!

596
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,816
They're round again.

597
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,440
He's off! He's off!

598
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,776
Where is it?

599
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,840
Ooft!

600
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,160
Where's Harris? Where's Harris?

601
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,840
That was yours, Chris.

602
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,696
If you'd have gone
back round, it was yours.

603
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,256
I was just trying to breathe.

604
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,600
Right, yeah, that's
always a good thing.

605
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,456
It's kind of a win.

606
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,536
If the cars...

607
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,936
I just don't know
what to say to you.

608
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,616
If these cars...

609
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,416
Fred, look at that.
Yeah. Chris, I'm sorry.

610
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,256
It brings out the best
in me, competition,

611
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,856
but it can bring
out the worst. Yeah.

612
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,080
If these cars weren't
write-offs before, they are now.

613
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,936
But they weren't dead yet,

614
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,456
because to see if our write-offs
really were worth saving

615
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,296
from the scrapheap, the producers
told us to use whatever we had left

616
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,200
from our six-grand budget to get
them fixed up and back on the road.

617
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,616
So, a few months,
a global pandemic

618
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,856
and one bottle of
hair bleach later,

619
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,560
we were back in business.

620
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,960
Or at least two of us were.

621
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,040
This is the life.

622
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,896
Out on the open road

623
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,960
in my Porsche, living the dream.

624
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:20,600
I mean, this thing has cost me six
grand all in - an absolute bargain.

625
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,776
Paddy, what exactly
have you done?

626
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,136
Now, yes, I've had to beg,
borrow and steal with the spares

627
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,056
because obviously I didn't have

628
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,096
the budget, but I quite
like the different colours.

629
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,880
It's a patchwork quilt of a car and
who doesn't like a patchwork quilt?

630
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,800
Why have you gone
for pink at the rear?

631
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,520
It's better than brown!

632
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,416
That car looks good
as new you're driving.

633
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,416
Mate, it is a honey and, of
course, being a Ford, parts

634
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,056
prices are cheap as
chips, which was necessary

635
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,600
because Flintoff dented every
single panel apart from the roof.

636
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,736
So, I've got an absolutely
mint-looking Ford Focus RS

637
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,816
one of my favourite
cars ever - for £6,000.

638
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,016
For once, we are onto
something with these things.

639
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,776
We are definitely
onto something.

640
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,600
Write-offs are
actually right-on.

641
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,656
But, in the spirit of fairness,
to fix up my battered Ford,

642
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,000
Flintoff had also given up
the rest of his six-grand budget.

643
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,256
So, the question now was

644
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,840
what had become of his Maserati?

645
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,840
My God.

646
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,416
Morning, boys!

647
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,080
May I introduce you to the
Mad MAXERATI? Very nice!

648
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,136
I couldn't afford any new stuff,

649
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,736
so I thought, rather than have
the new bits, get rid of the old ones.

650
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,616
I've taken everything
out that's unnecessary

651
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,720
and created an absolute
monster. Look at it.

652
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,376
Fred, I don't often say this,

653
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,576
but you have absolutely
knocked it out of the park.

654
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,560
It looks fantastic. I love it.

655
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,136
I've got to say as well, Chris,

656
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,096
seeing your car back to its former
glory has made me just as happy.

657
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,200
I apologise
profusely. I really do.

658
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,536
And the other thing about it,
Pad, now it's lighter it's faster.

659
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,680
See you later, son!

660
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,000
Ho-ho-ho! Yes!

661
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,296
Now, having proven
once and for all the sheer

662
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,536
genius of the high-performance
write-off, the sensible thing to do

663
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,120
would have been to take them
for a nice, long, scenic drive.

664
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
Lovely stuff.

665
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,656
What we were
actually told to do,

666
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,360
though, was head to North
London's Alexandra Palace for a test.

667
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,440
Hay, lads, this is
the old Ally Pally.

668
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,296
Please, please tell me, Paddy,
you're taking us to the darts.

669
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,080
I love it.

670
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,656
But whatever it was the
producers had in store,

671
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,440
it definitely wasn't darts.

672
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
What is going on in here?

673
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,840
What the hell is that?

674
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't know, but it looks
like it could probably hurt.

675
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,640
Challenge. There's a
challenge over there.

676
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,336
Right...

677
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,080
Let's see what
they've got for us.

678
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,856
You've brought your insurance
write-offs back from the dead.

679
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,176
Now it's time for them
to face the ultimate test.

680
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,880
You must all hit 50mph around
the Top Gear Wall Of Death.

681
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
So, that's what it is.

682
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,400
Yes, the Wall Of Death.

683
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,656
The legendary daredevil act
that, for over a century, has seen

684
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,576
motorcycle riders pin
themselves to a vertical wall,

685
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,616
relying on nothing but skill,

686
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,400
bravery and physics
to keep them there.

687
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,456
The walls themselves are
normally just a few metres wide,

688
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,616
but scaled up to
cope with our cars

689
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,840
this one was an
absolute monster.

690
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,360
Not on your nelly.

691
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,160
What?!

692
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,896
160 tonnes of wood and
steel built 100 feet wide

693
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,680
and as tall as a house.

694
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,856
And, just like any wall of
death, at the top, still completely

695
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,760
and utterly vertical.

696
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,456
This is brilliantly stupid. The
headlines are going to be brilliant.

697
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,776
This is just brilliant. I tell
you what, Pad, this is...

698
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,296
They've gone all out for
BBC One, haven't they? Yeah.

699
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,720
They've gone, "How can we get
the ratings? We'll kill them all." Yeah.

700
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,056
To at least try and stop
this from being the last thing

701
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,360
we'd ever do, the producers had
been good enough to enlist some help.

702
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,336
Guiding us up the wall would be
the world's leading wall of death

703
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,200
rider, Ken Fox.

704
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,816
Right

705
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,856
you're going to start off
round the bottom at what

706
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,216
we call the banking track and
learning how the vehicle steers.

707
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,536
I know you're used to
driving those vehicles

708
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,016
but they steer different there

709
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,576
the steering changes a little bit
and becomes a bit more lively.

710
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,976
Then we go a little bit higher
and it will feel like you're

711
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,256
doing a million miles an
hour and it will be 20mph

712
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,456
and then we just gradually
keep building up and building up

713
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,856
until you're up there and you
don't know how it happened

714
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,976
you're just up there.

715
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,056
OK. So, Ken, what can possibly go
wrong here? What are we looking at?

716
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,976
Well, the last crash I had
I was airlifted to hospital.

717
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,896
I ripped my ear off, they
had to glue my ear back on,

718
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,416
did some ribs in my chest,

719
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,536
bashed my brains about.

720
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,576
You know when it's in your blood,
it's what you do and... Right, OK.

721
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,336
You just do it.
No, Ken, no, Ken.

722
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,056
No, Ken. No, Ken.
Both my sons...

723
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,976
You don't have any
blood. It's all on the thing.

724
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,736
It's what we do.
We enjoy doing it.

725
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,096
When you've accomplished
this, you will feel taller. Yeah?

726
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,336
I feel better with Ken.

727
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,176
You know, I know he's told us a
few bad things there... He's calm,

728
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,136
isn't he? He's very calming. I
think we need to do something, Ken.

729
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,600
Let's get something inside.
Let's do it. Let's get on with it.

730
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,840
Our training will begin in this.

731
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,536
The can-am Maverick XRS.

732
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,496
With almost 200 horsepower

733
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,416
and weighing in at just
750 kilos, it's fair to say

734
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,080
getting up the wall in this would
be much easier than in our cars.

735
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,256
All right, my mate? Yeah.

736
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,896
What it was, though, was the
perfect vehicle for Ken to give

737
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,640
us our first taste
of the vertical.

738
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,720
Here he goes.

739
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,320
What the BLEEP?

740
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,776
Whoa!

741
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,400
Go on, Paddy, lad!

742
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,856
You all right, Paddy?

743
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,360
Jesus Christ! Is it good?

744
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,216
To keep our cars on the wall...

745
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,136
Hells bells! This is so good.

746
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,296
We'd be pulling almost 4G.

747
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,600
Fred will be going
now, "Faster!"

748
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,096
Every part of our write-offs
would have to withstand

749
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,336
four times its normal load.

750
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,936
Wow. I'm getting dizzy again.
You can't watch it round, can you?

751
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,976
Getting dizzy again.

752
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,416
And, at the risk of blacking out
the longer we ran, we'd have to

753
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,280
fight to stay in control.

754
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,576
I tell you something,

755
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,736
if I'd have heard that noise first,
I wouldn't have wanted to get in.

756
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,336
It's a bit unsettling, isn't it?

757
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,456
I've not said a word there.

758
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,056
I had to hold my breath and
pump a bit cos I started to go.

759
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,336
Did you? Yeah. All good, Chris?

760
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,416
That's interesting. What?

761
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,376
How are we going
to do that? No idea.

762
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,056
How are you going to drive a
Porsche Cayman round there?

763
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,120
Not a clue.

764
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,376
We'd had our first
taste of the wall

765
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,240
and the forces we'd have
to endure to stay vertical.

766
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,600
Next, we'd do it again.

767
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,776
This time in the driver's seat.

768
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,080
You good? Good.

769
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,376
And as McGuinness got stuck into
his training session... That's weird!

770
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,776
That's good. That's good,
mate. That's excellent.

771
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,200
It turned out that
driving around in circles...

772
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,800
And faster, please.

773
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,640
Is not as straightforward
as it looks.

774
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,736
Faster! Come on.

775
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,040
Keep going. Keep going!

776
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,576
Hold it there, hold it
there, just hold it there.

777
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,416
Now he's got the
wobble on. Hold it there.

778
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,736
No, no, no, no, no, no.

779
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,240
Higher.

780
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,936
Yes, stay there,
stay there, stay there.

781
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,936
OK, come in.

782
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,896
Come in, come in.

783
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,600
Well, it wasn't pretty but he's
done it. He got up. Well done, Paddy.

784
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,096
Well done, Pad.

785
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,560
I won't lie to you, I nearly
blacked out, but it's all right.

786
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,560
With McGuinness just about
getting it, next it was my turn.

787
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,176
Perfect, perfect,
perfect. Very good.

788
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,656
And getting up and running, I
soon discovered that the real

789
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,496
challenge of the wall is keeping
your speed and line as smooth

790
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,360
as possible as you
step up to the next level.

791
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,056
Stay there, stay
there, stay there.

792
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,776
That's it, that's it.

793
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,496
Stay there.
Brilliant, well done.

794
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,016
He's on it. He's on it. He's up.

795
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,680
He's on it. Come
in, mate. Come in.

796
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,440
Get in there!

797
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Absolutely spot-on,
young man. Get in!

798
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,560
Fair play to Harris, he'd
shown how it's done.

799
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,680
But it turns out there is another
technique for tackling the wall.

800
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,960
I like to call it The Flintoff.

801
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,120
Where you place your
right foot on the accelerator...

802
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,416
He's going very fast.

803
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,840
And smash it into the floor.

804
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,416
How fast is he going?

805
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,200
That's it. Stay
there. Stay there.

806
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,120
I'm on the wall!

807
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,560
OK, come in, come
in, come in now.

808
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,056
How fast was he going?
He put his foot down then.

809
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,800
How fast was he
going? Jesus, Ken.

810
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,856
Did I get up?

811
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,360
Just. Just. We couldn't spin
our heads round quick enough.

812
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,656
Come on, then, Ken, how
have we done, the three of us?

813
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,096
All three of you, you've
done good in the toy.

814
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,376
Now we go and get
the real motors in.

815
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,536
So, who's going to
go in the cars first?

816
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,216
Go on, then, I'll give the Porsche
a whirl. All right, Paddy. Yeah.

817
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,520
Go and get the motor ready.

818
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,016
This was it, then.

819
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,056
Time to put our six grand
back-from-the-dead write-offs

820
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,360
into the biggest
test they'd ever face.

821
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,256
We'd each get one shot
at the wall in our cars

822
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,936
and to succeed, we'd have to
keep all four wheels on the vertical

823
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,280
whilst clocking at least 50mph.

824
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,320
Suffice to say, the
pressure was on.

825
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,056
I have never felt as nervous and
as scared about anything in my life.

826
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,280
This is... This is real.

827
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,720
OK, Paddy, my
friend, let's get going.

828
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,760
Here we go, he's
off. Come on, Pad.

829
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:11,000
OK, this is the weirdest thing ever,
this. Come on, Pad. Come on, Paddy.

830
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,360
Faster.

831
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,400
God. Higher. I'm
really sweating.

832
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,720
He's going up the wall.

833
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,936
Faster, faster.

834
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,416
Higher.

835
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,680
This does not feel good.

836
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,600
Wow! He's going faster.

837
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,936
Faster.

838
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,000
He's up.

839
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,960
Higher.

840
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,040
Just up, just.

841
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,416
Look at the speed.
Look at the speed.

842
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,480
Yes!

843
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,000
You're doing 55.

844
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,920
Bumper's off. He's done it.

845
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,176
Well done, Paddy!

846
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,056
55.

847
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,800
Totally happy with that.

848
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,176
My word. He's broken the
suspension. Well done, Paddy!

849
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,456
Paddy, get out and have a look
at your left rear wheel. Paddy!

850
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,656
Look at that wheel.

851
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,120
Dear me!

852
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,960
Yes! Did he really do that?

853
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,096
Who's up next, boys?

854
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,360
Chris Harris, come on down.

855
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,520
Come on, Chris!

856
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,600
McGuinness had done it.
The Cayman had just held on.

857
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,160
And now it was over to Harris.

858
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,560
Here we go, driving
a Focus up a wall.

859
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,360
OK, Chris, off you go.

860
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,720
I suddenly feel quite nervous.

861
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,000
Straight up. Straight
away. Whoa, that is mad.

862
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,936
OK, I feel stable.
And it feels bigger.

863
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,280
I haven't got as much margin
between the boards. Faster.

864
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,016
Faster.

865
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,680
Higher.

866
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,056
He's on! He's up! Come
on, Chris! Go on, Harris!

867
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,480
The front's going to come off.

868
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,120
Go on. Nearly there!
Come on, come on!

869
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,960
Something's come off.

870
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,960
Go on, Chris! Yes!

871
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,776
Has the tyre gone? That's
sketchy. What's happened?

872
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,496
What's the noise for?
Something's come off.

873
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,680
There's a bit of car...

874
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,456
Nice and steady and stop,
mate. Well done, 54.85.

875
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,936
That will do me perfectly.

876
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Well done, Chris! Yes, Harris!

877
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,120
I know, we saw that come off.
What's that? I don't know! Don't know!

878
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,616
Fantastic, pal.

879
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,256
Now, I will never, ever, ever
do the Wall Of Death again.

880
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,136
You say that, you say that.

881
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,856
Right, Flintoff, come on.

882
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,840
Go on, Fred. Finish the job.

883
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,536
Two down,

884
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,656
one to go,

885
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,616
but the wall had already badly
damaged the two smaller, lighter

886
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,536
cars and Flintoff's Maserati was

887
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,760
the biggest and
heaviest of the lot.

888
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,256
I think he has the worst
vehicle for this by a mile.

889
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,296
I'm worried about what
it's going to do on the top

890
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,016
banking at sustained speed.

891
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,056
I mean, I've got everything
crossed nothing goes wrong with it

892
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,560
but it's just not a good look.

893
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,096
Ready, Freddie? Good, mate. Right,
OK, off you go, my man. Here we go.

894
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,560
We're off. Go on, Fred!

895
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,840
This is it. The
final run of the day.

896
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,896
I tell you what, it's a
completely different experience.

897
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,176
Already looks heavy.

898
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,800
It looks outrageous from here.

899
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,320
He's going for it.

900
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,720
Mate.

901
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,400
Faster.

902
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,336
I can feel the
weight of the car.

903
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,536
It just wants to
come down the wall.

904
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,336
It's completely
different to the buggy.

905
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,136
Higher.

906
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,120
Faster. That's what
we're asking for.

907
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,840
Higher.

908
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,776
My God.

909
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,000
Feel the wind!

910
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,160
56.

911
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

912
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,696
Come in, come in.

913
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,176
Come in now.

914
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,136
Something's happened.
Something's happened.

915
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,016
Something's happened. I'm on
fire. What's happened? Just stop.

916
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,336
Just stop at that. What's happened?
Just stop, just stop. What is it?

917
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,000
Don't know.

918
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,456
That was unbelievable.

919
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,800
Did I get up?

920
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,896
Fred, when the smoke came out,

921
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,256
me and him were up here and
we were like, "Get off that wall."

922
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,336
That was properly dramatic.

923
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,736
Did I get up? Did
I get up, though?

924
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,120
I'm sure he was on the wall.

925
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,200
I can't. No.

926
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,536
I've watched the
footage back and yeah,

927
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,856
I got 50 but I didn't have all
four wheels on the vertical. No.

928
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,456
I'm the last of a dying breed

929
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,096
I'm an honest sportsman, so
I've got to hold my hands up.

930
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,816
That is very, very honest. I
give you that. I give you that.

931
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,336
I could make excuses

932
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,376
I had the heaviest car by
far, my suspension went

933
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,136
so I couldn't steer, you two had
damaged the wall before we started,

934
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,376
but that's just not how I
operate. I don't do that.

935
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,616
I don't make excuses.

936
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,216
No, and Pad, fair play to you,
mate, fastest speed on the wall.

937
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,376
That takes some
skill. It really does.

938
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,216
I don't like to talk about it,
Chris. No, of course you don't.

939
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,856
It's a collective effort,
lads. There's no "I" in "team"

940
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,896
but there is an "all" in "wall".

941
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,896
Yes! Have some of that!

942
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,656
Hadrian, Berlin, hole-in-the,
eat your heart out,

943
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,336
there's a new wall in town.

944
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,176
McGuinness's Wall
Of Death, everybody!

945
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,240


946
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,536
No, don't encourage him.

947
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,416
It doesn't make up for the fact that
you crashed a classic Lamborghini.

948
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,016
Are you still going
on about that?

949
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,816
Well, it just goes to show
about life's ups and downs.

950
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,456
You know, I can drive
an old Jag 200mph

951
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,696
but I couldn't get up the wall.

952
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,496
Paddy, you were the fastest
on the wall but you destroyed

953
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,616
an iconic supercar. Chris, you don't
do anything of note really, do you?

954
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,256
But that's important too.
The world needs mediocrity.

955
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,376
You're a plodder. Wait there.

956
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,936
You crashed a Lamborghini,

957
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,376
you couldn't get it up. OK?

958
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,856
And that's all for tonight. We
should definitely leave it there.

959
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,016
Join us next week

960
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,816
when we head off on a rental
car road trip around Cyprus.

961
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,120
See you then! Goodnight!
