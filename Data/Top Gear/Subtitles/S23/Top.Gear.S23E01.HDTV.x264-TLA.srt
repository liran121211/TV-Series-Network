1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,650
Welcome to Top Gear, with our
all-new, improved audience.

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,490
- Tonight, I get chased.
- Right behind us.

3
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,290
Matt gets chased.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,210
See if I can shake 'em in these twisties.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,530
And then, in a bizarre
twist, I chase Matt.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,450
Come on, Great Britain!

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,610
And Matt chases me.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,930
We're going to get smashed.

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,530
This is brilliant!

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,290
Marvellous, amazing, beautiful.

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,370
All right, before we go any
further, would you like to meet

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,850
the first ever non-UK host of Top Gear?

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,770
Yes!

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,620
Brilliant, please welcome Matt LeBlanc.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,200
Matt LeBlanc, everybody!

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,730
All right, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,170
Oh, you're too kind, too kind.

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,290
All right, and with
that, back to you, Chris.

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,370
Thank you very much, Matt.

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,650
OK, right, well, if it isn't
all the guys and girls

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,930
from my local Indian restaurant.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,010
- Hi, guys. - Hi, Chris. - Hi, guys.

23
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,650
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,290
- Boss man. - And, firstly, thank
you for your continued custom.

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,610
Well, you're very welcome,
you're very welcome.

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,970
Now, anybody got any idea
why these guys are here?

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,050
- New caterers.
- What?

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,570
- New caterers.
- New caterers.

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,930
By the way, by the way...

30
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,580
we don't talk about catering
on this show any more.

31
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,250
In fact, to be honest,

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,500
maybe questions from the
floor was a bad idea.

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,810
Actually, Muno, you tell
everybody why you're here.

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,370
What are you here to represent?

35
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,530
We represent the equivalent of
one metric ton of downforce.

36
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,810
That's what they are, one metric ton
of downforce, ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,210
which apparently is enough to
turn an old-time US muscle car

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,100
into a lap-time destroyer.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,300
This is Fallon US Naval Air
Station, deep in the Nevada Desert...

40
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,170
.. home to the US military's
finest array of warplanes,

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,650
and something called

42
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,090
the Naval Aviation Warfighting
Development Center,

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,570
better known as...

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,090
Top Gun.

45
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,020
♪ Highway to the danger zone

46
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,610
♪ Highway to... ♪

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,050
This is where the best of
the best get even better

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,730
in the most fearsome
aircraft on the planet.

49
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,730
The perfect place, then, to test
America's latest killer wing,

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,380
which happens to be attached to...

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,400
.. the brand-new Dodge Viper ACR.

52
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,530
Now, you might take a look at the ACR

53
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,050
and think, "With its giant long
body and front splitter and scoops

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,490
"and rear diffuser, my goodness me,

55
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,290
"that's going to be a handful to drive."

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,850
Thing is...

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,100
you'd be absolutely right!

58
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,490
0-60? Just over 3 seconds.

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,570
Top speed? 177mph.

60
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,810
Noise? Tooth-shattering.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,410
Listen to that.

62
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,330
Basically, it's a road car,
but it's got to be said,

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,170
it's as close as you can come to
a race car without having to wear

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,180
fireproof knickers and a wristband
with your blood group on it.

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,370
All highly exciting, but the
Viper formula has barely changed

66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,250
since God was a boy, and you can tell.

67
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,690
We all love a manual gearbox, but
this one's a little bit tight.

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,610
It's offset at a weird
angle, which means that third

69
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,740
can often become fifth if
you're not fully concentrating.

70
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,580
And then there's the Viper's
prehistoric power output.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,900
An 8.4-litre V10 chucks
out 645 horsepower.

72
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,890
But, at its heart, it's a
quarter of a century old.

73
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,460
Modern supercars produce far more
power from engines half the size.

74
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,460
It's about as cutting
edge as a rusty crowbar.

75
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,210
But Dodge have at least
polished their crowbar up a bit.

76
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,730
The ACR has bespoke sticky tyres,
brakes as big as dinner plates,

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,220
race car suspension and,
most importantly, the wing.

78
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,290
This piece of carbon, like the
inverted wing on a fighter plane,

79
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,130
actually jams the Viper into the
tarmac with phenomenal power.

80
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,450
On the straights, it
actually slows the car down,

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,010
but going into the bends at
top speed, over a tonne of air

82
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,410
presses the Viper into the floor.

83
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,770
A tonne!

84
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,930
And it really works.

85
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,610
The Viper ACR holds 13 track records,

86
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,180
more than any other car
in production right now.

87
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,170
So, after all these years,

88
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,450
it seems Dodge has finally
perfected their Viper.

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,220
Good for them.

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,130
Or at least it would be

91
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,340
if the competition hadn't
been busy making this.

92
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,490
The Corvette Z06...

93
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,810
or, as the Americans have it, the Zee 06.

94
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,450
It's more powerful, it's quicker to 60,

95
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,370
its top speed is higher,
it's cheaper to buy

96
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,170
and it looks better.

97
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,620
But which one, then, is
the king of muscle cars?

98
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,170
Viper or Vet?

99
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,180
It was time for a dogfight.

100
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,100
Our cars have been equipped
with guns -- laser guns.

101
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,210
Manning those guns will
be Top Gun instructors

102
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,330
call signs JoJo and Syphin.

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,730
And at the wheel of the Vet,

104
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,010
Top Gear's top girl, Sabine Schmitz.

105
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,090
I feel the need, the need for speed.

106
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,900
The rules are simple. First
to get missile lock wins.

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,370
Ginger, I don't like you
because you are dangerous.

108
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,130
We've got a rule here at Top Gun --

109
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,250
it's a 10 fine every
time you quote the movie.

110
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,580
JoJo, I think Sabine's ego is
writing cheques her body can't cash.

111
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,970
This is going to be an expensive day.

112
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,220
Whoa, rock and roll, JoJo.

113
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,210
She's right behind us,
she's right behind us.

114
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,050
- Get behind him.
- I'll get closer.

115
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,410
Time for a little... evasive action.

116
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,700
I'm going to hit the brakes
and watch her fly by, OK?

117
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,490
Have you got him?

118
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,010
Three, two, one.

119
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,450
Fire!

120
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,570
Brakes.

121
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,450
Whoa!

122
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,490
There she goes!

123
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,210
Go, go, go.

124
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,890
Son of a...

125
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,680
The hunter has now become the hunted.

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,410
He's on our tail!

127
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,850
- Get closer, get closer.
- I'm going to reel her in.

128
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,260
Woo!

129
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,330
Don't let her get away from you.

130
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,330
The Viper's wing is doing its thing, baby.

131
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,410
Until I found out there's a limit
to how much "thing" it can do.

132
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,440
Oh, he spun! He spun off.

133
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,490
You can be any time my wingman.

134
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,740
- Wait, what is wingman?
Not wingman? - Yeah.

135
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,500
Whilst I was recovering from
my aerodynamic overconfidence...

136
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,100
.. Schmitz disappeared.

137
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,820
Where would the enemy
most likely come from?

138
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,140
- Probably where you're
not looking. - Really?

139
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,130
Have you ever had an angry
German on your tail before?

140
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,120
I've never had that.

141
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,040
She so wants to win.

142
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,530
Go, go.

143
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,520
I follow you, buddy.

144
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,500
- Eyes left.
- Oh, oh.

145
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,530
We're on his tail, we're on his tail!

146
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,930
The smiling assassins were all over us.

147
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,490
Get closer.

148
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,730
Or at least, that's what they thought.

149
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,220
Shoot!

150
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,090
Missed him.

151
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,170
That's when she can't keep up with us --

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,960
round the corners, the Vet is killed.

153
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,730
She's all over the place.

154
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,720
The suspension's awful... like a Ferrari.

155
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,320
There's so much more grip
than this piece of sh...

156
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,250
Jeez, this car's good!

157
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,240
She will not be able to make this corner.

158
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,020
We missed it!

159
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,340
- Where is he?
- I don't see him.

160
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,690
Yeah!

161
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,080
She's dead, man, she's dead.

162
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,610
Boom, she's dead.

163
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,380
Oh, holy moley.

164
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,530
I might need a break, Sabine.

165
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,730
- Huh? - I might need a
break. - You need a break?!

166
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,770
- I might need a break. - What? - Yeah.

167
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,220
Oh, sh...

168
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,490
Sorry, I... My Top Gun pilot
is a little bit, er, in trouble.

169
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh, did he throw up?

170
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,770
Is it time for a new call sign?

171
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,290
- Er, yeah.
- Upchuck.

172
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,410
Yeah. Pukes on Top Gear.

173
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,820
Oh, no!

174
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,420
And so it's the Viper
that is officially Top Gun.

175
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,610
Fast, agile, and once you know how
to use it, absolutely devastating.

176
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,860
Top Gun, clear to take off...

177
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,020
Whoa-oa-oa!

178
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,890
Fly safe, my friend.

179
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,580
Fly safe.

180
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,770
- That was good. - That was
good fun, wasn't it? - Great.

181
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,810
Thank you, thank you.

182
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,410
And thanks to the US
Navy, and Sabine Schmitz,

183
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,730
now undoubtedly the
queen of the Vomit Comet.

184
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,810
OK, now, just... hang on a second.

185
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,770
Do you seriously expect all
these people to believe

186
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,170
that she made a guy who
flies fast jets in wars

187
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,530
throw up after just, like, a
half an hour in a Corvette?

188
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,610
Yes, because that's what happened.

189
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,290
Are you sure that it wasn't
just a ruse that you came up with

190
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,740
to cover up the fact that she
made you throw up in an Audi?

191
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,530
No.

192
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,530
OK, just chicken... checking!

193
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,930
- Did you say "chicken"?
- No. - All right, anyway...

194
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,250
Here is the Viper ACR
in the flesh, everybody.

195
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,290
- And now...
- Woo!

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,610
.. we need to see how fast
it can go around our lap,

197
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,010
which means only one thing.

198
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,810
Yes! It's time to bring
on our tame racing driver.

199
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,300
We got custody! We got custody!

200
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,210
Some say the day he was born,

201
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,170
he drove himself home from the hospital,

202
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,500
and that he's being investigated
for irregular emissions.

203
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,730
All we know is, he's called...

204
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,460
.. the Stig.

205
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,290
OK, here we go, he's off.

206
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,530
The Stig back in the saddle and
armed with 8.4 litres of engine.

207
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,930
That's 15 pints of displacement.

208
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,810
Into the first corner and the first
test of the ACR's massive wing.

209
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,410
Stig keeping it tidy there.

210
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,170
Let's see how happy he is
to be back in the groove.

211
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,810
Oh, look at him beaming! He's ecstatic.

212
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,930
Right, very clean through
Chicago, heading into Hammerhead...

213
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,300
on those massive brakes.
Can the Viper keep it tidy?

214
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,210
Very neat. Little skid there.
Little slip on the exit.

215
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,210
Into the fastest part of the lap.

216
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,570
Stig and Viper in perfect harmony.

217
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,330
Follow Through, that wing
shoving the ACR into the tarmac.

218
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,130
Serious speed past the
tyre wall. Look at that.

219
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,170
No expense spared on the white paint.

220
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,730
Second-to-last. Very stable under braking.

221
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,090
Stig can smell the finish now. Come on!

222
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,610
And over the line. There you go!

223
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,420
So...

224
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,730
Here we have the time.

225
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,210
OK, we're holding out
a lot of hope for this.

226
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,050
It if goes 1:16.8 or less,

227
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,090
it's up there with the
Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.

228
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,050
Can it beat the Lamborghini
Huracan -- 1:15.8?

229
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,890
I can tell you the Dodge Viper...

230
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,490
1:15...

231
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,370
. 1 -- there it is with the Ariel Atom.

232
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,300
Rock and roll!

233
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,050
So I join Top Gear. They
say, "How about a road trip

234
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,530
"and a UK/USA challenge?"

235
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,210
I say, "Sure." They say,
"Head-to-head with Chris."

236
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,450
I say, "Bring it on." They say,
"Blackpool." I say, "Where?"

237
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,700
They say, "In fibreglass
three-wheelers." I say, "What?"

238
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,580
We'd be driving to Blackpool in these...

239
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,540
.. stunning Reliant Rialtos.

240
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,290
Oh, wow, look at that.

241
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,330
OK.

242
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,850
Successor to the Reliant Robin and
equally as terrible in every way.

243
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,970
Worse still, the producers
had kindly chosen

244
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,160
to chop off their roofs.

245
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,250
Nice wheels, Matt.

246
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,890
Great paint job.

247
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,930
They've told me that one of
these costs double the price

248
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,930
of the other one, so I suppose
we could try and guess which one.

249
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,970
I mean, mine looks nicer, to be honest.

250
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,050
- Don't you think?
- Yours is nicer, yeah.

251
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,250
I think this was the more expensive
one. I'm sorry, but... I don't know.

252
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,570
- I don't know, I'm just guessing.
- Yeah. Looks like it.

253
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,050
- OK, and you know where we're going?
- Yeah. We're going...

254
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,490
- The route? - Yeah, we're
going to Blackpool, so we'll...

255
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,050
We'll come out of central
London here and we'll turn left

256
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,090
at Regent's Park, look out for Birmingham.

257
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,690
- If they start talking in a Braveheart
accent, we've gone too far. - That's too far.

258
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,770
- Yeah. - That's too far north, OK.
- Yeah. But it's about 250 miles.

259
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,860
All right, let's roll.

260
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,490
With zero idea what challenges
awaited us in Blackpool,

261
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,730
we set off on our very
first Top Gear road trip.

262
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,770
This is perfect. You wrap up warm, you've
got blue skies, it's nice and fresh.

263
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,890
It's not that bad, this little car.

264
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,890
You know what, honestly,
gearbox, nice and smooth.

265
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,480
OK to give you a little love tap?

266
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,660
Erm, OK!

267
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,970
Despite our first impressions,
we were loving our three-wheelers.

268
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,180
Listen to that.

269
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,730
Hey, there's fourth gear now.

270
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,490
Oh, I haven't tried fourth
gear. Tell me about it.

271
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,580
Very luxurious.

272
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,340
Buddy!

273
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,890
Thing is about Matt, is
because he's such a superstar,

274
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,490
he actually looks cool in his
Stars and Stripes Reliant.

275
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,010
He-hey!

276
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,090
I just look like a dick!

277
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,930
And with London traffic behind us,
things were actually looking good.

278
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,050
At least, so I thought.

279
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,290
Chris, what's that smell?

280
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,130
Ooh.

281
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,370
'Just 26 miles into our journey,
my Reliant gave another hint

282
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,370
'that it might be the cheaper car.'

283
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,210
The temperature gauge just
started going up, up, up.

284
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,340
It's just water, coolant, it's
overheating. It's not oil smoke.

285
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,690
- That'll be it. - That's
the problem. - That's it.

286
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,330
- That's the problem.
- Be fine now.

287
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,500
Problem solved. Soon we
were back on the road.

288
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,170
- Hey, Matt, how's the car?
- Running like a top now! Runs great.

289
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,360
Blackpool, here we come!

290
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,450
I just saw a sign for Oxford.

291
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,530
- Does that mean we're near Blackpool?
- Not really, to be honest.

292
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,740
- Um, no. We're sort of half
the country away still. - Right.

293
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,410
'And then...'

294
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,810
The temperature gauge has pinged.
It's all the way high again.

295
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,690
If you don't want to go
to Blackpool, just say.

296
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,650
'Frankly, this was
getting a little suspect.

297
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,130
'A UK versus US challenge in British
three-wheelers on a British TV show

298
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,810
'and the car they'd given to the American

299
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,650
'decided to roll over and die... again.'

300
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,330
You know, you watch Top
Gear on TV and you see them

301
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,570
driving Bentleys and
Porsches, and they invite you

302
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,210
to be on the show, you say,
"Sure, that sounds great."

303
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,130
And they make you drive
this... from here to eternity.

304
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,370
And his runs fine.

305
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,170
You all right?

306
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,210
- Honestly...
- Does it look like I'm all right?

307
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,810
- It's nothing to do with
me. - I'm happy. - Are you?

308
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,970
Don't I look happy? That's my happy face.

309
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,370
It's a good face. You're a great actor.

310
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,850
It goes up on the corners, like this.

311
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,450
Still 200 miles from Blackpool,
we put our heads together

312
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,300
and got Matt's car back in the groove.

313
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,700
Drives itself, this thing, really.

314
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,450
But as we pushed north, the
chilly winter air started to bite.

315
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,220
Fortunately, though, the producers
had kindly packed some extra clothing.

316
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,810
It's now raining, it's much
darker, it's much colder.

317
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,050
I'm dressed like Captain Birdseye.
Matt is dressed like a bear.

318
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,850
When this piece is over, I'm
going to have a good long talk

319
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,290
with the wardrobe department.

320
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,010
Got to be firm. Behind closed doors.

321
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,900
With a stick.

322
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,730
- A big stick.
- But ever the professional,

323
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,170
LeBlanc soon got stuck into his
first ever Top Gear car review.

324
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,250
Let's talk about this gem
of an automobile here.

325
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,220
Acceleration -- can't tell.

326
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,130
Handling -- can't tell.

327
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,330
The clock works, apparently.

328
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,420
It's midnight.

329
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,900
The fabric on the seats is disgusting.

330
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,530
I wonder when they finished
the first prototype,

331
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,490
did they shine it all up,
step back, look at it and say,

332
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,810
"Oh, yeah, nailed it"?

333
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,660
Do you think that was the conversation?

334
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,690
'Delirium was beginning to take hold...'

335
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,970
'.. of both of us.'

336
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,450
My windscreen wiper is
now imitating the sound

337
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,980
of a seagull at the seaside.

338
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,330
'But the great British public
were still doing their bit

339
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,520
'to cheer us on our way.'

340
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,490
How you doin'?

341
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,770
'And by the time we got north
of a place called Birmingham...'

342
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,250
Do we have to pay for the
one that's on the truck?

343
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,780
'.. morale had hit rock bottom.'

344
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh, it's really raining now.

345
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,130
Hey, listen, you know what?

346
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,490
Between the cold weather and
these flashing yellow lights,

347
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,010
I'm going to lose my mind, man.

348
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,330
'Time for decisive action.

349
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,210
'I figured my Reliant had
about ten miles left in it,

350
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,450
'and while I hadn't been
able to drive to Blackpool,

351
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,210
'I could at least drive into Blackpool.'

352
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,250
So this is what we're going to
do -- we're going to pull over,

353
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,820
get the car off the truck and,
hopefully, she lasts into Blackpool.

354
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,250
You're going to last,
aren't you? Honey? Come on.

355
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,770
'Despite being lumbered with
the worst car in the world,

356
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,570
'Matt was determined to get
there under his own steam.

357
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,860
'Or, as it turned out, his own
smoke. Lots of his own smoke.'

358
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,130
That's more smoke than I've ever seen

359
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,810
coming out of a car that isn't on fire.

360
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,810
I'm not stopping again.

361
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,460
I'm going to go until it blows up.

362
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,260
- If I see an actual flame, I
will tell you. - Thanks, bro.

363
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,220
Matt, we are so close to
Blackpool. Please make it.

364
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,700
Come on, baby.

365
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,460
We're going to do it.
We're going to do it.

366
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,500
Oh, it just died!

367
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,810
Come on, we're there, Matt!
We're there! You can't stop!

368
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,730
It won't restart.

369
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,730
'There was only one thing for it.'

370
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,770
'The love tap.'

371
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,340
- It's running! It's running! Go!
- Come on, Matt's car!

372
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,730
Purring like a kitten. Woo!

373
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,450
Thanks, Chris. Thanks for the start.

374
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,530
Come on, Matthew! We're going to make it.

375
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,370
OK, come on, baby. Hold it
together. It's about 500 metres.

376
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,560
Blackpool, here we come!

377
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,740
- Yes! - All right! We
made it! Woo! - Woo!

378
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,540
LeBlancpool! Genius.

379
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,820
- Yeah-heh!
- Yee-haw!

380
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,650
Matt LeBlancpool. It doesn't get
any better than that, does it?

381
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,730
No, it doesn't. No, it
doesn't. No, it doesn't.

382
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,770
- But as you and I both know...
- Oh, yes.

383
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,050
.. it did get wetter, windier,
wilder and weirder. That's right.

384
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,250
More Top Gear presenter torture I
really did not sign up for coming up.

385
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,690
- Yeah, sorry about that. See
you later. - Yeah, OK. - OK.

386
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,210
All right, how about we now meet tonight's

387
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,900
Star in a Reasonably Priced Car?

388
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,450
Well, we can't.

389
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,610
How about we meet tonight's Two
Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car?

390
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,700
Well...

391
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,530
.. that's not going to
happen either, I'm afraid.

392
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,330
But how about we meet tonight's two stars

393
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,890
in a brand-new rally cross car?

394
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,930
We can do that! Please welcome
Gordon Ramsay and Jesse Eisenberg!

395
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,730
Jesse, how are you? Gordon, how
are you? Come and sit down.

396
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,730
- Thank you. - Come on,
guys. - Thank you very much.

397
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,770
- Jesse Eisenberg, Gordon Ramsay.
- Thank you.

398
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,690
Thank you.

399
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,370
- Gentlemen, welcome. - Thank
you so much. - Good to see you.

400
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,410
- Welcome to the programme.
So first of all, Jesse. - Yes.

401
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,490
Can you tell us, please, what
Gordon's up to at the moment?

402
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,530
Yes, of course. I've been rehearsing this.

403
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,130
Yes, Gordon Ramsay, who is
currently seated to my right,

404
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,770
is preparing to compete in an
ironman in June to raise money

405
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,250
for the Gordon and Tana Ramsay
Foundation, as well as which

406
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,170
he will be making a record
sixth appearance in Soccer Aid,

407
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,570
where he'll once again be risking
actual bodily harm, like this.

408
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,300
- Painful.
- Ow!

409
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,170
And, Gordon, how long were you
affected by that injury for?

410
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,130
Cos you were stretchered off, weren't you?

411
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,490
I was ill for about five weeks after that

412
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,130
because I just didn't expect it.

413
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,170
It's not as if you can prepare yourself

414
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,170
and get sort of tense to take the
hit. So, yeah, naughty Teddy.

415
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,050
- And have you seen Sheringham since?
- Funnily enough, no.

416
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,290
Now, can you do me a favour?

417
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,770
Can you tell us what Jesse's
up to at the moment, please?

418
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,610
- Yes, I would, but I can't - BLEEP
- see that. It's so, so small.

419
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,650
Can't really see. That's better.

420
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,490
It is tiny. It is. It is...

421
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,530
Jesus, that... that is
super small. Thank you.

422
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,410
So, Jesse Eisenberg,
currently seated to my left,

423
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,410
is performing in the incredible
satirical comedy play The Spoils,

424
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,450
written by Jesse himself.

425
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,690
It's playing now at Trafalgar Studios.

426
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,890
Sadly, obviously, there's no video
available, but here's another clip

427
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,260
of me getting clattered again,
this time in slow motion.

428
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,660
Oh! Oh!

429
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,890
And watch this -- just
have a look at this.

430
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,410
Any sympathy? I don't think so.

431
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,740
That's...

432
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,730
- All right, cars. Are you
ready, boys? - Sure. - Yes.

433
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,170
OK, audience, you are going
to decide who lays claim to,

434
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,450
first of all, as far as these two
are concerned, best first car.

435
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,210
Let's go with Gordon
first. Gordon's first car?

436
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,730
A Fiat Strada.

437
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,490
That's shocking. Can I just
apologise about the hair as well?

438
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,210
- Sorry. Jesus. - Well, it may have to
become best first car and hair, this feature.

439
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,330
So we have the Strada.

440
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,330
OK, best first car. Your first car, Jesse?

441
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,170
Yes, my first car was,
like, a Honda Accord.

442
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,930
- Honda Accord! Here we go.
- Yeah!

443
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,690
- Yes, yes, yes. - Once again, I'm feeling
this is best first car and hair competition.

444
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,090
Yeah, yeah, I... See, I
had a haircut at the time

445
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,730
cos I couldn't fit in
that car with that haircut.

446
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,170
And... yes. No, that car, by the
time I got it, it had probably been

447
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,450
through, like, 35 owners,
including, like, Henry Ford.

448
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,770
And it was so broken down
that the engine would overheat

449
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,410
every time I drove it, so I had
to drive with the heat fully on

450
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,210
in order to extract the heat from it.

451
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,570
I don't even know if that's true. My dad
said I had to drive with the heat fully on,

452
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,090
which now, in retrospect,
seems like a practical joke

453
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,450
he was playing on me, but
then seemed totally logical.

454
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,050
OK, so audience, you
decide. Best first car.

455
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,130
Let's have a look at them
both again, here we go.

456
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,970
It is a cheer for Gordon's Fiat Strada...

457
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,420
.. and hair.

458
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,850
Or Jesse's Honda Accord and hair.

459
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,250
Ooh, Jesse just gets that
one, don't you think so?

460
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,930
- He just gets it. - One-nil,
Jesse, congratulations. - One-nil.

461
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,690
Are you ready for best car ever
now? Gordon's best car ever.

462
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,250
- Oh!
- Oh!

463
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,530
The LaFerrari.

464
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,770
Yes, an absolute beast.

465
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,850
How long have you owned yours for?

466
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,850
I got delivery... yeah,
about nine months ago.

467
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,130
- Right. - I told Tana I
was buying an electric car.

468
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,770
Well, it is a little bit
electric, isn't it, I suppose?

469
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,810
- Isn't it?
- A little bit electric.

470
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,570
Can you recall the first ever
drive you had in your LaFerrari?

471
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,410
Yes. Meg asked if I'd go
and pick her up from school,

472
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,050
so she had, like, a netball
tournament up in Ascot.

473
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,050
So I took a little spin out
there, literally from the showroom

474
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,970
- and drew up in the school
and Meg went - BLEEP - crazy.

475
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,490
She said, "Dad, how can you
embarrass me like this?

476
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,490
"The noise of the car,
we had to stop playing,

477
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,330
"everybody's staring at me."

478
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,770
And I said, "But you've got
no idea, this car's..."

479
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,090
She said, "Yeah, but you look
like a grandad in a Batman's car."

480
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,250
So this is your best ever car now.

481
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,130
But you may have a sort
of future best car.

482
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,810
There's one on the way. There's
another little thing proving...

483
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,890
- What's this? What's this?
- So this is from Ferrari.

484
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,090
And I got it sent about three months ago.

485
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,210
And they're doing a limited
edition of the LaFerrari.

486
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,610
- So what are we talking about?
- The LaFerrari Spider.

487
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,170
They made 499 of these beauties.
These, I think, they're making 100.

488
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,530
- 150. - OK. - There's the key. - Wow.

489
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,690
This is the first proof on TV, radio
or in a magazine that this car exists,

490
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,730
cos anybody you ask about this car to do
with Ferrari, they go, maybe, maybe not.

491
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,650
But you have actually ordered one,
and this is what they've sent you?

492
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,570
- Yes. - So you've parted with a lot
of money, and they've sent you a box?

493
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,250
Yes.

494
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,610
Well, you're a very lucky boy, well done.

495
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,050
And if this is ever going to
be attached to anything else,

496
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,450
- then good luck with that, too.
- It's great.

497
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,290
- So, Jesse, you are up for best car ever
against LaFerrari. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,930
What are we thinking about
Jesse's chances here, everybody?

499
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,250
Yeah. I need some kind of
spaceship to compete with it.

500
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,610
- Remember, it's your vote that counts.
- I think I might win the sympathy vote.

501
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,290
The nicest car I've ever had was that
Honda Accord from the previous image.

502
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,810
- No, come on, it's not. Come on.
- Yes, it is, it is. It is, it is.

503
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,970
No. I moved to... I moved to
New York City, I ride a bicycle.

504
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,810
Didn't you have a Nissan once?

505
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,010
No, no, I learned to drive on, like, I
think maybe an Altima, a Nissan Altima.

506
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,130
But it was also not a
good car. I mean, not...

507
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,130
- At the time it was really... you know, had
been used by several generations. - All right.

508
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,930
So far, the LaFerrari or the
Nissan Altima, what are we thinking?

509
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,050
Wait, wait, before they vote, can I just
say, mine has an air freshener in there.

510
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,650
We need something better
than a Nissan Altima.

511
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,290
Do you have any experience
of another car that might be

512
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,890
- a bit better that we can represent you with?
- Yes, I was in a Porsche one time. - A Porsche!

513
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,210
Shall we take the Porsche?
Let's take the Porsche.

514
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,050
- What kind of Porsche was it? Why
were you in it? - I've no idea on
either of those. I don't know.

515
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,970
No, I wound up in it for maybe
30 seconds -- does that count?

516
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,410
Yes, of course. It's going to have to,
cos we can't put this against LaFerrari.

517
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,770
Did it look a bit like this one,
perhaps? 356, was it like that?

518
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,770
- Oh, that's nice. - It looked nothing
like that. - Gorgeous car, by the way.

519
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,130
- Beautiful. - Nothing like that? - Nothing
like that. - OK, was it more like this one?

520
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,530
- 2.7 RS? - No, no, it was much
more modern. - Really? - Yeah.

521
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,770
- OK. Was it like this
one? Carrera GT? - Oh.

522
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,290
It was somewhere between the
yellow one and this one, yeah.

523
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,330
OK, was it like this one?

524
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,850
- Just use your acting
skill. Say yes... - Got it.

525
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,130
- Was it like that? - Yeah, it was
exactly that one. - OK, perfect! Perfect.

526
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,850
OK, so once... Once
again, you're in charge.

527
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,890
- OK, remember, Gordon's one down
here, everybody, OK? - Yes. Come on.

528
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,290
Best car ever between Gordon
Ramsay and Jesse Eisenberg.

529
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,970
Is it Gordon's LaFerrari,
or is it Jesse's 918?

530
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,760
Let's hear it for Gordon's LaFerrari.

531
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,330
Let's hear it for Jesse's 918!

532
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,890
- Oh, no! - Nothing. Not even
one person. - Gordon wins.

533
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,730
I should have brought my mother
here, she would have voted for me.

534
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,730
It's one-all. It couldn't
be more exciting.

535
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,250
Shall we have the decider as the lap?

536
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,570
- Yes!
- Yes.

537
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,490
OK, let's go with Gordon first.

538
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,170
Here we go. Our muddy Mini Cooper, then.

539
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,730
136 horsepower of prime British beef.

540
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,460
- Come on. - Can he handle it? - Let's
go, baby. - BLEEP - nail this one.

541
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,090
First corner. Here it is.

542
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,690
All change, sharp right-hander now.

543
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,890
And straight onto our first
dirt section, everybody.

544
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,450
And the water splash, brand-new.

545
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,820
Look at that, woohoo!

546
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,930
Oh, very nice, Gordon.

547
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,100
Into Hammerhead.

548
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,210
Oh, come on! Round of
applause, ladies and gentlemen.

549
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,690
Excellent control. Right,
our second off-road section.

550
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,530
- Heading towards the hairpin.
- Come on.

551
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,410
Apparently, the fastest way around
this is with a handbrake turn.

552
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,290
Does he go for it? Yes, yes, he
does go for it with a handbrake turn.

553
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,650
- Used the handbrake?
- Up.

554
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,730
Coming up, our jump. Our brand-new jump.

555
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,290
And... all right! Big air
there from Gordon Ramsay.

556
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,530
More big air from Gordon Ramsay.

557
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,770
Right, back onto terra firma
and approaching the tyre wall.

558
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,330
- Oh.
- Left, left, left, left.

559
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,330
- Get out of the - BLEEP
- way, bird. Before I eat you.

560
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,330
His next-to-last corner. This
often catches lots of people out.

561
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,850
Very tidy. Bit of counter-steering there.

562
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,770
And finally round Gambon,
and he's across the line.

563
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,500
There you go.

564
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,570
- How did that look? - Loved
that. - Yeah? - Great.

565
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,610
- First-ever lap time. - I know,
thank you. - OK. - Thank you.

566
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,650
- OK. Right. Jesse.
- Yeah.

567
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,130
How did that look to you, compared
to how you think yours turned out?

568
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,570
Well, that's how I pictured myself,
but I'm sure I look a lot different.

569
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,610
- Shall we have a look?
- If you need to.

570
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,290
Jesse's lap. Here we
go, come on, everybody!

571
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,530
This is the one.

572
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,730
Into the first corner. Looking smooth.

573
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,890
No tyre squeal there. Slow and
steady... could win the race.

574
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,610
OK, fight all instincts to go too
fast, this is really slippery.

575
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,490
Towards the water splash,
let's have a look.

576
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,380
Yay!

577
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,730
OK. Bit of trail-braking there.

578
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,770
Call it what you like, I'm not quite sure,

579
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,130
never seen it before, to be honest.

580
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,650
All right, now. There he
is through Hammerhead.

581
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,650
Enjoying the scenery as he goes.

582
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,290
Will he ever get to the
second off-road section?

583
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,050
And, yes, he's on the
second off-road section.

584
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,370
Now the thing with the handbrake.

585
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,330
Can we see the Scandinavian flick?

586
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,930
Actually, that wasn't bad, I
don't think. That was all right.

587
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,130
Hey, thank you very much for your pity.

588
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,650
And air. There's some air!

589
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,890
Nice through the tyres there.

590
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,610
Next-to-last corner, hard left.

591
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,090
Tight, good line.

592
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,450
And round Gambon, and
Jesse is over the line.

593
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,100
OK, so...

594
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,290
What do you think, guys?

595
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,410
I have an idea.

596
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,770
The thing about the conditions
today was they were near perfect.

597
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,290
And so one of you could end
up top of our leaderboard.

598
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,730
Right, right.

599
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,770
Well, Gordon, this is
automatically the fastest lap ever

600
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,570
until we have Jesse's, because
it's the first lap ever.

601
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,050
Gordon Ramsay, you did our
brand-new rallycross circuit

602
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,540
in our rallycross car...

603
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,890
.. in 1:56.3, everybody!

604
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,970
- Yeah. I'll take that.
- Well done. - I'll take that.

605
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,690
- There for now. - All right. - Yes.

606
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,010
- OK. - Yeah. - Jesse, looking
at 1:56.3 and seeing the film...

607
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,210
- Yeah.
- .. what would you like to be?

608
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,250
I think you could just move that
colon over one... one number.

609
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,330
OK. 15 minutes, 63 seconds.

610
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,770
Would you like to be under two minutes?

611
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,370
- Would you like...? What do you think?
- I'm just happy I'm alive.

612
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,890
So, yeah, whatever you want
to put me on. I don't care.

613
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,330
OK, well, I can tell you,

614
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,530
Jesse Eisenberg went round
our course in one...

615
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,490
- Yes!
- Oh!

616
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,210
- I'm joking. - Oh! - 2:10.9 seconds.
There you go, Jesse Eisenberg!

617
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,130
Hey!

618
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,890
Going to be close together,
closer together. Thank you, Jesse.

619
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,970
- You know what, that's not bad.
- Thank you, Gordon. - Thank you so much.

620
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,220
Come on, guys!

621
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,010
I don't know about you, but I
often lie awake in bed thinking,

622
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,690
"When they approach Top Gear
to remake Lawrence of Arabia --

623
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,610
"which they will --

624
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,690
"what car are we going to
replace the camel with?"

625
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,610
Well, those crazy Brits
who came up with this,

626
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,210
the bonkers Ariel Atom, think
they might have the answer.

627
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,300
Check this out.

628
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,740
It's called the Nomad.

629
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,200
And it's some sort of off-roader.

630
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,570
Look, I don't really want
to start by picking apart

631
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,530
your strange British cars,
but as an off-roader,

632
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,170
the Nomad does suffer a few tiny flaws.

633
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,610
'First of all, getting in.'

634
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,700
No.

635
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,930
A door would have been nice.

636
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,050
'And where most off-roaders
have four-wheel drive,

637
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,650
'the Nomad makes do with just two.'

638
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,610
So if you get stuck, you're
probably not going to get unstuck.

639
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,450
'Worse still, as you can clearly
see, the Nomad is full of holes.'

640
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,220
Yeah, getting wet here. Getting
really quite wet. Yeah.

641
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,690
'So, as a conventional off-roader,
the Nomad is completely useless.

642
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,090
'But conventional can be so... boring.'

643
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,180
Woo!

644
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,820
On a surface like this, you simply
shouldn't be able to go this fast.

645
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,740
Behind my head is the latest 2.4
litre four-cylinder Honda engine.

646
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
Makes 235 horsepower.

647
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,650
In an age of 600 horsepower family sedans,

648
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,220
that doesn't seem like a lot.

649
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,210
'And it's not a lot.

650
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,690
'But because the Nomad weighs as
much as your mother's G-string...'

651
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,370
.. this thing hauls ass!

652
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,210
0-60 takes just 3.4 seconds.

653
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,090
And unless your other car is a superbike,

654
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,140
or a cheetah with a saddle on
it, that ought to be enough.

655
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,580
'And so should its top speed.
Sure, it's only 125mph...'

656
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,610
.. but it feels like
more. Much, much more!

657
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,780
This is not off-roading.
This is low-level flight.

658
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,090
Because this car is from the same
people who brought you the Atom,

659
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,290
the time they've saved on styling

660
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,140
has been spent on the important stuff.

661
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,090
The suspension is the same kind of
stuff they use in World Rally cars,

662
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,650
so the Nomad can absorb bumps that'd
split most cars clean in half.

663
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,130
Look at all that suspensioning.

664
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,100
Suspend! Suspend!

665
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,160
Oh! Oh, yes! Smooth, like a Cadillac!

666
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,440
And there's more cleverness.

667
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,250
This bodywork, if you can call it that,

668
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,650
is made of the same
material as traffic cones,

669
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,690
so it'll bend instead of dent

670
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,580
if you were to accidentally bump
into, say, a medium-sized mountain.

671
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,970
And look -- unlike the Atom, there's
a windshield. For obvious reasons.

672
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,060
Such as the wind.

673
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,410
But maybe the Nomad's
neatest trick is that

674
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,000
it isn't just brilliant off-road.

675
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,330
Most of your hardcore lightweights
-- your Atoms, your Caterhams,

676
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,570
your Radicals -- yeah,
they're great on a race track,

677
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,320
but they can be pretty hard
work on real world roads.

678
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,770
But the Nomad is more approachable.

679
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,330
You can really feel the
suspension doing its thing.

680
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,650
You feel the limits of the tyres.

681
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,500
A really flickable chassis. I love it.

682
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,450
You really feel part of the action.
You feel, I don't know, plugged in.

683
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,050
'And, OK, £33,000 is quite
a lot of money for a car

684
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,700
'with no luggage space or doors...'

685
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,540
.. but honestly, it's the
most fun you can have in a car.

686
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,730
Whoa!

687
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,290
Well, the most fun you can
have with your clothes on.

688
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,330
I remember one time, I
was with this, er...

689
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,210
Well, there was two of them actually...

690
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,250
Oh, they were supposed to cut that out.

691
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,170
So it's quick both on and off-road,
which in no way begs the question,

692
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,610
does this make the Nomad the world's
best all-terrain getaway car?

693
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,050
As we all know, one of the
hazards of modern Britain is being

694
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,330
pursued by bloodthirsty evil villains.

695
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,210
'Or to give them their
Latin name, paparazzi.

696
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,090
'But can the Nomad outrun them?'

697
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,210
To find out we've assembled
three of the most vicious,

698
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,930
cold-blooded villains on the planet.

699
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,700
Scum.

700
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,690
This is Barry. Pure evil.

701
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,420
He's going to be chasing me
with this kid's toy. Good luck.

702
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,250
This is Dave. Ruthless,
heartless, homeless, probably.

703
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,440
He'll be on a dirt bike.

704
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,810
Meet Pete. Basically a
lizard with opposable thumbs.

705
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,700
He'll be on...

706
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,380
.. whatever that is. Put that down!

707
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,770
'The challenge is, can these
villains get a clean photo

708
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,890
'of me in the Nomad?'

709
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,170
Let's find out.

710
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,210
On my mark, get...

711
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,300
Nah, just go!

712
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,530
'We'd agreed I'd get a
one-minute head start,'

713
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,010
'but the villains, being
villains, didn't play fair.

714
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,610
'Dave's bike took off like a shot.

715
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,690
'Barry's camera drone took
off like a... camera drone,

716
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,940
'and Pete took off like
a... drunk puppet.'

717
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,970
So, how to escape the villains.

718
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,060
Tip one -- weaving.

719
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,380
Ha-ha!

720
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,560
Tip two -- keep them guessing.

721
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,490
Bike's gone, bike's gone!
It's an all-aerial battle now.

722
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,930
Aerial Nomad versus aerial assholes.

723
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,850
Ha-ha!

724
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,440
Tip three -- create a smokescreen.

725
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,220
That ought to do it.

726
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,180
'And drones, it seems,
not great with dust.'

727
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,010
Drone down, drone down!

728
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,100
'So long, Barry.'

729
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,340
Then the drunk puppet man met his
worst enemy -- a moderate breeze.

730
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,370
Where's he going? I'm pretty
sure that's Algeria over there.

731
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,930
That's unlucky.

732
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,340
'But just as I was busy
basking in my own smugness...

733
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,330
'.. biker Dave was back.'

734
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,020
Sneaky. So sneaky.

735
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,780
'With the dirt bike hot on my tail,
it was time to change the play.

736
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,410
'On tarmac the Nomad's extra
grip would, in theory,

737
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,400
'give me the upper hand, especially here.'

738
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,760
See if I can shake him in these twisties.

739
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,020
I think I should be able to get
a bit of a gap on him here.

740
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,610
'Sure enough, the Nomad's
agility through the corners

741
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,130
'gave me some breathing space.'

742
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,490
So there you go. No match for the Nomad.

743
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,490
'Unless, that is, you hit traffic.'

744
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,580

The Italian Job lives, starring LeBlanc,

758
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,540
LeStig and LeAriel Nomad.

759
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,650
And what you've got to
love about the Nomad,

760
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,770
like the Viper, is that they are
just built for pleasure alone.

761
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,160
Yeah, that's right. But
now back to the pain...

762

Representing the US of A, the Willys Jeep.

768
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,770
Born in the Second World War,
the daddy of all off-roaders,

Representing the UK, the
Series One Land Rover,

771
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,730
a reliable workhorse so indestructible

772
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,920

- Two legends.

775
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,490
This is now proper USA
against the UK. This is good.

776
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,530
I know, I know, this is it.

777
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,450
This has got -- what's
this? A 2.2 litre motor

778
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,730
- and you have a one point...
- Six. - .. six litre motor.

779
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,170
Should, on paper,
absolutely spank this thing.

780
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,810
I know, but the bloke who invented
this had one of those and then,

781
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,010
sort of in his own mind,
improved it and came up with

782
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,690
- the Series One, so technically this
is a later evolution of that. - OK.

783
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,130
I think we should wait for the
weather to get a little more

784
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,090
challenging before we actually begin.

785
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,140
- Yeah, this is a little
too balmy. - Yeah.

786
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,850
Soon and, I have to say, a little
weirdly, a man in robes appeared.

787
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
as Mayor, it gives me

788
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,730
great pleasure to welcome our
two intrepid challengers.

789
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,890
Your first challenge today will be
a simple race -- the speed test.

790
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,770
1km of run-up. Fastest
through the timing gate wins.

791
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,160
Gentlemen, to your vehicles.

792
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,620
- OK.
- OK, is it all right?

793
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,690
This may take a while.

794
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,010
Since we seem to have some time to
kill, here's an interesting fact.

795
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,850
On this very stretch of
promenade in 1906, a lady called

796
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,370
Dorothy Levitt set a women's
land speed record of 91mph.

797
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,770
Come on, you beauty! For Britain.

798
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,860
Come on! Come on!

799
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,210
Oh, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried.

800
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,050
Abysmal at best.

801
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,690
- All right? - It was...
It was terrible, wasn't it?

802
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,890
Well... I mean... wasn't that bad, Granny.

803
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,250
- What do you think?
- I think...

804
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,810
Please, over 50mph. Maybe 49... 48, 49mph.

805
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,850
Your guesses seem to be dropping.

806
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,250
All right, let's see it, come on.

807
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,770
- Oh!
- No!

808
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,850
Fine, not that quick.

809
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,260
But the signs weren't looking
great for cocky Matt either.

810
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,410
Piece of cake, piece of cake.

811
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,010
Yeah, feel that American power, baby.

812
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,860
- Here we go. Yeah!
- Click it there!

813
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,410
Oh, that looked quick, didn't it?

814
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,810
Look at that face.

815
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,930
You know you've beaten
us, don't you? Yeah?

816
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:41,090
- That felt... That felt pretty quick.
- OK, erm, 43.81 to beat, OK? - 43.81.

817
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,250
For America's honour.

818
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,330
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

819
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,490
This is what happens when
you mess with the Big Dog.

820
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,850
So that's one-nil to the States

821
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,330
and it was back to robes guy
to find out what was next.

822
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,530
'I love this guy.'

823
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,410
It's time for our second challenge.

824
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,210
A British classic, the tug-of-war,
here on Blackpool Beach.

825
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,620
On your marks, get set, tug.

826
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,130
With a rope tied between us,

827
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,890
the winner would be the
first to spear their balloon

828
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,330
and this time, we'd each be
backed by some home-grown muscle.

829
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,610
Helping me were local rugby
superheroes, the Fylde Vandals.

830
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,850
And helping me was an
American football team

831
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,730
from somewhere called... Blackburn?

832
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,980
The Lancashire Wolverines.

833
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,570
'Then it turned out
robes guy had a friend.'

834
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,220
On your marks, get set, GO!

835
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,250
Come on, boys!

836
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,530
- Come on! Come on!
- Pull! Come on, pull!

837
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,130
'Never before on Top
Gear had so much effort

838
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,580
'produced so little movement.'

839
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,370
'Soon it became clear that
neither of us was going anywhere.'

840
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,610
Oh, no, no, no.

841
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,650
'And as Chris threw the
rule book out the window,

842
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,930
'the tug-of-war was
declared a no-score draw.'

843
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,930
So it remained one-nil to the USA
with just one challenge left.

844
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,410
USA, USA, USA!

845
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,290
And so back by popular demand...

846
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:30,010
Today's final challenge will be a
traditional automobile drag race.

847
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:35,570
But this is Blackpool, so we're
doing it bigger, better, brighter.

848
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,900
Welcome to the Top Gear
triple-drag challenge.

849
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,770
- Can I go?
- No.

850
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,450
We would have to race across the
beach, tow a stranded ice cream van

851
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,300
to safety and escort these
lovely ladies to the finish line.

852
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,050
So it was drag, drag and drag.

853
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,530
- Three... - Two... - One...

854
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,060
Go!

855
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,890
Oh, no! The American's got the lead!

856
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,340
I can beat him on the reverse.

857
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,050
'As we hitched up to our ice cream vans,

858
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,290
'it was pretty much neck and neck.'

859
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:21,650
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on! Oh, no!

860
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,610
'Until Matt's superior torque
started to give him the edge.'

861
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,460
Come on! He's got it absolutely nailed.

862
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,970
'And with just the ladies left to collect,

863
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,730
'I unleashed all 2.2
litres of my Jeep's power.'

864
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,450
See you later. Ha-ha-ha!

865
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,290
'With Chris flailing behind...'

866
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,530
He's already at the drag queens. No!

867
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,210
'.. I picked up Miss UK and
made a sprint for the finish.'

868
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,170
Oof!

869
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,890
Jump in, jump in, jump in! Come on!

870
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,280
Quick, quick, quick! Jump in!

871
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,810
- How's it going?
- Oh, lovely.

872
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,370
Ha-ha!

873
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,050
- Ooh!
- Careful.

874
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,490
Here we go. Yeah!

875
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:13,180
We've lost the battle but
we can still win the war.

876
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,330
'Yep, another defeat for the Brits.'

877
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,770
Two-nil to Team USA.

878
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,500
Victory, or so I thought.

879
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,690
"Congratulations, you have
completed the qualifying stage

880
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,570
"of Top Gear's UK versus USA challenge."

881
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,930
- Qualifying?
- That's what it says here.

882
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,370
"Tomorrow, you and your
respective cars will race

883
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,410
"to the top of a mountain.

884
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,850
"Matt, you have gained a
one-second head start tomorrow."

885
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,460
You're kidding me. All that effort
for a one-second head start?

886
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,860
I don't make the rules.

887
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,890
Our deciding challenge brought us
to the magnificent Lake District,

888
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,770
and a race to plant our national
flags at the top of Muncaster Fell.

889
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,960
Off-road hell awaited us.

890
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,090
And so did two old friends.

891
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,530
- Hey-hey! - Oh. - The
Reliants are back, yes!

892
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,530
Yay(!)

893
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,970
'Good thing I had my
one-second head start.

894
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,770
'Still, at least I had backup, in
the shape of professional strong man

895
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,530
'and world champion
powerlifter Nick Best.'

896
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,930
- Hey, Nick.
- Matt, what's going on?

897
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,370
Good, good, good. Thanks for helping out.

898
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,220
- How much do you lift?
- Everything.

899
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,930
And helping Chris out
would be some thin guy.

900
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,010
- Hiya. - Alistair Brownlee,
how are you doing?

901
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,650
- Good, thank you. How are you?
- Great, thanks.

902
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,010
I can lift a Jeep. I don't think he can.

903
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,290
Oh, I've been studying the
old Ordnance Survey maps

904
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,050
and I've been looking at the
tracks that we've got to go up

905
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,600
and hopefully I'll find the
smoothest and quickest way up there.

906
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,290
Let's quit the small talk
and get going. Come on.

907
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,650
Can we just have a little bit of respect

908
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,570
for my Olympic gold medallist?

909
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,050
I'll have Nick pick him up and throw
him off the hill if you don't. Let's go.

910
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,650
'And so, for the honour of our nations,

911
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,810
'and with one more British
thing I'm yet to figure out...'

912
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,860
Matt, you will go on my first cannon.

913
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,970
Chris, you will go on my second cannon.

914
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,290
Three, two, one.

915
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,530
- All right, Nick. Here we go, buddy.
- Let's do it.

916
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:38,380
Al, can you keep checking the
Reliant's still there, yeah?

917
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,450
'With the summit looming way above us,

918
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,020
'we each took our own view on
the fastest way to the top.'

919
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,490
Ah, there's nothing like a Willys Jeep.

920
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,130
- Whoa! - Think we're still
on the right route here.

921
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,370
- Yeah?
- We're doing all right, yeah.

922
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,210
Alistair's route was longer,
but undoubtedly more achievable.

923
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,970
Meanwhile, Team USA's more direct approach

924
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,010
was throwing up some obstacles.

925
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,540
- Oh, we've got some crap in the
way up here for sure, Nick. - Yeah.

926
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,410
Clearly he doesn't need my help.

927
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,850
That is a big dude.

928
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,250
It's good to have strong friends.

929
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,970
'Hang on, a friend that reads
maps isn't exactly a disadvantage.'

930
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,890
200 yards straight and a gate coming up.

931
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,250
- Disengage the brain and just
engage the power. - Got it.

932
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,300
Here we go! Whoa!

933
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,250
Surely he's not going this
fast in the Jeep. No way.

934
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,930
- Got to be, come on! - No
way. - Come on, Britain!

935
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,010
'And he was right. Back on the short
route, Nick and I were in trouble.'

936
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,050
We've missed the turn.

937
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,210
Why didn't you tell me we were
supposed to turn back there?

938
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,050
It's not my fault, you're
the one that's driving.

939
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,130
I didn't say it was your fault,
clearly it's my fault. Clearly.

940
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,650
Do you think you could pick
that up and spin it around?

941
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,690
Yeah, yeah, I can pick it up.

942
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,570
- Uh-oh.
- That's not a good sound.

943
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,250
- We're going to have to get it up.
- Yeah, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

944
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,050
- It's all right, man.
- OK. - It's all good.

945
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,600
Just go up and over, that'll
get it past the tree.

946
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,060
'So after an incredibly hands-on U-turn...

947
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,780
'.. America was back in business.'

948
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,740
And as we climbed higher,
we closed in on the Brits.

949
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,210
- Where is he now? Is he close?
- About 20 yards off us.

950
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,250
'Then things got a little... competitive.'

951
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,820
- We're going to get smashed.
- Yeah.

952
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,840
I might have tapped you
a little bit. Sorry.

953
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,490
- It's more than a tap.
- Slightly more than a tap, yeah.

954
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,330
I'm not sure that's within the rules.

955
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:58,380
- Come on, we'll find another
way. - All right. - Whoa!

956
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,820
We can cut that out.

957
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,050
'Matt and Nick had muscled
their way into the lead,

958
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,330
'but Britain never gives up.'

959
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,210
We are never more dangerous
than when we're behind, Al.

960
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,370
Underdogs, that's where
we like to be, isn't it?

961
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,930
Behind us, the Brits were
gaining confidence and ground.

962
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,300
Then our route planning
let us down. Again.

963
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,730
- Give me a push, Nick.
- Go on. Hit it.

964
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,060
Come on, baby, come on. Come on!

965
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,860
- Argh!
- Come ON!

966
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,860
Team GB were also closing in
on the summit, and also stuck.

967
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,850
No, we're not going
anywhere, I don't think.

968
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,890
- We're really struggling.
- Or at least they were,

969
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,290
until another skinny triathlete
appeared from nowhere.

970
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,330
Look at him go!

971
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,130
- Jonny! - Thought you lads could use
some help. - I think this is allowed.

972
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,450
Two Brownlees equal one
American strongman.

973
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,250
- I think that's fair.
- And then Chris cheated. Again.

974
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,490
As long as we take a bit of the Reliant
with us to the top of the hill, that's fine.

975
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,330
- Technically we've
done all right. - Yeah.

976
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:15,090
'So taking what I prefer to call a
liberal interpretation of the rules...'

977
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,010
- Yeah, he's got it!
- Yes!

978
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,690
'.. we grabbed a bit of
flag, ditched the Reliant,

979
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,650
'and pushed for the top.'

980
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,690
- Great.
- Come on!

981
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,490
Straight up. Straight up.

982
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,580
- Come on! - Come on. - Straight up.
- Come on! - Come on! We can do this.

983
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,410
I can't see, boys. Where am
I going? I can't actually...

984
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,610
Right, go, go, go.

985
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,170
With the cheating Brits
making a break for it,

986
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,770
Team Fair Play weren't far behind.

987
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,130
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

988
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,530
Get on it, get on it,
get on it. Get on it.

989
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,690
'But our Reliant Reluctant
had dropped anchor.'

990
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,780
- Give me a push, Nick. - All right.
- Come on, we're almost there.

991
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,850
- This is it. This is it!
- All right. Keep going! Keep going!

992
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,530
- We can do it! - Come on! - Stop!

993
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,130
- Ye-e-ey!
- All right, come on.

994
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,720
Put the flag up, put the flag up!

995
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,300
YEAH! USA, where are you?

996
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,890
'We were close, so close.

997
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,730
'But even with the might of one
of the world's strongest men,

998
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,890
'we weren't going to make it to
the top without a little help.'

999
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,930
Come on, boys.

1000
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,210
- ♪ Let the sunshine in
- Let it shine

1001
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,450
♪ Let the sunshine in

1002
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,570
♪ Open up your heart
and let it shine on in

1003
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,890
♪ Let the sunshine in... ♪

1004
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,210
Yeah! Woo!

1005
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,250
You didn't bring a whole car.

1006
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,730
- We brought... we brought enough of a car.
- No, no, no, no.

1007
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,970
- That's our first-ever film together.
- That's our first one.

1008
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,050
The end of the first film.

1009
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,130
OK, well, now, thank you, Blackpool,
thank you, the Lake District.

1010
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,490
- Thank you very much. - Yeah.
- That was a lot of fun, yeah.

1011
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,730
OK, I know what you
might be thinking here.

1012
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,050
You might be thinking
from the video evidence

1013
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,200
it's patently clear
that I may have cheated.

1014
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:17,330
What do you mean you "may"
have cheated? You cheated.

1015
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,370
Yeah, all right, OK. I did cheat.

1016
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,050
But after I cheated, I helped you to win.

1017
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,610
- Well, yeah, that's true. Thank
you. - Oh. - Thank you very much.

1018
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,690
- You're very welcome.
- And on that bomb...

1019
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,850
- No, no, no! We're not...
- I didn't... - No, no, no, no!

1020
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,930
- We're not doing that, no.
- I was just testing you.

1021
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,610
- Just testing you.
- Phew!

1022
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,650
Next week -- the Jaguar
F-PACE, the Porsche Macan,

1023
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,730
the Mercedes GLC and the McLaren 675.

1024
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,410
Cue the TV walk. Plus Eddie Jordan,
Jenson Button, Tinie Tempah,

1025
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,690

Goodnight, everyone! Goodnight!
