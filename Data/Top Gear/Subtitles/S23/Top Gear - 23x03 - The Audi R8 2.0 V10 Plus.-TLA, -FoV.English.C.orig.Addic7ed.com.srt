1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,490
'Tonight, I speak German...'

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,250
Vorsprung durch!

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,290
'.. the German speaks English...'

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,050
Go out, go out, go out!

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,370
'.. and Matt takes a tour of London
with superstar wheel man Ken Block.'

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,490
Oh! Westminster Bridge!

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,130
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,930
This is it, the wait is
over. Tonight is the night.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,810
Yes, the night where more cars go sideways

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,810
than ever before on Top Gear.

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,330
No, no. No, that's not
what I'm talking about. No.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,730
I'm talking about you guys
finally getting to see Chris

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,050
enjoy his breakfast twice.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,570
Once on the way down and once
again on the way back up.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,490
Can we just get this over with, please?

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,420
Sure, yeah. Let's roll the Audi R8 film.

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,970
Here is the brand-new R8 2.0,

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,560
and it's gunning for the big boys.

19
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,770
Cost -- £135,000.

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,170
Engine -- the V10 from
the Lamborghini Huracan.

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,620
Horsepower -- over 600.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,850
And there's no cheaty turbo charging here,

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,340
which means you can rev this
engine all the way to 8,700 rpm.

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,210
Even the slightest tickle of that
accelerator delivers all that power

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,660
right to the back of your head.

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,850
0-60 in 3.2 seconds.

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,730
And she will not run out of
puff until she hits 205mph,

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,010
which makes her the
fastest, most powerful,

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,250
road going Audi of all time.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,660
Vorsprung durch. Have some of that!

31
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,130
The engine might be supercar old school,

32
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,410
but everything else about the R8 is

33
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,420
reassuringly state-of-the-art.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,930
There's aluminium and carbon
fibre all over the shop,

35
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,450
which makes it a bit lighter,
but a lot stiffer than before.

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,250
And as far as looks go, it's
completely an R8 still, obviously.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,130
However, it's just subtly so
much sharper and better sculpted,

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,660
miles better looking. I love it.

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,130
Physical dials? No chance.

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,610
The entire dash is a
high-def widescreen telly

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,330
that can be configured as you desire.

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,530
And then there's the stuff you can't see.

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,170
Under your fingertips here is a
seven-speed, twin-clutch gearbox,

44
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,090
changing gear faster than you can
say, "Does it come in manual?"

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,840
Which it doesn't, by the way.

46
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,330
And because it's a bonkers fast Audi,

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,250
naturally it has to have four-wheel drive.

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,130
This, though, is especially
clever four-wheel drive

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,970
which can shove 100% of the
engine's power front or back

50
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,690
depending on which end wants it most.

51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,170
Every single second this R8 is
making a gazillion calculations

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,170
based on information drawn
from hundreds of sensors

53
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,740
that help it to decide exactly
where to push and what to shove.

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,610
One of the results of which is that
it grips so well through the corners

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,530
your internal organs will
have to apologise to each other

56
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,810
quite a lot.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,600
Here we go again.

58
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,490
So, the R8 will change gear for you.

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,290
It will alter the suspension stiffness

60
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,450
and steering response for you.

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,290
It will decide how to
divvy up the power for you.

62
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,370
ALL to give you the optimum performance.

63
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,610
There's no doubt that the
R8 is a brilliant car.

64
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,890
An amazing bit of kit,

65
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,450
but is it just a bit too friendly
to be a genuine supercar?

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,770
Or does it have a dark side?

67
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,850
To test whether the Audi computers
have removed the V10's venom,

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,250
we've come to one of the most extreme,

69
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,010
intimidating race circuits on the planet.

70
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,980
Laguna Seca.

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,100
Home to the infamous Corkscrew.

72
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,170
A high-speed descending helter
skelter over a blind crest

73
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,220
that throws you into a
sheer 30-metre drop.

74
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,690
Clearly there was only one
person in Top Gear's arsenal

75
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,680
to take to the wheel.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,700
Sabine Schmitz.

77
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,170
- Sab...
- Hm?

78
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,050
How about a challenge?

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,290
Challenge? What do you mean?

80
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,690
- Your brain versus Audi's
brain. Two flying laps. - Mm-hm.

81
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,890
First lap, the car's in control.

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,970
All the computers, all the race
aids on, gearbox in automatic.

83
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,370
- You're just a driving monkey. OK?
- Yeah, OK.

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,690
Second lap,

85
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,610
you're in charge of
everything, gearbox in manual.

86
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,540
- Sabine versus the machine.
- Oh, cool.

87
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,220
Let's go.

88
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,650
'First lap, dynamic mode.

89
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,170
'That means all of the R8's
driver's aids are on --

90
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,530
'launch control, dynamic
steering, track spec damping

91
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,010
'and traction control,

92
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,610
'faster throttle response
and a quicker gear change.'

93
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,530
Three, two, one. Go!

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,410
I'm just a monkey behind the wheel!

95
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,060
I do nothing!

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,050
It's shifting itself.

97
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,100
Whoo!

98
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,720
Corner number three.

99
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,730
No gear shift at all.

100
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,250
Are you still there?

101
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,210
We're going on the hill. Corkscrew!

102
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,420
That was fun.

103
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,370
The car has everything under control.

104
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,560
Coming to the final bend.

105
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,570
Oh, baby!

106
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,220
Home straight.

107
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,970
Oh, slow down, Sabine, please.

108
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,450
You need some fresh air?

109
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,970
Oh, [BLEEP].

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,970
[BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP!]

111
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,090
'After putting a few pounds in the
swear jar it was time for lap two.

112
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,490
'This time, all driver's aids off.'

113
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,450
OK, 1.46.78 to beat.

114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,450
Can Sabine beat the Audi machine?

115
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,460
In three, two, one. Go!

116
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,570
This is the real deal now.

117
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,290
Hairpin bend.

118
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,610
Go on, Sabine.

119
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,090
Feels better from a passenger
point of view, if that matters.

120
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,690
Yes, corner number three.

121
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,530
Going well.

122
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,730
Yeah!

123
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,520
Come on, Sabine.

124
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,970
Yeah!

125
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,450
- Feels smoother.
- Good traction.

126
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,490
Up the hill. Come on.

127
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,610
All you can see is sky!

128
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,680
Oh, much quicker into
the Corkscrew this time.

129
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,060
Hold on tight to your balls, sonny!

130
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,450
- Ah!
- Hey!

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,700
My stomach wants a divorce.

132
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,770
Two more corners left.

133
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,220
This is great stuff. Yes!

134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,890
Very late breaking into the last corner.

135
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,410
Come on, Sabine.

136
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,560
You can do it. Sideways
into the home straight.

137
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,660
- Go on, Sabine.
- Here is the finish line.

138
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,370
Whoo!

139
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,130
Stop! Stop! Stop!

140
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,050
Stop! Please, stop!

141
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,970
Go out, go out, go out!

142
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,050
Why is it red?

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,410
Strawberries. For breakfast.

144
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,570
The new Audi R8 and
Sabine Schmitz, everyone!

145
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,450
Who did beat the machine by
seven seconds. Seven seconds.

146
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,580
Yeah! Thank you very much.

147
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,250
So, Sabine, the Audi R8 V10 Plus,
Audi's fastest road car ever.

148
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,730
A hit or a miss?

149
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,490
I like the suspension, I like the
response of the steering wheel,

150
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,010
I like the power and the
brakes. Everything perfect.

151
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,010
I have a little problem with
all that technics inside,

152
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,450
you know the computer stuff.

153
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,810
Doesn't work so easy, you
really have to think about it,

154
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,850
- what you're doing. - So,
thumbs up? - Thumbs up.

155
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,970
I love it, but I'm not so
sure about strawberry boy.

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm not here.

157
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,010
OK. Didn't say you were.

158
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,610
Now it's time to hand the R8
over to our tame racing driver.

159
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,890
Some say...

160
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,130
es ist der Mann der
auch ein Rennfahrer ist.

161
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,570
Er hat zwei... Fuchse!

162
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,970
Oh, it gets me every time. I tell you.

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,730
- OK, all we know is he's called...
- .. the Stig!

164
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,970
All right. Let's do this.

165
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,290
Off the line, the Audi R8 V10 Plus.

166
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,930
Italian heart, German suit.

167
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,650
Stig, with all the computers
firmly switched off,

168
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,610
just like Sabine, of course.

169
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,930
Up to the first corner and
that's very, very tidy,

170
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,180
nip and tuck from the Stig.

171
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,610
Stealthy focus, focus stealthy.

172
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,450
Immaculate through Chicago.

173
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,930
Oh, so precise. Oh, so accurate.

174
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,570
Very Teutonic.

175
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,250
Into Hammerhead now.

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,530
Will there be any oversteer whatsoever?

177
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,970
Of course there won't.

178
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,530
The R8's four-wheel drive
system keeping everything

179
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,530
pointed in the right direction.

180
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,880
Time to open up the taps
now and step on that gas.

181
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,180
Up to the tyre wall, then.

182
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,050
Bit of a slide on the exit there.

183
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,770
Second-to-last corner.

184
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,930
Stig stamping on those
carbon ceramic brakes.

185
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,580
Still no dramas. Why would there be?

186
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,170
Round Gambon clean as
a choirboy's conscience

187
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,160
and across the line.

188
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,010
So, we have the car here
and we have the time here.

189
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,370
The Audi R8 V10 Plus,
basically a Lamborghini Huracan

190
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,970
dressed for dinner as opposed
to ragging it around the track,

191
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,290
so, it should be pretty close.

192
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,370
There's the Lamborghini Huracan at 1.15.8.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,890
And it is... 1.15.7.

194
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,610
There they are.

195
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,290
Happy together.

196
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,940
OK. OK.

197
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,730
Now, here's the film that's
made all of us the most jealous,

198
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,770
because we didn't get to make it.

199
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,180
Driving the new Ferrari F12
tdf, it's that damn Chris Harris.

200
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,320
- Hate that guy.
- Yeah.

201
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,780
This is the Ferrari 250 GT
Berlinetta Tour de France.

202
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,850
It's a car named after the legendary race.

203
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,210
No, not that one.

204
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,860
The other one.

205
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,180
The Tour de France Automobile.

206
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,810
They called it the toughest
car race in history.

207
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,970
An entire lap of France.

208
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,490
4,000-odd gruelling miles over
ten days on road, track and dirt.

209
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,700
The Tour de France made the Le Mans
24 Hours look like a Sunday fun run.

210
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,650
It ran for nearly a century,

211
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,530
but its glory days were
the end of the 1950s,

212
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,730
where this Ferrari 250
Tour de France cleaned up,

213
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,370
winning every year it competed.

214
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,220
Only 77 were ever made and
this one is worth £5 million.

215
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,370
They were easy to drive long-distance.

216
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,650
They were reliable.

217
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,370
But they were also quick.

218
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,780
This one can do 160mph.

219
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,100
Which is thanks to a three-litre
V12 producing 250 horsepower.

220
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,820
Which, by 1950s' standards, was a lot.

221
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,250
What's it like into this hairpin?

222
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,930
Second. Heel and toe. First.

223
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,170
Wow!

224
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,610
Bit of understeer.

225
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,130
Get on the gas early.

226
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,370
Grab second.

227
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,360
Listen to the noise!

228
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,410
My first day in the job.

229
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,010
Can't believe they've given me a
£5 million Ferrari to throw around.

230
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,410
Wouldn't make the best introduction to
the BBC insurance department, would it?

231
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,000
"Hi. Yeah, Chris here. New bloke."

232
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,170
The Tour de France race
didn't just run on road.

233
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,930
They'd also stop off for
a blast around any track

234
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,610
they found along the way.

235
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,600
Tracks like this one.

236
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,660
Circuit Paul Ricard.

237
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,200
Fast...

238
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,370
.. technical...

239
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,850
.. and boasting one of the
longest straights of any

240
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,840
track on the planet.

241
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,420
Just the place, then, to let
the old girl off the leash.

242
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,320
My first chance to open it up.

243
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,340
Yes.

244
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,090
Doesn't get any better.

245
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,340
That engine, that gearbox.

246
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,490
It's really hard not to
imagine yourself as some

247
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,140
gentleman racer from the late '50s.

248
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,840
What a life to lead.

249
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,770
Whoa, bit of oversteer.

250
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,980
So good was the 250 TDF that when
it reached racing retirement...

251
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,810
.. Ferrari retired its name too.

252
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,260
Now, 50 years later, the
Tour de France is back.

253
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,060
Whoa-ho-ho, ho-ho!

254
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,220
Welcome to the Ferrari F12 tdf.

255
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,820
770 bhp of brain-melting V12...

256
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,560
.. fury.

257
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,010
The basic recipe is the same
as the TDF from the '50s.

258
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,170
A normally aspirated V12 up
front, motivation from the back.

259
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,420
But this is another world.

260
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,970
OK.

261
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,130
This isn't officially
called the Tour de France,

262
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,370
because those pesky men in
Lycra now own the full name.

263
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,460
So, tdf lower case it is.

264
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,740
What Ferrari's done here, basically,
is take the F12 and sharpened it.

265
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,930
More power.

266
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,170
Less weight.

267
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,220
A pretty standard recipe
for going quicker.

268
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,170
But taking a car as savage as
the Ferrari F12 and making it

269
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,820
sharper is like taking a hydrogen
bomb and making it more explode-y.

270
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,930
It is bonkers fast.

271
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,620
Nought to 60 in under three seconds.

272
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,460
Top speed 211mph.

273
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,970
But the tdf isn't really about speed.

274
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,530
It's about downforce.

275
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,770
The dark art of gluing a car to the ground

276
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,220
through the power of air alone.

277
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,890
It's not pretty, but it's all functional.

278
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,130
This big mouth gulps in the air,

279
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,410
then extracts it through this
nostril, then in again into this

280
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,850
intake here, where it gets
accelerated down the side of the car.

281
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,730
And these gills are fully functional,

282
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,010
cos they reduce the
pressure in that wheel arch.

283
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,730
And then everything gets kicked
over this new rear spoiler

284
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,410
and there are even flaps down
there underneath that are just

285
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,410
to give you more downforce but, of course,

286
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,090
it's also an excuse for
some beautiful details.

287
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,180
Everything's carbon and little
bits that stick out everywhere.

288
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,420
This car also has something Ferrari
calls "passo corto virtuale".

289
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,410
Where the tdf's rear wheels
turn slightly in the opposite

290
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,530
direction to its fronts.

291
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,250
They say this makes cornering more nimble.

292
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,690
I say more scary.

293
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,370
Ferrari said it created
this car to be challenging,

294
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,560
to be a bit of an animal.

295
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
And, by George, it is.

296
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,330
I'm using about a quarter
throttle here in third gear

297
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,650
and I'm completely sideways.

298
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,690
I don't think I have
driven a car that wants

299
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,940
to oversteer more readily.

300
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,490
That was 90mph.

301
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,680
And I absolutely love it.

302
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,130
It's a difficult car to control,

303
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,690
but would you want it any other way?

304
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,250
Should Ferrari make cars
that everyone can drive?

305
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,570
All supercars now can be
driven by complete idiots.

306
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,920
The world needs cars that
are difficult to drive.

307
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,490
Compared to the normal F12,
then, the tdf is easier to crash

308
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,170
and less easy on the eye.

309
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,460
And it costs £100,000 more.

310
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,680
But none of that matters.

311
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,770
You want a car that makes the
hairs on your neck stand up,

312
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,490
that makes every nerve in your
body dance like it's in some

313
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,660
insane '90s rave every
time you push the throttle?

314
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,580
This is it. This is that car.

315
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,570
Ferrari has hinted this might
be its last proper V12 without

316
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,210
some sort of artificial power boost.

317
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,940
Maybe turbos, more likely
hybrid electrical power.

318
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,170
So, the F12 tdf could
be the end of the road

319
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,210
for that grand, pure engine

320
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,860
and a road stretching back to the
250 Tour de France and before.

321
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,740
The V12 -- the very soul of Ferrari.

322
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,660
If this is indeed a send-off...

323
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,320
.. it's an unforgettable one.

324
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,770
All right. OK, OK, OK.

325
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,210
So, Chris, just between you and me,

326
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,130
you've driven every supercar,

327
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,620
hypercar, super-hypercar,
hyper-supercar on the planet.

328
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,170
- How does it compare?
- Well, it's scarier.

329
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,370
It looks angry, it sounds angry --

330
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,450
everything about it is angry.

331
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,290
I can't believe you need
a licence to buy a gun,

332
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,010
but you can just walk
in and buy one of these.

333
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,250
OK, so then, where does
Ferrari go from here?

334
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,330
Oh, I don't know, but it probably involves

335
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,570
electricity and hybridity,
and four-wheel drive.

336
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,250
It'll be a new recipe.

337
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,490
This is the last of the old kind.

338
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,730
It's pure, it's vivid,

339
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,130
it's just wonderful.

340
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,250
So you like it?

341
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,170
Yes.

342
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
Would you date it?

343
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
- I'd marry it.
- Ah!

344
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,490
OK, ladies and gentlemen, the
future Mr and Mrs Harris.

345
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,970
And keep that applause going for tonight's

346
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,250
Superstars in a Rallycross Car,

347
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,690
Kevin Hart and Anthony Joshua.

348
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,450
Hey, hey, hey.

349
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,930
- Hey, my friend.
- Wow.

350
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,330
Hello, Kevin, how are you?

351
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,530
How are you, sir?

352
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,410
- Anthony, how are you? - You all
right, yeah? - Hello, hello, hello.

353
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,010
Kev there, Anthony there.

354
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,370
- What about this?
- Wow.

355
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,210
Amazing.

356
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
- Amazing.
- So cool.

357
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,370
When we announced that you two
were going to be on the same show,

358
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,090
people became so excited they
literally started to fall apart.

359
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,690
- Is that what happened?
- Seriously.

360
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,250
Can those people in the
back, can they see me?

361
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,770
Is this...?

362
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,890
Should I sit up? I feel
like this is unfair.

363
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,170
I feel like they all lost sight of me

364
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,210
as soon as I did this
right here. It's like

365
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,690
- I was here, then I wasn't.
- OK, so, Anthony,

366
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,010
do me a favour, tell everybody
all about Kevin, please.

367
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,490
Well, Mr Kevin Hart,
currently seated to my left,

368
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,210
is starring in Central Intelligence

369
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,050
alongside Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson...

370
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,770
- Yes, that's good.
- The film is out the 29th of June.

371
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,210
- And here is a clip where The Rock,
who plays a CIA agent... - Yes.

372
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,970
.. Bob Stone, is pretending to
be Kevin and his wife's therapist.

373
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,620
- Yeah, that's good. You did
really good. - Thank you.

374
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,330
It's called soul-gazing.

375
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,700
Stare into my soul, and
I'll stare into yours.

376
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,610
- Maggie, this...
- Hey. Shh.

377
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,130
There's no talking, and don't look away.

378
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,050
(Stare into my soul.)

379
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,410
- (You are not my...
- Shh, there's no talking.)

380
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,810
Yeah, but I'm not staring at...

381
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,370
(Me and you. Stay with me.)

382
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,320
- (I'm your wife.) - You are
not my wife, don't.... - Hey.

383
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,090
How could you hit your wife?

384
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,610
How could I...? How could I what?

385
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,690
- You hit your wife!
- No, I...

386
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,250
- He hit me. - OK. - He hit you.

387
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,770
You hit us.

388
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,210
Excellent.

389
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,380
OK, so...

390
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,450
If you look very carefully at that clip,

391
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,050
it looks like you're trying
not to laugh all the time.

392
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,610
No, that was a long day.

393
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,770
We laughed...

394
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,090
we laughed... I would say 90%

395
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,970
of that was... was broken up by laughter.

396
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,850
First of all, Dwayne's hands
are the size of my face,

397
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,050
so him to smack me...

398
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,810
my whole face was numb
by the end of that day.

399
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,370
I just couldn't stop laughing,
so he had to keep smacking me.

400
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,810
And he said, when I smack him,
he's like, "Just go for it."

401
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,160
And I said, "All right," and I
smacked the [BLEEP] out of Dwayne.

402
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,210
I was like, "You have a smack, dude."

403
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,930
Even though we're acting, I smacked
him, I knew we were acting,

404
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,730
but I still got scared. "All right, man.

405
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,330
"Come on, don't you be for real.
Like, that's my character."

406
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,170
- And are you movies now? Is that
what you're focused on? - Yeah, man.

407
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,450
You know, I'm like a sex symbol.

408
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,010
Here's the thing.

409
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,210
Here's the thing, man, the
big screen makes me look tall,

410
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,290
- so I'm in love...
- Does you a favour?

411
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,450
Yeah, I'm in love with the fact
that I just look tall on the

412
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,010
big screen, and then it's a shock

413
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,610
- when people see how small I
really am. - OK. - "I got you!"

414
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,090
- Cos you are.
- Yeah.

415
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,290
I mean it, I knew you were
small because I've seen you

416
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,450
on other shows, but you
are really, really small.

417
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,890
No, you know, I don't say
"small", I say "petite".

418
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,330
That's a better word.

419
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,890
It's just a better word to use.

420
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,850
Petite just means I'm put together

421
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,370
in a smaller package than your
average-size male. That's all.

422
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,650
- But I got a nice smile, so it takes
your attention off of my size. - Yeah.

423
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,690
You got to learn, it's
tricks to the trade, man.

424
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,570
If you're going to be small, there's
certain things you got to do.

425
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,490
I'm a good clapper. See that right there?

426
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,450
When you think about me being small,

427
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,890
I might give you a good clap.

428
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,090
You out of there, you
forgot about it that fast.

429
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,570
If I was tall, I wouldn't be cool.

430
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,610
- If I had this size, I'd look stupid.
- What you trying to say?!

431
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,450
I would look stupid if I came
out here with the same voice,

432
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,490
- all big like this.
- Yeah, it would be no fun for us, either.

433
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,690
You'd be like, "Kevin, get
your dumb ass out of here,

434
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,440
"looking all stupid." Can't
move my neck. It'd be weird.

435
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,970
Do me a favour, can you
tell us what Anthony's up to?

436
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,610
Oh, man, no problem.

437
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,890
Mr Anthony Joshua to my right here,

438
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,850
if you do not know, this man will be
defending his IBF heavyweight title

439
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,100
against Dominic Breazeale.

440
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,490
Yes, yes.

441
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,490
It's going down on the
25th of June at the O2.

442
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,610
You know what, I don't need
to talk about this man.

443
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,330
To show you how incredible Anthony is,

444
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,770
here's a punch that won him
the belt in this first place.

445
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,490
Well, this IS the punch that won
him the belt in the first place.

446
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,210
Take a look for yourself,
people. See, that was good.

447
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,090
.. on the floor, and
there's still 1.40 left

448
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,570
in this second round.

449
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,130
And he's down again.

450
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,450
And Joshua on the brink here,

451
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,570
strolls into the corner.

452
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,610
The IBF heavyweight champion of the world.

453
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,650
- Yes, yes.
- Wow.

454
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,640
- Wow.
- Thank you.

455
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,570
So, Anthony, you defend your
title on the 25th of June

456
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,970
and, of course, in that fight,
it was all over the second round.

457
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,050
- Yeah. - Don't you
sometimes feel a bit guilty

458
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,690
when you end the fights too early?

459
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,530
Don't you feel, like, for the
advertisers, the sponsors...?

460
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,570
.. drag it out a little bit longer?

461
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,370
I leave that down to the
promoters of the job.

462
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,330
And even though, you know,

463
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,330
you do get the glitz
and glamour and stuff,

464
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,050
like coming on this beautiful show,

465
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,850
meeting legends like Kevin and yourself,

466
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,770
it is a gladiator sport, as well,

467
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,410
and it's kill or be killed.

468
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,290
So, at the same time,
there is the longevity,

469
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,570
and the entertainment, and
the advertisement of it,

470
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,610
but people are coming out to
see someone get knocked out,

471
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,370
and I'd rather that be him than me.

472
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,250
OK.

473
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,730
- I get it now.
- So you understand, yeah?

474
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
- It's serious business.
- I'm so stupid(!)

475
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,810
So that was in the second round.

476
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,450
- Now, he went down just before
the knockout punch... - Yeah.

477
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,090
- .. he got up to a mandatory
count of eight. - Correct.

478
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,570
So they were two big punches.

479
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,530
When you sort of sense that moment coming,

480
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,210
is the punch fizzing in your hand,

481
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,690
or does it come from nowhere?

482
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,010
It's... it's second nature
cos it's just an instinct

483
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,890
that I've picked up through
training constantly over the years.

484
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,090
I love it, because you
see it in their eyes

485
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,850
when they get hit. Everyone has a plan.

486
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,690
They come to the ring
with so many plans --

487
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,970
"I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do that."

488
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,370
And then, as soon as you hit
them with a certain shot,

489
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,930
everything goes out the window...

490
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,210
- Yeah. - .. and it's
funny to see in their eyes.

491
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,170
- YOU know.
- Yeah, I know.

492
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,170
- I relate.
- You can relate?

493
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,490
Yeah, I relate.

494
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,370
So, yeah, and then it
goes out the window --

495
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,730
all plans out the window.

496
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,370
- OK, so, let's talk about cars, shall we?
- OK, yes. Let's do it.

497
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,650
OK, so, best first car?

498
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,010
Now, be ready for this, Anthony, OK?

499
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,730
This guy is so into his
cars, it's not funny.

500
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,330
- All right? - Yeah? - Just be prepared.

501
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,530
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - OK, this may
be your first knockout for a while...

502
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,090
- My first defeat. - .. in
the wrong direction. - Yeah.

503
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,690
- OK, so, first car ever?
- Yeah.

504
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,970
Ladies and gentlemen, take a look at this.

505
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,570
This is, you're about
to see a Pontiac, man.

506
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,770
A Pontiac Firebird.

507
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,290
First of all, what happened
to my chest in that picture?

508
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,410
But it was a Firebird Trans Am, man.

509
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,210
This is my first baby.

510
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,770
I remember getting this car.

511
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,290
My mom couldn't afford to get me a car.

512
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,690
This is when my dad
wasn't really in my life

513
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,570
as much as he should have been.

514
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,610
So my brother, he went
and mustered up some money

515
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,930
and brought me a car.

516
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,010
At the time, it wasn't new,

517
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,090
you know, it didn't start all
the time, but it was my baby.

518
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,290
It was my first car, man.

519
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,850
But for the first car, a
Pontiac Firebird Trans Am?

520
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,090
- Yeah, yeah.
- What a brother.

521
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,290
Have you sort of returned
the favour since then?

522
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,010
Absolutely not.

523
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,610
No, I have not. No, of course, man.

524
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,530
I've gotten my brother... I've
gotten my brother some cars

525
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,090
to date, but nothing is ever going
to surpass what he did for me.

526
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,330
Anthony, you're up against
a Pontiac Firebird.

527
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,490
- This is a tough call.
- Yeah, that is a tough call.

528
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,410
And it must be your genuine first car.

529
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,930
Anthony, what is it?

530
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,330
My first car was a Vauxhall Astra 1.6.

531
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,100
All right!

532
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,530
Look how skinny I look.

533
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,810
My head don't fit my body.

534
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,410
Why do you look like a boxing
coach that didn't make it?

535
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,290
He looks like he has no training.

536
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,090
OK, well, we've got to fight the corner

537
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,130
- for the Astra against
the Pontiac... - Yeah.

538
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,450
.. because the Vauxhall Astra is the

539
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,890
- third bestselling car ever in
the UK... - Really? - .. ever.

540
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,770
- Wow. - That's what I'm saying
-- I know what I'm talking about.

541
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,690
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

542
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,770
One in four drivers in the UK --

543
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,130
they may not want to admit it --

544
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,930
- has driven a Vauxhall Astra.
- Yeah.

545
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,570
All right, well, we've got to
find out, OK, best first car?

546
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,770
Audience, you decide.

547
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,850
Let's hear it for the
1980 Pontiac Firebird.

548
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,860
Yes, yes, yes.

549
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,180
Yeah.

550
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,370
Or the Vauxhall Astra?

551
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,050
OK, Kevin wins Round One.

552
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,570
Round One, Round One.

553
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,410
Round One, Round One.

554
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,810
- Now, now, now.
- Well-deserved.

555
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,130
Best...

556
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,890
best car ever? OK?

557
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,890
- Best car ever?
- I have to warn you, Anthony,

558
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,010
- he currently owns nine
brilliant cars. - Nine?

559
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,960
OK? So let's just see the nine
cars he currently owns, OK?

560
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,730
OK, look at those.

561
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,370
Just take us from the top-left

562
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,010
to bottom-right, please, Kev.

563
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,610
OK, that's my Ferrari,
that's a 458 Italian.

564
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,290
I told myself when I get to
a point in my career where

565
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,090
I can afford one, I was going to get one.

566
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,090
This is after I bought it,

567
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,930
and this is my sexy pose...

568
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,930
that I chose to do in front of it.

569
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,050
So you got a G Wagon? Is that a '63?

570
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,530
That's a '65.

571
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,810
Then you got an SLS, and
then you've got a Wrangler,

572
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,810
- is that a Rubicon?
- Yes, it is.

573
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,890
You know the great thing
that I did with this?

574
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,490
People, if you look close, right,

575
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,540
you see that stepladder
on the bottom of it?

576
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,890
- That's didn't come with that -- I
put that on there. - Good for you.

577
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,690
I put that on there, yeah, true stuff.

578
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,650
I jump in and out of it, actually.

579
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,010
It's funny when you jump
out in front of girls,

580
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,850
cos the just say, like,
"What happened to his knees?"

581
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,930
But it's a good... it's a good truck, man.

582
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,090
It's like the opening
scene in Trading Places...

583
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,450
Pretty much, when Eddie
Murphy's down on his knees.

584
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,970
Back to the grid. Now,
the van is interesting,

585
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,050
cos a lot of people don't
know about these vans.

586
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,330
- Oh, it's my pride and joy.
- This is a Jet Sprinter.

587
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,410
- Now, educate people about this van.
- OK, so I work a lot.

588
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,490
I have a crazy schedule,

589
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,450
so I built a mobile office.

590
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,650
What this is, it's basically

591
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,970
equipped to have everything

592
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,330
I need, from Wi-Fi, a living room setting,

593
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,850
a closet, a bed, yeah.

594
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,290
There she is, see that?

595
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,810
That right there, that's
called peanut butter insides.

596
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,690
I like peanut butter.

597
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,810
I love peanut butter.
So those seats recline

598
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,930
just like an aeroplane.
They go forward, back,

599
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,130
that back row reclines all
the way down into a bed.

600
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,570
This is what I'm in more than
anything at all, pretty much.

601
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,210
Let's go to the final corner,

602
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,130
because I do believe the final car

603
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,570
- you're going to cite as
your best car ever. - This is.

604
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,650
And I don't understand
why, but please tell me.

605
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,810
All right, so this car here is a

606
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,540
Pontiac GTO 1966.

607
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,050
There's a story behind this car.

608
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,010
My dad loved the Pontiac
GTO. You know, he loved it.

609
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,170
He said, "Son, this is
the best car of all cars."

610
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,250
My dad was in and out of rehab,

611
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,610
in and out of jail throughout my life.

612
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,730
And just as a testimonial to my dad,

613
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,610
and my dad having meaning to me,

614
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,210
when I could afford it
and I found it, I bought

615
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,330
what my dad's favourite car was,

616
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,370
and built it up in mint condition.

617
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,530
And then it was kind of a hypocrite move,

618
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,170
cos my dad came to my house.

619
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,690
He's like, "Can I drive it?"

620
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,880
I said, "Absolutely not."

621
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,890
- I haven't let him. - Really?
- I have not let my dad near the car.

622
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,170
But the nickname for that car
is Dad -- that's what I call it.

623
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,810
It's just after my father.

624
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,250
All right, so best car ever?

625
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,810
- Best car, right there. That's
it right there. - That's cool.

626
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,370
Now, Anthony, sorry, forgive me,

627
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,210
I forgot you were here,
actually, because...

628
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,410
- that took a while. But see what
I'm saying about Kevin here? - Yeah.

629
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,050
So you're going up against
this 1966 Pontiac GTO.

630
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,730
- Yeah. - Yes. - Good luck.

631
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,330
What do we have?

632
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,930
My best car ever would
be the Range Rover Sport.

633
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,690
Why?

634
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,730
Well, it's the car that
I bought for my mum.

635
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,810
Aw-w-w!

636
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,420
Bye!

637
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,730
I wanted my mum to feel like
her son, who's an Olympian,

638
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,450
she'll be proud to tell everyone.

639
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,290
She can live up to those expectations.

640
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,250
So the day before I fought
for the British title

641
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,530
I made sure my mum got her car delivered.

642
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,530
She come out, and this
was parked downstairs.

643
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,090
She's crying, she's over the moon,

644
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,940
- and that's why this is my
favourite car. - Wow. - Yeah.

645
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,690
- It's a good play.
- I like it.

646
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,770
- Cos it's only about winning. - I like
it. - Don't care about anything else.

647
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,170
- I like it. - Yeah? - Yeah.

648
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,220
- He bought the car for his mum!
- I like it.

649
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,650
Beautiful mom.

650
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,530
That's a beautiful mom.

651
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,610
So, it is Mrs Joshua's
Range Rover up against

652
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,530
Mr Hart's '66 Pontiac GTO.

653
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,610
Let's hear it for...

654
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,010
Kevin Hart's beautiful 1966 Pontiac GTO,

655
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,250
called Dad, that he won't
let his dad drive...

656
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,810
Or...

657
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,690
let's hear it for brand-new IBF
heavyweight world champion,

658
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,410
from Britain...

659
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,170
.. the car that he bought for his mum,

660
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,090
- the Range Rover,
Anthony Joshua. - Boo!

661
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,300
Boo! Boo!

662
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,250
Boo!

663
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,250
Who buys a car for their mother?!

664
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,250
Boo!

665
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,860
Boo, moms.

666
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,210
- Nobody else? Just me?
- So it's 1-1.

667
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,330
Shall we go to the laps?

668
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,250
Kevin, how do you think yours went?

669
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,490
Oh, man, I think mine was amazing.

670
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,290
You're looking at a semi-pro,

671
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,970
so it's not... it's not something
that's difficult for me.

672
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,810
This stuff comes easy.

673
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,890
You know, I ate that track up.

674
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,440
Yeah, that's what I did. I
made the track my [BLEEP].

675
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,250
Well, we'll see.

676
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,090
Anthony, how do you think it went?

677
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,770
As long as it went half as
good as Kevin's, I'm happy.

678
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,370
I'm happy.

679
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,770
Very wise answer.

680
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,890
Would you like to see Kevin's lap? Yes?

681
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,650
OK. He loves his cars,

682
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,890
how can he drive? Let's
find out, here we go.

683
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,690
On the line, Kevin Hart.

684
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,650
30 million Twitter followers,

685
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,890
but that counts for nothing
on our rallycross course.

686
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,810
I can feel it.

687
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,490
Ricky Bobby. If you're
not first, you're last.

688
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,050
A bit of Talladega Nights there.
Time to shake and bake, Kevin.

689
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,850
Good conditions on the course
today, so no excuses there,

690
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,090
dry but cool, should be quick.

691
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,210
Now let's kill the rest of it,
let's go. Let's go, give it to me.

692
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,570
Big splash?

693
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,530
Yes! The Mini's wipers going crazy.

694
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,370
Now, this is very promising so far.

695
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,050
Here comes Hammerhead,

696
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,610
and I like the look of that.

697
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,370
Oh, that's very nice. That is very nice.

698
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,730
Ooh, good turn, Kevin. Good turn.

699
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,210
Good turn, indeed. Off-road
now for the second time.

700
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,890
Let's have a look at the
hairpin, very telling, this.

701
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,330
Oh, again, very nice,
ladies and gentlemen.

702
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,570
And the jump!

703
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,770
Air, yes! Big air.

704
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,850
Nearly there, Kev, just
a few more corners.

705
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,770
Let's go. We there.

706
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,010
Don't overthink it, Kevin.

707
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,410
The second American on
our rallycross track,

708
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,060
will he be faster than Jesse
Eisenberg? Let's hope so!

709
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,490
Into the last corner and...

710
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,610
across the line!

711
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,090
What do you think?

712
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,250
That was great driving.

713
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,770
- That was great driving.
- But you know when you see yourself

714
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,570
back on-screen, you think one thing or the
other, what do you think of that, seriously?

715
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,490
Well, I mean, a lot of you guys could tell

716
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,890
I have experience behind
the wheel, you know?

717
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,570
It was very quick. Honestly,
it could be a record.

718
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,850
I don't know what it was,

719
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,690
but I'm curious to know what the
fastest times around here were.

720
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,970
- I'm quite sure I'm up
there. - All right. - Yeah.

721
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,920
Well, we're about to find out.
Shall we see Anthony's lap?

722
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,850
World champion in the ring, how
does he do out on the track?

723
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,410
Let's have a look now.

724
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,370
All right, Anthony Joshua, the
first MBE in our rallycross Mini.

725
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,690
Let's go, baby!

726
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,290
Not at all motivated
there. Olympic gold -- easy.

727
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,810
Serious competition now, Anthony.

728
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,370
There, there, grip! Give
me some grip! Lovely.

729
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,610
Through the water splash.

730
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,770
Yay! And time for the tricky left-hander.

731
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,570
This isn't easy at all.

732
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,090
Nice.

733
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,570
If you're too hard on the
brakes there, it's all over.

734
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,220
Hammerhead, look at that.
Yes, come on, opposite lock!

735
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,450
This is looking good.
This is looking rapid.

736
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,490
Come on! Let's pick it up. Up!

737
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,850
Back off-road, and this is so slippy.

738
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,970
There's SO little grip here.

739
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,130
Did you give it some handbrake?

740
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,690
I think he did, ladies and gentlemen.

741
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,860
High rev!

742
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,170
Good air! Excellent air
for such a big guy.

743
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,210
- Right, Tyre Wall...
- This is the one, this is the one.

744
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,570
Whoo!

745
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,060
Look at that, look at that!

746
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,240
16 fights undefeated, will he
retain his perfect record here?

747
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,930
Bouncing into the last corner,
big chunk of grass there

748
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,690
and he's over the line!

749
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,530
Great drive. That is a great drive.

750
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,850
- Well done, well done, well done.
- That's a great drive.

751
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,050
That's a great drive.

752
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,370
- What do we think?
- May the best man win.

753
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,210
- May the best man win.
- That's fine, cos it's you.

754
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,730
- That's what I'm saying, deep down.
- That was a great drive.

755
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,410
I thought they were both great
drives, very, very good.

756
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,010
Kevin, to go top, 1.53.9 to beat.

757
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,650
Kevin Hart completed our lap in...

758
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,490
1.50...

759
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,890
7.7, there you go.

760
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,730
- Wow. - That's all right! - Top three.

761
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,930
- You go third. - Top
three. - That's not bad.

762
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,060
I'm happy with that. Top three.

763
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,050
Did you beat Anthony,
did Anthony beat you?

764
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,650
Anthony Joshua, your time
around the Top Gear track

765
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,250
in the rallycross car, as our superstar,

766
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,290
one of our superstars, is...

767
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,090
1.50...

768
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,210
2.6! You're the brand-new leader!

769
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,290
- There he goes! There he goes! It's OK!
- What is this?!

770
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,730
- You're beaten by the new champ! - No!

771
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,370
- No, it's fine!
- No! No!

772
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,690
- It's fine!
- No!

773
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,100
- Let's hear it for Anthony
Joshua and Kevin Hart! - No!

774
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,650
This is racism!

775
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,250
This is racism at its best, right now!

776
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,180
He won because he's black!

777
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,730
Let's hear it again for Kevin
Hart and Anthony Joshua!

778
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,580
- You were moving!
- Very good.

779
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,740
OK, our next film is about Rory
Reid and a little blue hatchback.

780
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,930
This is the new Ford Focus
RS. It looks like a five-door

781
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,940
family hatchback that's been down the gym.

782
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,680
Scratch the surface, though,
and it's got substance.

783
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,730
A Cosworth-tuned 2.3-litre turbo engine

784
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,380
that bangs out 345 horsepower.

785
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,340
345!

786
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,770
In a Ford Focus!

787
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,770
That's like fitting a
retirement bungalow with its own

788
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,160
surface-to-air missile system!

789
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,180
0 to 60 happens in 4.7 seconds.

790
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,770
Quicker than the Lamborghini
Countach ever managed it.

791
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,260
People, this isn't a Focus, it's a blur.

792
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,530
And to prevent this blur becoming
a smear, it's got massive brakes

793
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,660
and adaptive suspension to
cope with British B-roads.

794
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,530
Even in its most unyielding setting,

795
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,970
this isn't a hot hatch that's going
to grind your spine to talcum powder

796
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,810
the minute you see some bumpy tarmac.

797
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,610
The ride is firm, but it's forgiving.

798
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,220
And, more importantly, it's fast.

799
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,250
And then there's the best bit.

800
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,570
The Focus RS now has four-wheel drive.

801
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,690
That's not exactly revolutionary
in a modern hot hatch,

802
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,280
but this version is a bit special.

803
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,570
Most four-wheel drive hot hatches
send pretty much all their power

804
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,490
to their front wheels,

805
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,420
but the Focus RS sends 70%
of its power to the rear.

806
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,770
Sensors monitor speed, yaw,
steering angle and G-force,

807
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,770
sending data to the rear drive
unit, where two clutch packs employ

808
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,130
side-to-side torque
vectoring to send power

809
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,380
to the left or right wheel.

810
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,450
You got all that?

811
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,130
Me neither.

812
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,770
But what it all adds up to is this button.

813
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,020
You press it four times...

814
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,610
.. and this happens.

815
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,810
Whoo!

816
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,580
Yeah!

817
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,770
Whoo!

818
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,420
Pointing forward is so last-century.

819
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,140
Sideways! That's the new forwards.

820
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,970
And if you're thinking,
"Well, that's immature,"

821
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,060
yep, it is.

822
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,220
But so am I!

823
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,090
Drifting just makes everything better.

824
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,410
Imagine how much happier
we'd be as a nation

825
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,140
if we could get everywhere like that.

826
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,290
And it's not because I've been
taking lessons off the Stig.

827
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,540
I haven't. Sliding this car is so easy.

828
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,200
I reckon even a child could do it.

829
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,460
My granny could drift this.

830
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,080
See what I mean?

831
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,530
If I have to find a problem,

832
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,130
the seating position is a little bit high,

833
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,770
the gear change is a tiny
bit woolly around the edges,

834
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,770
and from some angles the RS does look...

835
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,170
tame.

836
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,690
Sure, they're minor flaws,

837
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,240
but the world of hot hatches
is cut-throat right now.

838
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,450
Especially when it contains
bruisers like this,

839
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,580
the Honda Civic Type R.

840
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,690
Like the Focus, it costs £30,000,

841
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,020
but unlike the Focus, it's all big
arches, big wing, big attitude.

842
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,660
However...

843
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,160
It looks great...

844
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,020
.. and it drives OK, so why
does it feel a bit out of date?

845
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,370
In the Ford Focus, your 30 grand
buys you four-wheel drive.

846
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,220
In here, it's two for the price of four.

847
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,530
There's more power than before...

848
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,970
.. but it's all on the front wheels.

849
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,360
And where's my drift button?!

850
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,770
Even though it was only out last year,

851
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,850
the Civic just feels old-fashioned,
like Honda have been so busy

852
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,770
perfecting the old formula,

853
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,410
they didn't notice that
the world's moved on.

854
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,960
The game's become more
grown-up, more sophisticated.

855
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,850
Uh-oh.

856
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,410
I'm in serious trouble here.

857
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,450
The Mercedes-AMG A45.

858
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,890
Yep, the current kings of Formula
One have gone and built a hot hatch,

859
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,730
and the results are... predictable.

860
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,060
Go!

861
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,980
No, no, no!

862
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,380
It's just like Formula One!

863
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,240
Honda, down on power,
languishing at the back.

864
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,810
Civic, you've failed me!

865
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,140
I like your look, but if I need power...

866
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,850
.. I need the A45,

867
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,650
with an engine developed
by Merc's F1 team.

868
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,850
40 horsepower more than the Focus,

869
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,970
70 more than the Civic,

870
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,980
that's 376 horsepower
from a two-litre engine.

871
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,330
Unprecedented.

872
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,010
Like the Focus, the A45
also has four-wheel drive.

873
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,570
It's got a fancy pants
double-clutch gearbox.

874
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,130
It 0-60s in barely four seconds.

875
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,060
And, with the limiter
removed, it'll hit 169mph.

876
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,850
It's just as you'd expect from an F1 team,

877
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,650
all very impressive...

878
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,570
and all a bit dull.

879
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,220
Look, here I am going round the
Hammerhead at serious speed.

880
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,380
But you just don't feel as part of
the action as you do in the Focus.

881
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,810
This wins Top Trumps every time.

882
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,730
Most power -- tick. Drag race -- tick.

883
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,880
But who needs Top Trumps
if it's not exciting?

884
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,440
Are you excited?

885
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,570
I'll take that as a no.

886
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,810
And that's the point.

887
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,450
The A45 is just a bit
grown-up for a hot hatch.

888
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,740
It's like... something
your dad might drive.

889
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,330
Here's the other kicker.

890
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,890
This A45 is ten grand more expensive
than the Focus and the Type R.

891
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,220
In hot hatch world, in
any world, that's a lot.

892
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,250
Which is why I choose the Focus.

893
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,250
Ten grand buys you 200 days'
worth of B-road petrol,

894
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,180
or 50 tyres to turn into dust clouds.

895
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,090
Even if it were the same price,
the RS is more interactive,

896
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,250
more hands-on, more joyful.

897
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,170
This is the best hot hatch on the planet.

898
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,650
Maybe even the best fast
car you can buy, full stop.

899
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,780
Keep your Ferraris, man, keep
your Porsches and your Paganis.

900
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,850
I'm taking the Focus RS.

901
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,380
I love this thing. I do.

902
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,930
And here they are, Rory Reid
and his little blue hatchback.

903
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,690
That's a pretty hard sell you
gave the Focus there, Rory.

904
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,010
But, seriously, "Keep your Paganis,
keep your Porsches," really?

905
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,850
Really, really, man. This
car does the mundane,

906
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,450
it does the astonishing.

907
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,530
You can take this to the shops,
you can drift it, you can race it.

908
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,890
It's like having a three-car
garage in one car.

909
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,930
Name me one other car
that's as much fun to drive.

910
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,050
Your Paganis, your Porsches, all
the stuff you just said to keep.

911
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,810
Yeah. I'm talking about in
the real world though, OK?

912
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,330
On real roads, the Focus RS is just
more of a laugh, man, you know?

913
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,490
It's more super than most supercars.

914
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,810
Oh... You're sure?

915
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,130
- Yeah, I said it! I said it!
- OK, OK.

916
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,180
Ladies and gentlemen, Ford
salesman of the month, Rory Reid.

917
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,050
So, not too long ago,

918
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,050
I had a day off and I wanted to do
a bit of sightseeing around London.

919
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,650
And, here's a little tip for
you, don't go with one of those

920
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,090
open-top bus tours.

921
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,330
You want to see London,
you're feeling brave,

922
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,530
go with Top Gear Tours.

923
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,120
Ask for Ken.

924
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,250
- Ken?
- That's it.

925
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,890
I don't think I... Do I need a helmet?

926
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,940
- I would suggest it.
- All right, all right.

927
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,570
OK, you know what I'm thinking...

928
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

929
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,570
I'm not in a big rush, you know.

930
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,450
We can talk about some of
these sights I'd like to see.

931
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
When you get a minute.

932
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,370
I really want to see Buckingham Palace

933
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,540
and I'd also like to see Tower Bridge.

934
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,860
Oh, and the Houses of Parliament.
You know where that is?

935
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,920
Oh, Canary Wharf!

936
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,650
Did you know that that, right there,

937
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,570
is the second tallest building in London?

938
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,050
Yeah, that one over there.
Back there, way back there.

939
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,780
That was it.

940
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,410
- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
- What? What? - That's Tom Odell.

941
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,210
♪ I wanna find... ♪

942
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,560
- Who's that?
- Listen to him. Great piano player.

943
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,890
- I can't hear anything.
- I can't hear anything.

944
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,840
You know what, though? Let's
give him a little money. Here.

945
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,220
- That's very nice of you.
- Yeah.

946
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,000
Do you drink a lot of coffee?

947
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,260
Oh, cool, Lloyds of London.

948
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,810
Where we going?

949
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,980
Secret route.

950
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,610
What's this button do?

951
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,450
- Don't.
- OK.

952
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,460
Don't touch anything.

953
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,740
Not touching anything.

954
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,370
Do you know that most of
the London Underground

955
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,700
is actually above ground?

956
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,050
This is a good short cut.

957
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,020
Oh, cool! This St Paul's Cathedral.

958
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Turn around.

959
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,610
Go round again.

960
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,730
A lot of famous people get married here.

961
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,170
Do they look familiar?

962
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,960
Congratulations!

963
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,700
A fascinating city, really.

964
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,970
Did you know that a lot of people
think this is London Bridge,

965
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,650
but it's actually called the Tower Bridge,

966
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,260
because of the, uh, the towers.

967
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,720
Interesting, huh?

968
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,340
Is this another short cut?

969
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,640
This is interesting.

970
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,410
Very colourful.

971
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,460
- Least I could do.
- You're all right, Ken.

972
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,400
Oh, look, look, look!

973
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,290
What is that?

974
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,900
- I think that is a Stigsy.
- Oh, cool!

975
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,100
- Can I just...?
- No.

976
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,330
Oh, Westminster Bridge!

977
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:19,250
Did you know that it's illegal to
die in the Houses of Parliament?

978
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,240
So maybe be careful.

979
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,860
Oh. Does Winston approve?

980
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,730
It doesn't look like it, does it?

981
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,780
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

982
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Five-O.

983
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,960
See the police right there?
They're right behind us.

984
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,740
- Is this thing street legal?
- I think so.

985
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,050
Did you know that if the flag
on top of Buckingham Palace

986
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,460
is all the way at the top,
that means the Queen is home?

987
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,730
So she's home. So we better, uh...

988
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,380
We better be on our best behaviour.

989
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,890
I wonder what room she's in.

990
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,240
Well, let's find out.

991
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,420
Hey, there she is!

992
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,170
So, we saw the Queen.

993
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,780
That was awesome.

994
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:56,020
- So check London off the list. Thanks, Ken.
- You're very welcome.

995
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,620
- Where to next?
- Next?

996
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,540
I'm ready! Let's go.

997
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,810
OK, I gotta ask you. What
does the red button do?

998
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,770
- No.
- Come on.

999
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,970
Not this time. Maybe next trip.

1000
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,220
Oh.

1001
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,700
Yeah!

1002
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,930
- Wow. - What a ride. - What a ride.

1003
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,450
What a ride. Thanks to the RAF...

1004
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,970
.. and the city of London and
to the amazing Ken Block.

1005
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,330
- He is something else, isn't he?
- Unbelievable.

1006
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,490
Oh, uh, by the way, he said
that whenever you want,

1007
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,970
- he's ready to take you...
- Oh, no, no, no! I'm fine, thanks.

1008
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,330
All right, on next week's show,

1009
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,050
the might Aston Martin
Vulcan, the Tesla Model X.

1010
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,570
And second-hand luxury takes on
Eddie Jordan on a super-posh train.

1011
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,260
See you next week, everyone.
Thanks for watching. Bye-bye!
