1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,790
Tonight, I get even more shouty.

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,230
Naughty!

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,390
Matt has a serious word.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,150
You remember to push the button.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,280
And Eddie Jordan doesn't
speak for over a second.

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,470
Hello, welcome to Top Gear.

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,790
I need to apologise for the lack
of consciousness of my colleague,

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,750
Chris Evans, here. You see,
he had to be heavily sedated

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,950
following the making
of tonight's first film,

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,190
during which, even by his standards,
he got a little over excited.

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,550
Come on, buddy, come on.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,310
- Whoo...
- There we go.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,060
He'll be all right in about
eight and a half minutes.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,430
The McLaren F1

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,560
landed somewhere from outer space in 1992.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,190
A study in extreme performance
with ground-breaking carbon fibre

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,040
construction, enhanced by
magnesium and 24-carat gold.

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,960
Wow.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,750
Oh-ho-ho!

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,150
The results were breathtaking,

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,830
the F1's top speed, more than 240mph,

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,350
which meant, for a dozen
years, it stood alone

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,430
as the world's fastest car.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,150
McLaren, though, didn't stop there.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,070
In 1995, they entered the
F1 GTR in the infamous

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,670
Le Mans 24-hour endurance race.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,040
First time out, it won!

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,630
And then, STILL not
satisfied, they created this,

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,430
lighter, and with more downforce,
an even purer competition version,

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,270
and christened it the McLaren F1 Longtail.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,870
Wow-ow!

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,950
It's so powerful!

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's so naughty!

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,040
It's so loud!

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,710
McLaren only built ten, which makes
ownership a pretty exclusive club.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,590
Cost to join -- £10 million.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,040
That's what this car is worth.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Which is why, although
this car is road-legal...

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,710
.. I'm perfectly fine driving on our
very friendly, deserted airfield.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,480
Aaaah!

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,320
This car is ridiculous!

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,590
Oh, my God!

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,440
Oh, my God!

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,710
The Longtail name came to represent
McLaren at its most extreme,

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,110
and even though they've built plenty
of cars since, none of them has been

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,350
considered outrageous enough to
pick up where the original left off.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,790
Until now.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,390
This is the McLaren 675LT.

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,710
Yes, once again, that's LT for Longtail.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,910
And whilst this one's actually a road car,

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,030
as opposed to an out-and-out race car,

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,120
it's still really, really, really fast.

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,590
Watch. Here I am at standstill.

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,230
0 -- 60 in 2.8 seconds,

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,390
0 -- 100 in 5 seconds.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,790
That's a ban,

57
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,030
that's six months in prison,

58
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,310
18 months in prison,

59
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,950
never see your kids again!

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,150
The 675LT borrows from
McLaren's 650S supercar.

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,240
Like its twin-turbo 3.8
litre V8 engine, for example.

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,590
That said, half its innards
have been upgraded,

63
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,990
which means brake
horsepower has risen to 666,

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,040
the number of the beast.

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
Brakes!

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,360
That's the fastest I've
ever been in a car. Oh!

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,910
Pfff...

68
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,070
So plenty of added speed, then.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
But the 675 is also about
what's been taken away.

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,750
First of all, this car is
an incredible 100kg lighter

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,990
than its 650 sibling.

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,310
The carbon-fibre seats save 15kg.

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,630
A millimetre of glass has
been shaved off the windscreen,

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,550
and that saves 3kg.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,150
The wheels are lighter than you'll
find on its big brother, the P1.

76
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,870
And my favourite thing of all, even
the lacquer that's coated on the

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,910
carbon fibre, is now
satin instead of gloss,

78
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,400
saving a crucial 50g.

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,910
Is all this bothersome
forensic nipping and tucking,

80
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
and shaving and fiddling, really worth it?

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Um, yeah!

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,670
Enter Chicago at 100mph,
slow it right down.

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,470
Try and get it round, all the
way round, can we do that?

84
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
Yes, we... can.

85
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,990
Hammerhead has never been more fun.

86
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,870
Oh, whoa!

87
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh-ho-ho!

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,590
OK, it's time to admit though,

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,230
the 675LT does have a huge bunch of
tricks up its sleeve which allow you

90
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,590
to drive like a hero, without wiping
yourself across a Surrey airfield.

91
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,790
Of course, you can turn
off all the hero buttons,

92
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,590
in which case you'd actually
have to be a hero, which I'm not.

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,550
But fortunately, I do have one with me.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,430
All right, Chris? Do you
fancy swapping places?

95
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,020
Cos I really want to swap places.

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,710
With all the driving aids
turned off, of course,

97
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,670
Jenson told me he needed to
warm the tyres up... a bit.

98
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,830
- What I really love
about this car... - Yeah?

99
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,390
Is the finish here. This Alcantara
here, I mean, you just don't

100
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,240
get that, do you, in your family wagon?

101
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,080
And the climate control system
here, have a little touch on that.

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,720
I tell you what, this radio is new.

103
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,510
A new navigation system, and,
oh, my God, it works well.

104
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,870
Right, here is now smoke IN the car.

105
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,390
You see, I don't get to do this.

106
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,430
I've got a serious job,
I'm having amazing fun.

107
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,630
'To get us back on track, I decided
to ask Jenson a sensible question.'

108
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,390
How does it compare to the P1?

109
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,630
Because they say it's
stolen a lot from the P1.

110
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,510
Can you feel the P1 in it?

111
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,230
Yeah. I have a P1 at home,

112
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,190
and I don't obviously drive on
the road quick, but you can feel

113
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,550
the stiffness in here, and
it's just really on the burn.

114
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,550
The front track is a lot wider,
so you've got that turn-in,

115
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,470
which most road cars miss.

116
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,750
Most road cars miss that initial turn-in.

117
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,350
And it feels like a race car.

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,990
- And the worst bit is, I've got a 650S.
- I know, I know!

119
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,790
- I've got a P1. - I know.
- I haven't got one of these!

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,230
- And they've all sold out.
- Yeah!

121
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,270
That's why this day is
very special for me,

122
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,390
because it's the first
time I've driven this car

123
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,790
and it'll probably be the
last time I drive it, as well.

124
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,830
You can have this one,
nobody's going to want it

125
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,270
- after you!
- I know, I don't want this one!

126
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,990
Now, this is not easy, be careful
here, because you don't want

127
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,540
to mess it up, you don't
want to go on the GRASS!

128
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,160
Well, I've seen it all.

129
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,310
The 675LT then really does
live up to the Longtail name.

130
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,510
And just like the amazing F1,

131
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,030
where this whole story started,

132
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,230
it takes McLaren's trademark
obsession with detail,

133
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,430
and sprinkles it with just enough
madness to become unforgettable.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,080
The result? Brilliant,
maybe even legendary.

135
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Hey, look who's back.

136
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,830
Hiya!

137
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,870
By the way, Matt, thank you for the grapes

138
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,030
and thank you for looking after
me. You're a very nice person.

139
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,630
Aw, that's nice, yeah, here.
OK. This car, £260,000.

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,990
You love this thing, right?

141
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,990
I love this thing, but more
importantly, Jenson Button loves it

142
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,790
and he said, off camera afterwards,

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,190
- he said this may be better
than the P1. - Wow, really?

144
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,230
- Yeah. - OK, back to you for a
second. Don't you own one of these?

145
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,470
- Yes. - So doesn't
that make you biased?

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,470
- No.
- Chris...

147
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,950
OK, yes, of course, it might
do a bit, but I did buy it after

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,110
we made the film and apparently,
within the rules, that's allowed.

149
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,430
OK, but I thought you told
me they were all sold out.

150
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,470
No, they WERE all sold out, but
one bloke paid his deposit,

151
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,270
cancelled his order, and
I stepped in. Honestly!

152
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,830
Uh-huh. Does Jenson know that?

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,230
Well, he does now. Anyway,
that's not the point.

154
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,470
So, how fast does this
car go round our lap?

155
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,830
It's time to hand it over
to our tame racing driver!

156
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,590
Some say he's had a fly
in his helmet since 2007,

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,120
but he likes the company, and
that he dreams in Portuguese.

158
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,230
All we know is he's called...

159
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,240
The Stig!

160
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,670
So, here we go. Launch control off
the line, the 675LT 666 horsepower,

161
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,630
the most powerful McLaren
ever to lap our track,

162
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,510
right into the first corner
there, and look how hard Stig's

163
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,230
working the superfast steering
to keep the 675 under control.

164
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,230
Stig looking positively
carefree this week,

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,800
as he heads through Chicago and
puts down the power for Hammerhead.

166
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,110
The 675's massive airbrake doing
its thing, rear-wheel drive,

167
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,430
of course, only 1,300 kilos,
after all that weight shaving.

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,670
Can Stig tame the mighty McLaren?

169
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,520
Of course he can!

170
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,150
Heading into the Follow Through now,
Stig clearly in a jaunty mood today.

171
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,830
Up through that McLaren
twin-clutch gearbox.

172
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,350
Here comes the tyre wall.

173
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,030
And that looks seriously fast.

174
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,030
Second to last, the 675 wriggling
around there, underbraking.

175
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,070
Come on, Stiggy, bring it home.

176
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,060
Into the last corner and across the line!

177
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,510
So...

178
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,710
That did look very, very quick.

179
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,310
We have had a McLaren around the
track before, the McLaren MP4-12C.

180
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,150
A much pilloried car, but did OK. 116.2.

181
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,030
How about this, though?

182
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,270
The McLaren 675 LT, with
the Stig at the wheel...

183
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,510
- 113...
- Ooh...

184
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,990
.. point 7 -- it's a brand-new record!

185
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,670
Well done! Well done, McLaren!

186
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,260
Bring on the P1! We want the P1!

187
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,750
OK, OK, right on.

188
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,470
Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls, fish and chips.

189
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,550
SUV time. It's our first
ever group road test on tour,

190
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,830
starring the much
anticipated Jaguar F-Pace.

191
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,910
- Ooh...
- Yeah, but first a warning.

192
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,430
The following film does not
feature flash photography,

193
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,590
nor does it contain
scenes of an adult nature.

194
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,470
However, it does feature
large chunks of Top Gear's

195
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,720
weird uncle, Eddie Jordan.

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,440
I can't understand a word he says.

197
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,760
South Africa.

198
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,630
Home to some of the world's
most diverse wildlife,

199
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,710
spectacular scenery

200
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,360
and an environment alien to
most modern off-roaders...

201
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,320
.. off road.

202
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,710
So we decided to start our test
in the SUV's real natural habitat,

203
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,400
the city.

204
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,560
So, this is it, Top Gear's first
group test on tour, starring...

205
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,910
.. the brand-new Jaguar F-Pace.

206
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,390
Look at that car.

207
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,190
Yeah, it is good-looking. It's
huge, but it's good-looking.

208
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,750
Yeah, but I've gotta say Jag doing
SUVs feels a little awkward to me.

209
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,470
That's what they said
when Porsche started SUVs,

210
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,350
in particular, your Porsche Macan.

211
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,590
Let's talk about your car.

212
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,350
This is the GLC.

213
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,150
It's all brand-new, it's a
proper car, luxurious, stylish.

214
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,830
Remember, it's from the
same guys who build the best

215
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,750
Formula One car on this planet.

216
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,510
- Let's talk power. - Let's talk
power. - I've got a 3-litre diesel V6.

217
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,990
I have a 3-litre diesel V6.

218
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,990
I have a 4-cylinder 2.1-litre diesel.

219
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,950
Wah-wah-wah...

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,390
'Whilst Eddie attempted to
defend his lack of power,

221
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,780
'Matt received a challenge.'

222
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,230
OK, challenge. "Welcome to
Durban, one metre above sea level.

223
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,550
"You and your cars will
climb 2,872 vertical metres

224
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,950
"to the highest pub in Africa, where
tomorrow night, it's music night.

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,680
"It is your job to deliver the
music, which will arrive now."

226
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,510
And it would be an eclectic
line-up, to say the least.

227
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,110
Joining chauffeur Eddie,
from Scotland and from Texas,

228
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,040
Sharleen Spiteri.

229
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,350
It's herself! Ah-ha-ha!

230
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,990
- Hey! - He's going to hate it when
he sees that he walks like that.

231
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,190
'With chauffeur Chris
and the Jaguar F-Pace,

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,270
'his old pal and blues
legend, Seasick Steve.'

233
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,790
The winner, the winner!

234
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,150
- 'And riding with me in
the Porsche...' - Whoohoo!

235
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,430
'.. chart-topping British
rapper Tinie Tempah.'

236
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,190
All right, let's kick some butt.

237
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,750
'Introductions over, and with
the music now onboard...'

238
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,030
- Here we go.
- '.. it was time to hit the road.'

239
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,590
This is what a winning team
looks like. Take a look.

240
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,840
It's beautiful. Let's go.

241
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,670
Oh, this thing drives pretty nice.

242
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,630
That Porsche can definitely
move. Can we reel them in?

243
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,420
We'll show them.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,240
However, just a few minutes into
our journey through urban Durban...

245
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,260
.. another challenge arrived.

246
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,350
"OK, guys, you will now assess the
high-speed handling of your cars.

247
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,990
"Ahead you will find an urban circuit,

248
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,030
"around which you will race."

249
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,590
Three laps of a street circuit,
complete with roundabouts,

250
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,720
pavements and nowhere safe to crash.

251
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,110
With Sharleen, Steve and
Tinie on stopwatch duty,

252
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,080
we lined up for a staggered start.

253
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,550
You ready, Chris?

254
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,910
Three, two, one...

255
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,070
go!

256
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,270
Come on.

257
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,070
'Eddie, though, had his
own take on the rules.

258
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,270
Three...

259
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,230
That was SO cheating!

260
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,360
Three, two, one, go!

261
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,830
OK, Porsche, here we go, darling.

262
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,150
- We'd never cheat. - No!
- We would NEVER cheat.

263
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,870
"Three..." He never got to two, man.

264
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,430
Come on now!

265
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,870
First roundabout, first chicane.

266
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,510
'The powerful F-Pace might
be the largest crossover here,

267
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,710
'but because it's made
from lightweight aluminium,

268
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,500
'it corners like a much smaller car.'

269
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,110
Keep it tight, keep it tight,
keep it tight, keep it tight.

270
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,230
Back down the road, Eddie was
in full vintage racer mode...

271
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,190
- Oh, oh...
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

272
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,550
Oh, yeah!

273
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,120
.. braking late and carrying
impressive speed through the bends.

274
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,030
God, Eddie's quick through the corners.

275
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,680
But what about his little problem?

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,870
His little engine.

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,750
On the straights, his Merc
simply didn't have enough oomph,

278
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,990
and to make matters worse, its
nine-speed transmission was

279
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,480
spending more time changing gear
than your average supermodel.

280
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,470
LeBlanc was closing in.

281
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,550
I see you, Eddie.

282
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,150
My God, Matt's quick.

283
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,190
'Plus, the Porsche is the only
car here with a super speedy

284
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,670
'double-clutch transmission,

285
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,390
'so it spends less time shifting gears...

286
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,710
'and more time doing this.'

287
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,630
I can see Jordan and I can see LeBlanc.

288
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,630
We could be on for an overtake here.

289
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Oh, my God, he's right
behind him! Come on!

290
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,710
With my Jag holding its
own up front, just about,

291
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,390
Eddie was doing all he could to
shake the Porsche off his tail.

292
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,910
You sneaky, little... Irishman.

293
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,430
- Oh, [BLEEP], here they come.
- Oh, God!

294
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,670
Come on, Chris!

295
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,550
- Yes!
- Whoo!

296
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,910
Oh, please, don't let
it be Matt. No, no...

297
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,700
Matt's in front!

298
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,160
No! No way!

299
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,670
So, with Eddie stone-cold last,

300
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,830
was it me or Matt who'd
set the fastest time?

301
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,430
What was my time, what was my time?

302
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,670
Our time, your time -- 2.31.

303
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,030
- 2.31. - 2.31. Right, that's the
time to beat. What have we got?

304
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,630
Aw, no, look at this.

305
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,760
2.24, whoa!

306
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,350
Nice! All right, all right, all right.

307
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,190
Well done.

308
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,790
Grudgingly, we had to concede Matt's
Porsche was quickest on tarmac.

309
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,790
But frankly, who cared,

310
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,230
as we were leaving Durban behind
and heading for the great outdoors?

311
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,150
And, feeling generous, we let
the musos take over the driving,

312
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,830
as well as the stereo.

313
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,680
New single, guys!

314
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Hey, that's not fair.

315
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm not putting on a Texas album.

316
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,870
As we munched up the miles in convoy,

317
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,310
through funky towns and colourful
villages, the roads opened up,

318
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,110
as did the horizon.

319
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,910
And behind the wheel, Steve
was falling for the Jag.

320
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,310
It is a lovely car to drive.

321
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,910
The seats are nice. I like that.

322
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,550
- I feel fancy.
- Do you?

323
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,760
Yeah, and I never feel fancy, hardly.

324
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,590
As we left civilisation behind,
the drive just got better

325
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,910
and better and better.

326
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,430
Nice road!

327
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,390
This is beautiful.

328
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,030
Oh, how beautiful is this?

329
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,120
And then, just like that, our
off-road adventure began.

330
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,030
Look at it out there.

331
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,750
No, look... No, no! I'll look at the view.

332
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,200
- Wow, look at that view over there.
- No, Steve, look at the hairpin bend!

333
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,910
Because they'd lost the road race,
we decided Eddie and Sharleen

334
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,190
should sit at the back of
the pack, eating our dust.

335
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,790
Hi, guys, we're having a ball,

336
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,040
we're just getting pummelled
with all your rocks back here.

337
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,950
Oh, Jesus, did you see that?

338
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,790
Sharleen, you and Eddie are going
to have to re-paint that Mercedes

339
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,150
when this is over.

340
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,630
'Meanwhile, we were up
front with clean air

341
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,220
'and a clear view to play with.'

342
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,870
Nice.

343
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,990
'And Tinie was having fun.'

344
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,630
Whoohoo!

345
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,550
- Whoaaa!
- Oh, man alive!

346
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,790
Whoo!

347
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,070
'Luckily, before Tinie got us
too acquainted with the scenery,

348
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,260
'Chris received a text.'

349
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,070
"You will now test the off-road stability

350
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,830
"of your sporting crossovers. Up
ahead, you will find a dirt track.

351
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,350
"You must complete the climb within
a minimum time of three minutes,

352
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,830
"carrying two of South Africa's
famous Sundowner cocktails."

353
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,470
"The couple with the most drink
left in their glasses at the end

354
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,910
"gets first pick of
overnight accommodation."

355
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,910
So, good luck, everyone.
Right, let's get the cocktails.

356
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,950
- No way. - Come on, we've
gotta try and win something.

357
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,510
Wow.

358
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,670
- Wowee. - I think there'll be
more ON us than in those glasses.

359
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,120
- Cheers. - I'll get the next
one, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, come on.

360
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,270
Oh, my God, no wonder they'd
covered everything in plastic.

361
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,750
Easy now...

362
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,550
Oh, man!

363
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,710
Oh, God, this is going to be crazy.

364
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,500
I'm already wet!

365
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,580
You got it?

366
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,110
Ooh, nice.

367
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,070
'We had spotted the
protective plastic too,

368
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,520
'which gave Sharleen an idea.'

369
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,580
Don't let them see that.

370
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,070
- Oh, [BLEEP], - my balls. - Oi!

371
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,040
My balls are wet.

372
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,070
'So, having won the road race,

373
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,550
'we were the first to
tackle the two-mile track.'

374
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,440
.. two, one, go!

375
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,820
Easy, Tinie.

376
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,550
'And it's fair to say,

377
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,200
'we weren't going to break
any land speed records.'

378
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,230
That is so slow.

379
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,670
Three-minute minimum, remember.
There's a three-minute minimum.

380
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,870
I think you're going to
have to go faster than that.

381
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,520
'So, he did.'

382
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,310
I'm in the zone, I'm in the
z... Oh! I'm in the zone.

383
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,600
'Back at the start, Chris and Steve
set off with a thirst for victory.'

384
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,430
- Yeah, good. Good so far.
- Ooh, this is the hard part.

385
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,630
Oh!

386
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,910
Now we're doing good.

387
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,910
Hit the jackpot there,
Steve, gotta tell you.

388
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,960
- If we don't win this,
seriously... - Go!

389
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,100
- Take it steady.
- I'm OK.

390
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,790
Doing awesome, man.

391
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,910
- Oh, Jesus!
- Ohhh!

392
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,030
Did I get you? I'm sorry.
Those are cashmere pants?

393
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,430
Those are nice pants.

394
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,390
Tell you what, the Jag's
all right, isn't it?

395
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,710
Man, you're rocking it.
This car's fair smooth.

396
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,630
Look at it. I'm relaxed now.

397
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,910
Steve, this is good driving... Waaay!

398
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,160
Oh, there's a little bit.

399
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,430
Brilliant.

400
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,150
'Soon, the finish was in sight.'

401
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,870
And we did it.

402
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,630
And with all of us
across the line in time,

403
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,390
as we pulled up for the judging,
the pressure was overwhelming.

404
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,160
- Oh!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

405
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,270
'But, hey, we thought,

406
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,640
'whatever happens, at least
we'd all given it a fair go.'

407
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,990
Whoa-oh-oh. Whoa!

408
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,590
- Hm... - What do you think?
- Why is it so pink? I'm suspicious.

409
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,590
- Shaken, not stirred. - They weren't
that colour when you picked them up

410
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,830
off the table. What have
you got going in there?

411
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,550
What are you suggesting, Matthew?

412
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,990
All right, here, this is ours, on the end.

413
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,070
- Look how much they have.
- No!

414
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,590
I'll tell you, she is
the most gentle driver

415
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,870
- that God has ever created.
- OK, just a small point...

416
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,030
I think there's some cheating going
on, hang on... Something's not cool.

417
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,430
Look at those guys' faces...

418
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,350
- Cheaters, all four of them cheated.
- They're all dishonest people.

419
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,830
- All four have cheated.
- No, we didn't cheat!

420
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,790
- You held those in your hand the whole time?
- I held them in my hand...

421
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,870
No, she held that one,
she held the big one...

422
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,110
'Clearly, my colleagues were lying,
and as they argued the results

423
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,630
'amongst themselves, we
realised that Eddie's cheating

424
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,310
'had actually paid off.'

425
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,750
It's not a contest. We've won.

426
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,670
We didn't win at the racing, but we won.

427
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,270
No shame in their voices, either.

428
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,270
No shame, no shame.

429
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,310
None.

430
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,110
Matt, we love you for being so honest.

431
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,430
Those guys are two decent human beings.

432
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,420
Yeah, just too nice.

433
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,800
'With a clear conscience, we drove
on through the murky gloom.'

434
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,710
'And while the others
were full of wonder...'

435
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,310
This is an adventure, man.

436
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,030
'.. with Tinie and I having
last choice of accommodation,

437
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,880
'we were about to find out
what happens to nice guys.'

438
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,390
Wow, look at this.

439
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,280
'And then, out of the darkness...'

440
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,550
Oh, no, look at our tent.

441
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,510
Look at OUR tent!

442
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,150
- Oh, no!
- What the hell is this?

443
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,750
Look at the size of their tent!

444
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,520
Oh, gosh.

445
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
- It was great. - Part two of our
South African adventure coming up.

446
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,390
Matt, do you miss your tiny tent?

447
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,070
I don't.

448
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,550
Do you miss your Tinie Tempah?

449
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,030
I do, I like that guy.

450
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,030
All right, well, let me tell you,
please welcome here tonight...

451
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,750
NOT Tinie Tempah. Sorry,
he couldn't make it.

452
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,590
However, please do welcome our other
three co-stars from South Africa,

453
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,590
Sharleen Spiteri, Seasick
Steve, Eddie Jordan,

454
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,120
and tonight's superstar in the
rally cross car, Damian Lewis!

455
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,630
OK, OK.

456
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,230
OK, how are you? Mwah, mwah.

457
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,230
- Hi, Steve. - Evans.
- Hi, Eddie, how are you?

458
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,430
- I've just... I've just
got to say... - What?

459
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,990
Three against one, is that fair?

460
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,750
Well, you say you're one,
Damian, but first of all,

461
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,790
not only are you ace at football,

462
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,510
you're brilliant at golf,

463
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,230
you're an accomplished cricketer,

464
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,630
but also, you are Nick Brody from
Homeland, everybody! Come on!

465
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,390
The toughest man to come out
of the States for ten years.

466
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,950
You're also Henry VIII, come on!

467
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,510
The most ruthless man to come
out of England in 1,000 years,

468
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,550
and now you're Bobby Axelrod, here we go.

469
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,030
Look at that dude.

470
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,870
Oh, yes, the most lovable rogue
since the Wolf of Wall Street.

471
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,070
That's why, you see, that's
what's going on there.

472
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,150
Got it, three into one.
Got it, got it, got it.

473
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,630
Yeah, you need three normal
people to even stand a chance

474
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,470
- of beating you. - Normal? - Steve,
tell us a little bit more about

475
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,390
what Damian's up to at the moment.

476
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,150
Damian Lewis is currently
starring as Bobby Axelrod

477
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,110
in the Sky Atlantic smash hit Billions.

478
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,990
Check this out.

479
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,320
He's an icon of the wealth
of our age and he's a fraud.

480
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,030
When did it become a crime
to succeed in this country?

481
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,560
When he falls, he's going
to hit the ground... hard.

482
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,070
A good matador doesn't kill a fresh bull.

483
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,320
He'll wait until he's
been stuck a few times.

484
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,470
It's the new big thing, Sky
Atlantic 9pm Thursdays,

485
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,990
or binge on the box set.

486
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,030
That's what we do, it's what we
did, we just finished it last night.

487
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,750
It's brilliant. Very car-y
show, isn't it, by the way?

488
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,110
I get to drive some fantastic cars.

489
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,670
They closed down the West Side
Highway one day in Manhattan,

490
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,510
as I got into an old Bentley
Convertible Continental,

491
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,310
went swerving in and out
down the West Side Highway.

492
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,750
- I've got a Dodge Charger.
- Yes.

493
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,710
- There it is. Look, this thing...
- I'm in love, I'm in love.

494
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,350
This is a beautiful, beautiful
car. It's got those lovely,

495
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,030
big bucket seats, a bit like this,

496
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,830
so it's a bit like you're rolling
around, like you're in a big sofa,

497
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,710
but it's got some poke
in it, which is great.

498
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,150
Eddie, you have a question.

499
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,550
Very important question.

500
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,070
Damian, we all want to know, will
you be the first ginger James Bond?

501
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,630
If Chris turns it down...

502
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,270
.. I'd be only too happy.

503
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,310
How far...? Is this one question
you get sick of being asked?

504
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,990
- No, I don't get sick of
it, I love it. - Do you?

505
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,070
- But it is chat, it is just chat.
- But you seem to embrace the question,

506
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,950
as opposed to sort of poo-pooing
it. Have you made any overtures

507
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,670
to the producers of Bond?

508
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,630
No-one has called me,
Chris. No-one's called me.

509
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,430
OK, have you called them at all?

510
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,790
The name's Bond.

511
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,430
- Sorry, you didn't ask me to practise!
- Do it, do it, do it!

512
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,710
Do it, do it, do it! Go on. So
Sharleen is the new Bond girl.

513
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,550
Let's make this happen. Go on.

514
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,940
The name's Bond, Ginge Bond.

515
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,620
Nothing wrong with that!
Nothing wrong with that at all!

516
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,670
It's you or me. It's you or me.

517
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,750
So, actually, we have
three musicians here,

518
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,510
cos, Eddie, you've got a band.
And, Shar, you're in the middle

519
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,070
- of making a brand-new album, as well.
- Made a new album, yeah.

520
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,630
OK, congratulations. And,
Steve, your latest album

521
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,230
is out on the 7th October

522
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,630
and you have the biggest live gig
of your life at Wembley on the 14th.

523
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,950
Biggest live gig of his
life, ladies and gentlemen!

524
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,790
I'm not nervous, I'm not nervous,

525
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,580
I'm not nervous.

526
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,790
What's the name of your new album, Stevie?

527
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,110
The name of the new record is
Keeping the Horse Between Me

528
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,590
and the Ground. Good philosophy
when you're riding one.

529
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,190
That's a great philosophy. All
right, let's get on to cars.

530
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,950
OK, so, it's you against
Team South Africa, all right?

531
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,230
So, first of all, first
car, what are you going for?

532
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,910
First car? I had a Subaru, which
I... Actually, I went travelling

533
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,950
in South Africa for a bit and
that's where I got my first car.

534
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,750
I got in a big, old Subaru
that took me across the Kruger,

535
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,470
into the safari parks, and I went
down through the Karoo in it.

536
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,310
Right, but you can't remember which
kind of Subaru it was, can you?

537
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,230
I think it was an "Imprayza".

538
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,750
- Impreza? - Er, that too.
- Yeah, doesn't matter.

539
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,350
- Well-known off-road car.
- Yeah, it was the "Subaru Imprayza".

540
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,590
- Did it look like this? Yay!
- Who's the girl selling it?

541
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,430
- Great first hair. - That
was Hamlet hair. - Was it?

542
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,550
- Regent's Park Open Air Theatre.
- Perfect.

543
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,310
Right, so, first car for Team South
Africa, we're going with Steve.

544
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,670
Steve, you've got to
beat the Subaru Impreza.

545
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,070
No problem.

546
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,270
First car was a 1949 Ford.

547
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,150
- 1949 Ford? - Yeah. - Now,
it didn't have a name, did it?

548
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,750
It was just called a Ford.

549
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,510
People called them Shoebox cos
they kind of had a slab side,

550
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,350
but this particular car, I
was walking out in the woods,

551
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,550
and I saw this car that was
abandoned and the windows were open

552
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,670
and it had blackberry
vines growing through it,

553
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,030
and I just fell in love with this car.

554
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,190
I looked at the registration,
had the address,

555
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,310
went over to the guy's house, and I go,

556
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,630
"Um, I found your car out
in the woods," and he goes,

557
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,310
"You want it?" And I go,
"Yeah," and he gave me the keys.

558
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,470
So, you know, I go, "Yeah,
really, you're giving me the car?"

559
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,070
And he goes, "Yeah, it don't work."

560
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,390
So I got a battery and I filled
up a wine bottle full of gas,

561
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,950
and I dumped some gas in the carburettor,

562
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,950
stuck the battery in,
and it started right up.

563
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,950
And that was up in Washington State,
and I drove it down to California.

564
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,270
- Wow!
- Along the coast.

565
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,110
And all Steve's stories are that
good, by the way, about anything.

566
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,390
"Steve, I heard you went
to the shop the other day."

567
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,190
"Well let me tell you about that..."

568
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,710
So, a 1949 Ford Shoebox, there you go, OK.

569
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,950
That car did not look that good.

570
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,710
What about you? Shall we try
and take you back in time now?

571
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,710
Yay!

572
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,830
- Is that really me? - Yeah.
- I look even old there.

573
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,910
All right, well it is best first car,

574
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,470
so let's see them both
together, back-to-back.

575
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,390
We've got Steve's Ford '49 Shoebox

576
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,270
and we've got Damian's Impreza.

577
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,390
Let's hear it for Steve's
Ford '49 Shoebox.

578
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,630
With a great story!

579
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,790
Or Damian's Subaru Impreza?

580
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,270
Steve takes the first round!

581
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,910
- 1-nil to Team South Africa. OK...
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

582
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,870
OK, best car ever, Damian?

583
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,190
I would have to go for my
Mini Convertible, which I love.

584
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,030
- All right. - Which I love.
- A Mini Convertible, best car ever.

585
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,550
- I drove a TVR, which I
loved. - Yeah. - But, you know,

586
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,470
went away for two weeks, then
you had to spend two weeks

587
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,030
getting it running again,

588
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,870
so that was always a problem, but
this, I stick my kids in there,

589
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,270
we stick a bit of Madness
on, we sing along,

590
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,830
the dog goes in the back.

591
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,630
Got a puppy, we have to attach
the lead to the handbrake here,

592
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,990
- in case he tries to jump out the back.
- So when he does?

593
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,110
- Well, if she does, the handbrake's
going on, isn't it? - OK, how's that?

594
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,110
Well, if we're doing a corner
at the time, it'll create quite

595
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,070
an exciting corner, but if we're
in heavy traffic on the M4,

596
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,510
it's going to be less helpful, you know.

597
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,430
OK, so, Team South Africa, best car ever.

598
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,670
Eddie Jordan's taken this one.

599
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,470
Beyond any doubt that wonderful
green car, the Jordan 191,

600
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,830
beyond any doubt, that is the winner!

601
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,620
Let's have a look, let's have a look.

602
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,230
Right, we... This is a bit
unfair, isn't it, best car ever?

603
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,630
But he did own it, I suppose.
Now, this was really special. Why?

604
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,670
Well, a couple of reasons. You
can probably see somebody's helmet

605
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,470
sticking out of the cockpit there.

606
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,910
It is none other than the
great Michael Schumacher,

607
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,510
his first ever Grand Prix!

608
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,870
OK, so...

609
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,710
Well, this could be close.

610
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,750
So best car ever, right?

611
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,950
Damian's Mini Convertible or Michael
Schumacher's debut Formula One car?

612
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,270
Let's hear it for the Mini.

613
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,910
- Yay!
- Well done.

614
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,630
Let's hear it for Michael
Schumacher's debut Formula One

615
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,230
Jordan 191...

616
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,080
Oh! Oh! With bonus... With bonus hair!

617
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,070
OK, well, it would have been 2-nil,
but I've got to disqualify you

618
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,790
just for that hair, sorry.

619
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,230
So, actually, I'm going to
give you the point by default.

620
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,390
Ooh, it's 1-all. It
couldn't be more exciting.

621
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,430
Let's go to the decider. So, it's
you up against Team South Africa.

622
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,310
Sharleen is in charge
of the lap, aren't you?

623
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,430
- OK... - Would you like
to see Sharleen's lap first?

624
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,430
Yeah!

625
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,720
OK, let's take a look.

626
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,990
There she is, off the line.

627
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,790
Come on!

628
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,750
Speed up, car.

629
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,340
Sharleen Spiteri, into turn one.

630
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,230
Easy left-hander and off-road from here,

631
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,630
little squiggle and a wiggle to the
right, and on to the dirt, she goes.

632
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,150
Having a good time,
water splash, here we go.

633
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,550
Good water, Sharleen.

634
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,950
OK, tight right-hander,
oversteer, no ABS, of course.

635
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,070
Into Hammerhead.

636
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,790
By the way, a very competitive Glaswegian

637
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,510
you have on your hands here, Damian.

638
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,070
Nice and tidy.

639
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,510
Back off-road.

640
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,830
Go, go, go, go, go.

641
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,590
Heading towards the big hairpin.

642
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,030
And, once again, oversteer, and...

643
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,750
[BLEEP].

644
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,150
- Oh, air, good air! - Air!
- Amazing air. - Come on!

645
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,390
You were in the air, Shar.

646
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,110
Eugh, I feel really sick.

647
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,390
Cleaning the tyres.

648
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,070
Cleaning the tyres, up to the
tyres, no lifting off there.

649
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,910
- See, I was trying.
- Very impressive, Sharleen.

650
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,470
Next to the last corner and...

651
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,270
up to Gambon. Looking good.

652
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,030
- Ooh! - Cutting the corner,
and... across the line!

653
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,910
- Yeah! - You hit that
corner perfect, Shar.

654
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,510
- Did I? - That's where
I'd go off the grass.

655
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,270
How was that for you?

656
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,670
Do you know what, I was just hoping
I'd get round the track in one piece

657
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,670
today, when I came, cos they
told me that the tyres were...

658
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,830
It was going to be quite
slippy, but I had so much fun.

659
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,070
- Did you? - Honestly, when
it started pulling around,

660
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,070
I was like, "Oh, this is great fun."
I loved it, I really loved it.

661
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,870
All right, so nice weather
for a record lap time, Damian.

662
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,790
Perfect conditions.

663
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,070
I wonder where this is going.

664
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,350
You have driven the Top Gear lap before,

665
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,310
but it was the worst conditions of
all time, and therefore the slowest

666
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,750
lap time of all time, but
everybody here says you still drove

667
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,270
it brilliantly. Would you
like to see a bit of that?

668
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,040
OK, take a look at this.

669
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,070
- Ooh!
- Watch this, watch this.

670
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,070
And, and, and...

671
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,110
Ooh!

672
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,640
Sideways across the line, whoa!

673
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,470
So today should have been a
breeze by comparison, really.

674
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,150
And also, your best car
of all time is a Mini.

675
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,710
- Yes.
- OK, so previous, here...

676
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,350
I've been practising on the
school run, Chris, yes.

677
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,710
Would you like to see Damian's lap?

678
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,190
Yeah!

679
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,400
OK, here we go!

680
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,510
Off the line! Good start there.

681
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,950
And we are off.

682
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,310
We are off and we are
about to be off-road.

683
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,390
To be honest, he's already
flying. He's already flying.

684
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,790
Look at that. Lovely.

685
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,270
All right, onto the dirt.

686
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,390
My heart's beating fast.

687
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,510
And water splash.

688
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,100
Yes, thank you very much, indeed.

689
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,030
Lost a second there, I reckon.

690
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,430
Into Hammerhead, keeping
it tight, once again.

691
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,110
Oh, you can see he's at home
in a Mini, the boy, isn't he?

692
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,230
- Yeah, you see, there you go.
- Almost on three wheels there.

693
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,280
I kept trying to take
the roof down though.

694
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,390
It's not roofless, but
you are being ruthless.

695
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,150
Hairpin handbrake, yes. Handbrake?

696
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,190
I did, and I gave it up.

697
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,790
Air, good air!

698
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,550
Who doesn't want a go at this?

699
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,070
OK, up to the tyre wall,
straight through there, nice.

700
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,350
Come across, get on the brakes.

701
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,430
OK, you can overcook it here so easily,

702
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,150
- which really messes you up for
- Gambon. Oh, look at that.

703
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,790
- No, in control, very good, slow
in, fast out. - Totally rocking.

704
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,870
And again... Oh, this is all good.

705
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,420
He's at one with his Mini,
and he's over the line!

706
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,270
How was it for you, Damian?

707
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,350
- It was so much fun.
- Was it?

708
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,430
I jumped in the car with the
Stig though, in the McLaren,

709
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,870
- early on in the day, when
I first got here. - Right.

710
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,430
And I had to change my
underwear afterwards.

711
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,350
It was the most terrifying thing.

712
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,030
I couldn't get out of the car.

713
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,830
I crawled out the car.

714
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,790
Right, now we've got
times up here already,

715
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,390
Jesse from last week, and Gordon.

716
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,750
First of all, Sharleen,
let's do ladies again first.

717
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,550
Sharleen Spiteri, you have
Jesse Eisenberg at 2:10.9,

718
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,310
you have Gordon Ramsay,

719
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,150
currently leader with all those
two names on the board, 1:56.3.

720
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,590
Sharleen, how do you think you did?

721
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,150
Do you know what, in all
honesty, I have no...

722
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,390
I think I'm over 2:00.

723
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,670
So you want to be beating
Jesse though, don't you?

724
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,230
I would like to beat Jesse. I'm not anywhere
near Gordon, but I'd like to beat Jesse.

725
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,750
Sharleen, you're right,
you were over two minutes.

726
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,990
Sharleen Spiteri, 2 minutes...

727
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,270
1.4, so well done!

728
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,520
- Oh! Yeah!
- You did it, you did it, you did it!

729
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,830
- Well done. - Happy with that?
- Yeah, I'm happy with that.

730
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,030
OK. Right, Damian, there's only one
thing you really want to do here,

731
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,950
isn't there?

732
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,110
I want to cook up something rather lovely.

733
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,230
OK, you did say to me
when you first arrived,

734
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,470
you said, "How competitive
was Ramsay last week?"

735
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,350
- And I think we both know the answer
to that, don't we? - Yeah, yeah.

736
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,070
He was pretty competitive, as always.

737
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,910
So 1:56.3 to beat.

738
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,360
You did it in 1...

739
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,670
50... Ooh!

740
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,440
3.9!

741
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,590
Congratulations. Well done, my friend.

742
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,390
- Whoa!
- Rock and roll, come on!

743
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,640
New leader, Damian Lewis!

744
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,990
All right!

745
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,830
Now, let's find out
what happened in part two

746
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,280
of Top Gear Does South Africa.

747
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,990
- Tinie, your skin is so soft.
- Move over, man.

748
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,430
Guys, challenge! Wake up.

749
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,910
- Yay... - "You will now test
your vehicle's stealth capabilities

750
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,300
"with a wildlife challenge."

751
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,550
'Using our cars' reversing cameras

752
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,110
'and our most delicate driving
skills, we'd have just two hours

753
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,790
'to film the most impressive
beasts of the South African bush.

754
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,510
'But first we'd have to find them.'

755
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,470
Let's go. Whoo!

756
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,310
- You know what, this feels quite deep.
- Oh, my God.

757
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,590
No, wait, don't go any
further, don't go any further!

758
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,600
Woohoo! We're clear!

759
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,390
'In the Jaguar, we decided to go big.'

760
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,510
So, Steve, we've got to find a rhino.

761
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,830
I thought rhinos found you.

762
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,750
Right on, Jaguar.

763
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,800
This car's doing all right here, isn't it?

764
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,390
I, actually, honestly, when
I said that, I meant it,

765
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,550
it felt nicer on the dirt
than it did on the highway.

766
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,510
It seems to settle into its groove.

767
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,430
Yeah, it seems at home here, doesn't it?

768
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,460
If we see a rhino, I'm
going to [BLEEP] myself.

769
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,040
Meanwhile, Eddie had spotted something.

770
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,270
Look.

771
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,310
- These are... - Eddie, you've gone
a bit Crocodile Dundee on me here.

772
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,630
No, look at the hoof!

773
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,630
He's going in that
direction. Come on, let's go!

774
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,950
How are we going to know
what direction he's going in?

775
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,950
Because you can see his hoof!

776
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,270
Do you really know what
direction he's going in?

777
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,550
Well, he's not going to
walk backwards, is he?

778
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,750
And then, incredibly,
Eddie was proven right.

779
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,070
Oh, wow!

780
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,350
Oh, my God, look, wildebeest.

781
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,150
That's too good to miss, we've got
to go and have a crack at that.

782
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,390
- Up here?
- Yeah, straight up.

783
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,310
- You're my periscope.
- I am!

784
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,470
Oh...

785
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,710
Don't go in there...

786
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,670
Where is he? Where is he?!

787
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,230
He's gone.

788
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,430
'In the Porsche, though,
Matt and Tinie were

789
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,030
'pointed in the right direction,
which happened to be backwards.'

790
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,630
OK, keep your eyes out for animals, buddy.

791
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,910
'And before long, they found some.'

792
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,230
There they are.

793
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,750
We don't want to scare them away.
We have to be really stealth.

794
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,710
- You checking out this pro
reversing I'm doing? - You legend.

795
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,070
Get your notepad out, mate.

796
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,630
You know, these are my favourite
animals in the world, Matt?

797
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,230
Are they really?

798
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,720
Right, I've got my director hat on,
I'm looking through the camera now.

799
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,670
Look, look, look, we got them.

800
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,790
That is awesome. Sick.

801
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,270
Oh, here comes some more! They're
walking right... Camera hogs.

802
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,070
- Look out your window,
Look, look, look. - Oh, yeah!

803
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,870
With the babies.

804
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,670
- Ooh! - Look, look,
look, look, look. - Ooh!

805
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,550
- Look at them all
running through. - Sick.

806
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,390
Whoo!

807
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,590
'Back on our rhino hunt, the
rhinos were nowhere to be seen.'

808
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,390
We haven't got anything on our camera.

809
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,790
Does that mean we lose,
if we don't get something,

810
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,590
with all that amazing driving you did?

811
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,230
[BLEEP]. Oh, man.

812
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,320
- We missed the impala.
- We can't even catch an impala.

813
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,550
'And worse still for Steve and I,

814
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,990
'Eddie's bush-tracking skills
were about to pay off again.'

815
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,960
Oh, my God! Giraffes.

816
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,760
What are the chances that
we can get up here a bit?

817
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,390
No, don't move. No, no, no, no, no, no...

818
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,240
Oh, my God, this is almost impossible.

819
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,310
Keep going, keep going, keep
going. Keep it as quiet as you can.

820
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,630
There he is, look. Beautiful.

821
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,510
'And then we discovered he wasn't alone.'

822
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,430
How elegant, look.

823
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,920
Oh, my goodness.

824
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,740
'Time was up on our stealth
driving challenge.'

825
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,270
- Do you think we got enough stuff?
- I think we did good.

826
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,670
We did really good. We've
got loads of zebras.

827
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,390
Zebra? What's a zebra?

828
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,270
Well, we call it zebra,
you guys call it "zeebra".

829
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,030
Zed. Zed, right?

830
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,590
- "Zeebra". - X, Y, zed. - Zee.

831
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,670
Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, zed.

832
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,150
- Zee. - Zed. - Zee.

833
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,430
It's not Jay "zed", it's Jay "zee".

834
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,120
Ah, OK, you got me, you got
me! I can't say no to that.

835
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,350
'The results were in.

836
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,870
'So, which SUV had stealthed
its way to success?'

837
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,910
OK, OK, OK, challenge results.

838
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,300
Here it is. "The winner is...

839
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,720
"Eddie and Sharleen."

840
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,950
- The underdogs!
- Yes!

841
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,230
These guys, why do they keep winning?

842
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,270
Did you cheat on this one, as well, guys?

843
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,230
No, how do you cheat at that?

844
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,110
Were any of them stuffed animals?

845
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,350
We were looking for a rhino!

846
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,190
Oh, my God, you two are so jealous.

847
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,750
So, giraffe beats zebra. Really? Who knew?

848
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,840
At least one thing was certain.
We had somewhere we needed to be.

849
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,350
Our passengers were due
to headline a music night,

850
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,740
at the highest pub in Africa.

851
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,150
And to get them the rest of the way,

852
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,110
our SUVs would really have to perform.

853
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,470
Come across!

854
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,060
Oh, no, no.

855
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,110
Ooh...

856
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,870
Way!

857
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,390
- Yeah! - What a show-off. - Legend!

858
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,350
- He's crooked. - Look at that,
look at that, all-time air.

859
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,270
Whoo! Good, good.

860
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,430
Oh, oh, ooh.

861
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,630
Ooh!

862
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,270
Oi! Almost ran over his man.

863
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,000
- We nearly lost you.
- Oh, God.

864
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,030
As we ploughed on, it was like our cars...

865
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,110
came alive.

866
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,990
Whoohoo!

867
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,310
They were in their element,

868
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,520
eating up whatever terrain
Africa threw at them.

869
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,790
But the Mercedes developed
another problem,

870
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,230
and this time it was sat
in the driver's seat.

871
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,100
Oh! [BLEEP].

872
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,080
Ooh!

873
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,270
Yeah, you just ripped the skirt off
the back of your car, it's hanging.

874
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,070
Hold up, Eddie, hold up.

875
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,670
'And it turned out there was
another reason why the Merc

876
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,710
'had taken a battering.'

877
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,630
Eddie, did you have it in off-road mode?

878
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,230
- I don't think so.
- You don't have it in off-road mode?

879
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,910
Uh, I don't know. No.

880
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,470
Eddie -- mountains, river, rocks, Africa.

881
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,310
You know, there's a button in there,

882
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,270
when you push the button,
it raises the car up

883
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,870
so you can get over the rocks
and stuff, so when you get maybe

884
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,960
off the pavement, hit that button
and you won't destroy the car.

885
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,670
Can you remember to push the button?

886
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,590
'Sadly, though, he didn't.'

887
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,630
It's pretty rugged here.

888
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,220
Mind you, can we raise the ride?

889
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,270
Aah!

890
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,560
- Oh, God!
- Eddie...

891
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,510
'The Mercedes and Sharleen were
looking unlikely to make it

892
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,800
'to the pub in one piece.
Something had to be done.'

893
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,030
How's it going, guys?

894
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,270
Eh, we bust this tank and it's leaking.

895
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,270
Right, so listen, we've, um...

896
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,350
We don't think you should
drive the car any more.

897
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,790
We think you should hand the keys over
to Sharleen for the remainder of the trip.

898
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,430
- That's not a bad idea, actually.
- Is he joking?

899
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,280
- It's true, I'm not kidding.
- Are you being serious?

900
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,160
Sharleen?

901
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,750
I'm not Sharleen.

902
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,270
You're not driving it, are you?

903
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,590
'With the Merc's issues
dealt with once and for all,

904
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,520
'we closed in on our final destination.'

905
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,800
Wow, look at that. There
it is, the Sani Pass.

906
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,840
Our pub is straight ahead.

907
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,590
Well, not quite straight.

908
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,310
Before us lay the most
treacherous of dirt roads,

909
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,870
climbing high into the
Drakensberg Mountains.

910
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,150
No run-off, no barriers,

911
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,870
no margin for error. No, seriously.

912
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,020
And as we steeled
ourselves for the climb...

913
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,790
- Oh!
- Hold on, guys. Message.

914
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,510
Yeah, have we all got the same message?

915
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,350
"Congratulations, you've nearly
made it to Africa's highest pub,

916
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,670
"a hell of a commute."

917
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,590
"However, there is only one vacancy
to perform on stage tonight."

918
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,150
"There are two other
vacancies working the bar

919
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,830
"and washing dishes in
the kitchen..." What?

920
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,670
- Oh, man, that sucks.
- "To decide who gets the gig,

921
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,830
"you and your artist will
race up the Sani Pass.

922
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,040
"The winner will be the fastest
and/or whoever survives."

923
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,880
Is it that nutty?

924
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,430
Yes, it was.

925
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,630
We would each have to attack a
terrifying, unsighted rally stage,

926
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,470
the ultimate test for our SUVs.

927
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,670
We would be trusting them with our lives.

928
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,630
I'm going to focus on the road,
you tell me when the lady says go.

929
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,430
I got your back.

930
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,550
'And in true rally style, we would
start at 30-second intervals.'

931
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,840
Go!

932
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,470
Breathe, breathing.

933
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,070
Watch her fingers.

934
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,360
Go!

935
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,110
Just a touch on the brakes, just a touch.

936
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,390
Go, go, go!

937
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,910
I love it.

938
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,150
Here we go, ready?

939
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,480
Easy now.

940
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,920
Way!

941
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,560
As the pass climbed higher,
the drops became ever steeper.

942
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,270
But with the other cars on
my tail, I couldn't slow down.

943
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,230
Straight, straight, straight,
don't... Watch the bump here!

944
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,590
Now take it steady.

945
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,680
But then the Sani Pass
threw up a surprise.

946
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,750
A border!

947
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,270
'Turns out Africa's highest pub
isn't actually in South Africa.

948
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,750
'It's in Lesotho.'

949
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,150
Can I see your passport, please?

950
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,110
Sure. We've gotta get through
this as quick as we can.

951
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,760
Oh, no, we didn't have
our passports ready! Oh.

952
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,620
We're in a different country now.

953
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,840
Whoa, whoa!

954
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,060
What the hell happened then?

955
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,350
What on earth is this? Keep going!

956
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,920
Flash them. Flash, flash, flash.
Oh, my God, what's he want?

957
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,710
- Can I see your passport, please?
- Oh, come on, we're in a race, man.

958
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,200
Let's go!

959
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,440
Go. Go!

960
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,820
Mind! Jesus!

through the border...

Thank you.

964
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,300
.. we were all approaching
the last stretch.

965
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,670
It was as stunning as it was dangerous.

966
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,400
Whoa, whoa...

967
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,920
Don't even look down there!

968
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,760

- Aah! - Oh, [BLEEP]!
- We're over the cliff!

- Can you see Sharleen anywhere? - No!

Come on, we've got Chris
just above, you can see him.

Chris is miles away, but I
can see Eddie and Sharleen.

come up, cos he is so fast.

Easy now, easy, easy.

What a road, and what a trip.

982
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,990
2,874 metres above Africa, and we
were all thinking the same thing.

00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,110
Almost there, brother.

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,070
Red wine coming up.

1004
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,430
Gordon's, Gordon's,
where's Gordon's? This?

1005
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,270
♪ All the girls like

1006
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,190
♪ All the girls like

1007
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,190
♪ All the girls like

1008
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,070
♪ OK... ♪

1009
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,670
Come to Africa, wash our dishes.

1010
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,630
We're going to miss all the fun.

1011
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,510
- We shouldn't be here, Sharleen.
- I'm not a bloody racing driver!

1012
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,870
Well, neither am I!

1013
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,070
But you were!

1014
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,030
My God. You're trying to blame me.

1015
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,790
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

1016
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,910
That was so much fun, that was a
trip none of us will ever forget,

1017
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,310
thanks to these three cars,
which are tough as nails.

1018
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,430
Which is absolutely true and correct.

1019
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,870
However, when it comes to
the road test, not the race,

1020
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,390
which is why we were there,
our car, mine and Steve's car,

1021
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,790
the Jaguar F-Pace, was the only one
that finished with nothing broken...

1022
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,710
- True, true. - .. nothing
hanging off and nothing leaking.

1023
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,390
- Good car.
- Great car.

1024
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,110
Which can only mean one thing.

1025
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,070
What?

1026
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,230
You were driving like Miss Daisy!

1027
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,110
And on that bombshell...

1028
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,230
Oh, no, no, no...

1029
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,790
We don't do that any more.
Did he not get the memo?

1030
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,830
I sent the memo. Anyway,
on next week's show,

1031
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,470
the debut of our two rookies
Chris Harris and Rory Reid,

1032
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,950
and Ken Block and Kevin
Hart and Anthony Joshua.

1033
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,550
Yeah, and the Tesla Model X, the
new Audi R8, and the Ferrari F12tdf.

1034
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,510
- Right, goodnight, everybody,
thanks for watching! - Goodnight!
