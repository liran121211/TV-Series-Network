1
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:16,408
Tonight,
the stupidest car in the world.

2
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:18,473
A Vauxhall you might actually like.

3
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:21,340
And who has won what in
the Top Gear awards ceremony?

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,265
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,304
Hello everybody!
Welcome, and a happy new year.

6
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,313
Happy new year to everybody.

7
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:41,340
Now, like many of you here, I suffer from
insomnia. I've tried everything over the years.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:46,356
I've tried eating lettuce, counting
sheep, I even resorted last night

9
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,357
to James May's new talking book. LAUGHTER

10
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:52,392
That didn't work either.
Now, Richard Hammond seems to have

11
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,388
accidentally uncovered
what might be a cure.

12
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:03,356
This is a Lexus.

13
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,828
It's called the RX 450h,
and it's everything you'd expect

14
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:12,348
from what Alan Partridge called
the Japanese Mercedes.

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,852
It's quiet, it's well-made, it's got a
lentil matic hybrid engine, all very clever.

16
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:26,364
All things you'd expect from a car company
that has won many awards over the years.

17
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,379
Neatest panel gap consistency in
the executive saloon sector award.

18
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:36,360
And the coveted, that's a nice paint
finish award. Three years running.

19
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:43,354
I think you're getting the picture.
All Lexuses are beautifully made

20
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:49,336
and impeccably engineered to achieve
unmatched levels of dullness.

21
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:52,301
So when they announced recently,

22
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:55,392
"We've made a sports car,"
oh, how we laughed in the office!

23
00:01:57,344 --> 00:02:00,380
Right up until the moment we saw it.

24
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah... Egg on face.

25
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:20,368
Foot in mouth. Humble pie,
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

26
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:30,341
It's called the LFA.

27
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:34,886
Despite being a Lexus, it
doesn't have many Lexussy features.

28
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,361
There's no eat your greens
hybrid hiding under the bonnet.

29
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:44,364
There's no golf clubs hiding in
the boot. It's even got a spoiler.

30
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,336
It's the real deal.

31
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:52,356
And if you're still not convinced
that this thing is a supercar,

32
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:55,360
then let me give you
some nerdy-licious numbers.

33
00:02:56,364 --> 00:03:00,309
552 horse power.

34
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:04,384
Same as the Gallardo.
0 to 60, 3.7 seconds.

35
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,325
Same as a Ferrari 599.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,304
Top speed, 202 mph. That's
faster than an Aston Martin DBS.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,324
OK, I think what I need to do here
is just find out how that works.

38
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,304
Stop.

39
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,364
Sport.

40
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,891
Ooh, yeah!

41
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:28,153
That I like.

42
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,250
ENGINE REVS

43
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:32,312
And go!

44
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:42,332
Woah... that's... explosive!

45
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:45,328
It's immediate.

46
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:52,308
There's no waiting for a second.
It is just stop, wham, going!

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,328
150.

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,308
170.

49
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:07,336
That's really quite a fast car.

50
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:13,380
Now, this being a Lexus, you might
expected to be not just a supercar,

51
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:18,324
but a supercar full of
immense attention to detail.

52
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,309
You'd be right.

53
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:25,340
4.8 litre V10, and yet somehow the
Lexus boffins have managed to make it

54
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,847
only the size of a V8, and as light
as a V6.

55
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:32,103
But that's not the most
amazing thing about it.

56
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,324
No, the most amazing
thing is the way it revs.

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,297
The engine is so lively,

58
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:44,344
they've had to fit this computer
game style virtual rev counter.

59
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:50,362
Because a normal analogue rev counter
can't keep pace

60
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:53,392
with how quickly
this thing gains and loses revs.

61
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:01,281
And then there's the beautifully
nerdy flappy paddle gear change.

62
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:07,348
The paddle to change up is lighter to
use than the paddle to change down.

63
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:10,316
Just so you know you're
going in the right direction.

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,341
HE LAUGHS

65
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:16,328
Amazing stuff from a company that
has never built a supercar before.

66
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,316
Which is why they took their
sweet time over this one.

67
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,349
Nine years in fact.

68
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:29,305
At first, the body
was made of aluminium.

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,317
Then, after years of work,
it was deemed too heavy,

70
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:38,300
so it was scrapped and they began
all over again, using carbon fibre.

71
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:41,345
Lightness was an obsession.

72
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,300
The steering wheel, for example,
is also made of carbon fibre.

73
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:51,849
The pedals are milled from a single
piece of aluminium.

74
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,364
And even the complex Lexus
stereo has been a on the Atkins.

75
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:02,293
Geekiness is everywhere here.

76
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,300
These mirrors are specially
shaped so they

77
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:06,337
funnel air
into these air intakes.

78
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:09,338
The designers were so obsessed with
good handling,

79
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:12,269
that even the water bottle for the
windscreen washers

80
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,808
is buried somewhere deep down there,
next to the petrol tank, to try and

81
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:19,312
keep as much of the weight as low as
possible and inside the wheelbase.

82
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,297
Just like an F1 car.

83
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:23,265
Don't be fooled by this gap.

84
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,308
That's not shoddy build quality,
that's a specially designed intake.

85
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:34,376
So, it's definitely a Lexus, and it
definitely looks like a supercar.

86
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:38,320
The question is,
does it feel like one?

87
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,878
It's lively...

88
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:44,380
TYRES SCREECH

89
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:50,356
The brakes are ferocious. After caning it
around this track, no sign of getting tired.

90
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,332
There's an initial lead from the
front end. It's quite a soft feeling.

91
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,277
The thing just wallows in,

92
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:04,332
and you can give it a boot-full with
the rear end.

93
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,396
In!

94
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,832
HE LAUGHS

95
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,308
TYRES SCREECH

96
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:14,293
Oh, no.

97
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:15,368
TYRES SCREECH

98
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,368
Oh, God.

99
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:25,364
Get it wrong and it takes absolutely
no prisoners. It just spits you out.

100
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,320
Get it right though, and you'll be
laughing.

101
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,384
Oh, yes! There you go!

102
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,376
HE LAUGHS

103
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:03,380
There we are. What a turn-up
from the librarian of the car world.

104
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:06,308
Which brings me to the
obvious question...

105
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:09,308
Would one buy one?

106
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:14,344
That all depends how much it costs.

107
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,265
L50,000, oh, yes!

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,336
L100,000, yeah. L150,000? Well, it's
expensive, but it'll be exclusive.

109
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:29,360
As it happens, the LFA
doesn't cost L150,000. No.

110
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:33,332
The LFA costs L340,000.

111
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:42,858
That's 130,000 more
than a Ferrari 599.

112
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:47,122
For a car
that's no faster than a 599.

113
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:51,317
And you know what?
Even at that price,

114
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:54,396
Lexus won't make
any money on each one they sell.

115
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,349
What this car is,
is an engineer's wet dream.

116
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:07,396
It's a brilliant creation,
and praise the Lord it exists.

117
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:12,376
But price wise,
it's on a different planet.

118
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,309
And there's another slight issue.

119
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:19,332
At the end of the day, and here
it is, the actual end of the day,

120
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,855
yes, I'm in the Lexus. Oh, God.

121
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,309
I can never get away from that.

122
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:29,372
"Will the owner of a
L340,000 LEXUS move it?"

123
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,399
That's me. Sorry.

124
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,357
It just doesn't...

125
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:36,328
It's a Lexus. It just is.

126
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:44,277
APPLAUSE

127
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:49,368
I'm baffled. I'm more baffled than
I've ever been.

128
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:54,333
Hammond, does this car,
does it do 1158 mph?

129
00:09:54,368 --> 00:10:00,308
Yes. Really? No. So, it isn't sixtimes faster than a Nissan GTR?

130
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,285
No. But it costs six times more?

131
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,328
Yeah, it does. Why? Well, it's made
of exotic materials.

132
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,849
It needs to be!
It needs to be made out of myrrh!

133
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:10,301
Is this windscreen wipermade out of saffron? No.

134
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:15,336
But there's a lot of carbon fibre.
Hammond, my bog seat at homeis made out of carbon fibre.

135
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:18,345
It didn't cost 340,000 quid.

136
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,297
Honestly, I just don't
understand this car.

137
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:25,304
Hopefully, our tame racing driver
will be able to make sense of it.

138
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,297
Some say

139
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:31,396
that he has to take his shoes off
with an Allen key.

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,340
And that his new year's resolution
is to eat fewer mice.

141
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:43,313
All we know is,
he's called The Stig.

142
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:46,344
And he's off!
It's wet out there, yet again.

143
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,353
Thank you, Copenhagen!

144
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:53,348
Let's see how the confusing and
expensive Lexus copes in these conditions.

145
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:54,341
Here he comes...

146
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:58,328
Look at that, through the first
corner. Rocking up a bit there.

147
00:10:58,363 --> 00:11:00,304
A little bit of
over steer on the way out.

148
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,316
CHAS AND DAVE SONG PLAYS

149
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,361
Stig, still enjoying a cockney
knees-up,

150
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:11,340
which is strange because
his knees are on his face.

151
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,881
There's Chicago, a
little bit more over steer.

152
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,644
How is it going to cope
on a moist hammerhead?

153
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,372
Will that
clever weight distribution help?

154
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:22,357
Running a bit wide, a bit slithery.

155
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:27,348
You can hear he's having to use the throttle
very gingerly as he gets out of there.

156
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,300
Right, now he can
really mash his paw down.

157
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:42,329
This thing sounds like
an old F1 car.

158
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:46,364
Let's hope it's not using know-how from
the Toyota team, or it'll be rubbish.

159
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,383
Two corners left, spearing
into the second to last one.

160
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,368
Just a flash of corrective lock.
Gambon, that's clean.

161
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:56,372
And across the line.

162
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,325
Do you have the time? I do.

163
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,357
It did it in 1:22.8,
which puts it there.

164
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,388
But critically, I've got to write
on there that it's wet, very wet.

165
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,345
That's the fastest wet lapwe've ever had. By a long way.

166
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,364
That next one is Lambo Gallardo.
The Gallardo, there. Look at that!

167
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,360
Three seconds a lap faster
for three times the price!

168
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,309
It's a bargain!

169
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,368
At the beginning of every year,
the BBC gives us a big lump of money

170
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:30,855
and tells us to go away
and make 14 programmes.

171
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,308
What we do is we divide that
lump of money by 14,

172
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:37,300
and that gives us
the budget for every show.

173
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,297
It's simple!
Unfortunately, and I don't

174
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:42,376
know how this happened, we've
made a complete Horlicks of it.

175
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,333
Which meant that when we got
to make this show, we had,

176
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:49,328
and I'm not joking, I'm not making
this up, almost no money at all.

177
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:53,333
No. And you didn't actually thehelp with your Lexus film? Why?

178
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:57,384
It had a space ship in it. It wasn't actually there
when I filmed it. Was it?

179
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,360
So, it was added? Yeah. And that's
cheaper than just using

180
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,344
a real space ship.
I don't think it is.

181
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,277
That stuff costs a bloody fortune.

182
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:07,328
We know that now the bill has come
in. I'm sorry, I got carried away.

183
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,349
Listen, stop bickering you two.

184
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:14,356
We now have to do the news and that's impossible,
because it's not the week you think it is.

185
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:20,352
It's actually December, December 9th.
It really is. We had the studiobooked for today,

186
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:24,269
and we've had to use it even
though we know you're in 2010.

187
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,321
This fly flying around here has
actually died by the time you watch this.

188
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:34,324
The real problem is obviously, between now and when
you're watching this, anything could have happened.

189
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:38,300
Somebody could have invented a car
that I don't know, runs on jelly.

190
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,336
We might have declared
war with France...

191
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,361
HE LAUGHS

192
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:45,324
Instead of the news, what we're
going to do, we're going to take

193
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,304
a look ahead to some cars
that are coming out

194
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,317
this year. This year. This year. Yes!

195
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:56,324
Lots of them, in fact. There's the new Jaguar
XJ, we're very much looking forward to that.

196
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:59,281
The Aston Martin 177,
the million-pound Aston.

197
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:03,320
But the one that really caught my
eye is this, it's the Honda CR-V,

198
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,364
and I think you'll agree it
looks absolutely fantastic.

199
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,301
However, I then read the bumpf.

200
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:14,324
It has a 1.5 litre engine, and a
boot full of lithium ion batteries.

201
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,349
That's not a bloody hybrid, is it?

202
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:21,348
Yes. You see what they've done here,
this is organic tofu,

203
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:25,340
dressed up as
a juicy steak. But don't be fooled.

204
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,301
Don't be fooled, people. James?

205
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:34,285
A car I'm really looking forward
to is the new Saab 95, here it is.

206
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,380
Unless of course Saab wentbust in the last two weeks... Which is a real possibility!

207
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,305
Seriously, James, really...

208
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,305
Do this two ways, we will edit it. Yeah. Cover yourself.

209
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,316
A car I'm really looking forward to
is the new Saab 95. There it is.

210
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:52,372
A car I was looking forward to was
the new Saab 95.

211
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,285
LAUGHTER

212
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,336
That's what it was going to look
like. They said... They say...

213
00:14:57,371 --> 00:15:00,285
What? They said. Oh, yes. They say,

214
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,352
or said, that it's
based on a jet fighter,

215
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:05,349
or was, but it isn't wasn't.

216
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:09,281
LAUGHTER
It's actually based on a Vauxhall.

217
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:12,352
You can or could get three engines,
maybe you could get three engines.

218
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:15,360
The best of which
was or is a 2.8 litre V6.

219
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:17,273
That will start at about L25,000.

220
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:22,289
It looks great.
James, why haven't you got a Saab?Because they've gone bust.

221
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:29,332
But if they haven't, then it is a very good
question because I do actually quite like a Saab.

222
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,340
They are a little bit alternative
and tend to be driven by quite

223
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,392
interesting people. That's
why he got hasn't got one then!

224
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:36,329
HE LAUGHS

225
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:42,300
Here's a car I'm looking forward to.
911 Turbo Cabriolet.

226
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,313
What?! Hammond, sorry!

227
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:48,356
It's twin turbos, seven speed double
clutch gearbox, flappy paddles.

228
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,353
I want one.

229
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:53,852
How old are you?

230
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,281
39. And 361 days.

231
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:00,328
Technically, yeah.
You know what that means, don't you?

232
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:03,305
The mid-life crisis is arriving.

233
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,392
Soon you'll be growing your hair,
whitening your teeth...

234
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:11,277
Have you bought a
Harley-Davidson recently?

235
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:16,356
Yes. Have you? All right, it's
happening! I agree!

236
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,297
I quite like the look of this.
This is the Citroen DS3.

237
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:24,396
That's going to be about L12,000.
It's sort of the size of a Mini.

238
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,289
Can I tell you the biggest problem
with this car?

239
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:30,300
When we buy cars - and we all do
this whether we like it or not -

240
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,819
we tend to think most of all about
what it will be worth

241
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:35,269
when we come to sell it, which is
perfectly reasonable.

242
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:39,304
The reason why we don't buy orange
and lime green cars is you think,

243
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,333
I won't be able to sell it in a
couple of years,

244
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,362
I'll get the grey one. I think
that's what will happen with this

245
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:47,356
because you will look at it and go,
I really like this, but what if

246
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,357
nobody else does and I won't be able
to sell it.

247
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:52,325
Or what if it's as out of date as
Roger Moore's safari suit

248
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,277
when he was James Bond? That's a
shame because right now it looks great.

249
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:02,320
It looks fantastic. I think that's one of the
best-looking cars that will be coming out next year.

250
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,349
No, you got it... No, this year.

251
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:10,332
This BLEEP year! Right, stop!Oh, God!

252
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:14,320
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Oh, God!

253
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:21,316
Let's move, on because this is another car I'm really looking forward to. It's this
- 911 GT3RS.

254
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,301
Are you only
looking forward to 911s?

255
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:28,309
I am having a mid-life crisis, it's
my right. I think that's a great car.

256
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:32,866
Lighter, faster. I think it wouldhave been OK when you were in your30s, Hammond.

257
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:37,388
I think it's bright and fun and people
will look at it and think I'm young in it.

258
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:42,300
It's just a Beetle. It was designed
by Hitler and it's a Beetle.

259
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,337
Yes, it was.

260
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:46,354
It wasn't.
Was.

261
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,301
Who says it was?

262
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,346
Was it designed by Hitler?Yes.

263
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,321
You remember, you were here.

264
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:55,828
At least I'm looking forward
to something this year.

265
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:59,300
You're just saying everything
is going to be terrible.

266
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:00,333
Not everything.

267
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:03,356
One car has caught my eye.

268
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,273
Ferrari 458.

269
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:10,344
This is the replacement for the 430.

270
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:12,357
Hmmm. What do you mean - hmmm?

271
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:17,384
I already think the Ferrari F430 is
the best car in the world.

272
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,348
It makes my little fizzy...
My rude thing...

273
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,372
I guarantee this is going to
be a lot better than a 430.

274
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:31,293
If that's true it could explode.

275
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,281
Does anybody else suddenly feel sick?

276
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:36,824
Yes. I don't want to see your
fizzy rude penis blowing up...

277
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:40,297
No, no, arrrgh! Let's just move on!
I don't want to know!

278
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:46,368
The fact of the matter is this. This has got a lot
more tech than a 430. It's a lot lighter than a 430.

279
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:50,312
I think the 430 has
about 480 horsepower.

280
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:52,333
This has 562.

281
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:56,312
The thing I love about it most of
all is that it's the first Ferrari

282
00:18:56,347 --> 00:19:02,384
since 1975 that actually looks
properly pretty. I'm just

283
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:04,345
completely bowled over by it.

284
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,356
Actually, we probably won't be
allowed to drive Ferraris because

285
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:13,273
a couple of weeks ago,
before Christmas...

286
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:19,273
Nice one. A big meetingin Copenhagen and many,many things were resolved there.

287
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:24,340
One of them - I'm pretty certain - will be
that we have to get out of our cars more often.

288
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,336
And that brings us
on to something we have over here.

289
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,269
In this plastic suitcase

290
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:34,380
is a folding the allegedly assisted
bicycle. It's called the Gocycle.

291
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:38,387
I think you'll find
it's called the Go Cycle.

292
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:42,325
Not the Gocycle, you idiot. That
says Gocycle.

293
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:50,340
Never mind. It costs L1200
and, as you can see, it is...

294
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,352
Oh.

295
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:59,336
I thought it was a folding bicycle. It's
a bloody bag full of bicycle components.

296
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:02,861
Have I got to build it? Would you
like me to give you a hand with it?

297
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:06,352
That's the most terrifying thing
Jeremy Clarkson can say to anyone.

298
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:09,333
I wonder if maybe you
two should go away.

299
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:14,320
Good idea, because this is not
the only post Copenhagen solution.

300
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,321
Hammond, what have you got here?I have this.

301
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:20,344
What it is is a skateboard for people
who can't be bothered to skateboard.

302
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:22,285
I'll get it all started up because

303
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,352
it is electrically powered.
This device controls your speed.

304
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,329
Why don't you give that
to me and I'll control it.

305
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:31,336
No, that's the most terrifying
thing you can possibly say.

306
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,304
Are you really going to ride that?Yes, I am.

307
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,321
Apparently this has a curve system.

308
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:38,277
Though how something can have
regenerative braking

309
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:43,392
when I can't see how the brakes
work I don't know - but it works!

310
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:46,313
This is much better.

311
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:51,372
It was designed by a man who wanted something
that would combine his love of cross-country skiing

312
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:55,348
and his love of cycling, and
then converted to run on batteries,

313
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:58,325
by someone who didn't
like either of those things.

314
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,348
It is quite pricey, L1,600, around about the
same as in 19995 Series BMW, but it is quite fast.

315
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:09,300
Top speed is 15mph.

316
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:14,838
Yeah, mine is faster.
I promise you this is quicker.

317
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,300
Race. Race?! Come on.
Anyone want to see a race? Yeah!

318
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,277
Back to here, lap of the studio.

319
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:27,344
3, 2, 1- go. I've got
wheelspin, a lot of wheelspin.

320
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:35,396
Come on, you stupid thing!I'm a 40-year-old man
taking up skateboarding.

321
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:37,368
I've got grip, I've got grip!

322
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,364
I've hit the wall!

323
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,380
James, are you still working on that
thing? Yes. Want to go on this?

324
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:51,360
No. It's great once you'vegot the hang of it. No.

325
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,293
Suit yourself.
I'm a bit bored with this.

326
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:57,337
I'm going to go and introduced
Jeremy's film on the BMW X6.

327
00:21:57,372 --> 00:22:02,364
Normally he would go and drive it in a
sewer or blow it up or something like that.

328
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:07,348
Unfortunately, Richard Hammond
spent most of what we have left

329
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,320
on his stupid... ARGH!

330
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,361
Sorry.

331
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:22,376
Unfortunately, Richard Hammond, who
has just broken our Christmas tree,

332
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:26,337
spent most of what we had left
on his stupid Lexus film.

333
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:33,360
Our instructions to Jeremy were very
specific. Keep it cheap and simple.

334
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:37,392
Right. One simple film coming up.

335
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:40,875
The X6 is BMW's attempt

336
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,143
to make a car which looks,

337
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:47,341
and goes, like a coupe,

338
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:52,392
but has a tall driving position
and a bit of off-road ability.

339
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:59,265
They call it
a Sports Activity Vehicle.

340
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,360
It's available with a choice of two
petrol engines, both of which

341
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:07,388
will attract the new L950
showroom tax...

342
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:10,309
And two diesels which won't.

343
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:12,349
In the cabin,
there is space for four.

344
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:19,376
But those in the back will be awfully
cramped due to the sloping roof line.

345
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,265
Inside it's all typical BMW,

346
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,380
except for this rather clever split
opening glove box lid.

347
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:29,321
It works well here.

348
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:31,392
But what if
you're the wrong way up?

349
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:41,297
To find out I went to Sydney,
which is in Australia.

350
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:48,392
Obviously everything here is upside-down and yet
it still works beautifully. That is impressive.

351
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,320
So...

352
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:55,321
How does the X6 drive?

353
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:58,333
In many ways, it's quite annoying.

354
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:02,336
You can't see out of the back very
well and it's got the iDrive system

355
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:04,380
which can only be operated
if you are 14.

356
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:08,333
No.

357
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:11,309
I don't know what any of that means.

358
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:16,344
Satellite navigation. You are coming up to a
complicated junction, trying to see which way it is.

359
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:21,300
You think it's a bit chilly, I'll just ease
the temperature up and the screen has gone!

360
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,300
I don't know which way to
go because...

361
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,396
Why are you telling me that?!

362
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:29,301
Then there's the gear lever.

363
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:34,356
It's on back-to-front cos if you
want to change down you push it away.

364
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,357
If you want to change up
you pull it towards you.

365
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:40,372
There's no point resorting to the paddles on
the steering wheel as unlike in a normal car,

366
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:46,361
where one change is down and one change
is up, in this they both do the same thing.

367
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:52,316
And what was the boss of BMW doing when
all the clowns in the laptop department

368
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:54,337
were coming up with this rubbish?

369
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:58,364
I can only assume she was
in a motel with a Swiss spy.

370
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:03,285
That would be preposterous!

371
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,336
Still, for a big, tall
car it's not bad in bends.

372
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:11,837
Unfortunately, to make it not bad,

373
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:15,269
they have had to put quite a lot

374
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:18,380
of beef and granite
in the suspension.

375
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:22,868
In Britain that makes it
really quite uncomfortable.

376
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:27,352
But what about countries
where the roads are smooth?

377
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:30,384
To find out, I went to Spain.

378
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,340
No, it's uncomfortable here as well.

379
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:56,356
The fact is this - it would be more
comfortable if it weren't so tall.

380
00:25:56,391 --> 00:26:01,265
There's a similar problem
with the performance.

381
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,305
Yes, the twin-turbo three litre
diesel that I've got in this

382
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,336
particular model will get me from 0
- 60 in seven seconds, and that's not bad.

383
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:14,352
But how much faster and how much
more economical would it have been

384
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:17,328
if the body wasn't so enormous?

385
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:22,297
You'd imagine that the advantages

386
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:28,328
of that big, high riding body would
become clear in the countryside.

387
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:31,333
But there's no low-range gearbox,

388
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:38,356
there's no ride-high control and
there's no locking differentials.

389
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:47,316
It doesn't take long for those
omissions to have an effect.

390
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:58,297
You see,

391
00:26:58,332 --> 00:27:01,304
that really says a lot, doesn't it?

392
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:03,281
The only way round this

393
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:07,376
is to get out and complete
your journey on foot.

394
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:13,392
That's the handbrake on and in park.

395
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:18,357
Help!

396
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:22,380
I'm still going down the hill.

397
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:29,285
Maybe it can handle snow
a bit better.

398
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,336
To find out I went to the
highest ski resort in the Alps.

399
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,301
No.

400
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:55,337
It can't.

401
00:27:55,372 --> 00:28:01,352
So it's too focused on being a
road car to be any good off-road.

402
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:04,396
And it's too focused
on being tall and heavy

403
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:08,301
to be any good on the road either.

404
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:11,361
And that, I'm afraid,
is far from the end of the story.

405
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:17,332
You see, the X6 was conceived at a time when we
all thought the banks knew what they were doing.

406
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:22,392
But it went on sale moments after
we discovered they didn't.

407
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:29,356
And, I'm sorry, but in a recession a
car like this just looks ridiculous.

408
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:37,364
To explain what I'm on about
I went in search of a metaphor.

409
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,320
And, inevitably,
that led me to Hong Kong.

410
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:56,345
You see that skyscraper,
the one Batman jumped off?

411
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,308
It's not particularly beautiful,
it's not particularly useful.

412
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:04,363
It was built by a world for a world

413
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,384
that doesn't really exist any more.

414
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:09,392
Remind you of anything?

415
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:16,368
To sum up, the Range Rover
is a much better all-rounder.

416
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:22,289
Which is why we use them
as camera tracking cars.

417
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:29,356
The X6 is too cramped, too complicated
and, with prices starting at L42,000,

418
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:31,329
too expensive as well!

419
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:39,332
Then you're going to need at least L1,500 a
year to run it, not including depreciation.

420
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:45,300
And I think I'd rather spend that
sort of money on a Caribbean holiday.

421
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,356
To find out, I went to Barbados.

422
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,328
I think a bit more research.

423
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:18,348
No. This is definitely better -
definitely.

424
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:25,840
APPLAUSE
Thank you very much.

425
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:29,308
I pride myself on my thoroughness.

426
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:31,313
What? Excuse me.

427
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:35,265
What?You are an apocalyptic dingleberry.

428
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,810
Why? You went to the Alps. Yes.
You went to Spain. Yes.

429
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:42,320
You went to Australia to see
if the glove box works. Yes.

430
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:44,293
You went to Barbados. Yes. You went to...

431
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:48,340
Hong Kong. That was just for astupid metaphor. Yes, I did do that.

432
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,273
You're a bigger idiot
than Richard Hammond.

433
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,384
You know what it means? What? What
it meant was there was virtually

434
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,297
no money left for my film,
which you can see later.

435
00:30:58,332 --> 00:31:00,325
I promise I didn't do
it deliberately. Really?!

436
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,273
It's now time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

437
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:09,356
Now, because of the budget issues this
week, we did have a bit of a problem.

438
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:14,857
Tom Cruise, for example,
was going to charge us L150.

439
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:20,289
Bonio out of U2 wanted
175 quid to come over here.

440
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:24,372
So, would you please welcome
a former tramp? Seasick Steve.

441
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:27,368
APPLAUSE

442
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:37,380
Sorry about this. How are you? Have a seat.
We have an accident every year and there it is.

443
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:43,293
I should explain to those of you who
are thinking and the tramp is who?

444
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:49,368
This guy is a musical sensation. I mean Brit
nominee, when was it, last year? Glastonbury.

445
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:55,360
My wife queued up for five daysto come and see that show you did. I'm sorry.

446
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:59,289
You have become this
amazing sensation.

447
00:31:59,324 --> 00:32:02,368
The instruments you play aren't
exactly conventional instruments.

448
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:05,305
I mean, your guitar, for example.

449
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,337
I don't play the guitar but I know
they have six strings. Yours doesn't.

450
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:15,352
I've got some that have got one string but that's
just a plank of wood with a string nailed on it.

451
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:17,341
That's called a diddlybo.

452
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:23,328
I've got this other guitar that's got three strings
that I got from a friend of mine in Mississippi.

453
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:25,281
He found it at a junk store.

454
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:30,308
I brought it home and my wife looked at that
guitar and goes, "That's going to make you famous. "

455
00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:35,368
And it has! Because, one day, a little known
broadcasting organisation called the BBC

456
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:38,360
called up and said, "Could you
come on the Jools Holland Show?"

457
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:42,265
I didn't even know
what Jools Holland was.

458
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,316
Just so that people can understand
the noise that Steve can make out of

459
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:49,320
this three-string guitar,
just have a listen to this.

460
00:32:53,392 --> 00:32:56,388
# The dog house
Dog house

461
00:32:56,423 --> 00:33:02,308
# Sing the dog house

462
00:33:04,312 --> 00:33:06,285
# Sing the dog house

463
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,340
# Sing the dog house... #

464
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,380
I had to just do that so you could just hear
that this... Where does that voice come from?

465
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:19,861
Obviously your mouth.

466
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:22,273
Drinking? Drinking.

467
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:25,361
So your first hit album, I should
say, it was called

468
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:30,358
I Started Out With Nothing And
I've Still Got Most Of It Left.

469
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:35,320
Yes. Which I think is the best
album title literally of all time.

470
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,349
The new one's called...?A Man From Another Time.

471
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:41,868
Again, pretty apt. We're going to
get on to this name - Seasick Steve.

472
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:46,352
Forgive me for asking. You must have
been asked a million times but why?

473
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:49,341
I just get sick on boats.

474
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:55,301
Like real sick. I don't go out
on the boats too much.

475
00:33:55,336 --> 00:34:00,364
I went on a ferry boat from Norway to
Denmark and threw up all night long.

476
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,340
The next morning, someone thought
it was funny. You're Seasick Steve!

477
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,309
And that stuck? Yeah, sort of.

478
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,336
You may be Seasick Steve but you can't be Carsick
Steve because what you probably don't realise,

479
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:14,325
we haven't got to this bit,
we've got a serious car man here.

480
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,388
How many cars have you ownedover the years? I try to count. I know it's in the hundreds.

481
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:23,281
In America, cars are real cheap.

482
00:34:23,316 --> 00:34:28,341
You can buy a late '30s,
early '40s car for 50 bucks.

483
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:31,368
So I'd buy it for 50 and drive it
for two or three weeks until it died

484
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,360
and leave it on the end of the road
and then go and get another one.

485
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:37,265
They were all over.

486
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,325
What was the favourite
from this list of hundreds?

487
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,344
My favourite truly is a car I have
right now which I've had for a while.

488
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,277
It's a '51 Chevy station wagon.

489
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:50,329
It's just a complete beat-up car butit runs good. Where is that now?

490
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:56,332
It's actually over here. I've got
it over here now. You keep it in theUK? Yeah, I've got it over here.

491
00:34:56,367 --> 00:35:00,332
I've got that and a tractor. You've
got to do a bit of farming then?

492
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:04,309
I don't care about the farming
part but I like ploughing.

493
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:07,854
So, presumably, I was listening
to a comedian on the radio the other

494
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,604
day talking about the importance
and reliability of getting to gigs.

495
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,989
Yeah. You don't use the Chevy.
Because presumably it's, "I'm sorry,

496
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:18,340
"Seasick Steve can't appear tonight
because his Chevy's broken down. "

497
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:22,360
I've got one of those big Mercedes
vans, like a big white one.

498
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:25,895
It's got like a wood burning
stove and fishing gear.

499
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,361
It's got like a log cabin inside.
It's real nice.

500
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:34,392
There's all these lines of those big tour
buses and then my old beat-up van in the middle.

501
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:37,285
Seasick Steve's arrived.

502
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,309
They saw me coming a long way away.

503
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:43,300
So, you've not called
the eco-bug then? What's that?

504
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,273
It was a thing in Copenhagen.

505
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:50,316
You've got to have a Toyota Prius
now - a hybrid. No, thanks.

506
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:54,324
My boy told me I could drive
my '51 Chevy the rest of my life,

507
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,329
and all the life I've had before,

508
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:59,388
and not make as much pollution as
one of them new cars costs to make.

509
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:03,392
I'll stick with the '51 Chevy,
thank you. Yes, good man.

510
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:10,317
That's the ticket.
One of the things I noticed,

511
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:16,304
looking back through the list of the hundreds of cars
you've owned, there's MGs, S-type Jag, E-type Jag.

512
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:20,297
You do like British cars. Yeah.
Why? I like the way...

513
00:36:20,332 --> 00:36:24,392
Not all of them but I like the way they smell inside them old ones
- the leather and everything.

514
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:28,348
What is a Morris Minor doing in
there? That is Britain's Beetle.

515
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:34,273
I was up in Liverpool playing
up there a few years back.

516
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:38,346
I met this guy who had, I think a '55 split window. An early one.

517
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:42,384
He asked me if I wanted to buy it. I said, yeah. Punch him, punch him!

518
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:47,281
My friend, he has Morris Minors.

519
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:53,300
He thought it would be real funny to
make me a guitar out of Morris Minors.

520
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:55,269
Seriously?These are two Morris Minor hubcaps.

521
00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:58,364
That's the best use I've ever seen for anything
on a Morris Minor. Go on, play it! Let's hear it.

522
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:03,324
So, now you can have something goodto say about a Morris Minor. Yeah.

523
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,345
Maybe not.

524
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,317
Are you going to give us a tune?

525
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:08,372
No, I'm not going to give you a
tune, I'm going to make a noise.

526
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,357
Morris Minor.

527
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,313
I'm startled. A Morris Minor noise.

528
00:37:19,348 --> 00:37:23,308
That's the best use
of a Morris Minor ever.

529
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:24,349
So, OK, the car man.

530
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:28,372
You came down here and drove possibly the
most modern car you've ever driven then.

531
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:33,384
My biggest problem is the shifter'son the wrong side. Correct side.

532
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:37,353
I kept rolling the window down.

533
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,349
But it is. I have to say that Lacetti
is getting a bit knackered now.

534
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:47,320
I didn't help at all. I apologise. No, we're thinking of gettinga new car for the next series.

535
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:49,867
You would be the last person
ever to go on the board.

536
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:52,611
I'm probably be the last
person on the board, too.

537
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,320
Like a double whammy!Who'd like to see Seasick's lap?

538
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:59,300
Yes!
Let's have a look how it went.

539
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:02,372
I'm embarrassed now.

540
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:07,368
Now, I'm trying to remember
all the things Stig told me.

541
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:09,875
I can hardly remember...

542
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,313
What day is it actually?

543
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:18,364
I've no idea. That is a beard in a car and that it
is tidy line cutting the corner.

544
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:21,269
That's OK. A bit damp.

545
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:24,269
A lot of under steer there.

546
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:28,372
You can make a lot of noise but you ain't
going very fast when you make the noise.

547
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:32,293
That's true.
We've got more understeer here. Yes.

548
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:36,304
Quite a lot through there.
That's slowing you down a bit.

549
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:38,281
The radio came on.

550
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,392
I don't want to hear no radio.

551
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:43,321
I'm busy racing, dude.

552
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:46,301
Dipping nicely into Hammerhead.

553
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:51,344
This looks like a good line. Yes,
looking very tidy on the way in.

554
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,344
And on the way out?

555
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:55,293
Very nice.

556
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:57,392
This is embarrassing. No, it isn't. This gear change was.

557
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:59,325
That's the worst.

558
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:06,312
This is the most fun I've probably ever had in my
whole life and that's probably kind of pathetic.

559
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,388
Let's have a look through here. Let's
see if you've got to any gentleman's...

560
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:14,875
This car...

561
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,293
is amazing.

562
00:39:17,328 --> 00:39:19,353
Fast - that is quick.

563
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:21,892
Coming into the
second to last corner.

564
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:24,361
Don't go on the grass, it's too wet.

565
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:30,396
You're on the grass a bit there.
Go, go, go! And around Gander.

566
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:32,895
A little bit slow on that one.

567
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,325
Across the line, everybody.

568
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,376
Very well done!
Very well done. Oh, boy!

569
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:49,277
You care, don't you?

570
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:53,360
I really care. I know I let down theside but you got to give it a shot. You gave it a shot.

571
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:57,361
I tried to get points for being a
little older but they didn't go for it.

572
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:01,372
I'd love to cheat here and give you a fast
time but unfortunately it was a slow one.

573
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:07,336
I know that. It wasn't a slow one.
What it was was, ready?

574
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:12,336
One minute and, bearing
in mind it was moist, 51.8.

575
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,388
Which means you go there.

576
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:25,320
You're faster than Tom Jones. That's enough. I'll take that.

577
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:27,281
That's good enough for me.

578
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:31,348
And he was in the dry.
You're faster than Helen Mirren...

579
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:33,337
Don't rub it in no more.

580
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:38,336
That's kind of it. Steve,
this has been an absolute joy.

581
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:41,305
A 100% pleasure for me. 100%.

582
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,348
Ladies and gentlemen, Seasick Steve. Thank you very much.

583
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:51,336
Thank you so much. Great music.

584
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:59,269
Right. It is now time
for me to present my film.

585
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:02,360
And, for reasons that I am sure
by now are abundantly clear,

586
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:06,380
it's about a medium-sized
Vauxhall and a nice old lady.

587
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:12,320
Right, here we go.
A lengthy yet hopefully interesting

588
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:15,345
and value-for-money film
about a Vauxhall.

589
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:21,308
If you're a proper car bore, you will
know that anything wearing the VXR badge,

590
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:22,353
I have one here
on the steering wheel,

591
00:41:22,388 --> 00:41:27,328
is part of Vauxhall's
Turbo Nutter ASBO range.

592
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,316
And so it turns out.

593
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:38,324
The engine, for example,
is a turbo-charged 2.8 litre V6.

594
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:42,312
Which produces
a meaty 321 horse power.

595
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:47,285
That's a few horse power short of
our old track favourite, the VXR8,

596
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,388
but, nevertheless, this executive-style
car is good for 60 in under 6 seconds.

597
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:57,269
If it didn't have
the hand of nannying,

598
00:41:57,304 --> 00:42:01,316
an electronic speed limiter,
it would do 170 miles an hour.

599
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:03,368
It does shift, this thing.

600
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:08,380
And the performance modifications
don't stop with the engine.

601
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:12,368
321 horse power is asking
a lot of front-wheel drive.

602
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:15,285
This version has four-wheel drive

603
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,364
to keep everything nice and calm
and civilised and under control.

604
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:21,391
It also has a very clever
front suspension,

605
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:24,384
very similar to the one
used on the Focus RS,

606
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,356
which, as we know, is very good.

607
00:42:28,384 --> 00:42:35,368
Also, the suspension has been lowered by 10mm
and you can choose from different driver settings.

608
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:39,269
At the moment I'm in normal mode,
which is the one I like,

609
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:44,304
but if I press this button, "sport"
- now the suspension is firmed up a little bit.

610
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,301
Can I feel that? Yes.

611
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:50,269
But lots of cars
have a sport button.

612
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:53,380
The insignia, however, has
another one that goes up to 11.

613
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:57,364
This one which is marked "VXR".

614
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,293
Press that and the
suspension gets even harder.

615
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:11,324
The throttle response is sharpened up a bit but,
most importantly, the instruments become red!

616
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,349
I mean, that's just fantastic.

617
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:18,300
It's a fire-breathing monster
with a spine of iron.

618
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:25,273
And the prize for all
this VXR-ishness?

619
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:28,269
Just over L30,000,
which, in Top Gear maths,

620
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:33,332
where we tend to round things up a bit,
makes it actually pretty good value.

621
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:39,372
Because the equivalent Audi S4
would be nearly L5,000 more.

622
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:42,364
And that's all you really
need to know about it.

623
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:45,300
But, obviously,
I have to keep going.

624
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:53,352
So I will, by explaining that the
insignia VXR is surprisingly restrained,

625
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:55,348
both to look at and to sit in.

626
00:43:57,324 --> 00:44:01,273
It is, therefore,
the first de-chavved VXR.

627
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:06,320
The first fast Vauxhall that would know
which way round a baseball cap goes.

628
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:12,293
This is actually a very
civilised car. It's very quiet.

629
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:18,304
The ride is very good and yet, without the
VXR button on, it still goes like stink.

630
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:25,336
It's also very spacious and it has a big boot
- and much more equipment than a pricier Audi.

631
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:29,324
And now I really have
run out of things to say.

632
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,289
But rather than go
back to the studio,

633
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:35,352
I'm going to introduce you to
someone I've always wanted to meet.

634
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:38,375
A lady called Margaret Calvert.

635
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,364
And here she is. Hello, Margaret.

636
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:43,277
Hello, James.

637
00:44:43,312 --> 00:44:45,353
You may never have heard
of Margaret but, believe me,

638
00:44:45,388 --> 00:44:50,336
if you are a motorist in Britain, she's one
of the most important people in your life.

639
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:52,337
If it hadn't been for Margaret
and her mates,

640
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:57,368
I would now be going the wrong way or
possibly even having a terrible crash.

641
00:45:00,308 --> 00:45:04,361
You see, Margaret, along with
her colleague Jock Kinneir,

642
00:45:04,396 --> 00:45:10,352
is responsible for creating something special
that we take for granted every single day.

643
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:12,396
The road signs of Britain.

644
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:22,392
I think you've perhaps made me
more important than I really am.

645
00:45:22,427 --> 00:45:24,348
Oh, I doubt it.

646
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:31,285
Margaret's work began in the 1950s,
when car ownership was booming

647
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,816
and the Government, alarmed at the clogged-up
roads, decided to build the first motorways.

648
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:42,312
However, existing road signs were totally
inadequate for the new, high-speed highways.

649
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:46,384
No one designed motorway signs before
because we hadn't had a motorway. Yes.

650
00:45:46,419 --> 00:45:50,367
And the whole job of making that
system of signs clear to the car,

651
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:54,316
which was still a new thing for
most people... The driver, yes.

652
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,281
And at speeds that were still new...

653
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:59,340
That all fell to a man and his
former student from an art college.

654
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,313
They gave you the whole job. Absolutely.

655
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:06,840
We were both on a crash-course
learning curve

656
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:12,297
to come to grips with
designing road signs.

657
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:16,273
It wasn't a fashion thing.
We were designing for permanence.

658
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:20,396
We were designing for something that
wouldn't look dated in 5 or 10 years' time.

659
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:24,313
Margaret explained how
the colour system of our road signs

660
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:28,356
was carefully designed to make words
and numbers as clear as possible

661
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:31,893
at the high speeds motorway-borne
cars could then achieve.

662
00:46:31,928 --> 00:46:35,396
And she and Jock horrified
the signposting establishment

663
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:38,881
by using upper
and lowercase letters,

664
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,630
instead of the accepted
block capitals.

665
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,309
And that's to do
with word recognition.

666
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:48,313
You read a shape, whereas if it's all
in capitals, it takes you longer to read.

667
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:52,368
So you don't have to read it in upper and lower.
You see the shape and you know what it says.

668
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:56,357
Exactly that. So your brain
fills in, you know, the middle bits.

669
00:46:56,392 --> 00:47:01,356
Most people wouldn't realise how involved this is.
They'd think it's just lettering you stick on a sign.

670
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:05,320
Absolutely, yes. And it still works.
It's basically the same system.

671
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:09,353
Margaret's work didn't stop
at motorway signs

672
00:47:09,388 --> 00:47:17,388
because she and Jock then went on to design just about
every other road sign you see in the Highway Code.

673
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:19,887
So you designed
a new type-face... Yes.

674
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:22,317
.. Which became known
as Transport. Yes.

675
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:26,392
And then you had to design the actual
pictures for your warning signs. Yes.

676
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:31,324
That's you, isn't it? That was
actually a very difficult one to do.

677
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,313
The important thing was to
make it look like an action.

678
00:47:34,348 --> 00:47:40,328
That it would really alert you to the possibility
of two children walking across the road,

679
00:47:40,363 --> 00:47:44,336
so hopefully you would try to
save lives by getting that right.

680
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:47,859
The previous sign had
a grammar-school boy

681
00:47:47,894 --> 00:47:51,313
with a satchel
and the girl behind him.

682
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:54,368
And they weren't holding hands
or anything like that.

683
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:57,388
And I just thought that this
is a little bit more caring

684
00:47:57,423 --> 00:47:59,387
and so I switched it round.

685
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:01,317
I based that, actually, on me.

686
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:04,265
I based it on
what I wore as a child.

687
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,269
So is that actually you?It is, actually, yes.

688
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:12,309
At this point, I was starting
to run out of intelligent questions.

689
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:16,308
What do you make of the car? Because
I can't quite make my mind up but...

690
00:48:16,343 --> 00:48:18,321
They always have faces,
don't they? Yes.

691
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:23,316
And I think some kind of look very
shark-like, some look very aggressive.

692
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:26,380
It looks like a car that's
been designed by a committee.

693
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:30,329
And then I ran out of
intelligent things to say.

694
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:35,320
But would you agree with me that it
would look a bit sexier in glasses?

695
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:39,376
That's a very interesting...
I think you're quite unusual.

696
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:46,308
Back on the road, we inevitably came
across one of her most commonly-used signs.

697
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,353
The story I read about you
was that you did that sign

698
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:54,348
and then the joke emerged it was a man struggling
with an umbrella and that joke's been around for years.

699
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:58,340
And that annoyed you and you wished
you'd done it slightly differently?

700
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:01,372
Well, I would have put a shoulder
on it, just. And I'd... Huh?

701
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:04,285
Oh, what, you want me to draw it on?

702
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,384
Yes. No. Come on.
I'm not doing it. I'll do it.

703
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:10,308
But I want you to direct me. OK.

704
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,316
Right, think of drawing a spade.

705
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,357
As if you're drawing a spade, yeah?

706
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:25,380
What do you think?
Well, I think from here,

707
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:27,356
it's sort of, it's wrong.

708
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:34,336
Not only did she not like my drawing, she
didn't find my gear changes very good either.

709
00:49:36,328 --> 00:49:39,348
That was a bit of a... Yes, sorry,
that wasn't very good, was it?

710
00:49:39,383 --> 00:49:41,877
No, that wasn't a good gear. Let's try that again.

711
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,636
Yeah, do that. I was trying
to be clever. Oh, right.

712
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:47,325
Skipping the cogs, so we're
doubling down into second.

713
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,376
Oh, right, yes. Even then, it
was a little bit juddery. Now...

714
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:55,392
Yeah, a bit... Is that better?A bit better. Could be smoother.

715
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:56,361
Sorry.

716
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:59,329
I decided to speed up,

717
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,392
and that didn't work either.

718
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:03,285
Oh my gosh!

719
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,269
Margaret didn't like
this sort of driving.

720
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:11,301
And as we headed for home, plainly,
she decided to get her own back.

721
00:50:11,336 --> 00:50:17,332
Big road sign. It is nice to thinkthat your legacy is spread all overthe country. Well, it is a legacy.

722
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:21,360
I suppose. And that's why I end up
sitting next to people like you.

723
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:23,340
Talking about road signs.

724
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:29,380
Did you put my seat heater onfor a joke? No, I didn't. Is it on?

725
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:43,309
Well done, mate. Good work.
Well done.

726
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:48,356
I have to say, when Margaret came on, it got
better, OK? The thing is though, I have a question.

727
00:50:48,391 --> 00:50:53,368
She really designed all of the road signs of
Britain? Well, her and, what was it, four others?

728
00:50:53,403 --> 00:50:55,317
Four or five people in total, yes.

729
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:59,344
Because I was thinking, if they decided
to change all the road signs now,

730
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:02,304
how many people would
this government employ?

731
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:03,349
A million. It would.

732
00:51:03,384 --> 00:51:08,360
They'd want 5,000 people just to decide what
the little girl on the school sign looked like.

733
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:11,301
Oh yes, should she
have a burka, a turban?

734
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:15,372
And then that man in the "men at
work" sign is clearly a man... Yes!

735
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:17,345
And that's not right.
No. They'd rectify that.

736
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,328
In the modern "men at work" sign there wouldn't
be a man, just be a pile of unused gravel.

737
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:25,265
Just a queue of cars
stopped for no reason.

738
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,384
It's OK, we've filled the time now.
OK. Er, so, let's move on

739
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,337
to the Top Gear award ceremony!

740
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:36,313
Oh, yes. This is the biggie. Oh, yes!

741
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:40,336
It's a big day. It is a biggie. A big day in the calendar.

742
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,313
A big day for us all.

743
00:51:42,348 --> 00:51:45,357
What are you doing? What... What? Just that.

744
00:51:45,392 --> 00:51:49,384
It's an award ceremony, I'm wearing
a gold lame jacket. It's appropriate.

745
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:51,337
It's quite sudden, isn't it?

746
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:56,349
Erm, anyway.
First award is Injury of the Year.

747
00:51:56,384 --> 00:52:03,336
And the nominations are - Richard in
our Headhammer Thrust i-Eagle, Geoff.

748
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:06,316
We're going to crash.

749
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:08,337
Ow, my chest!

750
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:11,316
Jeremy making paint-ball art.

751
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:12,320
Ready!

752
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,396
Ah!

753
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:25,345
And James on a gangplank in Bolivia.

754
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,344
It's like literally beingwith Livingstone... Yeah.

755
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:29,396
And...

756
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:37,316
Mm-mm! It was a good one.
A good moment there, mate.

757
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:39,344
Well done.
Both of us did cough blood.

758
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:47,396
I have the winner here. Injury of
the Year award and the winner is...

759
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:49,321
It's actually none of those.

760
00:52:49,356 --> 00:52:52,305
Now, I should say
before I announce this,

761
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:59,300
that when we film a car on Top Gear, there is always
a light, OK, in the top corner of the windscreen.

762
00:52:59,335 --> 00:53:04,341
Now, we've been doing this show for
years, so it would be impossible to forget

763
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:11,376
that that light is there and that it's very
sharp, unless, of course, you were a colossal anus.

764
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:15,308
East Midlands airport. You might have to...

765
00:53:15,343 --> 00:53:16,865
What? The camera.

766
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,388
What have you done?

767
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:25,388
Ow! BLEEP It really hurts. Agh!

768
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,349
Well done, chaps.

769
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:35,396
Gosh. It's an honour.
It is an honour.

770
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:38,285
Thank you. Thank you.

771
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,349
Now, as always, we present an award

772
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:47,277
to the person who's driven around our track
fastest of all in the course of the year.

773
00:53:47,312 --> 00:53:53,320
The fastest man around the Top Gear track, the
fastest celebrity in the reasonably-priced car,

774
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,376
from AC/DC, it's Brian Johnson!

775
00:53:57,376 --> 00:54:00,281
Sadly, Brian is in Florida
at the moment

776
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:04,812
and none of us could be bothered to
go over there and give him his award.

777
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:09,613
But we did find a film crew who very
kindly volunteered to do it for us.

778
00:54:09,648 --> 00:54:14,380
Thanks very much for this wonderful
honour and for this fabulous trophy.

779
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:16,384
You must have spent
a fortune on this!

780
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,337
My name's Brian, not "Brain".

781
00:54:18,372 --> 00:54:22,348
And that's an ice hockey player
on top of there, look. Never mind.

782
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:24,285
This'll do me for now.

783
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,328
So have a great time at Christmas
and I'll see you soon, guys.

784
00:54:28,363 --> 00:54:30,353
Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye.

785
00:54:30,388 --> 00:54:36,360
Brain Johnson! Well, I'm sorry.
That's the worst thing we've everdone. It was cheap. It was cheap.

786
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:41,372
And now it's time to get serious, because
it's time for our Car of the Year award, OK.

787
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,265
This, of course, is an
extremely coveted award.

788
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,320
Manufacturers all over the world
will be watching with bated breath.

789
00:54:47,355 --> 00:54:51,273
OK, the nominations
are the new Volkswagen Polo.

790
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:56,269
It's already won the slightly less
coveted European Car of the Year award.

791
00:54:56,304 --> 00:55:03,300
And the Kia Ceed, for its pleasing equipment levels
and ground-breaking seven-year comprehensive warranty.

792
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:11,396
And the Suzuki Alto, for its willing engine
and its attractive price tag of just L7,495.

793
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:16,320
And the winner for being much,
much better than all of those,

794
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,332
is the Lamborghini Gallardo Balboni!

795
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:20,329
Yes. Oh, yeah.

796
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:22,846
Oh, yeah. What a winner.

797
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:25,328
That's as it should be.

798
00:55:26,328 --> 00:55:30,320
We were impressed with
its stripe, it's V10 engine,

799
00:55:30,355 --> 00:55:34,312
its rear-wheel drive,
the savagery of its exhaust,

800
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:36,341
and its stripe.

801
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:40,308
No, seriously,
we think the Polo is tremendous, OK?

802
00:55:40,343 --> 00:55:42,277
Beautifully made and so on.

803
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:44,357
And that's OK if you're an
accountant, but we're not.

804
00:55:44,392 --> 00:55:49,332
What we look for in a car is, and I'm
loathed to use the word, it's an X factor.

805
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:51,396
Something you can't really
put your finger on.

806
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,345
And that's what we look for.

807
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,396
Yes. And the Lamborghini has something you can put your finger on
- a stripe.

808
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:03,348
We're moving on. There's a lot of people
tune in for this moment every year.

809
00:56:03,383 --> 00:56:06,885
Which is clever because
we've never done it before.

810
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,388
It's the Forklift Truck Driver
of the Year award.

811
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:12,388
The nominations are...

812
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:14,277
This chap.

813
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:20,300
Here he is, look. You're all right, back up, you're
all right. Oh, no. Wait a minute, hang on. Ooh!

814
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,380
But the winner without a question
or shadow of doubt is this chap.

815
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:29,293
Yep, back up, careful, careful...

816
00:56:29,328 --> 00:56:32,324
Ooh, bit quick.
No, ooh, that's not gone well.

817
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,301
Wow! I mean...

818
00:56:40,336 --> 00:56:44,332
Unbelievable... Credit where it's due. A fine effort.

819
00:56:45,392 --> 00:56:50,388
Well, it's appropriate we should now
move on to the Golden Cock award.

820
00:56:52,372 --> 00:56:57,352
This of course, is awarded... Here it
is, Richard demonstrating for you now.

821
00:56:57,387 --> 00:57:00,345
It's awarded to the member
of the Top Gear team who has,

822
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,304
in the course of making
the programme over the year,

823
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:04,361
been a complete clattering buttock.

824
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:08,886
Now, there were several cases behind the
scenes this year that we had to consider.

825
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:13,376
There was the time when James May, whilst
following the Range Rover camera car,

826
00:57:13,411 --> 00:57:16,301
somehow managed to lose
sight of it for a moment

827
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:19,384
and then start following an
entirely different Range Rover.

828
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:22,293
And he failed to notice for an hour

829
00:57:22,328 --> 00:57:28,352
that it didn't have a camera crew in it and
was in fact nothing to do with Top Gear at all.

830
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:32,353
Just to give you an idea of the
degree of James's idiocy there,

831
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:34,892
here's a picture of a normal
Range Rover. There it is, look.

832
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:37,396
And now here's a picture of
one of our filming Range Rovers.

833
00:57:37,431 --> 00:57:40,329
There is a giveaway there.

834
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:43,329
But in the end, there really
could only be one winner.

835
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:46,361
You may remember the steam train
race we had earlier on in the year.

836
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:53,308
Well, four minutes before the train was due to leave,
that's four minutes before the race was due to begin,

837
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:58,348
we were presented with a Jaguar XK with
the keys in the ignition, engine running...

838
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:01,325
and the doors locked.

839
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:09,316
So, the Golden Cock has to go to that man who was
trusted to deliver that priceless car on that crucial day,

840
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:11,332
and left it with us
in that condition.

841
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,396
And that man was...

842
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:15,345
The Stig!

843
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,340
Yes. Where is he?

844
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,308
He's here.

845
00:58:24,348 --> 00:58:27,324
Stig, the Golden Cock. Yes.

846
00:58:28,352 --> 00:58:30,353
Oh, it's great.
He's touched. He's touched,

847
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:33,860
I can tell. I should point out,
Stig, that is a rolling award.

848
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:37,332
We have to have it back now to
give it to next year's winner.

849
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:38,341
So if I can have that... Ah!

850
00:58:38,376 --> 00:58:42,297
No, you have to give it back so
it sits in our trophy cupboard.

851
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:47,332
Stig, give me the Golden Cock. Just... Stig,
give me the Gol... Give me the Gol... I need...

852
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:49,277
Stig, I need the, give me the Gol...

853
00:58:49,312 --> 00:58:53,312
No, not that. Stig, give me the
Golden Cock. Stig, give me the Cock.

854
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:55,837
We've lost both Cocks.

855
00:58:55,872 --> 00:58:58,293
Have you got his Cock?

856
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:02,384
Some of it. Yes. It's amazing.
You're joking, is thatall we have left of the Golden...

857
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:05,301
Oh, mate, it's weird.
He fights like a choirboy

858
00:59:05,336 --> 00:59:09,396
but you can hear his jaws just snapping shut
in his helmet all the time. It's terrifying.

859
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,325
I've got some of it back anyway.

860
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,364
Well, well done, Hammond.
Anyway, that was the Golden Cock.

861
00:59:14,399 --> 00:59:18,333
What I'm doing is I'm blathering. Yeah. You are.

862
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:22,378
How short can you make anhour-long programme? I don't know.

863
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:26,880
OK, seriously, honestly, because
James's film was so short,

864
00:59:26,915 --> 00:59:31,313
we do actually have time
for one more award. Yes, we do.

865
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:37,289
And since this is 2010, we can give
an award to the car of the decade.

866
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:41,340
Now we are taking this quite seriously.
There are a lot of worthy contenders.

867
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:45,321
And we considered everything from the
Rolls-Royce Phantom to the new Mini.

868
00:59:45,356 --> 00:59:49,372
Another car that makes our list of those
being considered, Pagani for the Zonda.

869
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:52,879
Yeah, we also considered,
did we not, the Range Rover TDV8,

870
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:56,352
simply for being all the car
you could ever possibly need.

871
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:58,329
And then the light bulb went on,

872
00:59:58,364 --> 01:00:02,317
because we realised there could
actually only be one car

873
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:06,380
of what the Daily Mail will
undoubtedly call "the noughties".

874
01:00:06,415 --> 01:00:10,341
It was a car that just
rewrote the rule book, really.

875
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:14,844
An amazing piece of engineering.
A genuine Concorde moment.

876
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:19,312
So, ladies and gentlemen,
the Top Gear car of the decade

877
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:21,312
is the Bugatti Veyron.

878
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:24,316
APPLAUSE

879
01:00:33,336 --> 01:00:35,349
Keep going, keep going.

880
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:38,308
Yes. More applause. More than that.

881
01:00:40,364 --> 01:00:43,312
Yeah! What about that?

882
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:45,325
Ha ha!

883
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,304
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

884
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:59,304
We're there! We've made it to the
end of the hour. We've done it.

885
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,313
Thank you so much for watching.

886
01:01:01,348 --> 01:01:04,392
We'll see you again later in
the year. Have a happy new year.

887
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,380
Take care, everyone. Good night.
