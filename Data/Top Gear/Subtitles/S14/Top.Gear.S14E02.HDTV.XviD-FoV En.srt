1
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,389
Now...

2
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:41,169
if you buy a G-Wiz,

3
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:45,373
plainly you are not interested
in style or comfort or speed

4
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:50,389
or practicality or driving pleasure
- or safety or your dignity.

5
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,889
LAUGHTER

6
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,921
And that got us thinking. If all
you want is a battery-powered box,

7
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,169
why spend Â£8,500 on one of these?

8
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:08,281
Why not simply build one yourself?
I mean, how hard can it be?

9
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:14,965
Keen to get cracking, we went to the Top
Gear Technology Centre and set to work.

10
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,109
It's all very simple, really.

11
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,717
I am in charge of the batteries
and the electric motor.

12
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:23,641
Clarkson is in charge - God help
us - of the bodywork and interior,

13
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:28,061
and Richard Hammond is in charge
of the chassis and the brakes.

14
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:32,341
If you are going to build your owncar, there's no
point just throwing the chassis together yourself

15
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:36,609
cos you'll get caught up in 20 years
- of red tape trying to get it registered to use on the road,

16
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,593
so what you need to do is use
the chassis from another car.

17
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,213
But there is a problem, because most
modern cars don't have a chassis as such.

18
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:48,733
It's all kind of built into the body,
so you need to choose from an older car.

19
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:52,517
Specifically, you've got a choice of
either a Land Rover, a Lincoln Town Car,

20
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:57,217
or this, a TVR Chimaera.

21
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:01,797
I bought this one for Â£5,000, and I
was going to remove its body and engine

22
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:07,873
and then use its chassis as
the backbone of our new car.

23
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:14,685
James, meanwhile, was preparing to
cannibalise something a bit less sporty.

24
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:20,157
I shall be using the electric motor
- from this, which just leaves me with the problem of the batteries.

25
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:23,157
Now, the Tesla - that
American electric sports car -

26
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:27,189
uses 6,831 batteries,

27
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,749
but that seems a bit excessive
to me, so to save weight,

28
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:36,893
and money, I'm going
to use two batteries.

29
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:41,141
Like all great car designers,
I'd created a mood room,

30
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:45,857
hung with images from which
I could draw inspiration.

31
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:51,517
Big cats, jet fighters,
the actor Peter Bowles,

32
00:02:51,557 --> 00:03:00,237
and pretty soon, I was
ready to start work.

33
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:04,701
It's a lovely material to work
with, aluminium, because it bends.

34
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:08,501
Car makers could learn a lot from
this simple system I've adopted.

35
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,765
Ow! BLEEP! Ow!

36
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:14,733
And there is the precious chassis.

37
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:23,705
That is the basisof everything
we're doing. A doddle!

38
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:28,081
In terms of construction, I've
taken my lead from shelving.

39
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,373
You've simply got the
uprights, which I've got here.

40
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:34,125
There it is.

41
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,533
The bolt goes through there.

42
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,453
Damn it!

43
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:40,373
How simple is this?

44
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:44,893
One piece, another piece,
bolts holding them together.

45
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,521
With the milk float dismembered,
my power system was taking shape.

46
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:53,937
That's 100 quid's worth of
batteries, a 20 quid milk float motor,

47
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:56,705
and watch this. MOTOR WHIRRS

48

49
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:02,425
Is that turning round now? Don't put
your finger on it. I'm not going to.

50
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,173
As long as you two keep the weight
of your body and chassis down,

51
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:08,677
that'll go like a
stabbed rat. Are you sure?

52
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:13,205
Well, it'll be a damn
sight faster than a G-Wiz.

53
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:20,725
'While May wired up his batteries and
Hammond prepared his chassis...' It's free!

54
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:27,173
'..I retired to the mood room to
seek further design inspiration.'

55

with a moustache? No. No.

58
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:48,005
Having finished their jobs, Hammond and
May left me alone to complete the bodywork.

59
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:56,893
Beautiful.

Guys, we're going to have to get the
electricity from this side of the road.

166
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,765
Nobody is in there. OK.

167
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,297
Thank you.

168
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:10,533
Sorry, everybody. You are so kind.

169
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:15,813
When you run out of fuel in the future, this will be your life
- undoing spaghetti.

170
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:18,469
We're in!

171
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:21,141
There. That works.

172
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,861
Sorry. Sorry.

173
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:27,005
James, how long does it take
to charge an electric car?

174
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:30,533
Well, to charge it fully would take a good
six or seven hours, but in two hours...

175
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,781
Whoa! Six or seven HOURS?!

176
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:37,733
My arm's aching already. Those are the
facts of battery-powered cars. We know that.

177
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:41,329
'Still, much to the
relief of everyone...'

178
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:45,049
CRUNCH! No! '.. Geoff was ready to go.'

179
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,733
Let's see. Yes! MUSIC:
Theme from "Rocky"

180
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,333
'Sadly, though, he was
just as slow as before.'

181
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:55,365
James, you're being
overtaken by children.

182
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,285
A lot of children coming past.

183
00:11:57,325 --> 00:12:02,033
There's a bicycle coming by. With two
people on it. Another bicycle coming by.

184
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:07,957
'On balance, we thought it best to leave Oxford
and get back to the Top Gear Technology Centre,

185
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:12,453
'but then James took a wrong
turning...' Left! Left there!

186
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:17,565
What? '..with terrible consequences.'

187
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:20,597
HORNS BLARE James, this is the A34!

188
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:25,657
Oh, God! This is a road
with a speed limit of 70mph.

189
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:29,813
A lot of traffic now! Can
you drive with the hazards on?

190
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:33,269
Yeah, but it might slow
us down a bit. Oh, my God.

191
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,909
James, get off the dual carriageway.

192
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,445
That sign says "Motorway 6". I
don't want to go on the motorway!

193
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:42,489
James, do not... Is there
a junction before that?

194
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,193
Look at the traffic jam. I can't.

195
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,193
It's too embarrassing.
Look at the traffic jam.

196
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,813
I can't! I've got my head in a
plastic box, and everyone can see me!

197
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,097
HORNS BLARE Do you know what we've done?

198
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,785
We've made something
worse than a G-Wiz.

199
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,365
Don't say that. We have.

200
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:01,377
I disagree. It's slower. Yes.

201
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,861
He's being cooked. Yes.

202
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:09,961
It's rubbish.

203
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:16,097
MUSIC PLAYS SLOWLY: "Heaven Is
APlace On Earth" by Belinda Carlisle

204
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:21,893
# We'll make heaven a place on... #

205
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,773
Eventually, we ended
up in the countryside

206
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:27,833
where at least we couldn't
get in anyone's way,

207
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:33,961
but unfortunately, the A34 had had a
catastrophic effect on our performance.

208
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:39,365
We're hardly
moving!HIGH-PITCHED DRONING

209
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:43,849
I wouldn't mind it going slowly. I
just wish it wouldn't make that noise.

210
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,117
James...

211
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,865
Oh, God! What?

212
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:50,773
ENGINE WHINES

213
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:55,209
Please tell me that... ENGINE STOPS

214
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,365
You bloody idiot!

215
00:13:57,405 --> 00:14:00,457
Why did you think two batteries
was the right solution?

216
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:05,253
Tesla used 6,800 batteries for a reason.

217
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:09,613
Oh, great(!) We're actually holding
people up here. Sorry. Sorry!

218
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,681
THEY STRAIN Come on, Geoff.

219
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,681
Come on! I'll tell you what, James.

220
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,817
What? There's loads of houses
around here where we can get

221
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,885
some more electricity(!) James, seriously, why
didn't you put more than two batteries in it?

222
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:27,613
I didn't want it to weigh too much.
- Batteries go flat. This is important consumer information.

223
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:30,725
Stored electricity is
like a caged animal.

224
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:35,365
You should have used more than two.
- Well, next time, I know and we know.

225
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:39,869
Tell me that isn't happening.
Tell me that isn't happening.

226
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:43,661
CRASH!

227
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:47,117
I... I don't want to...

228
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:51,041
The lonely walk
confirmed our worst fears.

229
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:58,273
Geoff was dead.

230
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:02,725
Don't applaud. Don't
applaud. Geoff is dead!

231
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:07,557
It was the saddest moment. As
it hit the tree, my heart broke.

232
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:10,917
They're obviously all from
Oxford, that's what it is.

233
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,257
Yeah.

234
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:16,165
Anyway, we could have given up
at that point, but we didn't.

235
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:18,897
We went back to the drawing board
and later on you'll be able to see

236
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:23,213
the results of our frankly brilliant
effort. But for now, it's the news.

237
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,293
It is indeed and we start with this.

238
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,729
As we know, Formula One has always
been the most glamorous sport

239
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,257
in the world, hasn't it? Yeah? But
not any more. Not from next year.

240
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:37,841
There's four new teams joining in,
OK. One of them, Manor Grand Prix,

241
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:42,309
is based in Sheffield.
How glamorous is that?

242
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:45,325
Strictly speaking, it's actually
between Sheffield and Rotherham.

243
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:49,461
If we're going to be pedantic, it's
between Sheffield, Rotherham and Worksop,

244
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,977
in a place called
Dinnington, which I know well.

245
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:57,025
And it's exactly like Monte
Carlo...apart from in every single detail.

246
00:15:57,065 --> 00:16:00,541
It does take the shine of it a bit.
I can't wait to see their new car.

247
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:04,053
I don't why you bother with all that
carbon fibre, I made mine out of steel.

248
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:08,057
Stainless steel. If that
Fernando Alonso hits our car,

249
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:12,165
his Ferrari will be knackered.
I'll tell you that for nowt.

250
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:16,309
It's funny, me dad worked in pit and
now I've got a job in pit and all.

251
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:21,729
They're replacing Toyota and
they've signed Timo Glock,

252
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,433
who presumably is currently learning
why it's important to punch anyone

253
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,869
who looks at him funny.

254
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:30,869
Is anyone from Sheffield?
Yeah. Are you? Whereabouts?

255
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:34,213
You're from Sheffield?
Cos I'm just thinking,

256
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:38,405
they're using Cosworth engines,
or I should say, Sheffield, Cozza.

257
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:42,733
Cosa? No, Coz-za. You've got to have-
a stroke halfway through the word.

258
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:47,293
Coz-za. So your face falls.
Coz-za.- Coz-za. Your face falls off.

259
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,793
You're from Sheffield, just
practise it, just show us.

260
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,125
How do you say it? Cozza.

261
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:54,717
There you go!

262
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:57,213
I think it's fair to say that
that team is probably Top Gear's

263
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:00,105
absolute favourite F1 team.
I want them to win everything,

264
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,997
so on the podium they're gonna
have a big brass band at the end.

265
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:09,261
Abide With Me. Ain't that a national anthem? We'll
have Abide With Me on a brass band, be lovely.

266
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:13,717
Now, criminals, would you like
to get away with your crimes?

267
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:17,493
Are you capable of running
more than 100 yards?

268
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:22,453
Well, good news, because the police
- are thinking of using these now.

269
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:25,561
It's a Mitsubishi electric.

270
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:30,309
They say it's helping
them crack down on CO2.

271
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,933
I don't want the police
to crack down on CO2.

272
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:36,341
I want them to get my
bloody television back,

273
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,981
because it's been six
years since that was nicked,

274
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:42,653
and I haven't heard a peep out of them whilst
they've been going on about cracking down on CO2.

275
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:45,405
I'll have to buy
another one at this rate.

276
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:48,417
What were you stopped for
the other day, by a policeman?

277
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,857
It was some motoring misdemeanour.
You just turned around and said,

278
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:55,417
"Oh, good. This must mean
you've found my television."

279
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:59,261
If I was a policeman and my chief
freemason came into the office

280
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:04,969
and said... I mean Chief Constable.
- I always get them muddled up.

281
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:08,421
And he said, "Right, you've got
to do your beat in one of those."

282
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:10,721
I would drink my own pepper spray.

283
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:14,565
I'll tell you what, this is a
slightly interesting one, OK.

284
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:18,749
There was a survey recently
about the effects that a nice car

285
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,029
can have on a male, the human male, OK?

286
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,217
What they did was they got 40 young
- guys and they made them drive

287
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,813
up and down the street in a Toyota
Camry and then drive up and down

288
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:31,877
the same street, in the
same manner, in a Porsche 911

289
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,905
and then they measured their
testosterone after each drive.

290
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:38,313
And after driving the
Porsche, it had shot up.

291
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:40,877
So it had an actual physiological
effect on them? Yeah.

292
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,813
I'm amazed by that. I think that
makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

293
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:47,029
Cos whenever I drive a really nice,
- exciting car I always get

294
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:51,157
like a nice little fizzing sensation.

295
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:55,001
No, it's not... Where is
this fizzing sensation?

296
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,125
It's not actually in
my penis, but it's...

297
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:00,781
but it's sort of just behind it.

298
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:03,125
A fizzing sensation
just behind your penis?

299
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,341
Yeah. So, isn't that
the pit of your stomach?

300
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:08,253
No, no, lower down than
that, sort of right...

301
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:13,781
That's your prostate, mate.
You've sat on the gear.

302
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:17,253
Does anybody else have a fizzing
sensation just behind their penis...

303
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:20,701
Am I the only person... Ah! Thank
you, sir. You have? Good man.

304
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:24,813
Or do you just want to be on television?

305
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:27,093
Come here. Do come here.

306
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:32,313
It's just got a lot worse! James May, a
man in a moustache has come on the stage

307
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:35,765
and wishes to meet you to discuss...
Please, have a seat. ..your fizzing penises.

308
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:39,141
That's the end of the news. Oh, God!

309
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:42,861
APPLAUSE

310
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:45,109
I'd like to commend you
on being brave enough,

311
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,017
especially as you've grown
a moustache for charity,

312
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:51,861
to come on the stage and admit that
- you too have been bestowed

313
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,501
with this great gift from the
gods of a slight fizzing sensation

314
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,937
somewhere behind your penis but in front of
your prostate when you drive an exciting car.

315
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:02,221
What sort of car are you
driving when you feel it?

316
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:06,173
Citroen AX.

317
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:09,005
Honestly, no, seriously...

318
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:19,657
we really must invite you to...
go back over there. Thank you.

319
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:22,349
I think some of us are just
more fortunate than others.

320
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,065
You must have had this on
a motorcycle. No, never!

321
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:30,253
I'm just gonna stand. I don't
even want to use that seat now.

322
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:34,037
Now, we have to just touch on
something, don't we, before we go,

323
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,549
because... LAUGHTER

324
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:41,269
No, we don't, no. No, no, no. Argh!

325
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,097
The news has gone wrong this week.

326
00:20:44,137 --> 00:20:48,409
I'd rather chop them off.
I'd rather slice them.

327
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:51,881
Thing is, next week
we're doing this item

328
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:57,445
on which car company has produced
the largest number of great cars.

329
00:20:57,485 --> 00:21:00,501
This is GREAT cars? Yes, GREAT cars.
- So, any thoughts on which

330
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:05,221
car company's made the
biggest number of GREAT cars?

331
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:07,521
See, Aston Martin isn't...

332
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,849
I don't think Aston has made a single
great, GREAT car. They make some lovely...

333
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:14,129
DB5 was only great because of
JamesBond. It's actually a bit rubbish...

334
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,677
Exactly. Anyone else got any thoughts?

335
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:19,973
Who said Ferrari? Somebody said Ferrari
over there. That's a good call, but...

336
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:23,457
It's a good call, but if you think about
it, they've made a lot of rubbish cars too.

337
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:26,053
Their 348 was rubbish, the
Testarossa was rubbish...

338
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,525
Mondial was rubbish. The F40
was a great car. That was great.

339
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:32,269
But what about mainstream
manufacturers, though? Ford.

340
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,925
They did the Model T, that's
kind of an important car.

341
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:38,173
Mustang... GT40 is a great car.

342
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,709
This, I think, is an interesting
debate that petrol heads can have.

343
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:43,805
We genuinely would like to
hear what you have to say,

344
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,445
so do please go on our website,
which is on the internet,

345
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:51,193
and then write something on... I don't
know how you... Write something on it,

346
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:56,085
which car firm you think has produced the largest
number of great cars. If you write that down

347
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,817
on our internet...we'll read it.

348
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:02,301
LAUGHTER

349
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:06,493
Now, last year I drove an Audi R8,
and I thought it was the knees of

350
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,253
the bee, but in a straight line, at
- least, it was a little bit slower

351
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:11,021
than a Porsche 911.

352
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:14,117
Yeah, quite a lot slower
than a 911, actually.

353
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:17,613
It was about THAT much slower. I admit
that much makes all the difference.

354
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:21,973
LAUGHTER

355
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:35,101
However, Audi has now
released a new faster version.

356
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:40,245
This is it, and it looks pretty
much the same as the original.

357
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:48,009
However...

358
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:53,009
The standard R8 has a 4.2-litre V8.

359
00:22:53,049 --> 00:23:01,605
THIS has a 5.2-litre Lamborghini V10.

360
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:05,973
That means 518-brake horsepower...

361
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:09,509
enough torque to tenderise an elephant

362
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:15,477
and a top speed of about 200mph.

363
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:20,069
0 to 60 is dealt with in
3.7 seconds. That's there -

364
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:24,789
80, 90, 100, 110,

365
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:28,741
120, 125 in eight seconds.

366
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:33,245
This thing is phenomenal!

367
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:47,213
The handling is pretty epic as well.

368
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:52,933
As a driver's car, this
is...spectacularly good.

369
00:23:52,973 --> 00:24:00,761
It's like Scarlett Johansson's lips
- or the roof of Paddington Station.

370
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:04,773
Absolutely faultless.

371
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:08,229
Oh, God, it's good!

372
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:10,413
Oh, mmmmm!

373
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:19,369
r!

374
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:27,413
And unlike most super-cars, it's
not even desperately impractical.

375
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:32,385
You get a boot, which is big
enough- for three medium-sized goats.

376
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:34,697
You get a useful shelf behind the seats,

377
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:39,933
and you get room inside to move about
- and breathe.

378
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:43,125
There are a couple of mistakes, I admit.

379
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:47,133
If, for instance, you have a can of
- tangy, refreshing drink here

380
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:49,685
in the cup holder, and
you go to change gear,

381
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:52,841
your elbow's going to knock
it and that's annoying.

382
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:57,169
And as far as I can work out,
the trip computer isn't working.

383
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,765
I don't like to say that because
it would have been installed by

384
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:02,777
a German who will be shot
at dawn for his mistake,

385
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:07,885
but it...it doesn't.

386
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:12,793
And then there's the biggest mistake of them all
- the price.

387
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,341
It's Â£100,000. And
that's just the start.

388
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,465
If you want ceramic brakes, Â£7,000.

389
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:23,485
Flappy-paddle gearbox, Â£5,000.

390
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:26,341
If you want the boot
lined in fake suede,

391
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:28,309
Â£1,600.

392
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,389
Bucket seats
- Â£2,350.

393
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,793
Colour co-ordinated
seatbelts - 750 quid!

394
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:39,249
If you want these panels,
here, finished in carbon fibre,

395
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,309
you're mad, mad as a Mexican's dog.

396
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:48,485
They even charge Â£500 if you want to
pick the car up from the factory yourself.

397
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:51,389
That's like charging someone
Â£10 extra for a bottle of wine

398
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:53,777
if you tread the grapes yourself.

399
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:59,309
I'd tell them to get lost.

400
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:05,513
Strangely, however, it's not the money
that would stop me buying this car.

401
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:09,889
The trouble is... is
it's a bit too joyless.

402
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,361
A bit too like Scarlett
Johansson's lips.

403
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:17,953
You can...never imagine
this thing smiling.

404
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,669
I mean, look what happens,
OK, if I hit this button here.

405
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:24,157
"Sport mode on," exclamation mark.

406
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:27,045
What's it got an exclamation mark for?

407
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:32,857
You put the sport on in a
super-car? You mad, crazy fool, you!

408
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:34,845
Look at the sat-nav, OK.

409
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:39,565
It can take you to a bank or a
bowling alley or a bus station.

410
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:42,233
I'm sorry? Golf course.

411
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:44,593
Historical monument.

412
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,517
Yes, I've got a super-car,
but I'm going to stop off

413
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:51,249
and look at this Neolithic fort!

414
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,001
The R8 V10, then, doesn't really do fun.

415
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:59,721
It doesn't do pantomime, so if I
was spending Â£100,000 on a car,

416
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:20,033
I'd think very seriously
about buying something worse.

417
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:35,297
This is the Corvette ZR1,
which is extremely fast.

418
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:39,441
This has a super-charged
6.2-litre engine,

419
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:49,269
which is a turbot compared to
Audi's 5.2-litre un-supercharged cod.

420
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:56,081
Put it in a drag race with the
R8 and the results are inevitable.

421
00:27:56,121 --> 00:28:02,393
I have got 120 more
horsepower than the R8...

422
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:05,781
and because the Corvette
is made from plastic,

423
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:09,581
it's lighter as well.

424
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,237
If only America could win
its wars so convincingly.

425
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:18,441
However, there are a few problems.

426
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:22,237
I tested one in America
last year and, erm...

427
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:25,989
after three days, it was starting to
fall apart, and then on the fourth,

428
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,221
it refused to start.

429
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:32,317
It's also insanely vulgar.

430
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:35,065
It's only available
with left-hand drive.

431
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:38,409
The luggage cover looks
like a motel shower curtain.

432
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:47,693
It's much too wide and in the
corners, it's a complete mad man.

433
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:51,141
Oh.

434
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:55,769
When I drove this thing
in California, I loved it!

435
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,241
But I think it might have
been a holiday romance,

436
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:04,501
because here on our track it's,
it's... Well, let's be kind,

437
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:15,925
let's say difficult.

438
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:20,833
Remember, I've got more
power than the Ferrari Enzo.

439
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:27,301
Oh, my God. Come on!
Get in a straight line!

440
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:30,429
I may have more firepower, but
trying to keep up with the Audi

441
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:34,925
is like trying to win the Grand
National whilst riding a lion,

442
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:38,893
that's made out of teeth and jelly.

443
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:42,221
It sort of wobbles about and
then if you're not careful,

444
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:45,085
it bites your arm off. Aaahh!

445
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,833
Oh, no! I'm gone!

446
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:53,165
The thing is, though, despite the
waywardness and the terrible danger,

447
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:57,021
the Corvette is more fun.

448
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:01,833
It's disintegrating already, I'm
being strangled by my own seatbelt

449
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:09,273
and the end's come off! Get on!

450
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:13,177
Be in no doubt, then
- the Audi is a better car.

451
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:16,133
It's better built, better
to look at, better to drive,

452
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:19,849
more comfortable, easier to
park, and, in the real world,

453
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:23,509
faster.

454
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,381
You'd have to be bonkers
to buy the Corvette.

455
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:36,053
And that is why you should.

456
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:39,477
APPLAUSE

457
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:42,149
It's that exclamation mark that
says everything about that car.

458
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,289
You want Sport Mode?! Sport Mode!

459
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:46,817
Sport Mode!

460
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:49,177
Oh, now, ah-ha...

461
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,445
I have got an apology to make.

462
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:55,365
I said in that film that the Audi's
- trip computer was broken.

463
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:59,401
It isn't, OK? It turned out I hadn't
pressed the reset button properly.

464
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,965
LAUGHTER

465
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:03,525
We did actually ring Audi
to confess to what he'd done,

466
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:07,805
but it was too late. The man
responsible had...shot himself.

467
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,649
Yeah. He had.

468
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:16,177
Anyway, it's now time to put both cars
in the hands of our tame racing driver.

469
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:21,149
Some say that he has some terrible
plans involving the moon...

470
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:22,993
LAUGHTER

471
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:27,461
..and that he was turned down for a place
on I'm A Celebrity because he IS one.

472
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:30,713
LAUGHTER

473
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:32,853
All we know is... he's called The Stig!

474
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:35,333
CHEERING

475
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:38,085
They're off! A genuinely
interesting battle, this,

476
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,213
because the Corvette is
faster in a straight line,

477
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:43,305
but it needs an extraordinary talent

478
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:46,649
to get it round corners
without crashing.

479
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,229
Look at that.

480
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:49,821
And there is the talent.

481
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:53,461
MUSIC: "When I'm Cleaning Windows"

482
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:57,805
Oh dear, Stig continues to make
each lap into a Cockney knees-up.

483
00:31:57,845 --> 00:32:01,309
Ooh, did you see that? Weirdly,
it's the Audi going sideways.

484
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:04,493
Through Chicago. What'll
happen in Hammerhead?

485
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,053
Let's have a look here.

486
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,213
Again it's the four-wheel
drive R8 that's out of shape.

487
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:14,053
The 'Vette in the Stig's
talented paws clinging on.

488
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,025
A wiggle on the way out, but that's it.

489
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:20,089
MUSIC CONTINUES

490
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,977
Right.
Follow-through -

491
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:25,541
this is where the
Corvette's super-charged V8

492
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:27,885
can really deliver some shock and awe.

493
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,901
The tyres
- they are both quick through there.

494
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:32,773
It's the in-bred lunatic versus
a car with no sense of humour,

495
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:35,201
and they're pretty much
neck-and-neck, just Gambon to go.

496
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:39,697
Both sigh through there,
and they cross the line.

497
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:42,977
And now we have the times... APPLAUSE

498
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:45,133
Audi.

499
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,853
The Audi first?

500
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:52,949
It did it in 1:21.6, which
puts it... That's for the Audi.

501
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:58,013
1:21.6? That was sort of a damp-ish-
lap, as well. That's quick, OK.

502
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:02,921
However, Corvette did it in 1:20.4.
- What?!

503
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:07,045
No... But the thing is, I reckon
you or I could get the Audi round

504
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,841
in roughly that time, OK?

505
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:13,965
But there's no way we could make the Corvette go round in that.
- Literally, I would

506
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:18,405
be five minutes dead. ..AND dead. Five
minutes AND dead is what it would be.

507
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:22,433
Anyway, now it is time to put a
star in our reasonably-priced car,

508
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:24,889
and my guest tonight is an actor.

509
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:28,573
He has played Kenneth Williams,
who is no longer with us,

510
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:31,417
he's played Brian Clough,
who's no longer with us,

511
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:33,529
and he's played Tony Blair, who, um...

512
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:35,793
LAUGHTER

513
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,777
..IS still with us.

514
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,733
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Sheen!

515
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:43,293
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

516
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,325
How are you?

517
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:49,717
Have a seat. Lovely.

518
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,529
I thought you were going
to look like Tony Blair.

519
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:55,213
I... It's my day off
today. Cos it's weird -

520
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:58,825
when I watched The Queen,
obviously when you WERE Tony Blair,

521
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:03,513
I remember thinking, "God, they did very well to find an actor
- who looks so like him."

522
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:05,261
But you're much better looking!

523
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,889
LAUGHTER

524
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,341
It's not hard, is it? Do people
think you're going to look like him?

525
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,621
In America people think I'm
a Tony Blair look-alike, yeah.

526
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:16,249
But you're not. I don't do
work as a Tony Blair look-alike,

527
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:19,341
although I do have
look-alikes in my family.

528
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:21,469
My dad is a Jack Nicholson
look-alike. Is he?

529
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:24,157
He is indeed. Cos I was looking
back at your family history

530
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:27,185
and it was all very weird, because
nobody's done anything conventional

531
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:30,077
since the dawn of human
history... That's true.

532
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:35,529
Your great-grandmother was... She was the first
elephant and lion- tamer in Barnum & Bailey Circus.

533
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:37,545
Right...! LAUGHTER

534
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:43,797
Her name was Nanny Blower, and God bless her,
she was talented, but she wasn't a looker.

535
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:48,001
She had her left breast mauled off
by a lion, and the claw of that lion

536
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,421
is on a chain somewhere in our family.

537
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:52,361
Seriously? Yeah.

538
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:55,533
And it's at this point you go,
"And we have that lion for you now!"

539
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:58,673
I wish I'd known. I
would have looked into it.

540
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:03,205
There was your... Not grandfather...
Great-grandfather. Who was the one who got drunk a lot?

541
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:08,141
Yeah, my great grandfather was a bit
of a waster in the town, in Port Talbot,

542
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:12,517
and the story goes that he was lying in the gutter
one night, having been chucked out of the pub,

543
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:16,985
and the moon appeared through the clouds, and
God spoke to him through the moon and said,

544
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:22,517
"You must mend your ways. Save up money and buy the
disused tin mine in the mountain." So from then on

545
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:26,125
he never touched another drink and he
saved his money. Everyone thought he was mad

546
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,517
cos there was no tin left. They
discovered a new vein of tin,

547
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:33,877
he became the richest man in Port Talbot
and became a street preacher from then on.

548
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:37,365
This is fantastic. Then your dad
was a Jack Nicholson impersonator...

549
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:40,969
A Jack Nicholson look-alike, not an
impersonator. Look-alike. There is a difference.

550
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:44,517
He's a genetic freak,
not a talented actor.

551
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:46,577
LAUGHTER

552
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:51,613
And now you're Tony Blair and David Frost... And Kenneth Williams
- and Brian Clough.

553
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,453
This is... Can I just,

554
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:57,005
first of all, can I just take a moment
to congratulate you on Frost/Nixon.

555
00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:59,549
That was amazing. Thank you
very much. Rocky is what it was.

556
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:03,705
It was Rocky for interviewers. Instead
of fighting, it was interviewing Nixon.

557
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,937
Brilliant film, I adored that.

558
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:11,393
And I was just wondering, why
do you choose parts predominantly

559
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:14,365
Now, the new film, Twilight
- it's New Moon, isn't it, from the Twilight series?

560
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,453
which you did this presumably because
you've got a 10-year-old daughter.

561
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:20,285
Yes. I have a 10-year-old daughter who
is obsessed with the books. As have I.

562
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:24,501
Completely besotted. And I always
say to her, "What are they about?"

563
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:29,093
rl,

564
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:33,349
"and she's in love with a werewolf, but she
was..." and I say, "What are you reading?!"

565
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:36,425
It's sort of this great love story,
- it seems,

566
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:41,409
and also, you know, they sort
of tap into something about...

567
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,085
particularly a teenage
girl's experience growing up.

568
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,909
So you're a v... I am a vampire.

569
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:50,253
So was it Peter Mandelson this time
- you modelled it on?

570
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,445
Yes, absolutely, completely
modelled it on Peter Mandelson.

571
00:36:53,485 --> 00:37:00,973
Now, cars - you spend a lot of
time- living there in Los Angeles,

572
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:29,725
so I would assume you
have some form of hybrid.

573
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:30,413
It

574
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:30,613
It was

575
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:35,129
It was a

576
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:39,941
It was a Datsun Sunny and a Ford
 Orion. I am not one who spends a

577
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:45,193
lot of money on cars. You spend a 
lot of time in Los Angeles. I would

578
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:54,209
have assumed you would have some
 form of hybrid. No, not really.

579
00:37:54,249 --> 00:38:04,349
There is a lot of pressure. It is 
the way for a. It is. I am going to

580
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:09,273
get a Jaguar. -- the way forward.
 I'd like to get a green one.

581
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:11,661
So when you go on American chat shows
and they say, "You got a hybrid?"

582
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:13,349
You can say, "No, I have
a Jag." "I have a Ja-a-ag."

583
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:14,833
So what do you use in England?

584
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:16,569
I nip around London on a scooter.

585
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:18,629
I once rode one of those across
Vietnam. It tried to kill me.

586
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:20,709
Did you ever fall off?
They're fantastic. In fact,

587
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:25,225
when I first got the scooter, it was just
before I started playing Kenneth Williams

588
00:38:25,265 --> 00:38:27,585
in this film I did, Fantabulosa!

589
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:31,209
And I was desperately trying to lose as
much weight as I possibly could to play him,

590
00:38:31,249 --> 00:38:34,493
so I went on the cabbage soup diet
for the last ten days. Which is great,

591
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:38,973
I lost ten pounds, but I did used to lose consciousness as well.
- I was so faint.

592
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:42,693
So I was driving around on
this scooter around London,

593
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:47,165
which was scary enough as it was,
but I was also constantly farting.

594
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:49,005
My stomach was making terrible noises,

595
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:51,165
and whilst I used to drive it
I used to practise the voice,

596
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:56,445
so if anyone saw an Aprilia going
past them around the Clapham area

597
00:38:56,485 --> 00:39:00,973
with a slightly sepia-looking
visor- and a smell coming behind it

598
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:04,773
and a voice going "mrr-rr-rr-rr"
as it was going along, that was me.

599
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:06,965
Did you ever fall off it?

600
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:08,509
No, I never fell off it.

601
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:11,761
I kept the stabilisers on, obviously.

602
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:14,853
Anyway, obviously you
came here, I have to say,

603
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:17,537
Los Angeles, THIS morning...

604
00:39:17,577 --> 00:39:20,165
I came from the airport
straight here and into the car.

605
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:23,009
So you're... Well, what are
we, ten hours out... Yeah.

606
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:24,945
I have no idea what time...

607
00:39:24,985 --> 00:39:28,525
I'll tell you what time it is. It's
- 6:30am, so it's time you were up.

608
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:31,557
I think there should be a new category,
which is, instead of just "W" for "wet",

609
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:33,213
there should be "JL" for jet lag. Jet lag.
And I believe... Was it damp out there as well?

610
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:37,933
It was damp-ish.

611
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:42,257
So that's jet-lagged and damp. And there
were people shooting bows and arrows.

612
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,933
Shooting bows and arrows. Many, many
things we have to write down. Many.

613
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:49,741
Jet-lagged, damp, bows and arrows.
And I'm Welsh. And you're Welsh.

614
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,413
LAUGHTER

615
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,509
In fact, who are the other
Welsh people on there?

616
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:56,181
Have I got a chance
of being top Welshman?

617
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:59,229
Alan Davies, is he Welsh? Or does he
just have a name... He's not Welsh.

618
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:03,665
Rob Brydon. Rob Brydon
- where's he?

619
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:08,025
Tom Jones. It would be good to beat
- Dame Helen Mirren, wouldn't it?

620
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:12,509
She's here. Tom Jones did. Tom Jones is on
top of Helen Mirren, not for the first time!

621
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:14,949
There's Rob Brydon,
just below Keith Allen.

622
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:18,665
This is kind of Little Wales, here, this
area. So this is where you're aiming for.

623
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:23,009
I want to be the fastest
boy in the village.

624
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:25,133
That's Little Britain.
I've just got that.

625
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,869
I'm there! See, even
jet-lagged, I'm on form, Jeremy!

626
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:29,133
LAUGHTER

627
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:30,413
Who'd like to see the lap?

628
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:33,089
ALL: Yeah! Let's have a look at this.

629
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:34,949
Oh, dear Lord...

630
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:45,133
TYRES SCREECH

631
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:47,325
Nice, smooth gear change.
'He's really ruined that.'

632
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,073
So here we go, coming up to
the first corner... Ooh, I say,

633
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,493
that's a vigorous turn in there.

634
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:56,045
Right, so we're not going
for the smooth approach.

635
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,965
Brake, you BLEEP, brake!

636
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,841
LAUGHTER

637
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:02,201
I like the hands on the
wheel there. That's wide!

638
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:04,809
This really is...

639
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:07,933
Don't go into fourth, Michael,
go into second, try that!

640
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:11,841
Well, one'll do! No, you're
supposed to LOOK slow,

641
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:16,089
so that you're actually...
That's not looking slow.

642
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:18,089
That's looking wide again.

643
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:19,885
The Stig did say,
well, he communicated...

644
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,653
Textbook. Absolute textbook.

645
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:24,337
LAUGHTER

646
00:41:24,377 --> 00:41:26,561
That's not what The Stig
said. He said "clunky".

647
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:30,433
"Clunky but brave" is how he
described you. Clunky but brave!

648
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:33,997
It's not healthy, that's
not healthy, Michael!

649
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:35,541
Looking very Welsh.

650
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,029
That's pretty quick!

651
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:38,561
Oh-oh! Yes!

652
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,057
Now you go... Look...

653
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,185
Holy cow, that's quick!

654
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:43,933
That's very quick!

655
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:45,261
Now, what about Gambon?

656
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,589
Bloody hell, look at that!

657
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,873
And across the line! That was amazing.

658
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:55,389
CHEERING

659
00:41:55,429 --> 00:42:02,137
I have here... Mm, mm,
mm-mm-mm mm-mm-mm... LAUGHTER

660
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:04,981
If it's under Roger
Bannister's mile, I'll be happy.

661
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:06,921
Under four minutes.

662
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,545
So you want to be somewhere down...
- The top of the Welsh zone.

663
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:15,373
It would be nice if I was, you know, above
Helen, and I would love it if I was above Rob.

664
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:20,109
So they're all around the one...
Rob's 1:51.7, but that was wet.

665
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:23,829
Michael Sheen, you
did it in one minute...

666
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,293
Yes...

667
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,213
..forty...

668
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,249
..six, point three.

669
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,309
Good Lord!

670
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,421
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

671
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:37,829
Seriously.

672
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:39,421
How did that happen?

673
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:41,361
That was a brave lap.

674
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:43,313
Gordon Ramsay just committed suicide.

675
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,749
I'm sort of mystified.

676
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:50,389
That was very fast. You can see it,
- cos you were doing a million down the straight.

677
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:52,485
I heard that Tom Jones
didn't want to come in,

678
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:55,093
and it must be something Welsh,
cos I didn't want to stop,

679
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:59,577
I wanted to keep going. I could
have beaten Jay Kay. Help yourself!

680
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:01,845
There's still 20
minutes of daylight left.

681
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:04,701
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Sheen!

682
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:07,437
Thank you very much.

683
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:15,329
Thank you very much.

684
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:20,341
Now, earlier on, we built
an electric car called Geoff,

685
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:23,081
and he was...a disaster.

686
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,217
Now, I'm not one to apportion blame,

687
00:43:25,257 --> 00:43:27,813
but it was entirely James' fault.

688
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:29,625
Why?

689
00:43:29,665 --> 00:43:32,441
Well, because...Jeremy's
body was brilliant...

690
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:35,893
Er, not Jeremy's actual
body, cos that's horrible.

691
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:38,013
The one on the car. My
chassis was brilliant,

692
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:42,005
and your battery system was
terrible. Well, it wasn't! Well...

693
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:46,329
it was. And, as a result, Geoff
ended up crashed into a wood.

694
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:49,061
We didn't give up. We decided
to go back to the drawing board,

695
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:53,501
and build Geoff II.

696
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:59,877
Back at the Top Gear Technology Centre, I fitted
narrower wheels which would reduce friction.

697
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:04,221
And James, mercifully,
found some more batteries.

698
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:07,205
I've also devised a
very, very clever way

699
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:12,017
of recharging them
while we're on the move.

700
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:15,329
Meanwhile, in the mood
room, Jeremy had decided

701
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:19,049
Geoff should no longer be called Geoff.

702
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,989
Hammerhead.

703
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:24,285
Hammerhead Shark. That's a dolphin.

704
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:26,253
I know, but it's like
a hammerhead shark.

705
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:28,629
Not really. It lives in the sea. Yeah...

706
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:32,501
I'll tell you the other thing
we've got to have, is the letter I.

707
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:35,425
Why? Because if you put
little i, not capital I,

708
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,253
little i with a little dot on it,

709
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:40,005
it tells everyone who
sees it that it's eco,

710
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:45,189
and that's OK. Doesn't. It does,
cos ecomentalists are stupid.

711
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:54,645
After many days of development,
ournew, improved car was finally ready.

712
00:44:54,685 --> 00:44:57,785
But Jeremy, you haven't done anything.

713
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,725
You can't improve on perfection.

714
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:02,221
Anyway, I have done something. Look.

715
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:04,645
An energy-absorbing front end.

716
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:08,053
You can have massive accidents
and no damage will be caused.

717
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:10,473
You could run this into
a wood at top speed -

718
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:12,833
nothing would happen.

719
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:17,473
Then James unveiled his
radical new propulsion system.

720
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:23,833
Look at this! Batteries as before. But a few more
of them for extra power. Here's the clever bit.

721
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:29,085
They're recharged by that.
That is a diesel generator.

722
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:32,909
That charges the batteries? Yeah.
that a generator just from a shop?

723
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:38,961
Yeah. So, we've made a hybrid?! Yeah, sort of! No, because a hybrid
- uses a normal engine

724
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:43,005
that drives the wheels. A hybrid is
- a normal car for fools.

725
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:49,661
This just charges the battery. a diesel electric.
I got the idea from old railway locomotives.

726
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:54,849
So you just run the generator. means that
you'll never run out electricity. Exactly. Yeah.

727
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:58,053
Uses a tiny amount of fuel.

728
00:45:58,093 --> 00:46:03,037
Yeah! Seriously, credit where credit's due!
That's not something you hear often on Top Gear.

729
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:07,525
Or ever, even! That's actually
quite a good idea. Thank you.

730
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:11,053
And this will go like stink.

731
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:28,849
And it did!

732
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:32,253
Well, that's brilliant! It's
a hybrid! We've built a Prius!

733
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:34,741
You don't think the producers are
messing with the subtitles, do you?

734
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:37,973
No! They wouldn't do that!

735
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:42,101
Since our amazing Eagle i
Thrust Head had cost Â£1,000 less

736
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:45,477
than a G-Wiz, we
decided it was brilliant,

737
00:46:45,517 --> 00:46:49,585
and that we should put it on
sale to the general public.

738
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:56,197
However, before you can do that, it
must pass a series of stringent EU tests.

739
00:46:56,237 --> 00:46:59,681
So we took the Eagle Thrust to
the motor industry's top secret

740
00:46:59,721 --> 00:47:08,273
proving ground, just off the A5 between
Atherstone and Hinckley near Fenny Drayton.

741
00:47:08,313 --> 00:47:12,229
When we get out, remember, be
positive, be positive! Yes! Positive!

742
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:14,973
Everyone's a customer!

743
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:19,477
We started with one of the biggies.
- A crash test.

744
00:47:19,517 --> 00:47:22,509
We've all seen these. A car
is loaded up with dummies

745
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:26,305
and fired into a concrete block,
whilst super slow motion cameras

746
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:32,945
record the impact.

747
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:38,229
I, however, am so confident about
the Hammerhead-i Eagle Thrust,

748
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:42,993
that we will be using a
different sort of dummy.

749
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:45,977
Don't worry, we're coming as well.

750
00:47:46,017 --> 00:47:48,821
There you go. Done. Can
you paint one on my face?

751
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:53,461
Why do crash test dummies have
these things? I don't know.

752
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:58,085
For the slow motion camera that records
the impact. It gives you a datum point.

753
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,541
Oh, I'm not interested in datum points... I didn't
think it was fashion amongst crash test dummies.

754
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:04,133
Are you sure about your
new bumper design? Yeah.

755
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,605
Thank you very much.

756
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:12,589
Hang on.

757
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:14,413
We were a bit frightened

758
00:48:14,453 --> 00:48:16,789
when we saw the concrete crash block,

759
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,841
because we had to
crash into it at 30mph.

760
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:22,741
But then Jeremy had a brainwave.

761
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:25,557
Remember what I told you.

762
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:28,325
It's a very, very good plan this.

763
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:37,481
OK. Now, let's see the
slow motion crash footage.

764
00:48:37,521 --> 00:48:42,901
We're going to
cra-a-a-a-sh.

765
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:47,461


767
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:56,809
Ohhhhhh!

768
00:48:56,849 --> 00:48:58,337
Ohhhhhh!

769
00:48:58,377 --> 00:49:04,653
Ow...my...chest.

770
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:09,213
Do you think we fooled them? Yeah!
Yeah. We're alive! We're alive! Wow!

771
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:11,169
We sur... That was...

772
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:14,541
It's not even marked! Oh, man,
that was, oh...! Staggering!

773
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:17,965
I think this is very convincing.

774
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:25,589
Shush, shush, OK, it's now time to watch
that crash at the speed it actually happened.

775
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,949
We're going to crash!

776
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,765
Ooh! Oh, my nose!

777
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:33,949
Oh! Oh! Ow, my chest!

778
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:38,793
And there we are, a superb
result in the crash test.

779
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:43,889
So, let's move on, shall we
and do...the pendulum test!

780
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:46,697
This is designed to measure
how a car will stand up

781
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:55,261
to being side-swiped
by a bus or a truck.

782
00:49:55,301 --> 00:50:01,293
Frankly, it was hard to see how we could possible
pass this, but then James came up with a plan.

783
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:04,545
We need a camera. Yeah.

784
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,765
A plan that would fool even
the most astute EU bureaucrat.

785
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:13,949
Action! Wow! Wow! Wow! THEY LAUGH

786
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:16,233
Pendulum!

787
00:50:16,273 --> 00:50:18,169
TOU KOOL!

788
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:26,281
Oh, right. So, now our car is going
- to face the fearsome pendulum test.

789
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,965
SPEECH IS REVERSED

790
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,669
PENDULUM CLANGS

791
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:34,573
Wow! Wow! Wow!

792
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:39,249
Wow indeed! Another pass! And happy
- that our car was completely safe,

793
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,593
we lined it up for a drag race.

794
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:49,889
We would be up against a Toyota Prius.

795
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:51,777
Chris Hoy's next-door neighbour.

796
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:55,389
Hannah...the fastest girl in our office.

797
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:59,517
And our main rival, the G-Wiz.

798
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:04,125
This was the quietest starting line
- in drag racing history.

799
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:06,981
ENGINE STARTS

800
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:08,953
Until Hammond started the generator.

801
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:13,293
OK, this is it! The future is here!

802
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:19,469
Three, two, one!

803
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:23,081
Did he jump the start? No.

804
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,361
I am so in the lead, straight away!

805
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:30,389
Oh! The Toyota's gone!

806
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:34,005
Where's the G-Wiz? I am all over it!

807
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:38,205
Come on!

808
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:41,645
This is brilliant! I'm going to win,
- I'm going to win!

809
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:49,845
Yes! Yes! Yes!

810
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:52,237
JEREMY LAUGHS Yes!

811
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,157
He beat the G-Wiz! By a mile!

812
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:55,749
He beat the G-Wiz!

813
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:57,893
And as ever, Hammond
was gracious in victory!

814
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:00,577
Yeah! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

815
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,957
Oh, yeah!

816
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:03,597
What do you think of that, then?

817
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:07,845
With your stupid little plastic gerbil!

818
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:11,421
Next we had to drive on
the fearsome Belgian Pave,

819
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,421
in a test designed to measure
both comfort and build quality.

820
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:17,285
VEHICLE CLANGS ALONG

821
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:19,861
THEY SHOUT WITH DISCOMFORT

822
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:22,297
Oh! Haw, haw, haw!

823
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:28,113
The chassis is smashing into the ground. It's
his generator weighs too much for my suspension.

824
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:30,189
Ow!

825
00:52:30,229 --> 00:52:33,769
James! What?! The chimney's come off!

826
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:36,689
Oh! Oh! That's quite...

827
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:38,881
Quite a lot of smoke in here!

828
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:42,521
THEY COUGH It's all
collecting in my Pope box!

829
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:44,801
VEHICLE CLANGS AND CLANKS Ow!

830
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:48,533
But we're still going!

831
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:50,957
Yeah, we're hammering now!

832
00:52:50,997 --> 00:52:53,597
Ow!

833
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,141
Oh! Has one of the doors fallen off?

834
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:59,333
No! No? Well then we
passed! I think we have.

835
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:05,285
It's an EU regulation. Is it? It actually
says if the doors are on after doing this,

836
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:10,645
then you've passed!
Well, they're still on!

837
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:14,769
Although we'd been a bit
gassed, the torture wasn't over!

838
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:19,709
So we re-attached the stove pipe and
went to see how the Eagle i-Thrust

839
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:23,253
would perform in the fearsome steep
- hill test.

840
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:27,881
OK, we're off!

841
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:35,069
GRILLE CLANGS Come on!

842
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:46,165
Come on.

843
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:49,849
I think we've passed this! Yeah!
Well done, everybody, that's good!

844
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:52,145
Yeah, we've passed. I bet the
G-Wiz wouldn't get up here.

845
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:54,301
I bet it wouldn't! No!

846
00:53:54,341 --> 00:53:59,069
In the interest of fairness, we decided
to see how the G-Wiz would get on.

847
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:04,833
Using, of course, an
independent test driver!

848
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:07,629
Is he good, this guy?

849
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:11,913
He's independent, that's
the important thing.

850
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:15,381
It's Â£1,000 more than our
car, this. Hard to believe.

851
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:18,553
Will it go 1,000 feet higher
up this hill? Let's see!

852
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:21,085
Oh! It... Uh...

853
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,929
It's struggling!

854
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,149
Now that's a failure! Yeah, there
you go! Right there, that's a failure!

855
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:34,005
The Ham Head Eagle i was sailing through
every test the EU could throw at it!

856
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:36,585
But then it was time to
head to the wind tunnel

857
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:41,457
where we could measure the
aerodynamic efficiency of that body.

858
00:54:41,497 --> 00:54:45,989
Where's Hammond? I'll call him.

859
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:48,853
Hello, lads. We gonna get
on with this? THEY LAUGH

860
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:52,273
Let's get going. What?! That
works! What? What? Nothing! Nothing!

861
00:54:52,313 --> 00:54:55,133
Well come on, then, how does it work?
I don't know. How hard can it be?

862
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:58,885
Ready! FANS START

863
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:02,993
FANS WHIRR Yes! Look
at this! Oh, my God!

864
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:07,245
There we go, 12. 13. Here
we go. Look at the speed!

865
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:15,681
28mph. I'm gonna take
this baby up a bit!

866
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:18,537
When the body work ripples like
that, it does look beautiful.

867
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:20,305
It looks like a fish!

868
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:25,365
A really square fish with wooden ears.

869
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:31,177
It's also moving. It's moving.
Did you put the handbrake on?

870
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:35,229
Now, that's... Stop it or it'll go
in the fans! No, make it stop now!

871
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:39,197
Stop! Stop it, Jeeves! Stop it!

872
00:55:39,237 --> 00:55:41,761
How do you stop the bloody fan?!

873
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:45,605
CRASHING

874
00:55:45,645 --> 00:55:49,617
Despite the slight issue with the fans,
we decided that our car had passed.

875
00:55:49,657 --> 00:55:53,525
So we moved on to what
would be the final hurdle.

876
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:56,121
The i-Ham would be
driven round the clock,

877
00:55:56,161 --> 00:56:01,713
flat out on the proving ground's
test track, to measure it's range.

878
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:05,557
Obviously, in these conditions,
it's damp, there's a bit of drizzle

879
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:09,229
in the air. The concentration
required to do this,

880
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:15,229
is just immense! It's too demanding, we
couldn't do that. No. But we know a man who can!

881
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:19,821
He's not the Stig, but he is
the Stig's vegetarian cousin.

882
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:21,869
# All the leaves are brown

883
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:26,805
# And the sky is grey

884
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:30,073
# I've been for a walk... #

885
00:56:30,113 --> 00:56:36,841
What's he called? His name
is...Janet Stig Porter. Oh!

886
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:39,213
Right! Fire up that generator!

887
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:42,637
ENGINE STARTS

888
00:56:42,677 --> 00:56:46,293
Go!

889
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:52,917
Look at the speed of him.

890
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:57,949
James, how long, realistically, are
- you expecting that to keep going?

891
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,917
Well, I've topped up the
geni-tank,- so that's eight hours

892
00:57:00,957 --> 00:57:04,541
on the generator. And that fully
charges the batteries as well,

893
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:07,229
so you get another hour out
of those, just the batteries.

894
00:57:07,269 --> 00:57:19,213
So realistically, you're looking
for nine hours of running? Yeah.

895
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:28,229
SIRENS WAIL

896
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:32,229
What's happened there is...
Well, the Stig's died. Yeah.

897
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:34,745
And that's because the
stove pipe came off.

898
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:41,057
Now if we re-attach that stove I think
I'm right in saying, am I not, gentlemen,

899
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:48,325
that the Thrust i Eagle Hammer Head
- is ready for its road test. Yes. It's ready.

900
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:51,873
Obviously, we couldn't do
that, because we'd be biased,

901
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:58,605
so we decided to lend it to Britain's oldest
motoring magazine for an independent review.

902
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,153
They test all the latest cars
and innovations and to make sure

903
00:58:02,193 --> 00:58:06,389
they didn't realise who were the
brains behind the Eagle Head i Hammer,

904
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:13,029
we had it dropped off
by an anonymous driver.

905
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:19,701
Hello, how can I help you?

906
00:58:19,741 --> 00:58:33,293
All we could do now was
wait for their verdict.

907
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:39,889
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

908
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:47,217
Now, we have been sent advanced copies
of the magazine that has reviewed our car.

909
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,497
Here it is! HE GASPS

910
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:52,701
We're on the cover! We're on the cover!

911
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:56,137
We have! Right, where is it?

912
00:58:56,177 --> 00:59:04,389
The Eagle... Right, here we go!

913
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:11,137
LAUGHTER

914
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:17,829
Erm...it says in the ride and handling section
where they deal with things like the chassis,

915
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:23,013
that to all intents and purposes, the Hammer Head
Eagle i-Thrust has no ride and handling as such,

916
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:25,857
instead it lurches around
almost uncontrollably.

917
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:28,797
LAUGHTER

918
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:32,593
Oh, God Almighty, no, it
gets worse! Listen to this.

919
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:36,985
They say that in the Highway Code, they say the stopping distance from
- 70mph is 215 feet.
