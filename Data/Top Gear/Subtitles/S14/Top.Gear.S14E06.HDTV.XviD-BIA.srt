Top Gear 14x06 - Bolivia Special
By KArkhon ( pix [at] sfcentar.com ) for Addic7ed.com

2
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:20,076
Hello, everybody. Hello. Thank you.

3
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,985
Hello!

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,017
Hello and welcome
to a Top Gear special,

5
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:28,017
which tonight comes to you
from South America.

6
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:32,036
Yeah. The brief was simple. Each
of us would be given a pittance.

7
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,079
And we were told we could
buy any car we liked

8
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:38,053
from a second-hand car
website in Bolivia.

9
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:41,969
Yeah. And the only bit of advice
we got, rather worryingly,

10
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:45,044
was that it would be best if we
chose a car with four-wheel drive.

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,039
We were then told we would
be united with our cars

12
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:51,000
somewhere around here in
a place called Spidertown,

13
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:55,004
right in the middle
of the Amazon Rainforest.

14
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:01,056
These are the views that
greeted us from our helicopter.

15
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:03,969
Except they're not,

16
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:07,048
because the helicopter
booked for us had crashed.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,064
That meant we had to
borrow these pictures

18
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,048
from Bruce Parry's programme...

19
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,048
.. and go to the start
point in a boat...

20
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,001
utterly bewildered by everything.

21
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:24,057
Look at that purple tree!
The butterfly's more amazing.

22
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:29,032
No, the purple tree's the best. No!The butterfly was the size of a bat.

23
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,061
Another crocodile over there.

24
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:33,036
It's not a crocodile,
it's a lump of wood.

25
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,061
Bird! Bird!

26
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:39,064
We're close to the Equator. We'revery close. Perhaps we're on it!

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,001
No, we'd see a big dotted line.

28
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:44,084
'And we weren't the only
fish out of water. '

29
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:48,036
It jumped in the boat!
It jumped in the boat!

30
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:51,032
In the boat!I've got it with my knife!

31
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,017
Ha-ha! Is that a piranha?

32
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:56,049
It's not a piranha,
they're long and thin.

33
00:01:56,084 --> 00:02:00,020
They're not! No, they're not!They are! They're short and fat!

34
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:01,028
Oh, that's sharks.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,028
'Eventually, the boat dumped the
three worst explorers in history

36
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,064
'on a bank,
in the middle of nowhere...

37
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,053
'and left. '

38
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:15,068
Have we just been abandoned here
to die? Whoa-whoa! What is it, what?

39
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:18,096
Are those zips?! Well,
they're outdoor trousers.

40
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:20,997
You can unzip the bottoms?! Yes!

41
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:25,026
I'm sorry, on the kit front, chaps...
James, what's all this?

42
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,558
This is my belt of many things.
What is that? Don't touch it.

43
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:32,056
That's a dental healthcare kit.
What's this? Don't touch it!

44
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:34,028
That is a shoe-polishing kit.

45
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,017
What?!

46
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:39,061
A shoe-polishing kit! Thank God for that If
we get hungry, we can eat his Kiwi boot polish!

47
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:44,048
Basically, what you've done is buy a "My First
Explorer" kit, put it on your belt... Don't touch it.

48
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,004
'Hammond then revealed
a little secret. '

49
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,031
So all these insects, where are they?

50
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,024
Why, are you frightened of insects?

51
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:52,985
Yeah. Are you? Yeah. Really?

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,048
Don't mess about. Seriously,
I am. It's a phobia.

53
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,053
It's like you and heights.

54
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:59,080
It's not you're scared of
falling off, it's a phobia.

55
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,037
You are scared of heights. This is the same, it's a phobia.

56
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:06,036
I just don't... What's yours? Phobia?Manual labour, you know that.

57
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,029
That's not a phobia,
that's bone idleness.

58
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:12,008
Rubbish! That's not a clinical
thing, that's just cos you're lazy.

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,096
'Since we didn't know what to do,
we just sat down and did nothing. '

60
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,048
I'm sure there's spiders in here,
there will be. Shh.

61
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,000
What?

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,044
Is that... Uh-oh... in harmony with nature?

63
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,084
Stop playing ethnic tunes. Boys...

64
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,088
Cars.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,001
'Plainly, there had been
a terrible mix-up

66
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:47,044
'because one of the cars
on the raft was a little Suzuki.

67
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,037
'None of us would
have been that daft.

68
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:53,076
'But then we remembered...
James was with us. '

69
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:58,001
1.3 litre... 1.3 litre!.. Wine bar specials.

70
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:01,024
Famous for being able to stay
on their own four wheels...

71
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,049
No, no, no. Falling over.

72
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:06,036
I presume then the Land Cruiser,
by power of deduction, is yours.

73
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,981
Yes, it is. Correct choice,
everyone will agree.

74
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:13,048
And you have, if my eyes are not
deceiving me, a Range Rover.

75
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,989
The best 4x4, by far, as we know.

76
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,036
I had one of those. Yeah, classic. I had one as well. Yeah.

77
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:24,056
Did yours ever... work? No.

78
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:27,061
How is that raft steering itself?

79
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:29,965
There's a little boat
behind it, look.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,064
'The driver of the little boat pushed
the raft vaguely near the bank... '

81
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,008
Right. Well, we can get... No,
don't do that, we need to get it...

82
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,033
'.. and then went home. '

83
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:43,040
Is that him just gone? Yep.

84
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,012
Oi! You haven't parked it!

85
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:54,040
'We tried to pull the raft nearer to
the bank but it was very difficult. '

86
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:57,012
Heave! It's not moving!

87
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:57,981
'So we gave up. '

88
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,000
That's it, lads.
Up the gang plank.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,013
Ow! There's a thing there.

90
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:07,084
We are good. It's like literallybeing with Livingstone... Yeah.

91
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,593
.. and...

92
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:10,033
THEY LAUGH

93
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:14,032
Do you want a hand up? Help!Probably quite painful!

94
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,057
It was. Don't worry, I'm all right.

95
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:20,061
'Eventually, even
Indiana Clarkson was onboard

96
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:23,056
'so we could get our first look
at what we'd bought

97
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,013
'from the Bolivian classifieds. '

98
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:29,540
Notoriously long-lived,
sturdy, reliable, small, agile.

99
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:33,997
What does it say in the advert
in the Bolivian Auto Trader?

100
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:36,092
I'll tell you what it did show in
the picture. That it was blue.

101
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,061
THEY LAUGH

102
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:42,028
Did it say, in the advert, that all
four tyres would be pumped up?

103
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:44,993
No. HE LAUGHS

104
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,061
Oh, bloody hell. We did buy these long distance.

105
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:51,084
'The only thing saggier than
my tyre was Hammond's roof.

106
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,607
It wasn't always
a convertible, was it?

107
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:56,061
No, it's been converted
to a convertible.

108
00:05:56,096 --> 00:06:00,036
It's been converted by someone
who is A, of Spanish descent

109
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:01,013
and B, a communist.

110
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:03,060
It's a tasty car all round.
I'm very pleased.

111
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,973
I like the see-through...

112
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,084
I like this. The window's not here,
it's here and there's no winder.

113
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,057
I don't need one, it's hot.

114
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:13,965
'To demonstrate what fools
the others had been,

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,048
'I showed them the beating heart
of my mighty Ranger Rover. '

116
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:24,049
Behold, gentlemen,the 3.9 litre V8 engine. Ahem.

117
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,052
3.9, yeah? 3.9. They had injection,
didn't they, Hammond, the 3.9?

118
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,072
Yes. All of them were fuel-injected.

119
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,061
What are those on top?

120
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:35,060
I believe they're carburettors.
They look like carburettors.

121
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,024
BLEEP. They ARE carburettors. They are carburettors, yeah.

122
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,057
That can't be a 3.9, mate,
that's a 3.5!

123
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:44,076
It said in the advert is was a 3.9!
It said mine was blue.

124
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,005
OK, so there's some issues.

125
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,025
You'll be opening
the bonnet a lot. I won't.

126
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,989
You will! That's what killed these
off, globally. Why does everywhere,

127
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:56,048
all over the world, anywhere difficult
and inhospitable use a Toyota Land Cruiser?

128
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,005
First Aztec bird we come across,

129
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,056
she'll make a bee-line
for me in this.

130
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:01,989
Yeah, OK.

131
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:07,060
'We could've continued arguing,
but we had to leap ashore... '

132
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,009
'Well, come on, then. '

133
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:12,044
'.. Because our challenge
had arrived. '

134
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,045
Thank you very much.

135
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,997
OK. It says, "You are in Bolivia.

136
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:23,072
"And you will drive to the Pacific
Ocean, which is 1,000 miles away. "

137
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:27,056
So we have to go 1,000 miles. There's a jungle in the way.

138
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,061
And the jungle would
just be the start of it,

139
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:35,096
because on our journey we'd have
to negotiate active volcanoes,

140
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:40,076
utterly lifeless deserts and
perilous mountain passes.

141
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:47,036
But before all that, we had
to get our cars off the raft.

142
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:51,028
Which, as you can plainly see,
would not be easy.

143
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,031
Clearly!

144
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, come on!

145
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,096
'Trying to move the raft
soon led to a problem. '

146
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,091
Holy moly!

147
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:03,017
I am sinking.

148
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:06,041
Yeah. It's getting deeper!Pull yourself out.

149
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:09,076
I cannot pull myself out. Every time the bubbles come out,

150
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,013
you go in deeper. I know!

151
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:15,012
That's brilliant! Oh, God, no.

152
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:17,025
THEY LAUGH

153
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,061
As I sank into the ooze,

154
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,556
my colleagues became
increasingly concerned.

155
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,981
His plums are in the Amazon, look!
THEY LAUGH

156
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:28,056
Go and get a rope or something,
just to tie around my waist.

157
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,989
All right, we'll get something.

158
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,033
'Eventually, and rather reluctantly,

159
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:36,040
'they decided to pull me out
with my Range Rover. '

160
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:38,573
Hammond! Yes!What are you bloody doing?

161
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:41,072
You want a proper knot,
don't you? No!

162
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,599
Just any old knot.

163
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,331
Will it start?

164
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,028
ENGINE STALLS

165
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:46,997
Oh.

166
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,969
ENGINE STALLS
Start!

167
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,034
You brought the wrong car.

168
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,064
ENGINE STARTS
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

169
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,081
Backwards!

170
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,029
Pull. Pull.

171
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:00,092
You coming up? Yes! Oh, yes!

172
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:01,969
Ow! Say when.

173
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:03,033
All right. Here we go. Yes.

174
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:06,012
Ow, my arm parts. Is it loose enough?

175
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,045
Yes. Stop, stop, stop.

176
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,981
Stop. So, as we can see,
my car's best.

177
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,028
Well, it didn't let you down there,
when it really mattered.

178
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:16,008
'Trying to move the raft
had resulted in nothing more

179
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:19,016
'than some muddy tide-marks
on my trousers. '

180
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,016
My jeans are ruined!

181
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:26,024
And so, with half the day gone,
we had to come up with a new plan.

182
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:30,032
You know, in the Second World War,
when a submarine was grounded?

183
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,049
When it had hit the bottom?

184
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:36,080
They used to get the crew to run backwards and
forwards and it would sort of shuffle it along.

185
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:39,016
Are you suggesting
we run backwards and forwards?

186
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,997
No, no, no! Use the cars.

187
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:43,017
If we go right
to the back of the boat,

188
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,993
that weighs the back down
and lifts the front up.

189
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:50,036
We then charge forward. The act of
doing that will shuffle the boat

190
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,092
nearer to that bank. That's a good idea!

191
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,056
'All we needed to do, then,
was back our cars up a bit. '

192
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,064
Oh, no. Hammond!Has anybody got any jump leads?

193
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,057
Seriously? You're joking. It won't start.

194
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:08,013
Just want to get this
completely clear again.

195
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:12,016
Range Rover - starting, working
well. Already saved a man's life.

196
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:14,092
Land Cruiser - broken down.

197
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, smoke! Smoke, smoke, quite a lot
of smoke. Something's on fire!

198
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,025
The starter motor's burn out.

199
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,044
'Despite using the
correct technique,

200
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,028
'Hammond couldn't
get his car going. '

201
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:28,017
It's on fire again!

202
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:32,973
And so, with the sun sinking,
I offered to help.

203
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,004
Why don't we simply attach it
to the back of the Range Rover

204
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,021
and I'll you a pull from here?

205
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:41,072
Because I'd rather drown myself,
but, yeah, it's... All right!

206
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:46,041
What's that noise?

207
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:49,985
Insects! Massive insects. Millions of them.

208
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,004
Just hurry up, quickly!All right, move forwards.

209
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,973
Mind your head!

210
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,009
'As the light faded, we lined up

211
00:10:56,044 --> 00:11:00,020
'for the most ambitious
jump-start in history. '

212
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,993
And... stop.

213
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:07,016
Three, two, one, go!

214
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,053
Sorry! What did you do that for?!

215
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:17,000
My breaks aren't very good!
Did it work? No.

216
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,048
Try again!

217
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,076
What happened? Nothing.

218
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:29,012
And... stop.

219
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:34,036
Three, two, one, go.

220
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,048
Try again! That's the good thing
about Range Rovers,

221
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,053
they can do this all night.

222
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:46,016
Yes, yes. When this thing starts,
it'll brilliant.

223
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:51,068
'The morning light
revealed our progress. '

224
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:58,044
Sitrep... Everything we tried
in the night didn't work.

225
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,021
But we have found peanuts.

226
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:04,045
'Rather embarrassingly,
James then discovered something. '

227
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,048
These planks are longer than that one
you've been falling down constantly.

228
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,589
If you get in here and
grab the other end...

229
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:13,061
Are they long enough to...?
Two together will.

230
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:19,020
'Soon, we had a ramp and our first
car was ready to disembark. '

231
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:21,060
Watch the long-haired man.

232
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:27,028
Let's see his back wheels on.
Don't stand there.

233
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:30,008
Do you want us to help you?
You're all right.

234
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,072
You're all right this side.

235
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,052
You're all right.

236
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,989
Yes!

237
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:39,024
Oh! Four-wheel drive! It is
four-wheel drive, you half-wit.

238
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,051
Well, why are the front wheels
not doing anything?

239
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:45,044
Don't tell me they don't work.
Try again! Say when...

240
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,051
OK! It's not good!

241
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:48,989
That's stuck now.

242
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,016
'The whole weight of James'
three-wheel drive Suzuki

243
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,025
'was resting on our ramp.

244
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,088
'So we had to build another one. '

245
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,969
You're all right. Right.

246
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,032
Range Rover, British engineering,
don't let me down.

247
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,020
To the left.

248
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,060
Poo is coming out.

249
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:12,088
Here we go!

250
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:21,012
Now that's what I call
four-wheel drive!

251
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:23,981
Having rescued a man from the ooze,

252
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:28,020
the mighty Range Rover would now
rescue the Suzuki.

253
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:29,969
There's only an ounce to pull.

254
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:33,036
Please be gentle with this,
Jeremy, and not a yob.

255
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,048
Power!

256
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,068
Got him. Stop, stop, stop!

257
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,028
Yes, that's it!

258
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:45,009
What a pillock!

259
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:48,008
'I then lined up
to pull the brakeless,

260
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,080
'powerless Toyota down the ramp. '

261
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:55,548
We were supposed to be
averaging 100 miles a day.

262
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,068
So far, we've done, well,
I've done, about 20 feet.

263
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,029
Ready?

264
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,068
No. Right, he's ready. Gently.

265
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,040
Oh, dear God.

266
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:08,052
Go.

267
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,056
Ha, ha, ha!

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,993
'Finally, we were all off the raft.

269
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:31,032
'And, as a reward, the producers
gave us a box of things

270
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:34,068
'to help us survive
the perils that lay ahead. '

271
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:38,029
Chainsaw. That's good, that's useful.

272
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:41,076
What is this? I know what
that is, that's a winch.

273
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,009
Some rubber tubing.

274
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:47,056
Durex. Condoms? Vaseline.

275
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,977
Tampax... and...

276
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,053
Viagra. I know we're gonna
be in the jungle together,

277
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:56,016
but that's a bit extreme. What
kind of party are they planning?

278
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:58,072
'We loaded up
the Ann Summers box... '

279
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,029
'.. jump started Hammond's car... '

280
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:06,036
Yee-ha! Is that working?Now you're gonna see!

281
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,557
Go! Fire it up! Jungle!

282
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,044
'.. and got cracking. '

283
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:20,024
'The jungle was a worthy adversary. '

284
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,040
Oh!

285
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,000
'But, for hour after hour,
we battled our way through. '

286
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,062
Do you want more?

287
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,040
This is the marker!

288
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:43,092
Rainforest. Shit. Good job!

289
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Guys... I left my phone down
by the river.

290
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,029
Oh, God.

291
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:57,024
Dipstick. I'm going
to have to go and get it.

292
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,056
Just wait here, I'll go get it.

293
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,029
Take care.

294
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:06,008
Oh! Oh, mate. Finally,
we are making progress.

295
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:07,997
Hammond! Yeah?

296
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,057
Did I leave it on that rock?

297
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:15,012
No, it was on the stump I tied
the raft too. Just by the rock.

298
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,013
OK, got it! OK.

299
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,041
Got it. Good. Let's move!

300
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,056
Now we're making progress,
let's keep up the momentum.

301
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,009
'Soon, we found a logging track

302
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,000
'where finally we could
get to know our cars. '

303
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,538
Time to find out what
is working on my Range Rover.

304
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,076
All these dials in the middle
made by Smiths - so, no.

305
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,084
Speedo, no.

306
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:42,088
The Range Rover was designed by
a man called Charles Spencer-King,

307
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:44,985
who was, no question, a genius.

308
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,528
Unfortunately, it was
then made in the Midlands,

309
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:54,815
just "that'll do".
Everything was "that'll do".

310
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,068
An UNBELIEVABLE piece of design,
ruined by minkies.

311
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,985
That said, however,

312
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,044
I seem to have bought the only 1980s
Range Rover in the world that works.

313
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:15,012
Given that Land Cruisers are
legendarily reliable and bulletproof,

314
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,993
this one isn't.

315
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:22,012
Oil pressure gauge, not working.
Temperature gauge, not working.

316
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,051
Fuel gauge... dunno.

317
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,021
Brakes not working.

318
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:28,017
That makes this one more special.

319
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:33,052
I have bought the only malfunctioning
Land Cruiser in the world.

320
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:37,048
And it is unique and therefore
probably priceless.

321
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:43,045
'Sure, my Suzuki only
had three-wheel drive,

322
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,016
'but I wasn't going to let that
tiny detail spoil the day. '

323
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,037
You're probably looking at
this Suzuki and thinking,

324
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:55,052
"It's small and comical, it's a toy
off-road, it's for hairdressers,"

325
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:59,032
And all the rest of it, but I'll
tell you what it is - it's plucky.

326
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:01,009
It's a bit like Finland in the war.

327
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:04,068
Look at Jeremy's Range Rover
lumbering along

328
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:06,033
this great, heavy beast of burden.

329
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:10,032
this is like a little mountain goat,
it just skips along. 'May?'

330
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,973
Talk of the devil. Hello.

331
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,973
Just to let you know, one of your
rear lights is hanging off,

332
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,032
but it's OK, I can mend it for you
with a small Phillips on my belt.

333
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:23,032
The voice there of the missing
member of Van Halen.

334
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:34,057
'Darkness fell,
but the temperature didn't. '

335
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:39,078
How can it be this hot at midnight?

'Hammond, however, had more to worry
about than the heat. '

337

338
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:51,056
There's something in here
squeaking at me, I'm... Oh, ho!

339
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,041
Bleurgh! Ah!

340
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:57,028
Oh! OH! What is that?!

341
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:58,981
Oh! BLEEP.

342
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:02,096
I can't stand that! I can't stand
that! I've gotta get out!

Ooh. There is a snake in your car.

He's coming up here.
He's coming up here.

It's known locally as
"the big vicious killer snake. "

Thanks.

Who's got my trouser-leg?

384
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:10,025
Has your trouser-leg gone missing?

'We soldiered on with the Range Rover up front,
forging a path through the dense jungle. '

386

Look at it - rescuing other cars,
ploughing through here.

387
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:25,080
My sweat being soaked up
by the floor!

388
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:32,008
But soon, the strain of point duty
began to show.

389
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:37,024
This is now smelling hot, this car.

390
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:45,000
I can smell Jeremy's Range Rover from back here
- it smells of imminent failure.

391
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,008
'I was right. '

392
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:52,000
Range Rover's just stopped working.

393
00:21:57,044 --> 00:22:01,009
That honestly wasn't very funny three
series ago and it's not funny now.

394
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:05,076
I'm not doing it on purpose. No, I
haven't got any brakes. That's how I stop.

395
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,008
Oh, no. Oh... No.
James, it's over-heated.

396
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,088
What a rotten bit of luck.

397
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:17,005
Missing! Broken!

398
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,017
Your fault, because I have been
forging a path through this stuff.

399
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:26,052
Bamboo has gone into it and broken my
fan and now my engine's overheating.

400
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:30,029
The plucky Brit has wounded itself
helping you out.

401
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:34,041
Your plucky British car has been
defeated by... What was it? Bamboo?

402
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:40,068
How did it get in there? What kind of design is it if
a piece of bamboo can get in there and break the fan?

403
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:41,985
Bamboo?!

404
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,969
Without this,
would you still be on the boat?

405
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:48,004
Yes, you would. Yes. You would still
be on the river-bank.

406
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,973
This is the hero of the day.

407
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:56,024
We passed the time by bickering
until the engine had cooled down.

408
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:59,016
I love the V8 rumble. Nice.

409
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:01,045
It's very mighty.

410

411
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,005
Yes!

412
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,028
The mighty Spitfire is down,
but not out.

413
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:14,060
'We battled on through
the undergrowth. '

414
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:18,036
There, that's a gear.

415
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,068
We did that
without breaking anything.

416
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:34,088
Whoa!

417
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,036
'Eventually, Hammond
and May stopped. '

418
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:46,025
Sorry!

419
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,012
Because we had reached
a small gully.

420
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:51,068
That's pretty steep.

421
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:52,037
What?!

422
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:57,012
That's a bit of a gully, I think
they call it. I'm just going todrive down and out the other side.

423
00:23:57,047 --> 00:23:58,017
No. You can't.

424
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:01,064
What is the biggest strength
with the Range Rover?

425
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,076
The wheel hits the bottom
before the front of the car.

426
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:07,037
If you look at a Porsche Cayenne
or your car,

427
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:10,024
there's about 18 feet of car
in front of the wheels.

428
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:12,076
This car cannot do that.
It won't make...

429
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:15,096
I'm going down. You two, stand back.

430
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:17,965
Watch and learn.

431
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,008
If you believe something
will happen, it will happen.

432
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,039
Low range. That was reverse.

433
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:26,036
Pointless handbrake off.

434
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,009
Oh, Lord.

435
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:38,033
Oh, brilliant.

436
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,064
Yeah, so you're now stuck in a whole.

437
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:43,017
Just lock the diffs. Just...

438
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:47,985
You great, dozy,
woolly-haired pillock.

439
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,000
It needs to be winched out. I knew that a while back.

440
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:54,008
'I fired up the winch on my Suzuki. '

441
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:57,048
James, winch me up.

442
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,057
Is it moving?

443
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:02,048
It's coming. It's trying hard.

444
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,017
Come on.

445
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,041
It is coming free.

446
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:11,092
Uh, guys? Oh, my God. Uh, James. It won't stop.

447
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:16,021
That didn't work.

448
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:20,076
Go on, then. Drive it out. It won't drive out. It just won't.

449
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:23,064
'Mystic Hammond was right. '

450
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:32,989
That nearly worked.

could regain some dignity.

was clear instructions from us two. '

Little bit left, James.

I would say, not left.

at this point is power.

Maximum power.

completely dark. '

agonising death.

506
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,096
I'd love to know
how hot this engine is.

507
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,965
Very is what I'm thinking.

508
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,969
'So when we made camp that night,

509
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:16,036
'I decided to cut
some vents in the bonnet. '

510
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,024
Jeremy, my car's on fire.
Well, put beer on it.

511
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,021
There's a fire extinguisher
in the car.

512
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,074
You set my car on fire.
I haven't got my glasses.

513
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,092
Pull the bloody pin out.
You burned my Toyota!

514
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:38,016
Thank you. Yeah.

515
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,000
Right, day three... Four!

516
00:29:56,024 --> 00:30:00,096
Uh, it clings.

517
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,040
OK.

518
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:09,076
Ladies and gentlemen, David Lee Roth
in the morning. Here he is.

519
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,084
James?

520
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:18,013
What we've done... Don't do that.

521
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:21,092
What we've done is accidentally
camped on a road.

522
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,076
Who's this bloke on a bike?

523
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:27,021
Morning. Morning.

524
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:31,084
He's going to work
and we're camping on the A1.

525
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:37,092
Yup.

526
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:48,096
I can't remember if I took
my malaria pill this morning.

527
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:52,048
If I were a girl,
I'd be pregnant a lot.

528
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:57,060
If you're watching this in smellovision, I
apologise because the smell in here is disgusting.

529
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:58,037
It's me.

530
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:01,045
I absolutely reek!

531
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,040
Luckily, we then got a shower.

532
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,041
Well, one of us did.

533
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:19,084
Hammond? Yes. How wet
are you getting in this rain?

534
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,053
It's not bad, actually.

535
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,993
It's quite a lot wetter here.

536
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:28,044
How can the rain be heavier there
that it is over here?

537
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,028
That's a river.

538
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,013
'It was indeed a river and one that
we'd have to cross

539
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:44,012
'which meant that we'd have to use stuff from
the Ann Summers chest to waterproof our cars. '

540
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:48,068
Right. These are condoms. Do you two
need some time to yourselves?

541
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,001
Have you got those Tampax?Wh... What?!

542
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:57,024
What are you planning?
I'll tell you my big problem.

543
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,012
It's my fuel filler cap.
If water gets in there...

544
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:01,559
You're in a lot of trouble.

545
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:03,037
If I put a Tampax in there,

546
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,076
it will expand width-ways
and I've seen the adverts.

547
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:09,053
I'll be able to go roller-blading
with a poodle

548
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:12,973
or drive a Range Rover through
a river in the Amazon delta.

549
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:18,036
James was suspiciously skilful
with the Vaseline and the condoms.

550
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,080
And soon, we were ready
to enter the river.

551
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:26,088
HE HUMS

552
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:36,012
Now, do I follow in Hammond's wheel-marks
on the basis that we know how deep it is,

553
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:41,040
or do I think, "He's an incompetent
fool and go somewhere else?"

554
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:46,000
'As it turned out,
I was an incompetent fool. '

555
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:47,084
That's looking DEEP!

556
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,057
Oh-ho!

557
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:53,032
Please, keep going.
Little donkey, swim!

558
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:57,965
Swim, swim. There you go.

559
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,985
This is when, suddenly, the
Land Cruiser comes into its own.

560
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,096
Yeah, there's maybe more comfortable
things that will get you there,

561
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:08,068
but the Land Cruiser
will always get you home.

562
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:10,569
Meanwhile...

563
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:13,001
It's stopped!

564
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:16,554
Aah! Water's coming in to my car.

565
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:20,037
'This caused problems for James. '

566
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:23,057
You're going to have to go
round the outside.

567
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:27,084
Straight ahead there. I'll tell you
when to go right hand down.

568
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,076
Good. There.

569
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,548
Oh, God!

570
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,981
Cock!

571
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,981
Good, good. That's two. OK.

572
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:42,017
Why did I listen to you,
you imbecile!

573
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:48,080
'Rather than accept another winch from the Toyota,
the Range Rover decided to start on its own. '

574
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:52,024
ENGINE STARTS

575
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:52,993
Ha-ha!

576
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:59,084
'Thus removing the obstacle James had
been trying to avoid when he got stuck. '

577
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,028
As far as I can work out,
he's dragging it even deeper.

578
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:04,981
HE LAUGHS

579
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:06,064
Hoi, it's floating.

580
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:11,032
There's a lot of bubbles came out
of your petrol-filler cap.

581
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,068
That's air. But they've been
replaced with water.

582
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:17,053
'This whole episode
made James very angry. '

583
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,057
If you hadn't tried to be clever and
if your car wasn't so unreliable,

584
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:26,024
I wouldn't have had to go round the outside in
my small off-roader and I wouldn't have sunk.

585
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:29,088
Unreliable?! It stalled! It stalled!It started again.

586
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:32,012
Mine will start again.

587
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,053
The rainforest
is just getting worse.

588
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:42,056
I'll tell you something, if you look over
there, would you not think it's getting thinner?

589
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:54,040
'It was and soon, our battered cars
emerged from the trees.

590
00:34:54,075 --> 00:35:00,037
'At last, we were out of the
spider-infested sweatbox.

591
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:08,004
'But ten minutes later, James and
Richard wished they were back in it. '

592
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,020
Oh, God!

593
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:19,044
Stop it!

594
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:26,004
Just answer me this simple question,
how comfortable are you two right now?

595
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:34,016
It's like a big, feather mattress.
I really am... relaxing. Yeah.

596
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,969
Oh, Jesus!

597
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:42,096
Have I broken James' spine? There
will be two Ted Nugents in a minute.

598
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:49,096
Oh, I'm so sick of that noise!
Stop rattling at me!

599
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:55,088
# Oh, Grace, you're getting away
with it

600
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:58,601
# Words but nothing to say with it

601
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:01,858
# Smile and take what you need

602
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,045
# In any way that you please

603
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,008
# Grace, you're getting away
with it... #

604
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:22,068
We spent the night in a town where
there were baths and bedrooms

605
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:25,012
and then we hit the road once more.

606
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,072
Oh, here we are.
This is cocaine country.

607
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:33,080
Kate Moss's delicatessen.

608
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,981
Obviously we can't drive
through this region

609
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:43,076
without registering our disgust at
the violent, reprehensible drugs trade

610
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:46,024
that brings misery
to so many millions.

611
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:56,989
May, have you seen what Hammond
has written on his car?

612
00:36:57,024 --> 00:37:00,060
Yeah, I don't think he's understood
what we're trying to do here.

613
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:04,965
Hammond, are you feeling
ashamed of yourself?

614
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,096
There was an opportunity and I took
it. But what about the untoldmisery to millions?

615
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:15,004
"Untold misery to millions"?
Are the ratings really that good?

616
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,048
Ha ha ha.

617
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:25,024
As we left town, we started to climb and
that was a problem for the Range Rover.

618
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:30,001
Every time we go up any form of
gradient, for any period of time,

619
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:36,028
the engine gets very, very warm. Still
nothing's working apart from the demist.

620
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:41,005
'Soon the engine became so hot,
I had to get radical. '

621
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,060
The scope of my engineering genius,
literally, knows no bounds.

622
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:49,072
Because, as you can see,
the vents I cut in the bonnet

623
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,017
are now windows.

624
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:56,064
So I can see where I'm going,
the engine is cool. All is well.

625
00:38:00,096 --> 00:38:04,025
Sooner or later, Jeremy has to admit that
the Range Rover isn't working properly.

626
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:12,056
We were only 110 miles from La Paz, but
between us and it was the Camino Del Muerte -

627
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:17,008
the death road - the most
dangerous highway in the world.

628
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:25,016
Over the years, the sheer, unguarded
drops have claimed hundreds of lives.

629
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:32,044
And to make matters worse, Captain Terrified-of-heights
didn't really have the car for the job.

630
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,993
James? Yes.

631
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:38,001
I don't know about the rear
suspension design on a Suzuki.

632
00:38:38,036 --> 00:38:42,036
The shock absorber is traditionally attached
at both ends. That's not absorbing shocks.

633
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:44,001
It's bouncing around on the spring.

634
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:47,088
That does affect your control quite
badly - not having a shock absorber.

635
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:51,048
I'm glad you said that up here,
Hammond, on my favourite road.

636
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,997
Hang on, before you go. What?

637
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:58,022
I genuinely don't like heights. It's my biggest failing, among many
- I accept.

638
00:38:58,057 --> 00:39:03,012
You know the, you drive into the back
of my car and it's very funny, joke?

639
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,977
Oh, you want me to drive into him?

640
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:10,084
I'll cut your BLEEP head off. You
will need a beep there, BBC Two.

641
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,040
I can understand that.

642
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:21,064
Uh, my car is perfect in every way,
apart from it not starting.

643
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:27,017
So could you, if you wouldn't mind,
push me?

644
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:32,080
So you want me to push your car with
my car, now, on this road here? Yes.

645
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:34,096
There's no alternative.

646
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:35,585
OK, here I come.

647
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,850
Careful, careful.

648
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,045
BUMPER CRUNCHES

649
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,008
I wasn't as careful as I could have
been. Sorry.

650
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,068
HE SNIGGERS

651
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:51,048
Pretty soon, we saw why the road
had earned its name.

652
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,040
God almighty, that is high!

653
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:08,068
That is a massive, massive drop!

654
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:18,024
This is insane.

655
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:21,037
Whoa!

656
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:26,052
The grasses stick up and you don't
necessarily see what a long way down it is,

657
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:28,061
then you get one of those gaps...

658
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:31,068
.. and you see down
and it is a long way.

659
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:34,040
There's one there.

660
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:38,061
'The dust didn't help either. '

661
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:42,004
Oh, gee. Look at that.
That's narrow.

662
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,044
HORN TOOTS

663
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,021
I don't understand the rules
on this road.

664
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:58,062
You seem to drive one minute on the
left and one minute on the right.

665
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:02,033
Sometimes the lorry stops to let you
go through. Sometimes they don't.

666
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:08,052
Some lorries pull over, others come barrelling up behind
you doing three and a half times the speed of sound.

667
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:10,008
It's completely baffling.

668
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:12,076
Thank you.

669
00:41:15,092 --> 00:41:19,076
I'm coming up against the truck.
I've got to go past him

670
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:24,048
and that means going on that side.

671
00:41:28,016 --> 00:41:29,096
Looking straight ahead.

672
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:33,025
Breathe.

673
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,080
Moments later, James slowed down
to let a mad local get past.

674
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:39,009
HORN TOOTS

675
00:41:39,044 --> 00:41:42,028
Does that mean there's one of those
maniacal taxi drivers?

676
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:44,000
.. and I didn't.

677
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,001
Oh, God!

678
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:48,072
BUMPERS CRUNCH

679
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:55,092
Sorry, I was watching the taxi. You're now going to get macheted
to death.

680
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:59,020
I was watching the taxi! I don't
care. Did I or did I not warn you?

681
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:02,977
James is killing Jeremy,
but things are going well.

682
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:06,997
I was watching the taxi. Youweren't. I was watching the taxi.

683
00:42:07,032 --> 00:42:10,985
Did your co-presenter just attack
you with a machete? Yes, he did.

684
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,032
He was quite cross cos I ran intohim. That doesn't happen on clothes
programmes or gardening shows.

685
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:28,012
'As we climbed higher, life in the already
battered Toyota became truly terrifying. '

686
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:31,068
That's my steering.
I'm inches from death, there.

687
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,981
The steering wheel
doesn't do anything.

688
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:37,004
My brakes stick when I'm going uphill
so the clutch slips.

689
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:41,092
I can't breathe
because the dust gets in.

690
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:44,041
Oh, God! That's real fear now.

691
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:48,092
Going downhill, the same brakes that
stick on going uphill, don't stop me.

692
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:50,056
Ugh!

693
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:55,004
'The Suzuki too
was showing the strain. '

694
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,051
BLEEP.

695
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:59,029
HE GROWLS

696
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:04,053
What is the matter? It's got dirt
in the fuel system from the river.

697
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:08,092
So it's broken? It's not broken.
Occasionally, a bit of it goes through.

698
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,057
Your simple, cheap car is broken.

699
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:17,032
'Sticking to the code of the Top Gear
brotherhood, I left James and Richard behind. '

700
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:23,032
It just goes to show they are badly-made
these Japanese cars. They're badly-made.

701
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:28,025
'James and I decided
to stick together. '

702
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:34,040
He's never going to go round us.
My God, he is.

703
00:43:34,075 --> 00:43:36,056
That's insane.

704
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:46,000
Right. I'm in a ditch.

705
00:43:47,068 --> 00:43:49,057
OK.

706
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:52,017
I didn't see this.

707
00:43:52,052 --> 00:43:54,040
Whoa-ho! What a thing to miss.

708
00:43:54,075 --> 00:43:55,037
Right.

709
00:43:55,072 --> 00:43:59,096
'No biggie, though, because my colleague
would winch me out in a jiffy. '

710
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:04,040
Hold on. What?The winch isn't working.

711
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:18,024
I'm now all on my own on Death Road. I have
no idea where Ray Mears and Ted Nugent are.

712
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:21,064
They've just disappeared. We have
no phones. They're not on the radio.

713
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:23,032
They could be dead.

714
00:44:25,048 --> 00:44:31,080
'We would, in fact, be dead quite soon, judging
by the mood of the angry, stuck locals. '

715
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:35,000
Good luck. Thank you. Handbrake off etc.

716
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:42,056
The ditch is going to level outso it'll be fine. There you go.

717
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:43,049
What a nice man.

718
00:44:43,084 --> 00:44:51,012
'Soon, though, I wished I'd stayed in the ditch
because the Toyota developed yet another fault. '

719
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:55,531
Something's broken
on that back corner.

720
00:44:55,566 --> 00:45:00,016
This is pretty close
to unbearable now.

721
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:02,045
Christ!

722
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,009
Meanwhile, very far ahead...

723
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:10,040
I'm now 5,500 feet above sea level
and still climbing.

724
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,092
Oh, God, crosses.

725
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:17,965
A lot of crosses there.

726
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,060
And then, underneath a waterfall, I learned
why there were so many crosses up here.

727
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:32,060
Oh, my God.

728
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:34,965
No.

729
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,008
Oh, my...

730
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:39,016
Stop there!

731
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,072
That is going. That is going.

732
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,036
CREAKING
Bloody hell.

733
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:31,969
We were still miles back.

734
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:37,053
It was almost dark and, worse still, James'
alternator wasn't charging the battery.

735
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:43,008
How much is running your car with headlights
on going to shorten the life of the battery

736
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:44,045
and then kill the engine?

737
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,057
I don't know exactly,
but by quite a bit.

738
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:50,028
They're already getting a bit dim,
to be honest.

739
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,969
God, this is murder.

740
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:54,080
Pretty soon, the inevitable happened.

741
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,977
My car is now dead
and without a new battery.

742
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:05,016
'Since the alternator was one of
the few things working on the Toyota,

743
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:07,977
'I swapped my live battery
for James' dead one. '

744
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:11,005
I think it was good of me to donate
my battery. Yes, it was.

745
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,076
Yes, it was. This time, we're not
going to run with your lights off.

746
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:17,024
No, OK. We'll use the torches.

747
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:18,092
Hang on a minute.

748
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:27,088
OK, I've waited till nightfall here
at the summit of the death road.

749
00:47:27,123 --> 00:47:30,587
My colleagues aren't here,
which means they must be dead.

750
00:47:30,622 --> 00:47:34,052
I've therefore made them these
rather touching memorials.

751
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:41,017
With the torches fitted,

752
00:47:41,052 --> 00:47:44,008
this was my view of Death Road.

753
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:52,008
Hammond, I want to say something to you
that I wouldn't say at any other time.

754
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,013
'What?'

755
00:47:53,048 --> 00:47:55,061
Please don't leave me.

756
00:47:55,096 --> 00:48:00,028
Oh, God, those words will stay with me.
I'll struggle to get over that. No, I won't.

757
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:18,036
The next morning,
we were all reunited in La Paz,

758
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:21,075
the world's highest
and worst capital city.

759
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:24,080
But as we waited for
our next instructions,

760
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:26,575
the mood was frosty.

761
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,001
Are you ready? No.

762
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:31,993
La Paz... I still haven't actually
forgiven you as such.

763
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:38,004
It's not like we're being all matey now and have
forgotten you abandoned us to die, just so you know.

764
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,005
I couldn't go back to the hotel,
eat steak, have a beer,

765
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,080
and go to bed feeling goodif I'd just left my mates... I had to go to bed.

766
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:47,088
Then tell your mates the steak
wasn't very good.

767
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,041
I thought you were dead.

768
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:53,060
I had a simple ceremony up therefor you. Then what did you do?
You went on.

769
00:48:53,095 --> 00:48:54,993
I said kind words about you.

770
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:59,041
What are we doing? Come on. "BetweenLa Paz and the Pacific Ocean,

771
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:05,016
"there is the Altiplano where the altitude
will cause you to have a pulmonary oedema.

772
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:09,031
"Then there's the Andes where you'll
have a cerebral oedema.

773
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:13,012
"And then the Atacama which is
50 times drier than Death Valley.

774
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:16,056
"It has never rained.
It's the driest place on Earth

775
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:20,080
"and there is no life,
not even bacteria. "

776
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:27,048
Given that our lungs and brains
would explode in the deserts

777
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:30,020
and mountains that lay between us
and the Pacific,

778
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:32,969
we decided to modify our cars a bit.

779
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:37,052
So it was time to find a workshop
and cue the music.

780
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:40,977
# Theme to "A Team"

781
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,044
Have you got "Spider In Car"
for Hammond?

782
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,068
You can't see through the window!

783
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:46,037
Stick to hammers.

784
00:49:46,072 --> 00:49:49,084
That's the precision tool board.
The hammer lives elsewhere.

785
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:02,084
The next day, we left La Paz well
prepared for the trials that lay ahead.

786
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,061
So, I've lifted the Land Cruiser,
obviously. Very simple.

787
00:50:06,096 --> 00:50:10,060
Gives me room for the bigger, wider
tyres I need for the desert sand.

788
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:12,973
Roll cage for safety, obviously.

789
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:15,981
Then to get rid of some of
the weight, I've lost the doors

790
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:20,981
because they were very heavy, and the
roof and anything else I didn't need.

791
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:27,072
What I've done to prepare for the desert
is team a rather fetching hooded cardigan

792
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:31,080
with some old combat trousers
and some big wheels on my car.

793
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,016
Wow, James has been busy.

794
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:38,045
Woo, yes.

795
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,973
You've modified that, mate.

796
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:45,020
As you can see, what I've done with
my car is mended it.

797
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:52,048
The modifying brothers were very
pleased with their results.

798
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,045
Yeah! Ah!

799
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,969
I'm liking this. Loving this!

800
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:01,008
But after a few miles,
the smiles had gone.

801
00:51:01,043 --> 00:51:04,965
Hammond, I've made my car worse.

802
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,040
How? It won't ride properlyand the tyres are catchingon the wheel arches.

803
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:12,084
It's got no power any more.

804
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,977
Oh, God.

805
00:51:14,012 --> 00:51:17,033
I am having to work my engine
quite hard.

806
00:51:17,068 --> 00:51:21,056
The problem is, you put bigger wheels
on, it has the effect of gearing it up.

807
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:25,045
First gear is like starting in
third... it's hard work.

808
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,000
The long and the short of it,
I've rather ruined it.

809
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:32,000
James has just overtaken me
in his 1 oz box.

810
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:33,993
RICHARD LAUGHS

811
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:38,024
That face is smug, I don't like it.

812
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:42,552
Because I'd made my car better,

813
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:45,061
as we climbed onto the Altiplano,

814
00:51:45,096 --> 00:51:48,080
I could relax and enjoy
the backdrop.

815
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:50,001
Look at that sky.

816
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:53,040
That's one of the best skies
I've seen for a very long time.

817
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:06,060
James, does it get hotter or colder
when you're at altitude? I've forgotten.

818
00:52:06,095 --> 00:52:11,013
I'm pretty sure it gets much hotter.
No, no, hang on. Colder.

819
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:17,016
There's only one way we can accurately determine
the temperature and that's by asking our colleague.

820
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,032
I know what you're thinking,
I'm fine.

821
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:27,029
As darkness fell, we pulled into
a petrol station.

822
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:32,013
In the shop, we found a bit more
than Kit Kats and pies.

823
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:37,088
Wait a minute. Caramelised cocaine. That's something
you don't see in every motorway service station.

824
00:52:37,123 --> 00:52:41,040
Wow. You take it and thenyou talk for hours.

825
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,969
Let's have that.

826
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:48,004
In fact, the sweet is made from coca
leaves which are legal and used by locals

827
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,004
to ward off the effects
of altitude sickness.

828
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,049
Hammond found them very moreish.

829
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:57,064
They're nice, they're caramelised.
I've had about six.

830
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:00,029
Luckily, this had no effect at all.

831
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:05,001
.. all the camping gear, then when
you got there, this was before the M5,

832
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:10,012
there was like a high bit and a low bit and
we used to say, "Is this the high/low bit?"

833
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:14,533
And Mum and Dad would say, "Yeah". And
then we knew how far it was to Weston.

834
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:19,020
I always thought Bristol was a bit
scruffy, but actually it's quite nice...

835
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:28,096
The next morning, we woke on the
staggeringly beautiful Bolivian high plains.

836
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,040
We couldn't see this in the dark
but it's absolutely breathtaking.

837
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:41,020
Look at it. It's took my breathaway. There's no breath
to take away.

838
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:43,057
We're at 14,000 feet
according to the gizmo.

839
00:53:43,092 --> 00:53:49,041
14,000? 14,006 feet. What's that?This measures your sats.

840
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:53,001
On Casualty, they always do this.
They put one of these on their finger,

841
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:57,076
and it's something to do with how much
oxygen there is in your red blood cells.

842
00:53:57,111 --> 00:54:02,088
If it's less than 98 or 99,
you've had it.

843
00:54:02,123 --> 00:54:05,052
And Tina Hobley comes. What's yours?

844
00:54:05,087 --> 00:54:07,053
87. That's less. Much less.

845
00:54:07,088 --> 00:54:10,040
Where's Tina Hobley, then?Just try yours.

846
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:12,004
I bet you can't go less than 87.

847
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:13,045
That's how ill I am.

848
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,032
89. 89? You're nearly dead.

849
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:19,053
I AM dead.

850
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:24,028
88, I'm not much better. If you wentinto a doctor's surgery in England,

851
00:54:24,063 --> 00:54:28,561
with sats of 88,they'd put you in hospital. 84.

852
00:54:28,596 --> 00:54:33,060
In fact, the only thing
in a dodgier state than me

853
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:35,001
were the modifications on my car.

854
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:37,989
What's happened? I've broken
my front right spring.

855
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,028
Completely clean. Sheared it
off both ends. You're joking?

856
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:43,981
Bloody hellfire.

857
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,068
So that is supposed
to be connected to that?

858
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:49,016
Yep. It's snapped clean off.

859
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:53,973
While trying to mend
the modified suspension,

860
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:58,032
there was another problem.
Your prop shaft fell off.

861
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:01,985
What? Your prop shaft just fell off.

862
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:07,036
Since there was no AA to call, it
took us all morning to get it fixed.

863
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,061
Ooh!

864
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,028
But eventually, we were off.

865
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:21,044
And apart from James driving
into a village well...

866
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:24,057
Sorry... Leave it!

867
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:28,068
.. we made good progress
toward the Chilean border.

868
00:55:28,103 --> 00:55:31,057
I'm in a fantastic desert,
with my two mates.

869
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:36,032
All the cars are working,
look at that, look at that.

870
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,076
It's great. It's an adventure.

871
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,033
And soon,
we reached a big milestone.

872
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:46,096
One mile, James, and we've done it.
Bolivia.

873
00:55:46,131 --> 00:55:49,973
Let's roll in as a threesome.

874
00:55:50,008 --> 00:55:55,000
You look at these three, you'd never
believe they were still running!

875
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:57,049
Most scrapyards would reject them.

876
00:55:57,084 --> 00:56:03,044
At the border post, we were given
the traditional welcome.

877
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,052
My arse!

878
00:56:11,064 --> 00:56:17,060
I hope he doesn't find the tampons.
Or, rather worryingly, the Viagra.

879
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:28,056
Drugs check over, we entered Chile, where
the scenery became even more sensational.

880
00:56:34,012 --> 00:56:36,084
Those are flamingos,
they actually are flamingos.

881
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,075
I've never seen them in the wild.
Wow.

882
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:44,032
Unfortunately, we were still
climbing.

883
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:48,004
Are you ready? 45 feet to go.

884
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:50,039
30 feet to go.

885
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,005
Here it comes.

886
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,012
5, 4, 3... We're there!

887
00:56:56,047 --> 00:56:58,969
15,006 feet!

888
00:56:59,004 --> 00:57:04,012
Ha! We are now higher than
the highest peak in Europe

889
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:07,012
and we're still driving.

890
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:13,000
Soon, the altitude would become
a big issue.

891
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:23,016
But the next day,
Hammond had an even bigger one.

892
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:27,056
His clutch had gone. Oh, God.

893
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:29,053
Oh, come on!

894
00:57:29,088 --> 00:57:32,973
It won't come out of gear.

895
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:37,048
I'm trying to rock it
on the starter motor... Ah!

896
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:42,009
There you go.

897
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:46,032
We're away, into second,
match the road speed...

898
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:48,000
Ooh! Hey-hey! There we go.

899
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:56,004
We've just pulled over here
to wait for Hammond.

900
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,023
Oh! Dust!

901
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,008
Is that him?

902
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,013
It is.

903
00:58:02,048 --> 00:58:04,072
It is. We're back as a three.

904
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:07,053
Hammond!

905
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:11,048
The donkey lives!Oh, yeah! It lives on.

906
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:15,008
At this point,
we had a decision to make.

907
00:58:15,043 --> 00:58:18,028
We can either go that way,

908
00:58:18,063 --> 00:58:20,047
which is very long,

909
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:22,032
or we can go that way,

910
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:23,017
which is short,

911
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:26,032
but does mean driving over
an active volcano.

912
00:58:28,016 --> 00:58:29,001
Short.

913
00:58:29,036 --> 00:58:31,044
Volcano. Short. I agree.

914
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,036
Short. Let's do it.

915
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:44,096
As we climbed, the air became
thinner and thinner.

916
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,965
15,400.

917
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,049
And climbing.

918
00:58:54,084 --> 00:59:00,056
We are, definitely, the highest
motorists in the world.

919
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:03,041
Apart from George Michael,
obviously.

920
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:07,086
Hammond's really got to think ahead
with no clutch.

921
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:11,096
He's gotta think ahead with
a brain starved of oxygen.

922
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:19,016
What is frightening is when I need to
come to grab first to get up a steep bit.

923
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:20,045
Changing down is harder.

924
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,084
You have to guess how high the engine needs
to be revving and slot the gear lever in

925
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,088
without a clutch.

926
00:59:29,096 --> 00:59:31,096
James too was having problems.

927
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:33,052
JUDDERING AND GRATING

928
00:59:36,092 --> 00:59:40,056
Oh, God, chaps, my transfer
box is jammed.

929
00:59:42,028 --> 00:59:45,036
But these niggles were overshadowed
by the big one.

930
00:59:46,036 --> 00:59:49,076
Up at this altitude, this engine
is really struggling.

931
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:53,008
For every litre of fuel vapour
it gets through,

932
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:56,008
it needs 14 litres of air.

933
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:57,017
And there isn't any.

934
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:01,034
So, it's just like me... HE GASPS

935
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:04,981
That means it's so down on power.

936
01:00:05,016 --> 01:00:10,008
'Up here, James's car
had, at best, 20 horsepower.

937
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:12,037
'And as we climbed higher,

938
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:14,017
'we started to suffer as well. '

939
01:00:14,052 --> 01:00:18,024
The breathlessness now
is pretty acute.

940
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,052
Just talking is... hard work.

941
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:26,036
I'm starting to feel a bit...

942
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:28,056
Jeez... no... I'm feeling really

943
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,044
quite weird.

944
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:36,088
'The terrain levelled out so we pulled
over to catch what we could of our breath. '

945
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:39,577
Do you feel sort of drunkbut it's not pleasant? Yeah.

946
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:43,032
Exactly that. My whole head...
I've got room spin.

947
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:46,040
'It was time for drastic action. '

948
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,024
Cyanide? No.

949
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:49,041
Viagra.

950
01:00:49,076 --> 01:00:51,061
Eh? Is this the time?

951
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:56,000
Apparently, Viagra, for reasons
unknown to science

952
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:57,981
stops you having an oedema
in your lung.

953
01:00:58,016 --> 01:01:03,048
I thought it was more the trouser department it
concentrated on. That could be a side effect, yes.

954
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,064
Down the hatch. Here we go.

955
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:11,048
Doesn't work. Nothing's happening.
I can't swallow it.

956
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:14,052
Nothing's happening.
I need a drink.

957
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,088
I'm going to get a massive neck
if I don't get some of that.

958
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:24,000
Apparently... that will
save our lives.

959
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:26,031
THEY LAUGH
Oh, God.

960
01:01:26,066 --> 01:01:27,993
I've just taken Viagra!

961
01:01:28,028 --> 01:01:30,072
On top of the Andes. CHUCKLING

962
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:36,028
'Sadly, it didn't seem to have
any effect at all. '

963
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,080
I'm getting a headache
and I'm feeling sick.

964
01:01:43,028 --> 01:01:45,001
Come on, come on.

965
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:48,033
'The big question now was this -

966
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:53,044
'which would give out first,
the cars or the men?'

967
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,048
Come on. Come on!

968
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,072
Come on.

969
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,041
Every gear change
is so critical now.

970
01:02:00,076 --> 01:02:03,092
I get tense about it,
that raises my heart.

971
01:02:03,127 --> 01:02:06,084
And then I need oxygen
all the more.

972
01:02:09,032 --> 01:02:12,052
Still there, Hammond? Yeah,
I'm still here. I have to go slow

973
01:02:12,087 --> 01:02:15,072
because I daren't risk changing up
to third. I won't make it.

974
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:17,013
'OK, mate, we'll slow down. '

975
01:02:17,048 --> 01:02:20,058
We're a team up here.
Cos this isn't funny.

976
01:02:20,093 --> 01:02:23,068
God, Jeremy's talking
about being a team.

977
01:02:24,068 --> 01:02:26,096
Must be the altitude.

978
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:30,037
'At 16,700 feet,

979
01:02:30,072 --> 01:02:33,024
'the Toyota broke down again. '

980
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,025
ENGINE STALLS

981
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,008
'I think my transfer box
has just gone. '

982
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:40,013
'James and I stop to help.

983
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,052
'And then we couldn't get going
again. '

984
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:47,068
The engines just aren't getting
any air.

985
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:48,989
At all.

986
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:51,046
There's just no... er...

987
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:53,070
James can't get his started.

988
01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:55,060
I can't get mine started.

989
01:02:56,096 --> 01:02:58,072
I haven't got any air to work.

990
01:03:01,064 --> 01:03:06,052
Once we get the Range Rover going,
that's the most likely to start,

991
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:11,040
we can geteverything started. Right. Can wemove it? Three, two, heave!

992
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:12,973
And go!THEY STRAIN

993
01:03:13,008 --> 01:03:18,028
'Pushing a Range Rover at this
altitude damn near killed us,

994
01:03:18,063 --> 01:03:21,029
'but eventually the big beast fired
and once again,

995
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:25,068
'the most unreliable car in the
world got the others going as well. '

996
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,052
Oh, yeah.

997
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,033
Bloody hell.

998
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:42,096
My lips are now tingling.

999
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,040
I get the feeling something's gotta
give soon.

1000
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,088
Jesus Christ, my head!

1001
01:03:59,056 --> 01:04:02,096
'At 17,200 feet,
we pulled over - again. '

1002
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,024
PANTING

1003
01:04:22,008 --> 01:04:23,064
Hammond? Yeah.

1004
01:04:26,052 --> 01:04:31,064
Even if... the cars could get over that
and I seriously doubt that, I can't.

1005
01:04:35,032 --> 01:04:37,021
Just pushing on's just stupid.

1006
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:40,072
Seriously, I'm calling it a day. I think you could be right.

1007
01:04:50,072 --> 01:04:55,036
'We really were in trouble. So, we
turned round and headed back down.

1008
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:56,052
'Fast. '

1009
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:06,068
16 two. Still feeling weird.

1010
01:05:10,028 --> 01:05:11,060
HE COUGHS

1011
01:05:13,036 --> 01:05:14,552
Breathing's better.

1012
01:05:14,587 --> 01:05:16,033
With every foot...

1013
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:18,552
the engine's gonna run smoother.

1014
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:21,036
My body's gonna run smoother.

1015
01:05:29,064 --> 01:05:34,024
'We then went the long way round
and finally, drunk on oxygen,

1016
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:37,096
'we made it to the other side
of the Andes. '

1017
01:05:45,048 --> 01:05:47,000
DEEP BREATHING

1018
01:05:49,044 --> 01:05:52,045
THEY INHALE NOISILY
Air!

1019
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,000
It's so... so underrated. It's thick.

1020
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,045
It's like breathing soup.

1021
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,020
You can bite off pieces of it
and chew it.

1022
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:03,024
It's like lung nectar.

1023
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:10,064
There is just one small thing
that's occurred to me, chaps.

1024
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,072
What?

1025
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:15,064
Where the hell are we?

1026
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:21,070
We were in the Atacama Desert

1027
01:06:21,105 --> 01:06:23,582
where there is no life at all.

1028
01:06:23,617 --> 01:06:26,025
Not even on a cellular level.

1029
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:31,012
Richard Hammond was the smallest
living organism for miles.

1030
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:35,032
There was nothing here at all.

1031
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:38,048
Except for one road.

1032
01:06:40,028 --> 01:06:41,044
Oh, yes.

1033
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:45,052
The Pan-American Highway.

1034
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,016
Running is smooth.

1035
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:56,016
The view is spectacular.

1036
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:58,000
Temperature is low.

1037
01:07:02,044 --> 01:07:05,052
'But the mad dash down the mountain
had been too much once again

1038
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,000
'for the modifications
on Hammond's Toyota. '

1039
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,020
Better stop. Oh, God.

1040
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:16,020
Didn't sound good.

1041
01:07:17,048 --> 01:07:20,016
You heard something? Oh, yeah!

1042
01:07:20,051 --> 01:07:21,033
Oh, dear.

1043
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:25,008
I think, James, we can safely say
that what's happened there

1044
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:26,997
is my prop-shaft has fallen off.

1045
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:30,032
'And the prop-shaft
was only half of it. '

1046
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,045
BLEEP.

1047
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,965
What's broken? Diff.

1048
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,049
It's shattered?Absolutely exploded.

1049
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:41,016
Good God. I'm surprised
that didn't somersault the car.

1050
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:46,076
I've just heard on the radio that
Richard Hammond's Land Cruiser

1051
01:07:46,111 --> 01:07:48,044
is in serious trouble.

1052
01:07:49,044 --> 01:07:50,092
HE SPUTTERS

1053
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:57,524
'Happily, the Top Gear orang-utan
elected not to stop and help.

1054
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:02,024
'As a result, James and I quickly
got the Toyota working again. '

1055
01:08:07,092 --> 01:08:09,053
We reconfigured it,
it's now running.

1056
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:13,040
Front wheel drive only
so it's now just its front legs

1057
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:16,028
dragging itself along,
still working.

1058
01:08:17,096 --> 01:08:22,000
'We were now tantalisingly close to
the Pacific Ocean, the finish line. '

1059
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,096
There can be no doubt this has been
our toughest assignment ever.

1060
01:08:29,044 --> 01:08:32,052
No question about that.
It's nearly killed us,

1061
01:08:32,087 --> 01:08:34,028
it's nearly killed our cars.

1062
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:40,969
'It is incredible to think
that these cheap cars

1063
01:08:41,004 --> 01:08:44,096
'bought unseen on the Internet
had crossed the Amazon rainforest.

1064
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:49,076
'They'd scaled the most dangerous
road in the world.

1065
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:55,096
'They'd still been working when their
drivers had broken down in the Andes.

1066
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:02,068
'We didn't just respect them.
We loved them. '

1067
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:06,985
I have a teddy bear, I've had it
since I was born.

1068
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,084
One of its arms has fallen off,
one of its eyes is missing,

1069
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:13,060
its head's come off more times
than I can mention.

1070
01:09:13,095 --> 01:09:15,593
To you it would be worthless junk.

1071
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:18,057
But to me, it means everything,

1072
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:21,072
and it's the same story
with this car.

1073
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,088
Yeah, the ride's terrible, it's a
bit noisy, doesn't handle that well,

1074
01:09:27,123 --> 01:09:30,033
and I'm always worried it's going
to fall over,

1075
01:09:30,068 --> 01:09:34,542
but it's done everything the big boys
have done, hasn't got stuck any more often,

1076
01:09:34,577 --> 01:09:39,016
and the only time it's really gone
wrong is due to its dunking in the river.

1077
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:42,036
I think the plucky little car's
done all right.

1078
01:09:44,068 --> 01:09:50,000
From the very start of the trip when I couldn't
start it on the raft, I thought, "Oh, no. "

1079
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:52,068
But I didn't know it then,
I didn't know how determined it was.

1080
01:09:52,103 --> 01:09:55,096
This thing is like
that Black Knight

1081
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:57,021
in that Monty Python sketch

1082
01:09:57,056 --> 01:10:00,064
where they're fighting with swords
and he gets his arm cut off.

1083
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:04,091
"No, no, 'tis but a scratch!"
It's a great little car.

1084
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:08,084
'As our exhausted convoy drew nearer
to the coast,

1085
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,004
'weirdly, the road
started to climb again. '

1086
01:10:14,016 --> 01:10:19,096
40 miles to go and we've got
to drop 2,300 feet to sea level.

1087
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:22,060
It must start going downhill
in a minute!

1088
01:10:22,095 --> 01:10:23,981
'But it didn't.

1089
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,040
'The punishing climb continued. '

1090
01:10:27,088 --> 01:10:30,076
I can smell... I can smell...

1091
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:32,076
a boiling engine.

1092
01:10:37,056 --> 01:10:42,016
Is the drop at the other end just sheer,
because we're nearly at the Pacific now?

1093
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:45,092
And we're 4,000 feet up.

1094
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:52,080
'Soon, though, we turned off the Pan-America
and headed through the dunes to the finish line,

1095
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:56,044
'where, unfortunately, there was
one more obstacle in the way.

1096
01:10:57,084 --> 01:10:58,088
'A big one. '

1097
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,084
Hang on a minute.

1098
01:11:03,076 --> 01:11:04,092
Whoa, wait.

1099
01:11:10,092 --> 01:11:14,012
Look how bloody steep it is. God above.

1100
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:18,033
I can see now
why they said four wheel drive.

1101
01:11:18,068 --> 01:11:21,572
Er, I've only got three wheel drive. I've only got two.

1102
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:25,325
What if you dig in?If you dug in and started to roll,

1103
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,009
the chances of you being alive
at the bottom... are nil.

1104
01:11:29,044 --> 01:11:34,008
'We therefore decided to get some
practice on a smaller dune first. '

1105
01:11:34,043 --> 01:11:35,549
Are we ready, chaps?

1106
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,056
Ready. Ready? Yeah.

1107
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:38,977
Three!

1108
01:11:39,012 --> 01:11:41,060
Two! 'Hold on, hold on. '

1109
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:45,052
Give me strength.
Give me strength.

1110
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:46,021
What?

1111
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:48,080
Just before we do this,
I wanted to say... Oh, shit.

1112
01:11:48,115 --> 01:11:52,012
No! Oh, my BLEEP!

1113
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,068
My donkey!

1114
01:12:09,048 --> 01:12:11,024
His wheel's come off.

1115
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:12,068
Aw!

1116
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:18,969
'Donkey was dead.

1117
01:12:19,004 --> 01:12:20,989
'And in some ways, I was relieved.

1118
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:25,064
'Because it meant I no longer
had to drive down that dune. '

1119
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,088
This is utterly, utterly,
utterly stupid.

1120
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:39,096
I wouldn't do this in
a brand-new Range Rover.

1121
01:12:39,131 --> 01:12:41,024
James, are you ready?

1122
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:44,981
Yeah, I'll be going for
second gear, Jezza.

1123
01:12:45,016 --> 01:12:49,028
Second gear, low range, and I've got
my diff locks in. Have you?

1124
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:52,040
I haven't got diff locks. 'Good luck, boys. '

1125
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:57,024
Three... two... one. Go!

1126
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,084
Oh, my God.

1127
01:13:09,016 --> 01:13:13,008
I don't know... Oh, Christ, I don't
know where the wheels are pointing.

1128
01:13:14,064 --> 01:13:16,040
I don't think so.

1129
01:13:19,056 --> 01:13:21,548
It's going sideways.

1130
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:24,040
Whoa. Whoo oh oh!

1131
01:13:26,024 --> 01:13:27,076
Don't you dare go sideways again.

1132
01:13:29,008 --> 01:13:32,064
'The soft sand was a nightmare
and the gradient meant pretty soon

1133
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:35,016
'we were fighting to keep control. '

1134
01:13:38,024 --> 01:13:40,056
Get in a straight line,
you metal BLEEP.

1135
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:41,076
Come on!

1136
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:44,072
Come on. Oh, it's going
a bit fast now.

1137
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:49,044
I'm in a 900-year-old utterly
ruined Range Rover.

1138
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:51,088
Argh! Argh!

1139
01:13:53,032 --> 01:13:55,020
Levelling out. It's levelling out.

1140
01:13:56,008 --> 01:13:57,048
It's levelling out.

1141
01:14:01,096 --> 01:14:03,084
Argh! We're down!

1142
01:14:05,016 --> 01:14:07,004
We're down!

1143
01:14:08,004 --> 01:14:10,020
Yeah!

1144
01:14:11,076 --> 01:14:16,076
'Once again, we had shown what the car,
even when it's an old croc, is capable of.

1145
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:19,028
'Well, two of us had.

1146
01:14:28,036 --> 01:14:31,064
'But when we finally regrouped
by the water's edge,

1147

'Hammond still believed
he'd chosen wisely. '

1148
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:40,068
Are you going to try and argue...?It's extraordinarily good.
It's led a very hard life.

1149
01:14:40,103 --> 01:14:42,973
It died a noble death,
I think valiant.

1150
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:47,037
I think rubbish. It has been a
constant source of problems and delays.

1151
01:14:47,072 --> 01:14:52,004
It was old and arthritic and had been beaten
every day of its life, sick old donkey.

1152
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:55,553
These two were old and arthritic
but they are here,

1153
01:14:55,588 --> 01:14:59,068
and the Land Cruiser is 2,800 feet
above us up there.

1154
01:14:59,103 --> 01:15:02,059
Forever. Can I just make
the case for the Suzuki

1155
01:15:02,094 --> 01:15:04,981
cos I know what you're thinking?
Plucky little car.

1156
01:15:05,016 --> 01:15:11,032
Helped you out a few times. I agree.
Technically, never really broke down. Well...

1157
01:15:11,067 --> 01:15:13,545
It didn't survive very well
in the puddle.

1158
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,024
But I'd like to say
most importantly...

1159
01:15:16,059 --> 01:15:18,073
Mm-hm... the ride is rotten.

1160
01:15:18,108 --> 01:15:20,053
Yes. And because of that,

1161
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:24,036
because it's almost
ruined your spine,

1162
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:25,989
and because yours isn't here,

1163
01:15:26,024 --> 01:15:28,965
we have a startling conclusion
to the show.

1164
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,020
It turns out that the most
unreliable car in the world...

1165
01:15:33,055 --> 01:15:36,020
