1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,325
Tonight, I get scared half to death
on our track,

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,480
We host our own art exhibition and the world
champion is in our reasonably priced car,

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,820
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

4
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,085
Thank you, everybody!

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you, Hello! Hello and welcome,

6
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,605
Welcome, everybody,

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,140
Now, a few years ago, we got very
excited by this, the Noble M400,

8
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:48,605
But then the man behind the company
that made it upped sticks and left

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,080
and then they stopped making it and then the
whole operation just disappeared from the radar,

10
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:57,560
Now though... it's back,

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,520
This is what it's come up with,

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,920
Designed and built by some blokes I've never
heard of on an industrial estate in Leicester,

13
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:12,800
it's called the M600,

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,605
Underneath
the rather featureless body,

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,200
the chassis is made not from
carbon fibre, but stainless steel,

16
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:28,960
The V8 that powers it
is lifted from this,

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,285
Yep, It uses the same engine,

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,800
albeit with a couple of turbo
chargers that Volvo use in the XC90,

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,360
So, built in Leicestershire from
bits of the Industrial Revolution

20
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:50,280
and powered by the engine
from a Volvo school bus,

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,640
And the cost? &#163;200,000,

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,120
That does seem like a lot for a car
that has no satellite navigation,

23
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,445
no climate control, no airbag,

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,000
It doesn't even have
anti-lock brakes,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,245
The men from Leicestershire
say ABS is just another example

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,920
of the nanny state sticking its
nose in, and that's very admirable,

27
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:23,525
But you can't help suspecting
the real reason it doesn't have ABS

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,040
is because when you're operating out
of a industrial unit in Leicestershire,

29
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,880
you can't really afford them,

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,725
There's another problem as well,

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
What kind of person looks at
the established range of supercars

32
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:41,040
and thinks,
I don't like any of them?

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,880
However, it turns out that there is
a reason why you might choose a Noble,

34
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:54,400
rather than a Porsche, or a Ferrari

35
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,237
or a Lamborghini,

36
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,216
or an Aston Martin,

37
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:00,160
or a McLaren Mercedes,

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,560
You see, in terms of sheer speed,
the Noble can blow all of that lot

39
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:10,240
into the middle of last week,

40
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,325
Let me show you
what I'm on about here,

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm currently doing 40 mph
in second gear, Ready? Foot down,

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,885
And there's 60,

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,800
40-60 in one second, One!

44
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,880
In fourth gear,
100 to 120 in two seconds,

45
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:46,365
100 to 130 in three seconds,

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,000
It does 150 to 170 so quick that your
eyeballs bounce off the back of your skull...

47
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,880
like squash balls!

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,685
Break it, break it! Oh, my God!

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,780
You have to push, There's very
little servo assistance there,

50
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:12,840
If you push too hard, you'll lock
them up because there's no ABS,

51
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,920
God, it's quick!

52
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
That's mind-blowingly fast,

53
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,485
That is properly,

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,480
head-alteringly quick,

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,845
Flat out,
it'll do 225 miles an hour,

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Mainly because the engine,
despite the Volvo connection,

57
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:41,605
develops 650 horsepower,

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,520
The whole car only weighs 1,250kg,

59
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:49,400
And the news
keeps on getting better,

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,605
This down here
is exactly the same switch

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,165
that a pilot uses in a Tornado
fighter-bomber to fire the missiles,

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,600
It was specifically designed so it couldn't
be used by accident and that is a good thing,

63
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:08,757
Because in here, what it does

64
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,880
is turn the traction control off,

65
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,840
Argh! I wish I'd kept it on!

66
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,400
I really wish I'd kept it on!

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,845
The margin for error

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,080
in most supercars is actually quite
wide, but in this, it really isn't,

69
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,005
Stop,

70
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,805
It's a constant nightmare,

71
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,280
1% too much speed going into a
corner, you get understeer like that,

72
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:51,440
1% too much throttle to
correct it, you've got oversteer,

73
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,640
1% wrong with the steering,
you're going to spin,

74
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
Remember, there are no electronic
driver aids to help you out,

75
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:02,485
There's no medevac chopper,

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,680
You get it wrong,
you're on your own!

77
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,285
There is a fantastic
sweet spot in this thing,

78
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,880
But even when you find it, you're
often too terrified to enjoy the moment,

79
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:31,720
To really enjoy it
and to find it regularly...

80
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,960
...you have to be a much
better driver than I am,

81
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm not really doing this justice,

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Driving it fast, then,
you need to be good,

83
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:50,280
But weirdly, to drive it at all,
you don't,

84
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,240
Happily, if you wind the engine down
to 550 horsepower or 450,

85
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,045
which you can do using
this switch here,

86
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,800
it becomes a different animal,
It becomes completely docile,

87
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:08,840
Calm, No harder to drive
than... a Nissan Micra,

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,080
And like the old Noble, it's
quiet and extremely comfortable,

89
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:20,245
It really does ride beautifully,

90
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,300
Summing this car up, then, is hard,
because let's be honest,

91
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:28,320
there are several very good reasons
why you shouldn't buy one,

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,160
But there is one
very good reason why you should...

93
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,200
Losers!

94
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,845
APPLAUSE

95
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,285
So it's that fast? That edgy?
That edgy?

96
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,980
Honestly, it's the nearest I've ever come
to collecting a camera car on a shoot,

97
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:08,640
I think that was the first time I've ever
seen you properly scared on our track,

98
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:10,365
Oh, I was, No, I really was,

99
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,120
It's not so bad when it's dry, but when it's
wet you have to have the reactions of a housefly,

100
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:20,997
So not a fat, balding middle-aged man,
then? <span tts:color=yellow0 Exactly,</span>

101
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:25,840
Not that, which is why we're now going
to hand it over to our tame racing driver,

102
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,245
Some say that you shouldn't
go round to his house

103
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,000
for your Christmas lunch, unless you
enjoy the great taste of seagull,

104
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,405
And that the reason
he always wears a helmet

105
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,320
is because a man once smashed him in the
face with a model of Salisbury Cathedral,

106
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,205
All we know is
he's called the Stig!

107
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,520
And he's off! We've had rain for the past
few weeks now and we've got a dusting of snow,

108
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:55,760
Still hoping for good things,
since Stig is one of the few things

109
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:59,760
that can really get to the
bottom of a Noble, He loves them!

110
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:04,200
That is nice through there,
Beautiful on the way out,

111
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:08,965
# In the bleak midwinter... #

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,445
Appropriate music for this weather,

113
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,685
Performing in the style of
a Kray brother's funeral there,

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,280
A bit of twitchiness on the way in, but tasty
on the way out of Chicago, now Hammerhead,

115
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:22,477
He came in very fast, understeering
as I discovered earlier,

116
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,640
but Stiggy knows how to drive
through and find that sweet spot,

117
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:29,080
# Oh, God
Oh, my king... #

118
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Right, time now to unleash the
twin-turbo kick in the kidneys,

119
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:39,417
He does seem to be sawing
at the wheel a lot in there,

120
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:42,246
It is a brute, this car,
but the Stig isn't fazed,

121
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,005
That would be literally impossible,
Two corners left,

122
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
He's still working hard, but the
car itself looks really composed,

123
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,685
Coming up to Gambon,

124
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
slices through there
and across the line!

125
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:55,280
APPLAUSE

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,520
OK, Here it is! Here it is,

127
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:05,325
It goes, mmm...

128
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,800
Hang on,
you've just gone above a 599,

129
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,325
Yes, And above a Scuderia,

130
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,840
That's that fast Lambo, <span
tts:color=yellow0 And above the Enzo,</span>

131
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,685
That's an Enzo up there!

132
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,900
Past the Veyron,
Past the Zonda convertible...

133
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,080
Whoa! <span tts:color=yellow0
To there!</span>

134
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,200
So it's expensive, but it works?

135
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,365
Excellent, Right,

136
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Now we will do the news
and we begin with the this -

137
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:35,557
it's a new Aston Martin,
It's called the Rapide,

138
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:39,245
You can think of it as a DB9
with two extra doors,

139
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,160
That means there's room back here
for two extra fully-grown adults

140
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:50,125
to enjoy the 470 horsepower,
V12 motoring experience,

141
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,560
And they can enjoy exquisite details, such as
these magnetically located grab handles, look,

142
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:58,440
It won't flap around
when you're driving along,

143
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:02,497
All this is yours for &#163;140,000,

144
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:06,006
Now,
that is quite a bit more expensive

145
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,445
than Porsche's four-door,
the Panamera,

146
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,520
but there are two very good reasons
why you should choose the Aston Martin,

147
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:18,577
Firstly, and unlike the Porsche,
it does look rather magnificent,

148
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:23,600
Secondly, most importantly,
this is quintessentially British,

149
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,480
Despite the fact
that it's made in Austria,

150
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,925
Which I think is in Germany,

151
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,165
OK, Now, as you can see,
we are surrounded here

152
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,165
by a mountain of motoring-related
Christmas present ideas,

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,160
<span tts:color=yellow0 I say present ideas,
actually it's landfill, </span>Oh, yes,

154
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:46,000
We haven't got time to get through all
of it, but I want to start with this,

155
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:50,400
Perfume, as we know,
is a very popular Christmas gift,

156
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:54,760
Big names, Givenchy, Chanel,
Now look... The RAC,

157
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,540
Yes, the RAC has launched this,

158
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:00,560
They're calling it Eau De Voiture,

159
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,125
Ooh, sounds promising!

160
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,600
What you do is
you spray it into your car

161
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:07,005
and it makes it smell
like a minicab,

162
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,805
It's quite strong! <span tts:color=yellow0
Have some of that,</span>

163
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,080
<span tts:color=cyan0 It is like a minicab, </span><span
tts:color=yellow0 Because it smells... Oh, shit!</span>

164
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,485
My eyes!

165
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,760
You cretin! <span tts:color=yellow0
I'm blind!</span>

166
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,445
The thing is, what it does,
and I've really got a lot of it now,

167
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,120
is it's one of those smells that makes
you think it's covering up other smells,

168
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:32,200
Like Femme Fresh,

169
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,485
LAUGHTER

170
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,320
Because it's a very strong smell in it's own right,
but it suggests that there are other things masking,

171
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:45,040
You get notes, don't you? You get
notes, undercurrents, Suggestions of...

172
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:48,160
I can smell the fruity stuff,
but also a bit of stale wee,

173
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:49,805
Sick?

174
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,365
I can get a really beery burp,

175
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,525
All the things
you'd expect in a minicab,

176
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,005
I have another gift suggestion here
for Christmas,

177
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,525
Are you fed up with people bumping
into you in a crowd situation?

178
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,280
<span tts:color=yellow0 Yes, I am!
</span>Well, I have the solution here

179
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:09,077
with these small, ear-mounted
human indicators, I kid you not,

180
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:13,840
What happens is, I'm walking along,
say in a shopping centre,

181
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,725
Here I am in a shopping centre
and you'll be the crowd?

182
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,480
There's a danger of jostling here,
because I'm going to that shop on my right,

183
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,405
You can indicate!

184
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,200
So now you know and you can take evasive action,
<span tts:color=yellow0 And you can go left?</span>

185
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:29,160
Yes, Actually,
I fancy the record shop over there,

186
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,720
Everybody knows what's happening, I think it's a very
good gift, <span tts:color=yellow0 Human indicators,</span>

187
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,817
So how much are they? Do we know?

188
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,845
Oh, I don't know, Some money,

189
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,645
Land Rover are taking
a very pragmatic approach

190
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,445
to the Christmas gift idea
and they have produced this,

191
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,520
It's the Land Rover distress
whistle and it will cost you &#163;1,50,

192
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,805
I just want to paint the scene
for you, You're in the wilderness

193
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,280
in your Land Rover and you drive into
an impassable gully, You become stuck,

194
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:00,165
It starts to fill up with water,

195
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,480
You're out of food,
you're almost out of fuel,

196
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:04,725
You cannot get a signal
on your mobile phone

197
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,480
and you're bleeding heavily from a
severe abdominal wound, But it's OK!

198
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,325
HE BLOWS WHISTLE

199
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,900
If I was there with you in that
situation and you produced that whistle,

200
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:17,467
I would beat you to death, <span
tts:color=cyan0 That's nice,</span>

201
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, yes, <span tts:color=yellow0
Look at this superb shirt,</span>

202
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,680
It's got everything
you need, really,

203
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,525
It has a web address here,

204
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,405
It's stitched into the collar
and then on the back,

205
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,245
<span tts:color=yellow0 look at that
- Mercedes-Benz, </span>That's classy,

206
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh, yeah, Really, honestly, it's hard to
think of any way that this could be improved,

207
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:42,800
That says, I have a washing machine and
everything else I own is already in it,

208
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:46,280
But, James, you like a flowery
shirt, so why wouldn't you like that?

209
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:49,240
Well, why would you want
a web address?

210
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:52,245
Jeremy? Jeremy?

211
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,845
OK, this is a bad thing,
That's a bad thing,

212
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,440
It's got out of hand,
It's all right, No, it's gone out,

213
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,645
Relax,

214
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,085
That's actually quite...

215
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,205
Jeremy has
set fire to the Christmas presents!

216
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,120
I have actually set fire to
the Land Rover teddy bear, No,

217
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,760
You know
the smoking rules in Britain?

218
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,480
<span tts:color=yellow0
My eyes! </span>Sorry about that!

219
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,165
Anyway, look - I think...

220
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,040
It's still on fire! <span tts:color=yellow0
It's not,</span>

221
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,320
It's smouldering, that's all,

222
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:32,085
Look at this!

223
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,000
It's a fork on one end and
a 10mm ring spanner on the other,

224
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,880
And the best thing is, there's
another spanner in the middle!

225
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:42,725
No, but this means
you can go seamlessly

226
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,640
from mending your motorcycle to
eating a pie without even pausing,

227
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:49,480
<span tts:color=yellow0
Look at this, </span>Wow!

228
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,765
You say wow,

229
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,445
This is some packaging,

230
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,840
You know the sort of packaging? You're
going to sever your fingers getting in there,

231
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,525
When you get in there,
you've got this metal thing,

232
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,140
Then you get underneath your car,
use what fingers you have left

233
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:07,720
from opening the packaging
to attach it to your exhaust pipe,

234
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:11,920
And then it makes a noise
which fools other road users

235
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:14,760
into thinking
that your car is turbo-charged,

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Is it like that wastegate
noise when you lift off?

237
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,565
Brilliant,

238
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,165
We could attach you -
it would be easier,

239
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,200
It's not really going to fool anybody bolted
onto my Panda, whatever sort of noise it makes,

240
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:32,845
Chaps, you know how difficult
it is to choose the right calendar,

241
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,080
<span tts:color=yellow0 Obviously you choose it now and
you've got to live with it, </span>It's a big commitment,

242
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,125
For 12 months,
you have to live with it,

243
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,240
So I'm a bit stumped on what I'm going to
use next year, because there's this one,

244
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:47,760
This is Her Majesty's
Prisons of England,

245
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:51,485
Different picture every month,

246
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,200
<span tts:color=yellow0 But then I found this one
- Birmingham's Outer Circle Municipal Bus Route, </span>Oh, nice!

247
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:02,600
But then I found, I think, the
solution to my calendar problems,

248
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,640
The Unofficial...

249
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,377
Oh, yes!

250
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,045
CHEERING

251
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,280
Who did that? It's awful!

252
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
You can have it, James,
I've got loads,

253
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,525
Why are you
drunk in all the pictures?

254
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,365
It looks like all the pictures were
taken coming out of award ceremonies,

255
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,560
so, yes, I probably was drunk, <span tts:color=yellow0
Do you know what I really love about that calendar?</span>

256
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:33,000
Because it's unofficial, you all go and
buy one, he receives not one single penny,

257
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,400
I know, I know!
Thank you for publicising it,

258
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:38,125
It's very kind of you,

259
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,000
We'd like to recommend this
calendar, Everybody go and buy it,

260
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,645
Get rid of that thing!

261
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,165
Let's do
the rest of the show like that,

262
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,120
Why does everything get
broken in our Christmas thing?

263
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:54,005
As we know, the Lottery Fund
has spent millions of pounds

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,760
turning old warehouses in places like Liverpool
and the West Midlands into art galleries,

265
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,405
And we also know that they have
all been an unmitigated failure,

266
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,200
We think the reason for this is because
they haven't got any cars in them,

267
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:13,497
Art experts will tell you that cars
aren't art, We think they can be,

268
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:18,725
Back in the 1970s, BMW started
making things like this over here,

269
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,440
It's a three-litre CSL, but the bodywork has
been painted by American artist Alexander Calder,

270
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:27,205
Then in the '90s,
there was a three-series race car,

271
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,140
The body's been painted by artist
Sandro Chia, Then over here,

272
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:35,005
an 850 CSI - that's been painted
by British artist David Hockney,

273
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Provincial galleries would never
accept this sort of thing these days,

274
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,325
and that, we reckon,
is exactly why they're failing,

275
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,000
So we decided to take over the
Mima Gallery in Middlesbrough,

276
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:47,845
And using nothing
but motoring-based art,

277
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,040
we would attempt to get 30,000 visitors
through the door up North in a single week,

278
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:58,160
And that's as many as Tate
Britain gets in a week in London,

279
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,360
This is the North,
which is where northerners live,

280
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,525
And this is the art gallery
we've taken over,

281
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,480
We'd simply clear out the paintings
northern people plainly don't want to see,

282
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:21,080
and fill it with motoring
exhibits that hopefully they do,

283
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:30,000
To decide what these exhibits would be, we
went to our secret motoring art base in Surrey,

284
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,360
<span tts:color=yellow0
What on earth is that? </span>It's a car,

285
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,365
The artist claims that he makes
these by painting them

286
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,405
and then driving a remote control
over them, I mean, I like it,

287
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,800
I like it, <span tts:color=cyan0
It's got a joie de vivre to it,</span>

288
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,645
Yes, put it in! Oh!

289
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,325
It's Damon Hill in the wet,

290
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,000
<span tts:color=yellow0
Superb, </span>That goes in,

291
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,605
What he should have done
is just given us that bit,

292
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,480
That would now look like one of Monet's visions of
his lily pond, but it would be about Formula One,

293
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:01,005
It does have a Monet
quality to it, no question,

294
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,565
I'm sorry, gentlemen, this
is the worst painting I've ever seen

295
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,240
<span tts:color=yellow0 in my entire
life and it's not coming, </span>Or is it?

296
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:12,125
Maybe this is a commentary
on the superhuman,

297
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,280
almost alien nature of
a Formula One driver at this level,

298
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,857
Because clearly this isn't human,

299
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:21,365
That much is immediately apparent,

300
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,920
What it's done is suck the life out
of this corpse in the overalls her,

301
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:29,845
All of that is gone,
drained out by this creature,

302
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,560
This is coming with us,
This is properly amazing stuff,

303
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:37,205
And so is that, I think in
Middlesbrough this will go well,

304
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,840
Why-aye, a tab! They're refuelling
his car and he's having a tab,

305
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,245
That is, without doubt,
the centrepiece of our exhibition,

306
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
It's exquisite work, <span tts:color=cyan0
That is not going in,</span>

307
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:52,640
<span tts:color=yellow0
Hammond... </span>It cannot go in!

308
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:56,445
We went round
the room ticking the yeses,

309
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Look at the way they've captured
his moustache so beautifully here,

310
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:03,480
Not just that moustache, but
the other two moustaches as well,

311
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:07,960
So this is a collage
out of press comments about him,

312
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:09,765
I see,

313
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,200
Excellent, Definitely going in,

314
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,365
Oh, gentlemen!

315
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,440
Gentlemen! I bet you any money
that in the North,

316
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:22,445
people will be stunned by this,
It's a V8 Shark,

317
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,360
<span tts:color=cyan0 If it provokes a response, that's going,
</span><span tts:color=yellow0 It will provoke a response,</span>

318
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,160
In addition to the pre-prepared art,
we've been making some ourselves,

319
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:36,685
James, for example,
is keen to make a sculpture,

320
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,940
I've decided to de-construct the car,
literally, as you can see, and artistically,

321
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:45,125
Then rather than try and rebuild it as
a sculpture that speaks about the car,

322
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm going to do it as a sculpture that speaks
about my emotions, my feelings, when I drive a car,

323
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:53,720
Inspired to some extent by Picasso...

324
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,165
What you need to bear in mind
is if you can get an artist,

325
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,960
somebody with frizzy hair and sticky-out
teeth, to say it's art, then it's art,

326
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,045
While James set to work
on his big metal face,

327
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,720
Richard went off to create a modern day
interpretation of Constable's Hay Wain,

328
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,360
Right...

329
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,000
Unlike Richard, I'm not very good at
drawing, because I didn't go to art school,

330
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:32,160
So my painting will be done by this,

331
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,885
The 2005 Red Bull F1 car, Yep,

332
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,380
Its three-litre V10
will be my brush,

333
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:48,805
All we need now
is a tame racing driver,

334
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,680
Some say he has a massive chin,
and that's true, he does,

335
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:56,485
Because he's David Coulthard,
So are you ready for this?

336
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,640
I think so, I'm still trying
to get my head round the concept,

337
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:01,325
Well, the idea is very simple,

338
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,205
We are going to put
paintballs into the air box,

339
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,520
They will then shoot out of
the exhaust, and into the canvas

340
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,125
that I'll be holding behind the car,

341
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,765
so we'll sort of splatter the canvas
using this car as our brush,

342
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,960
Sounds beautiful, <span tts:color=yellow0 It's
triggered to start firing them at 5,000 RPM,</span>

343
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,445
So you need to go to 5,000,
Can you do that?

344
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,400
I can probably manage that, <span tts:color=yellow0 So if you
want to hop in, mate, I'll go and stand behind the vehicle,</span>

345
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:28,880
Actually I might just put
some protection on my head,

346
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
I've done some weird things
in my life, but this is up there,

347
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,720
All right then, David, Ready!

348
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,320
Argh! Oh, God! Oh!

349
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:49,645
My gloves!

350
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,965
I'm not giving him mouth-to-mouth,
that's for sure,

351
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,040
Things were going badly for me, but
they were worse for Sir Henry May,

352
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,685
Every day, over 10,000 people go to the
National Gallery to see the Hay Wain,

353
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,040
More will come and see this, because it's
got more of a social statement about it,

354
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:25,280
Also, because I'd substituted
the Hay Wain for a Zonda,

355
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,120
It's poetry in paint,

356
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,400
One's now protected and using
a stronger aluminium canvas,

357
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:37,040
Coulthard and I were in business,

358
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,240
A plane of light
just bouncing off here,

359
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:52,000
Work it in, work it in...

360
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,165
With the paintball painting finished,
I was now busy on another creation,

361
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,980
What I'm doing is spraying the car with a special
paint that shows up best in ultra-violet light,

362
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:15,760
Sorry, sorry! So when I've finished, Mr Coulthard
is going to take it for a spin round the track,

363
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:20,120
It will streak, showing me
where the air flow has gone,

364
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:23,125
Sorry, sorry again, Sorry, mate,

365
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,840
With the car dripping wet,
David set off,

366
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,600
But unfortunately some of the paint
had gone on his visor,

367
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,720
Oh, dear!

368
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,000
After wiping his helmet, he set
off again to create some 200mph art,

369
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,885
You sprayed my helmet,

370
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,565
You shot one of my testicles,

371
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,680
Oh, I see, that helmet,
That was, I admit, a mistake,

372
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:04,557
but you should
see what has been achieved,

373
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:07,365
When we put this
under ultra-violet light...

374
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,920
Can we edit the spin out? <span tts:color=yellow0
Yes, we can edit that out!</span>

375
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:11,805
You promise?

376
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,580
Projects completed,
we reconvened at the secret base,

377
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,320
where our exhibits
were to be assessed by Rupert Maas,

378
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:21,600
an art dealer
from the Antiques Roadshow,

379
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,725
It was a lot better than this,

380
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,600
<span tts:color=yellow0 The problem was, it didn't
dry, </span>It's sort of still happening, isn't it?

381
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:34,400
It's performance art, because
it has streaked in a living way,

382
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,205
Yes...

383
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,325
It fell off the easel,

384
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,080
I mean, it really is nature and the
automotive world absolutely crashing together,

385
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:46,325
It's very good, Very good,

386
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,600
Quite, quite, I have to say, I think it is
probably more compost than art, but thank you,

387
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,880
Annoyingly, Rupert seemed to quite
interested in James May's big face,

388
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:02,405
It's called
Acceleration Face Number One,

389
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,845
I mean, I was inspired
to some extent by Der Blaue Reiter

390
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,405
and some of the works of that era, <span
tts:color=lime0 And African masks, </span>Exactly,

391
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,920
The African mask has had an influence on it, It's very
angular, it's quite simplistic, it's quite primitive,

392
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:19,005
<span tts:color=yellow0
Has it been on fire? </span>No,

393
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:25,040
What does the expert think? <span tts:color=lime0 Well, let's have
a look at it in the round, I quite like the welding, </span>Oh!

394
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
We can repair this, James,

395
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
<span tts:color=yellow0
That's better! </span>You see?

396
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,645
The Mona Lisa of the scrapheap,

397
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,365
The rest of the visit
wasn't any better,

398
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,720
<span tts:color=yellow0 Is there anything
here that catches your eye? </span>No,

399
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,517
<span tts:color=yellow0
Does that one work? </span>No,

400
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:51,280
<span tts:color=yellow0
Is this no good? </span>No,

401
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:53,925
Does it work on any level for you?

402
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,540
<span tts:color=lime0
No, </span>Does it have artistic merit?

403
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,085
<span tts:color=lime0
No, </span>So all of this is terrible?

404
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,440
Frankly, yes, <span tts:color=yellow0 Thank you
very much for coming along, </span>Thank you,

405
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:07,485
I value your opinion, I won't
necessarily pay any attention to it,

406
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,400
In fact, none of us will, But thank you very much for
coming, Rupert, <span tts:color=lime0 Pleasure,</span>

407
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:17,600
Feeling a bit disheartened, we decided
to try and create our own BMW art car,

408
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:21,245
We need to agree on
a light source and a viewpoint,

409
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,340
Our genius plan was to paint the
inside of the car on the outside,

410
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:31,400
with James taking the bonnet,
me the side, and Jeremy the boot,

411
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:33,445
Can you tell what it is yet?

412
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,080
Jeremy, though,
didn't quite get the idea,

413
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,760
Right, red for the blood,

414
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:41,840
Er, mate...

415
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,365
What?

416
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,645
It's supposed to be
what's INSIDE the car,

417
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,805
How do you know there isn't
a horse's head in the boot?

418
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,760
For our final creation, we had to cut a car in
half, which meant using a dangerous plasma cutter,

419
00:28:57,795 --> 00:29:01,565
That meant
we had to take precautions,

420
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,640
<span tts:color=yellow0 I could help,
</span>You can't do this with a hammer,

421
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,057
That's exactly why
you're taped to a chair,

422
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,440
This is like a scene
out of Reservoir Dogs,

423
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:12,885
Don't give us ideas,

424
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,485
Guys, where did you find that car?

425
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,560
It was just outside with
all the rest of them for this,

426
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:24,160
It says here,
RJO4 RWZ, it's a rental car,

427
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,880
APPLAUSE

428
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,365
We'll see how that pans out
later on,

429
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,005
but now it's time to put a
star in our reasonably priced car,

430
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,680
Now, my guest tonight won the 2009
Formula One World Drivers' Championship,

431
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:51,445
He won the 2009 World Constructors'
Championship for Brawn,

432
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,120
And when he was pipped to the BBC's
Sports Personality of the Year award

433
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:58,405
last weekend, by Ryan Giggs,

434
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,440
he won the 2009 trophy
for the best forced smile,

435
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,800
Let's see
if he's still gritting his teeth,

436
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:09,720
Ladies and gentlemen, Jenson Button!

437
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:11,680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

438
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:14,317
Thank you,

439
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:16,885
He's here,

440
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,640
Hello to you, Well done,

441
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,000
<span tts:color=yellow0 Jenson Button,
Formula One World Champion, </span>Wooh!

442
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:26,137
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

443
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:29,240
Have a seat, Have a seat,

444
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,840
OK, that's the congratulations
over now the commiserations,

445
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,845
Because this
time last week...

446
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,560
Did anybody see
Sports Personality Of The Year?

447
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:44,445
<span tts:color=lime0
Yes, </span>Yes,

448
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,160
I mean, let's be honest, Ryan Giggs,
he's 73,

449
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:51,725
And he can still kick a football,

450
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,925
I think you do need an
award for this, actually,

451
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,080
We have actually got a clip of the
moment, If you want to look away,

452
00:30:56,115 --> 00:31:01,080
Everyone else can see this,
here we go, This is the moment,

453
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:03,917
Well, that is a shock,

454
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:06,720
That's a big shock,

455
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:08,565
Yeah,

456
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,120
That is a... That is a rictus grin,
that is,

457
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,920
I could be an actor with that, no?

458
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:18,005
No, you couldn't,

459
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,365
You couldn't because what I loved
was when he said

460
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,125
I haven't got a speech ready I
thought, no, but the man behind you has,

461
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,100
So anyway, I just want to know because I'm
sure loads of people will be interested,

462
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:31,040
It was actually this time last year,
there you were gearing up for a new season,

463
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:35,045
You had got Ross Brawn on board
who's obviously a genius designer

464
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,680
and then the call comes through from Honda that
they're pulling out of the sport, How did that feel?

465
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:45,160
It was difficult, I had just got back from, I
was in Lanzarote doing some fitness training,

466
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,525
I was all ready for the new season,

467
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,320
I arrived at Gatwick and I got a
message from my manager saying,

468
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:52,805
it's over,

469
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,445
Honda are pulling out of the sport,

470
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,805
It was a really difficult thing
to take in, Because you know, will

471
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,400
were going to be racing in 2009, We were going to
have a competitive car, possibility of winning races,

472
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:06,605
There was a lot of work
that went into that car and

473
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,605
it would have been an absolute
tragedy if it wasn't on the grid,

474
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,320
So all I could do was stay focused and
try to help the team as much as I could,

475
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:18,965
And that's what we did, we got through a
difficult winter and we produced a car...

476
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,880
<span tts:color=yellow0 And this was when Ross was able to buy what
remained of the Honda team, </span><span tts:color=lime0 Yes,</span>

477
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:30,925
Now, you came here last time having not won a
race in Formula One and you had done about 14011,

478
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,680
<span tts:color=lime0 Yeah, </span>And you said you'd cheerfully
give up the jets, the lifestyle, the Monte Carlo for that first win,

479
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:43,240
But the thing is you damn nearly did give up
all that lifestyle to go to Brawn, didn't you?

480
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:48,005
I mean how big a sort of cut
was it in terms of everything?

481
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,845
There were 700 odd people working at the
factory and they had to scale down the team

482
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,560
so obviously there were some redundancies,
which was tough, even for the people that stayed,

483
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:03,880
But we all gave as much as we could
and we tried to help as much as we can,

484
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,760
I suppose it would be impossible to
say, no, I want n million dollars

485
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:08,605
a year when people are
being made redundant,

486
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,760
Because you went to 20% of
your salary or something,

487
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:15,080
Can't remember the figure
at the moment,

488
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:16,720
But don't feel sorry for me,

489
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,365
LAUGHTER

490
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,845
But that first test that you did

491
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,280
in what would become the Brawn car,
were you surprised how fast it was?

492
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:31,445
I knew we had built a good
car because all the numbers

493
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,525
said so in the wind tunnel but until you
actually drive it, yeah, you don't know 100%,

494
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,520
But we bolted in the Mercedes Benz engine in the
back because obviously it wasn't made for that engine,

495
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:46,920
We had to sort of trim the chassis down and
make sure the gearbox fitted, just about fitted,

496
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:49,085
With some spaces and what have you,

497
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,360
And went out and tested it at Barcelona and after
five laps I really felt comfortable in the car,

498
00:33:54,395 --> 00:33:57,880
And I came and I said, Guys, you know,
this is all right, This is a good baseline,

499
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,357
Even though it was a last minute
botch job to get the Mercedes engine,

500
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:02,765
Yes, yep, this fills pretty nice,
My engineer came up to me and said,

501
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,360
<span tts:color=lime0 Jenson, you are seven tenths quicker
than anyone, They had been testing for three months, </span>

502
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:12,920
Seven-tenths, <span tts:color=lime0 Seven tenths, Which
is a lot, </span>That's three years in Formula One,

503
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:16,040
It's massive, <span tts:color=yellow0 Oh yeah,
</span>And then every race people were putting on

504
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:19,880
big packages and for us to try and
keep the advantage was impossible,

505
00:34:19,915 --> 00:34:22,445
So, yeah, it's been a
very tricky season,

506
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,080
Leading the championship from
start to finish sounds easy,

507
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:26,725
But it's not,

508
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,005
It's really, really hard,

509
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,325
Cos I have to say,
I mean Brazil, I don't know

510
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,680
if anybody was watching Brazil
which was the penultimate race,

511
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:37,077
You had to come fourth and
then you were definitely

512
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:39,405
World Champion irrespective
of what anyone else did,

513
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Let's just have a look at these clips of
you in that race needing to come fourth,

514
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:48,085
So that's big John, isn't it?

515
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,480
<span tts:color=yellow0
Grosjean? </span>Grosjean, Yeah,

516
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,925
'Can he do it?'

517
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,400
'Another stunning piece of driving under pressure from
Button,' <span tts:color=lime0 Thank you, Martin,</span>

518
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:59,037
Look at that
again, that's round the outside,

519
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,605
'Wonderful move by
Button squeezed in there,'

520
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,080
We're almost doing 200 miles an hour there you can't really see
it from the camera but it's <span tts:color=yellow0 ... </span>

521
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:07,237
Jesus that's so close,

522
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,325
'Jenson Button through,'

523
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,885
'I have to say,
he's been impressive,'

524
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,805
So this is now whatever
his name is, the Red Bull,

525
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,480
That was last of the late
breakers, wasn't it? Take that,

526
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,365
APPLAUSE

527
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,600
Great drive, <span tts:color=lime0 Thank you,
</span>That was the drive of a champion that was,

528
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:30,640
You know when it kicks out...

529
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,685
When I'm driving a car and it
kicks out like that, I poo myself,

530
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,725
This might sound really silly and
think I'm a bit of a know it all, but

531
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,460
<span tts:color=lime0 I did actually do that on
purpose a little bit, </span>What, kick the tail out?

532
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:49,160
Because I had to make sure that I could get to turn
two first and one of the only way of doing it is

533
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:51,600
a little bit of oversteer makes the guy a
little nervous that you're getting close,

534
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:55,725
And that is what happened, And the
great thing is he backed out of it,

535
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,720
Sorry, I just need to... This is very peculiar,
So you have the World Championship riding on

536
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:06,240
your having to finish the race,
obviously to get the World Championship,

537
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:10,360
And you kick the arse of the car
out, ON PURPOSE,

538
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:13,165
to unnerve whoever he is,

539
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,120
Well, it's giving him less room he's
got no room to turn on the inside,

540
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:20,805
Yes but what if you had
cocked it up,

541
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,800
You know for me to win the world championship before the
last race was a must, <span tts:color=yellow0 Oh, yeah,</span>

542
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:29,520
I really wanted to get it done
before so I had to take the risk,

543
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,800
Now, obviously we are
looking forward to you versus Lewis,

544
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:34,765
Are you going to
be able to beat him?

545
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,685
That's the aim, I
wouldn't be doing it if not,

546
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,840
That's going to be, I tell you it's
going to be a fascinating battle,

547
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:42,525
This is a massive buzz for me,
It's so exciting,

548
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,965
I've been in F1 for ten years and
having the chance to race

549
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,160
alongside Lewis at McLaren, it's
something I'm really excited about,

550
00:36:51,195 --> 00:36:53,045
Can we just talk
about your road cars?

551
00:36:53,080 --> 00:37:00,600
<span tts:color=lime0 Yes, </span>Have you not got a Veyron? <span tts:color=lime0
Yes, I have, </span>Can I just ask what's the fastest you've driven it?

552
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:05,560
Um, 70 times... Less 10%... 77,

553
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:08,640
LAUGHTER

554
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,085
LAUGHTER

555
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,765
<span tts:color=lime0 It's actually been here, </span><span
tts:color=yellow0 Do you believe him? Has it?</span>

556
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,520
I sneaked in one day and unlocked the bars and drove round your
circuit, <span tts:color=yellow0 Had a bit of a practice,</span>

557
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:20,645
Was it any good here?

558
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,840
It was all right, except for you had... I can't say
what I was going to say, Because I want to sell it,

559
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,525
LAUGHTER

560
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,240
So anyway, obviously you came here
into our Liana,

561
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:36,165
I tell you what,

562
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,160
I had to change my driving style here,
<span tts:color=yellow0 Really?</span>

563
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:41,477
I think it was the snow, possibly,

564
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,725
You say that, you're such a fusspot,

565
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,720
No, seriously, listen to this, You've
got to listen to me, I'm a guest,

566
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:51,205
LAUGHTER

567
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,920
Go on because it would just
be a racing driver excuse,

568
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,165
No, it isn't an excuse
but I jumped in

569
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,240
and I sat there revving the engine with
the heater on thinking, I'm so nervous,

570
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:03,525
This thing is an amazing bit of
kit,

571
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,600
I've learnt so much coming here I'm really
going to take it into the 2010 season,

572
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,605
Who would like to see Jenson's lap?

573
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,205
<span tts:color=cyan0
Yeah!</span>

574
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,440
There you go, It's
obviously the old Liana,

575
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,285
And there it is,
We haven't seen that for ages,

576
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,100
<span tts:color=lime0
Look how wet it is, </span>It's damp,

577
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,987
Think like this is for the
World Championship, come on JB,

578
00:38:26,022 --> 00:38:28,840
It's more important than the
Formula One world championship,

579
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,445
Look at it, it's greasy,

580
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,405
In F1 if it's wet the tyres work,
if it's greasy you just slide,

581
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,240
<span tts:color=yellow0 You're holding on nicely through there,
</span><span tts:color=lime0 A little bit slippery out here,</span>

582
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,685
It is interesting, that first turn,

583
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,565
Yes, I'm
impressed, no power understeer,

584
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,480
<span tts:color=yellow0 First turn you took the
wide line in, </span>A little bit wild, JB, Come on!

585
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:51,725
At least I'm not singing,

586
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,960
You're not singing, And Lewis has a different line
in that first corner and he's adamant about it,

587
00:38:56,995 --> 00:39:01,777
<span tts:color=yellow0 So there you
go, you see, now that's tidy, </span>

588
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:06,560
I tell you what, I'm more scared
driving this than I'm a Formula One car,

589
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,845
I was, This bit here is scary,

590
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,680
<span tts:color=yellow0 It is, If you go on the red wires, that's
quite slippery, </span>I think they should put this on the F1 calendar,

591
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:15,240
This place rocks,

592
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,360
Oh, That was nice and close
to the tyres made the move,

593
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:21,320
Second to last corner
here let's have a look,

594
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:22,885
Yes, that's good,

595
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,160
<span tts:color=yellow0 Got the back out a bit,
</span><span tts:color=lime0 Yeah, it's fun, Beauty,</span>

596
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,840
Come-on, got the back out again,

597
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,557
There we are,

598
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:31,205
Across the line,

599
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,960
I thought that looked
quite good, that,

600
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,445
So,

601
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,960
APPLAUSE

602
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,840
So, Here we go, Jenson... Button,

603
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,800
<span tts:color=lime0 See that, I didn't
even lean forward, </span>You will,

604
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,640
No, really, Where do you reckon?

605
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:55,245
It felt good,

606
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,940
Very slippery but I could slide
the car through the corners,

607
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,600
It was fun, I don't think
I'm quicker than I was before,

608
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:04,445
Because it was dry, how would I be?

609
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,965
Well, Lewis was here in exactly the
same car in exactly the same conditions,

610
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,720
<span tts:color=yellow0 They rarely were exactly
the same, </span>I'm a better driver than I was then,

611
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:18,400
You did it, he's a 1,44,7,
you did it in 1...

612
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:20,497
40...

613
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:22,560
4...

614
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,045
9...

615
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,640
<span tts:color=lime0 Oh, you're kidding, </span><span
tts:color=yellow0 You just missed out,</span>

616
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,885
But give him a huge one,

617
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,160
Wait a minute, I'll
give you the wet,

618
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,360
Look at that,

619
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,120
Do you know what it was? It was that
showboating in the last two corners,

620
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:44,685
It was fun, though,
That little thing is so fun,

621
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,800
It is, You should try the
more powerful Chevrolet Lacetti,

622
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:50,360
Well, they wouldn't let
me have a go in that one,

623
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:51,885
No, because that's the Formula One
car,

624
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,240
Anyway ladies and gentlemen, I give
our World Champion, Jenson Button,

625
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:02,405
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

626
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,045
And actually your face will be

627
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,480
back in a minute because what we're going
to do now is pick up our art gallery film,

628
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,920
James and I arrived by aeroplane
fresh from the south,

629
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:20,120
Where do Geordies actually come from?

630
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:22,645
Geordies are from the Northeast,

631
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,480
Maybe they're all Geordies, Then
there's others, Foggies, aren't there?

632
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,725
There's the Foggies and the
Muggies and the monkey hangers,

633
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,340
<span tts:color=cyan0 I don't know what they
are, </span>Are they all types of Geordie?

634
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,920
<span tts:color=cyan0 Well I think so,
</span>Or are they, maybe they're different,

635
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:36,525
They all say why-aye so
they must all be Geordies,

636
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,760
As our BMW art car was so valuable, I
decided to drive it to the exhibition myself,

637
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,040
What I have here is a 3,5
litre straight six painting,

638
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:55,680
It's art that moves you,
quite literally, moves you,

639
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,365
At the Middlesbrough Institute Of
Modern Art, Captain Sense of Direction

640
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,765
had decided to make an audio guide to that
would steer visitors around the exhibits,

641
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,200
If you turn through almost 180 degrees to your left
or even to your right in fact because it of course

642
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:20,320
makes no difference whatsoever and walk
straight ahead towards the wall and rotating to

643
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:25,200
your right and not quite through 180
degrees but probably about 155,

644
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,560
I, meanwhile was on the road, touring the local radio
stations in a bid to drum up some support for our show,

645
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,437
This is fantastic,

646
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,245
I've got a van,

647
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,000
I've got a list of phone
numbers and I've got a mission,

648
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,520
I'm a PR agent,

649
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,765
And then walking through the white
door we arrive at the upstairs gallery,

650
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,760
Actually, that's not right, You need to come out
and turn left or right if you haven't gone through

651
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:57,920
the white door through the
glass door, which you push,

652
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:01,685
You are then in
the upstairs gallery,

653
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,440
The first stop on my publicity tour
was Radio Tees,

654
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:09,160
Who cares about the weather
because it's the weekend,

655
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:12,725
Who cares when Top Gear is in town,

656
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,680
And Richard flipping Hammond is with
us, <span tts:color=yellow0 Yes!</span>

657
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:17,840
Here comes the publicity,

658
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,800
Welcome to Teesside, You of course used to work
here many many years ago, why are you here?'

659
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:29,520
Well, it's great to be here,
I did used to work here, apparently,

660
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:33,240
I worked in a lot of radio
stations for not very long,

661
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:36,125
What are you doing!

662
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,805
'So yes I worked here... '

663
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,960
<span tts:color=yellow0 Talk about the exhibition,
</span>And I have fond memories of working here,

664
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:46,097
Nobody's interested in your
bloody memories,

665
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:50,200
Because I started in radio York
in 1989,

666
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:53,485
Oh for crying out loud!

667
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,360
For the rest of the interview Hammond
brilliantly publicised... himself,

668
00:43:57,395 --> 00:44:01,200
I've just started something up called
Blast Lab, a kids' science show,

669
00:44:01,235 --> 00:44:04,285
Oh, for God's sake,
This is ridiculous,

670
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,245
To make matters worse
in the gallery May was busy

671
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,725
ignoring our instructions to
make the audio guide interesting,

672
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,880
As it was codenamed during development,
rejecting the complicated hydragas suspension

673
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:20,725
of its forebear, the Allegro,
in favour of a straightforward

674
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,800
steel-sprung chassis with a rear axle derived
from a design already used to great effect,

675
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,320
Hello?

676
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,240
Yeah, I'm doing it,

677
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:36,125
I've just,

678
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,960
Yes, I know it's got to be done by
it 3,30, But I can't do it because

679
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:40,520
people keep ringing me up and
asking me if I've done it yet,

680
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,000
As I bore down on Middlesbrough, Hammond's
publicity tour was going from bad to worse,

681
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:52,525
Yes, I did, I started in 1989
at Radio York,

682
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:59,280
'Yeah, absolutely, I think Total Wipeout
has been a tremendous success... '

683
00:44:59,315 --> 00:45:01,565
I'm going to have a heart attack!

684
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,125
There's one where people
have to climb a platform and

685
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,680
in front of them are four massive red
inflatable balls and they have to...

686
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:09,240
Total Wipeout is just
idiots falling over,

687
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,480
Talk about our art exhibition!

688
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,085
The good people of Hartlepool,

689
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,965
Hammond is in town with his
PR machine,

690
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,280
At Mima, the other idiot was
in the gallery of motor-racing,

691
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:34,965
A subject about
which he knows nothing,

692
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,165
Some pictures of racing
cars going around corners...

693
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,840
Hopefully, these cardboard boxes
won't be here by the time you arrive,

694
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,725
There's a man on fire,

695
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,680
There's a car going along, erm...

696
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:49,320
And then I had a problem,

697
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,920
I was coming round the corner
doing about 27mph

698
00:45:53,955 --> 00:45:56,365
and a cow was there,

699
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,645
And I just had nowhere
to go because of this...

700
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,080
I'd say there was a school bus... well it was
a bus full of children, handicapped children,

701
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:05,685
and I saw some ginger
ones on so I just...

702
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,440
I thought, well I'm going to have
to miss that, so I'll put it

703
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:10,800
in the ditch rather than injure
the children,

704
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,245
That story didn't wash,

705
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,040
Take a deep breath, Sir, Lips around
the tube, constant stream of breath,

706
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,000
Keep going, keep going, keep going,
thank you,

707
00:46:20,035 --> 00:46:21,645
The good news was, I scored zero,

708
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,520
The bad news came when the car
was towed out of the ditch,

709
00:46:26,555 --> 00:46:31,005
That's not too...
It is quite bad, Oh, God,

710
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,080
And my attempts to mask the damage
with T-Cut just made everything worse,

711
00:46:36,115 --> 00:46:39,680
ENGINE REVS

712
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,605
This was an important
exhibit for us, this car,

713
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm casting around in my head for someone to
blame but it's just me, it keeps coming back at me,

714
00:46:53,035 --> 00:46:57,560
So, when we met up, I decided
to do the honourable thing,

715
00:46:57,595 --> 00:46:59,045
And go on the attack,

716
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,885
Did you hear what he did on the...?

717
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,200
<span tts:color=cyan0 Yes, I did hear what you did on
the radio, </span>I've been working my backside off,

718
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:08,240
You have been and done one interview and
you talked about Blast Lab, Total Wipeout...

719
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:10,360
He didn't ask the right questions, <span
tts:color=yellow0 I told you,</span>

720
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:12,685
I know more about PR than you,
I was on top of it,

721
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,565
Listen, none of this detracts
from the fact, and I can read it in

722
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,520
your face, that you've been an idiot
and you have ruined the whole event,

723
00:47:20,555 --> 00:47:22,765
By the way, Thanks for asking,

724
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,480
<span tts:color=yellow0
I'm fine, </span>We don't care,

725
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:27,245
Evidently, No, it has not...

726
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,800
As the exhibition was due to open the following
morning, we agreed to stop bickering and get to work,

727
00:47:32,835 --> 00:47:35,765
James went off to rouse the troops,

728
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,840
And Richard
relaunched his PR campaign,

729
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,885
My work is complete,
One mobile billboard,

730
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,845
But better still,
just to really give the message,

731
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,360
what I've done is actually put one of the exhibits
from the gallery, on the move, lit and everything,

732
00:47:51,395 --> 00:47:55,605
so that people can see it, I'll leave
the door open as I am driving around,

733
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,605
THAT is PR, <span tts:color=lime0 I'm good,
</span><span tts:color=yellow0 Good,</span>

734
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,840
I was with Stephen Wiltshire, the artist famous
for creating detailed drawings from memory,

735
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,120
So which bit of New York do you think
you're going to put behind the car?

736
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:14,680
I'm going to
put the Brooklyn Bridge,

737
00:48:14,715 --> 00:48:16,320
Brooklyn Bridge, OK,

738
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,800
Out on the streets, the PR machine
had adopted a more personal approach,

739
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,325
People of Middlesbrough,

740
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,720
Tomorrow morning is your opportunity to soak
up some art, Madame, in the black tracksuit,

741
00:48:30,755 --> 00:48:33,577
Sir, in the white tracksuit
top, you could visit Mima,

742
00:48:33,612 --> 00:48:36,400
You, young man, in the grey
black tracksuit trousers,

743
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:37,885
You sir, in the blue tracksuit top,

744
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,000
Tomorrow morning, nine o'clock at
Mima,

745
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:44,045
Art is for the masses,
art is for you sir,

746
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,000
In the black tracksuit trousers and you
young man in the blue tracksuit trousers,

747
00:48:48,035 --> 00:48:51,560
There is a festival of art
available for you,

748
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,880
Back at the gallery it was all go,
Each of us had chosen what he

749
00:48:57,915 --> 00:49:00,677
thought was the
best-looking car of all time,

750
00:49:00,712 --> 00:49:03,405
And Jeremy and I were
busy installing them,

751
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,960
Richard had gone for his
own, Series 1 Land Rover,

752
00:49:06,995 --> 00:49:09,937
Jeremy for a Ferrari 275 GTS,

753
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:12,845
No, it is absolutely terrific,

754
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,000
I bet if you turn the radio on it'll just be
the beginning of The Italian Job, That music,

755
00:49:17,035 --> 00:49:19,765
And I'd gone for a
Lamborghini Countach,

756
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,520
How long have you talked about the
Lamborghini Countach for on the audio tape?

757
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:25,680
Please tell me it's no
more than two seconds,

758
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:28,245
A few minutes,

759
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,285
It's a very important car,

760
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,965
So, this idea that...
seriously James...

761
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,965
Yes, but you're only thinking in
terms of numbers of people coming

762
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,480
<span tts:color=cyan0 through, which I know is an honourable
ambition... </span><span tts:color=yellow0 Yes, that's the goal,</span>

763
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:40,085
Yes, but they have to come to a
gallery and experience some art,

764
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,800
OK, what's this James? This is how I want
to see the people of Middlesbrough, OK,

765
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,960
On your left, there's a Lamborghini Countach,
that's a Ferrari 275 GTS and there's a Land-Rover,

766
00:49:52,995 --> 00:49:56,137
In here,
we've actually got some art,

767
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:59,245
That's the speed
I want them to be doing,

768
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,240
If they saunter, if they're standing there,
saying, Oh, look at the wire wheels and the seats...

769
00:50:05,275 --> 00:50:06,765
The log jam,

770
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,480
There was, however, a more immediate
problem, Oh, hang on a minute,

771
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:15,085
<span tts:color=yellow0
Hang on, </span>Is it too wide?

772
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,605
<span tts:color=yellow0
Well, yeah, </span>We cannot not have it,

773
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,160
<span tts:color=yellow0 Can't it just be there?
</span><span tts:color=cyan0 Well, not really,</span>

774
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:23,400
Eventually, the Countach was
bought in on a special giant thing,

775
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:28,285
And with that done,
we went to check on Stephen,

776
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,880
So that's four hours, And it's gone from a blank
piece of paper to that James, in four hours,

777
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:37,440
<span tts:color=cyan0 That's extremely good,
</span>How many times have you been to this place,

778
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:40,125
Twice, in the Brooklyn Heights,

779
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,880
So you remember the detail on this bridge, just from
standing here two times? <span tts:color=lime0 Yeah,</span>

780
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:49,165
That car is astonishing,

781
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,840
<span tts:color=yellow0 I know, You're pedantic on these things,
That is really accurate, </span><span tts:color=cyan0 Spot on,</span>

782
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,600
Darkness fell but still
Hammond's PR onslaught rumbled on,

783
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:05,325
We've stuffed the Mima
gallery full of things

784
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,285
that people want to go and see,
Obviously, it's automotive themed...

785
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,200
And long into the night, James and I were
arguing about where the art car should go,

786
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:18,080
So what, you want to position it to draw
people's attention to the bit you crashed?

787
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:20,000
<span tts:color=yellow0
Well, yes, </span>No, I disagree,

788
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,285
OK, it needs to be...

789
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,720
Leave it like that, Please
go, get on with your next job,

790
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:27,760
I'm very happy, Leave it there,

791
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,205
Show day, And amazingly, our
exhibition was looking rather good,

792
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,605
We had installed many thought-provoking
pieces including, Stig World,

793
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:58,200
A video installation where visitors get a
glimpse of what goes on inside his helmet,

794
00:51:58,235 --> 00:52:02,680
We also had our ground-breaking
masterpiece called, What's Europcar

795
00:52:02,715 --> 00:52:08,285
Going To Say About This?,
and obviously Our BMW art car,

796
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,060
We knew that all of this would bring in the
multitudes and prove that motoring is the way forward

797
00:52:14,095 --> 00:52:19,800
for the nation's art galleries, so we went on
to the roof for our first glimpse of the queues,

798
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:21,560
We'll be able to look at
the crowd from over here,

799
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:23,240
Are you ready, steady...

800
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,800
It's not that big, is it?

801
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,845
It was a disaster,

802
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,440
And the news from the outlying
car-parks was even worse,

803
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:39,480
It was like a scene from Omega Man,

804
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,880
It's now 10 to 10, As you can see,
we've been open for 15 minutes,

805
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:47,400
And there is just...

806
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,005
There, officially now,
the people looking after

807
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,165
the exhibits, outnumbering the
number of people looking at it,

808
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,040
My carefully-prepared personal
lectures were a complete waste of time,

809
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:12,280
For me, the artist has managed
to avoid any kind of branding,

810
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:14,600
It's just simply pure...

811
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:24,200
To hit our targets we needed 800 visitors
an hour but it just wasn't happening,

812
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,685
I am just doing a
rough head count here,

813
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,120
<span tts:color=yellow0
That's about... </span>It's not a lot,

814
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:31,565
Around 75 people, tops,

815
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,520
By midday the numbers had picked up a bit but
instead of following the prescribed route through

816
00:53:36,555 --> 00:53:42,237
the gallery, everyone was all over the
place thanks to James' useless audio guide,

817
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:47,920
'And then walking through the white
door, we arrive at the upstairs gallery,'

818
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:49,605
'Actually, that's not quite right,'

819
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,480
'Into the next room,
The door of which should be open,'

820
00:53:52,515 --> 00:53:55,120
HIGH-PITCHED ALARM BLARES

821
00:53:55,155 --> 00:53:58,925
'Bloody Nora,'

822
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,880
'Yeah, but I can't do it because people keep
ringing me up and asking me if I've done it yet,'

823
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,120
'I can't even turn it off,'

824
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,000
Worse still, Hammond had forgotten
to do his homework on the exhibits,

825
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:16,965
That's a Ferrari 275 GTS,

826
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,160
As you can see, the lines are...

827
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:22,680
It's lovely,

828
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,320
<span tts:color=lime0 Nice colour,
</span>Yes, it is a lovely colour, yes, it is,

829
00:54:28,355 --> 00:54:31,325
We called an emergency meeting,

830
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,680
OK, right, what are we
doing, what are we doing?

831
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,685
Don't skid away, let's just relax,

832
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,645
Please... <span tts:color=yellow0 What is going to
work about it? This is a catastrophe, James,</span>

833
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,760
<span tts:color=cyan0 It's not a catastrophe...
</span><span tts:color=yellow0 It's a catastrophe,</span>

834
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:47,445
Plainly, Hammond's
PR had been rubbish,

835
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,920
So, to bring in the crowds
we needed to find one,

836
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,725
And we did,

837
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,325
FOOTBALL FANS CHANT

838
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,245
At half-time, we would
make a hearts and minds

839
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,040
appeal for the Middlesbrough fans
to come to our show after the match,

840
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:09,040
Sadly, though, we put Captain
Geordie in charge of our outfits,

841
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,720
BOOING AND WHISTLING

842
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,040
Is this not...?

843
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,320
Give us a minute,

844
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,200
CHEERING

845
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,325
People of the Northeast,

846
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,720
We apologise for
that terrible mistake,

847
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,040
We are here to ask... Please, we have
an art exhibition at the Mima Gallery,

848
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:59,760
we need your support,
we have Ferraris, Lamborghinis,

849
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:01,680
we have Richard
Hammond's Land Rover,

850
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,400
Er, anything else?
No, Oh, there's one thing,

851
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:09,685
Nottingham, You can't come,

852
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,925
The away fans responded with
good grace,

853
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,320
# You fat bastard, you fat bastard
you fat bastard... #

854
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:18,480
You fat bastard!

855
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,960
Amazingly, though, our plan worked,

856
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:27,920
In you come,

857
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,205
If you start shuffling
through that way,

858
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:38,400
Soon the place was packed, which meant
I could finally unveil our centrepiece,

859
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:43,080
Without a doubt, the highlight,
the highlight of the show so far,

860
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,645
How much do you have to
hate somebody

861
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,400
to sit down with a piece of
cloth and then do that to him?

862
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,525
Among the crowd was a learned art scholar who
could see James' sculpture for what it was,

863
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,080
<span tts:color=cyan0 Are you saying it's a bit crap, </span><span
tts:color=lime0 Yeah, </span>Nothing to see, Nothing to see,

864
00:57:04,115 --> 00:57:08,245
The crowds, though, meant we had a
new problem with a James' audio guide,

865
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:15,040
Not only was it still getting everybody lost but
as I'd feared it was also extremely long-winded,

866
00:57:15,075 --> 00:57:17,725
'And latterly, to
5,2 litres, an expansion'

867
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,000
'that was accompanied by the
fitment of a new cylinder head... '

868
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:22,245
PHONE RINGS <span
tts:color=cyan0 'Hello,'</span>

869
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,085
This meant the visitors weren't
moving through the gallery fast enough,

870
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,920
Have you been listening to the audio guide?
<span tts:color=lime0 Yeah, </span>How is it?

871
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:32,085
Pretty boring,

872
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,880
With bottlenecks springing up everywhere
there was no way we'd get the numbers through,

873
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:40,325
So I was forced to shorten
my personal lectures a bit,

874
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,325
Right, everybody, there's only one
interesting thing in here

875
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,200
and it's that painting there of the
Bentley, Good, you've seen it, off we go,

876
00:57:47,235 --> 00:57:49,845
There we are, that's
a BMW, we've done it,

877
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,520
In here's a Formula One car
with some paint on it, lovely,

878
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:54,245
Right, out, Out,

879
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,445
Out, you, you, off you go,

880
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,280
<span tts:color=yellow0 James, however, simply didn't
get the idea of this at all, </span>Does he know?

881
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,217
Does a cat know it's a cat?

882
00:58:03,252 --> 00:58:04,986
Does a dog know when its old,

883
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:06,720
What does he actually know?

884
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,045
What are you doing
with them up there?

885
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,605
Well, I'll tell you
exactly what's happening,

886
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,920
Everybody's getting into a room where
James May is talking and they're stuck,

887
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:21,205
This called for drastic measures,

888
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,280
<span tts:color=yellow0 These are stink bombs, </span>So
in machine terms he's extremely bright but he's inanimate,

889
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:31,600
Does he have any feelings? Can we transfer
our own feelings on to the crash-test dummy?

890
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:34,285
Sorry,

891
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,365
Rodin's Thinker, He's sort of naked,

892
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,120
<span tts:color=yellow0 Ooo, bit of an itch, </span>The point of
art is, you have to interact with it, You don't just look at it,

893
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,800
What's that stink?

894
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,165
Sorry about that, it's
unfortunate, but...

895
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,360
OK, if you'd like to move to the exits
now, tremendous, thank you for leaving here,

896
00:58:56,395 --> 00:59:00,085
Sorry about the smell, I've
no idea how that happened,

897
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:07,760
Soon the crowds were moving along at a fair old
pace, which meant there wasn't much more we could do,

898
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:10,760
<span tts:color=yellow0 We've got the best
exhibits that we could have got, </span>Yep,

899
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:13,720
We've done the best
PR that we can do,

900
00:59:13,755 --> 00:59:15,885
Oh yeah,

901
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,080
It's now time for us to bail out
and let the numbers roll in,

902
00:59:21,115 --> 00:59:23,717
With that, Back to the studio,

903
00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:26,320
I finally got to say that,

904
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,040
APPLAUSE

905
00:59:30,075 --> 00:59:32,725
OK,

906
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,160
I have the figures here, remember...

907
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,805
Remember, we had to beat 30,000,

908
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,480
Yes, so... <span tts:color=yellow0 And
what we actually managed was 50,000,</span>

909
00:59:42,515 --> 00:59:44,897
Yes, yes,

910
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:46,946
No, no, 15,

911
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:48,925
15,000,

912
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,680
Oh,
so, a half of what we needed then,

913
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:54,445
Yeah, we were halfway there,

914
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,125
But, this is still an all-time
record for the Mima Gallery,

915
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,520
Yes, That is brilliant, <span tts:color=yellow0
We did it,</span>

916
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:05,560
We sort of did it, We did something,

917
01:00:05,595 --> 01:00:07,245
Cars are the future of art,

918
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,085
They are and that is a bombshell
and that means we can end,

919
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:19,120
Now, we're back on December 27th with an elongated
special in which we drive across South America,

920
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:21,965
That is quite something,
But until then,

921
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,760
Have a very, very happy Christmas,
Take care, Good night,

922
01:00:25,795 --> 01:00:28,600
