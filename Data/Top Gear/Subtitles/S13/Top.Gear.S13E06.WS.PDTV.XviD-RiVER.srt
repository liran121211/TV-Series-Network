1
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:13,760
Tonight I wear some goggles

2
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,315
Richard falls down a small slope

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,490
And James Says hello to a man

4
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:20,790
All right, mate?

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,690
hello, hello, good evening, thank you everybody.

6
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:32,995
thank you, thank you

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,980
Now as we know the real world where we all live if full of dreary cars,

8
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:43,290
like the Renault Scenic and the Toyota... whatever this is.

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,175
Which is why, in the fantasy world that is Top Gear,

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,000
we prefer to feature things that are a bit more exciting,

11
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,810
a bit more dinosaurish.

12
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,060
Our track...

13
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,150
.. it's the natural home of the quad cam 84 litre carnivore.

14
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:12,387
From the massive Murcielago

15
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:15,590
to the agile Ariel Raptor

16
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,135
we have them all.

17
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,100
We even have a keeper capable of taming them.

18
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,840
The Top Gear test track? It's Jurassic Park!

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,750
This week, though, there are no T Rexes. There are no raptors.

20
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:35,917
There are none of those... Pssp!.. spitty things.

21
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:40,050
This week, Top Gear has gone all Springwatch.

22
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,960
This is the new BMW Z4.

23
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,310
It's not mid-engined.

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,590
It isn't a fire-breathing monster that runs on brimstone and baby owls.

25
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,070
It's just a common-or-garden sports car.

26
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:01,735
I didn't like the old Z4.

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,160
I thought it was too ugly and mostly driven by people

28
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:10,070
who spent their evenings wife swapping.

29
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:12,365
Do you know why I thought that

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,270
It just whenever I thought that someone with Z4, I thought those car keys

31
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:20,272
I bet them spend less time in the ignition

32
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,205
and they doing a pot round at Muriel's house.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,570
Given the choice, I would have bought a Mercedes SLK instead.

34
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,960
In fact, I did.

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,275
This, however, is the new Z4.

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,920
While it may not be much of a looker with the new aluminium roof up

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,580
It is fantastic with it down

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,045
it is sort of Uma Thurman-ish

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,310
Perfect, But you Can't really explain why.

40
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:59,540
It's the same story with the interior

41
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,390
It's very different to any other car

42
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:05,680
and that's good but so's this!

43
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,875
That long, priapic bonnet

44
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,830
houses a 3-litre engine which is boosted

45
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:17,290
by two turbo chargers.

46
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,150
Actually it doesn't feel like a pair of turbos.

47
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,140
It feels like a pair of testes.

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,820
Big, meaty ones!

49
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,515
Obviously it's not a raptor

50
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,750
but since I'm now doing 140 mph...

51
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,050
it's not a cow either.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,130
The best thing about this car, though,

53
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,450
is how it feels to drive.

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,795
The old Z4 was too hard.

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,230
Getting in to it after a hard day at work was like getting home

56
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:01,920
and flopping down on a sofa made out of Chuck Norris.

57
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,485
This one, though,

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,250
they've done what Lotus did with the Evora and Jaguar with the XF -

59
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,070
they've softened it down.

60
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,730
It's nice!

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,110
Don't think however it's become a hopeless wallowing herbivore.

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,600
That intrinsic BMW-ness is still there.

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,910
It's got that wonderful sense that when you turn into a corner,

64
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:39,580
that the whole car is pivoting around your hips.

65
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,790
Who'd have thought I'd come right down the food chain this week?

66
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,500
I'm in Kate Humble's hedge

67
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,520
And I'm loving it!

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,310
Today, I'd buy a Z4 over a Mercedes SLK in a heartbeat.

69
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,675
In fact, I'd rather have one of these

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,630
than almost any of the Top Gear dinosaurs.

71
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,620
It is THAT GOOD!

72
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,585
'Before we move on though, there is another new car

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,700
'in the Springwatch section of Top Gear's wildlife park. '

74
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,782
(Look! Look! There it is.

75
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,795
(That is a brown Datsun.

76
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,325
(I realise, of course, that you might think...

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,540
(that here in the whole world of pterodactyls and peacocks

78
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,430
I'm hanging its tail out.

79
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm revelling... in the short wheelbase, the taut rear drive chassis.

80
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm on the straight and I'm UNLEASHING 326 horsepower!

81
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,720
Eat my exhaust fumes dinosaur!

82
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,480
This is the new Nissan 370Z GT...

83
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,020
a shortened, more powerful version of the old 350.

84
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,785
Prices start at 27,000 and that makes it very cheap

85
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,790
especially when you look at all the equipment it has.

86
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,580
I've even got something called a "SynchroRev Match system".

87
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:50,835
So, In the 4th Gear, Yes, wanna change to The 2nd

88
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,660
You hear that, it revs the engine, SO the Right speed match the revs

89
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,985
Make the change smoother.

90
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,220
That's very simple and very clever. - I like that.

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,490
as a heart starter, this thing eats the BMW for breakfast.

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,995
It's got 26 more horsepower for a kickoff.

93
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,870
It's a lot more... exciting as well somehow.

94
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,025
And even this GT version,

95
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,420
with leather seats and the rev-o-matic gearbox,

96
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:33,210
is five-and-a-bit thousand pounds cheaper.

97
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,950
THIS is a RACING hen!

98
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,030
There is just one problem with it however.

99
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:45,990
It's very nasty.

100
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,675
It's fine here on the track

101
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,930
but on the road, it's so hard and harsh.

102
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:58,585
It's also very noise

103
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,685
And it's not a nice noise, either.

104
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,795
I would rather listen to my own firing squad.

105
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,170
The worst thing about this car though, is that if you had one,

106
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:13,960
you'd never get invited to a wife-swapping party.

107
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:20,060
People would think you're a bit... Oddy.

108
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,025
but, this, I love it

109
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,155
honestly, if somebody says to me

110
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,625
you have to have to one of these for the rest of your life,"

111
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,310
I Would be delighted. Yes, It's great, I Like... It's brilliant car

112
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:41,190
however we must now find out how fast this,

113
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,665
and indeed the hen go round our track,

114
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,380
which of course means handing them over to our tame racing driver.

115
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:54,190
Some say that on Thursdays he becomes incredibly bulbous...

116
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:04,330
.. and that recently pigs in Mexico have started to die of something called "Stig flu".

117
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:08,550
All we know is he's highly contagious.

118
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,040
And they're off! I have to say, these cars aren't really comparable.

119
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:18,102
The Nissan is loud and aggressive, the BMW more day-to-day

120
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:22,130
but they both look tidy through the first corner there.

121
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,470
Yep, no problems at all.

122
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh, dear, it sounds like two sets of bagpipe music there.

123
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:37,785
Hard to tell really with bagpipes. Anyway...

124
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,875
we're round Chicago nicely. Coming up to Hammerhead.

125
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Looks the BMW might be having a bit- of under steer there. Yes, it is!

126
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,945
But at least he's OK with the gear change

127
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,610
cos the Stig's in the automatic which BMW say is actually faster.

128
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,930
So It's the Datsun got there, Follow-Through.

129
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,350
My word! Now the BMW's got an over steer!

130
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:06,245
I've never seen that there before!

131
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,590
The Nissan has no problem at all. Two corners left.

132
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,132
The BMW kicking out its tail again!

133
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,605
The Nissan rather boring in comparison.

134
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,570
But... Yes, now look at it! It's showboating! And there they go!

135
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,720
Across the line!

136
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,505
Mmm? Now... here we have the Nissan,- look.

137
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,540
The Nissan did it in 1 minute 27.5 and the BMW...

138
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:37,392
1 minute 28.2.

139
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:40,175
So that goes...

140
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,495
there. So what we're saying here,

141
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,055
really, is, er, buy the BMW because it's slower,

142
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:52,190
less exciting, more expensive and less well-equipped.

143
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,905
And now the news. And the big news this week -

144
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,655
the government wants to put up signs on the motorway

145
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,655
telling drivers to pull over at the next junction, get out

146
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,785
and swap their car for public transport which is kind of puzzling.

147
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,020
cos why would you, when you're in the car already,- would you just stop

148
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:10,735
and then get on a train? I don't know.

149
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,475
It's like going to the cinema and a sign says, "

150
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,180
"Have you thought about reading a book?" Yes!

151
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,947
It's too late. I'm in the cinema!

152
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,645
What are the signs going to say?

153
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,540
"Don't need to be on time or near where you actually want to go?

154
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:25,085
"The railway station is next left. "-

155
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,575
"Something missing from your daily commute?"

156
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,530
Yes, a foul smell from a stranger sitting next to me.

157
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,425
Is that what they intend for us to do?

158
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,880
I tell you what. You know the Government announced earlier this week that 60,000 people

159
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,490
are going to be laid waste by swine flu? What they ought to be telling us

160
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:44,765
is under no circumstances use public transport.

161
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,865
That's the point. You're right. The funny thing is...

162
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,560
swine flu is getting a bad press. Well... Have you noticed?

163
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:54,185
You see? It is. They're saying it's bad for the economy

164
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,345
because no-one will buy anything and there'll be a lot of absenteeism

165
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,380
but look at it this way, parking spaces for the rest of us will be easy to find.

166
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:03,585
That's a good point.

167
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,460
Now, you know I've been saying for years, and years that Porsches are getting uglier -

168
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,055
Cayman, Cayenne, "coxter"

169
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,730
and that thing you were driving the other day, the Panamera? Yeah. I've...

170
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:15,735
I've worked out why they're now so ugly. OK?

171
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,750
I've got a photograph of the managing director of Lamborghini. What do you think of him?

172
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:25,032
He looks like a male model. Look it is. He's absolutely magnificent to behold.

173
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:29,280
I've got a photograph also of the managing director of Ferrari. more than that

174
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,792
He runs Fiat. Look at that.

175
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,270
Dashing. Dashing and glamorous.

176
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:33,275
I've also got a photograph

177
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,440
of the man who runs Porsche. Here he is.

178
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,565
If he likes that moustache,

179
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,955
which he does cos he's grown it on his own face,

180
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,375
that would explain why he looked at the Panamera and went,

181
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,760
"Yes! That's a good-looking car. We should make that. "

182
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,215
On a sort of serious motoring note,

183
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,580
it is rumoured, this is business, that VW might buy Porsche.

184
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:58,700
That bodes well

185
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,150
cos VW can make a good-looking car - a good-looking sports car. In fact, remarkably,

186
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:03,415
there's one in the studio!

187
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,985
It's over there. It's the VW BlueSport. Now that's mid-engined.

188
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,330
It's got a two-litre diesel engine in it to start. They'll put petrol in later.

189
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,615
There's a 60 percent chance they'll make it

190
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:17,605
about two years. It's worth having a look at.

191
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,530
"The great thing about that It's not very practical.

192
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,857
"It's got a diesel engine, “you know all of these

193
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,115
but it's incredibly beautiful and, as a result,

194
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,080
I would like to buy one. Now... there's a new Range Rover.

195
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,165
We had it in the studio last week, OK?

196
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,540
It's got a new bumper and a new engine. That's not important.

197
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,825
what is important, OK?-

198
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,900
is it's got cameras in its head lamps. looking forward

199
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:37,467
One on the back looking backwards

200
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:39,000
And two on either side looking down.

201
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,600
yes, these are so when you're off-roading you can see like tree stumps

202
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:44,155
and bears that might be in your way

203
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,520
That's right, These You feed the picture to your screen. Ok, your SAT screen,

204
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:50,360
But it doesn't turn off when you're going along on the road.

205
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,012
and you've got all different cameras on there

206
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:53,595
yes, it's honestly, you are sitting there.

207
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,040
You've got five different feeds coming in but you can choose which one you want.

208
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,450
which like you're being sport director in Wimbledon,

209
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,555
wow, choosing which one you want,

210
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,330
yes, you think coming up to crest of the hill, that one, yeah, nice, then reverse

211
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,620
and you get the back view on, put you foot on,

212
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:07,885
you got exhaust look, it fantastic.

213
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,385
Isn't it a bit distractive? Oh god, it's unbelievable

214
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,815
You're not allowed to talk on a mobile phone these days

215
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,470
but now you can direct Ben Hur while you're going along the road

216
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:21,175
it's just... I haven't even got to the best bit because...

217
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,550
got into London that other day, go on Holland Park a very pretty girl in the car behind.

218
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:26,665
yeah very pretty

219
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,915
Switched to rear camera...

220
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,485
.. and then I found you can zoom in

221
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,020
on parts of the girl in the car behind!

222
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:36,595
So it's got lech-o-matic?

223
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,460
And the traffic lights goes like RED,GREEN,RED,GREEN and I went like...

224
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,105
It was just FANTASTIC!

225
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,910
Last week, a piano was accidentally dropped on a Morris Marina as we were filming.

226
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,425
Last time this happened,

227
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,115
the Morris Marina Owners Club,

228
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,680
which is like the provisional wing of the Morris men,

229
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:01,835
were absolutely furious. They went berserk.

230
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,275
There's been a lot of internet activity on the Morris chat room.

231
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:11,590
"I'm going to send an email to the BBC and I don't care if they don't read it!"

232
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,760
Now that's what they said last time, OK?

233
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:15,685
This time it's getting worse.

234
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,115
They said they'd get physical. I'm quoting now.

235
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,510
One of them says, and I'm not making this up,

236
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,755
"If I see Jeremy Clarkson in the street,

237
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,080
I will poo into my hand and throw it at him. "

238
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,375
What?! They'll poo into their own hand?!

239
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,060
What a stupid way of getting someone. It's like an assassin lining up on the target

240
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:38,320
and shooting them through his own head!

241
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,175
It's revolting.

242
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,780
The thing is, last week when we were making the film you probably saw out in France,

243
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:47,890
there was doubt as to who actually owned the car that you ended up driving.

244
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:50,750
Was it the wife of the president of- the Morris Marina Owners Club

245
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,585
or was the wife of the President of France

246
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,625
who is of course it's Carla Bruni? That was cleared up this week

247
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,800
because Carla Bruni went to Nelson Mandela's birthday party in New York

248
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,750
Where she sang a song which clears everything up

249
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,580
Now we know. You're history.

250
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,730
Now, we are constantly being told, mostly by people who wear slacks,

251
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:45,590
that classic cars are more fun than modern ones. < Yes!

252
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,805
There was a yes over there. The thing is, though,

253
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,355
we weren't sure. So the producers gave each of us GBP 3,000

254
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,835
and told us to go to a classic car auction in King's Lynn

255
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:00,670
which is famous for being nowhere near anywhere else in the world.

256
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,870
They said we could buy anything we wanted as long as it was built before 1982

257
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:09,135
and then, when we had cars, there would not

258
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,470
be the usual series of small challenges but one big one.

259
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,380
'After a 2,000 mile drive, we arrived...

260
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,270
'at the wrong place

261
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,525
'and then the right one

262
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,070
'where, inside the shed... ' All right, mate?

263
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:26,740
'.. there were many cars to choose from. '

264
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,625
"The Teesside Yesteryear Motor Club. "

265
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,520
How much do I not want to go out for dinner with anyone who's a member of that

266
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,235
Yeah, a '68 Daimler.

267
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,320
It's V8 but a tiny capacity so a busy little engine and too expensive unless it goes cheap.

268
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:47,670
You never know.

269
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,135
'As the start time neared, we took our seats. '

270
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,035
This is the first time I've ever been to a car auction.

271
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,865
It's fantastically exciting. We could leave with anything.

272
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,240
At auctions in the past, normally I'm the one at the back, drunk out of my mind,

273
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:05,260
bidding for signed rugby balls. Those are charity auctions.

274
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,305
Ladies and gentlemen,

275
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,410
we will now get the first car in. Here we go. Here we go.

276
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,505
Here we go. What is that?

277
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,495
A London taxi. A Lanchester LJ 200.

278
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,620
"1953. No documents. Condition - three. " No documents

279
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:25,230
Who'll start me? 500? Quickly!

280
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:27,375
500? 500, thank you, sir.

281
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,510
500, I'm bid. What are you doing?! I'm getting on with it.

282
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,005
It's the first one.

283
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,885
I'm doing what they did in nightclubs in Yorkshire. 700, I'm bid.

284
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,730
At 700. I'm going ugly early. Go in, get the first one you can.

285
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,830
1,000 bid. It's a car. I'm after it.

286
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:44,430
At GBP1,000. Give it to me.

287
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:45,445
Thank you, sir.

288
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,770
That's mine. You bought it?! madman! Look at the back of it

289
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:55,035
What do you mean "go ugly early"? You go in...

290
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,940
I did it in nightclubs. When I was in Ripon, you'd walk in

291
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:00,775
and the first girl that's breathing you go to her and go,

292
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,730
"Hi, love, how are you doing?" You've pulled. That is. Job's done

293
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,320
Your mates who think that in a minute Ursula Andress

294
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,920
is going to turn up, and she didn't, are stuck.

295
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:11,880
'The next lot was a tasty Ford Cortina. '

296
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,045
Bang on. Bang on.

297
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,350
On my right, 220. 220. 240. 260. 280? 280.

298
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:18,405
300. At 320. 320...

299
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,690
I bid! You did. You're still in it.

300
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,255
.. 420. 440...

301
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,695
I'm not sure. I want a convertible.

302
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,260
Oh, have it! If you chicken out now,- you won't get it.

303
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,135
Go on! Come on!

304
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,495
.. 530. Quickly! 540.

305
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,040
No, I'm hanging on. I'm hanging on.

306
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,160
'Several terrible cars came and went. '

307
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:39,545
What the hell's this?

308
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,365
It's an Austin Seven. I'm not interested.

309
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,150
'Then, finally, a convertible arrived. '

310
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,005
Hang on. 2,000 bid.

311
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,210
'And Top Gear's auction new boy went mad. '

312
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,617
2,400. 2,500.

313
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:52,936
2,600. 2,900.

314
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:54,185
At 2,900.

315
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,365
3,000 bid.

316
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,835
At 3,000. At 3,000.

317
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,550
3,100. 3,200. You're making a mistake.

318
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,460
What are you doing? 3,400. 3,500.

319
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,090
Yes! 3,600.

320
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,985
222.

321
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,705
Have you thought, "Holy BLEEP!" I've just bought THAT!

322
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,030
How much have I paid for it? GBP 3,600. I've got 600 of my own money in that?! Yes, sir.

323
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,875
Oh, my God, what have I done?

324
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,545
'Well, at least he'd done something

325
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,600
'unlike James, who, as car after car went by... '

326
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,775
Bid. No.

327
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,765
'.. still refused to buy. '

328
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,435
You will see. my patience will be rewarded.

329
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,590
Spitfire Sports... Come on, James, you must bid here. No, I don't.

330
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,970
James, it's in budget. You like the colour.

331
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,255
Bid! Bid!

332
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,900
'James was being so stubborn, I decided to bid on his behalf. '

333
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:45,325
1,450. 1,500.

334
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,705
Did you just bid on that, you halfwit? Yes.

335
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,500
James, I'm warning you, if you don't buy something in a minute...

336
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,765
This is mine. It's a Bristol,

337
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,230
but it's got the wrong engine so it's not worth much. Watch this.

338
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:04,220
Someone start me 5,000. 5,000 bid. At 5,200.

339
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:05,575
5,400, 5,600...

340
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,030
That's you stuffed, then, isn't it? We're out.

341
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:09,522
6,200, 6,400...

342
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:10,945
I wanted that.

343
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,400
7,000... So, Captain Cautious, what are you gonna do now?

344
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:18,155
You're starting now to look like you're in trouble.

345
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,800
There's plenty more stuff coming through. We're now coming up to the last lot.

346
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:25,670
What?! The very last lot.

347
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,390
Oh, mate!

348
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,620
It's nice! I don't want that.

349
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,850
Seriously, what do we do, cos I don't want a Citroen? I don't want it!

350
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:43,470
550, 600, 700... You've got to bid, mate.

351
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,535
You've got no choice.

352
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,060
You've got no... 900 quid?

353
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:48,855
Bid.

354
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,960
1,050, 1,110...

355
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:53,030
1,150, 1,200...

356
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,710
Oh, God. You've got to buy it, mate. Yes.

357
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:58,225
1,400. 1,450!

358
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,945
It's a lovely colour. 1,500!

359
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,630
At 1,500... The name, sir?

360
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,970
Worth every penny!

361
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,900
'It was time to inspect what we'd bought. '

362
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,645
Look at it in here.

363
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,070
It's like driving around in a radiogram.

364
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:19,245
Listen to that... Oh.

365
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,585
This has not got an MOT, has it? I'll book it in.

366
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,360
The first thing they're going to say is you're running on...

367
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,915
An odd number. Three. That's good.

368
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,230
We'll get the fourth one going and it’ll be fine.

369
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:34,485
I'm very confident. This is a classic.

370
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,075
'And it was a damn sight bigger than Jeremy's classic. '

371
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,060
This is going to be a remarkable thing, watching you fold yourself into a Midget.

372
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:46,715
It isn't a Midget. It is! It's an Austin-Healy.

373
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,715
It's a hairy-chested man's car. No, that's the big Healey.

374
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,820
This is a little tiny Healey built in the same factory as the MG Midget.

375
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,630
The only difference between this and a Midget is an MG badge.

376
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,075
Oh...

377
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,745
Let me help you.

378
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,345
There, you see!

379
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,650
Let's do this scientifically. There's the top of the windscreen.

380
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:13,205
'Still, at least my car wasn't medieval. '

381
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,110
In 1977, you couldn't drink the water in France and they hadn't heard of an ignition key.

382
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,820
How about that?

383
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,005
What a dismal racket.

384
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,985
'It was time to receive our challenge. '

385
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,690
"You have been entered in a classic time trial rally

386
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:36,540
"on the sunshine island of Majorca. "

387
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,460
Ah! Majorca means...?

388
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,715
Bad food, prawn shells in everything...

389
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,030
Driving on the other side of the road. They drive on the wrong side of the road.

390
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,600
My steering wheel's on the wrong side of the car.

391
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,212
"You have two weeks to prepare your cars

392
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:54,883
"and ship them there. " For a classic time...

393
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:57,485
I know what they are. My wife does these.

394
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,210
They're those ones where you have to get from A to B on difficult roads

395
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:03,925
and you have to average a certain speed within the speed limit

396
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,100
but you have to average it. We are talking some properly anal stuff here.

397
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,310
How do you make a car ready for a rally?

398
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:13,790
I dunno.

399
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,000
'To find out, we took our cars for a spin. '

400
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:21,390
So, faults. Let's just go through the faults.

401
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:23,455
That window won't wind up, no big deal,

402
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:28,830
and the hood here doesn't fit properly. Other than those tiny things,

403
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:31,100
it's ready to rally, this one.

404
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:42,230
Power - 32 horsepower, to be precise.

405
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,910
'While waiting for a booking at the MOT centre,

406
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:49,320
'I discovered something amazing. '

407
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,150
Hold on a second.

408
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,580
My granddad worked at Mulliner's, the coach builders.

409
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:58,787
And in the 1950s, when he was there,

410
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:01,960
they were making Hillman Humber Standard

411
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:05,157
and Lanchester. This car's 1953,

412
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:08,285
so my granddad built this car!

413
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,400
This actual car, he was working at Mulliner's and this is what he did,

414
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:15,550
he was a coach builder. He built this car!

415
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,710
'While Richard was having his "Who Do You Think You Are?" moment,

416
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,782
'I was not very far away,

417
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,785
'still not going very fast. '

418
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,520
0-60? I'll give you a few seconds to have an educated guess.

419
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,575
No. 31.7 seconds.

420
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,440
'Meanwhile, I was getting acquainted with Granddad's craftsmanship. '

421
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,650
Oh, God. Third isn't working.

422
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:43,940
Oh, hell.

423
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,015
I can't get anything past second. HORN HONKS

424
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,480
No. Granddad didn't do the gearbox. That's a Daimler gearbox.

425
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:52,955
Sorry!

426
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,830
This armrest is adjustable.

427
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:58,635
I'll adjust it up a bit... Oh.

428
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,780
My granddad didn't build that bit. That was somebody else.

429
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,040
Day off, maybe.

430
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,220
'Eventually, I made it to the MOT centre. '

431
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,310
'Meanwhile, in the Healey... '

432
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,675
God, it's even got quick steering.

433
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,440
Everybody knows a horror story about someone who bought a car at an auction.

434
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:27,180
But what you have here

435
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:30,115
is a fairy story.

436
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,300
Quite by accident, I've bought a genuinely brilliant little car.

437
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:40,575
'Unlike Richard, whose MOT inspection was now finished. '

438
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,500
You've got a hydraulic pipe that goes to the floating master cylinder

439
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:47,337
and that's leaking fluid quite badly.

440
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,140
It's a wonder you got here with it.

441
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:50,945
OK. OK.

442
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,670
The nearside front trunnion top and bottom is badly worn,

443
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,707
the other side is following quite closely behind it.

444
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:59,710
The brakes on the back are about 83% out of balance.

445
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:02,275
You're got a brake hose which is floating,

446
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:07,430
which is pouring fluid out of it. The shackles on the back of the spring hangers,

447
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:09,015
they're in very bad condition as well.

448
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,280
Most of the shackle pins and bits and pieces are very badly worn indeed...

449
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:18,280
and some pins had missing -God...

450
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,040
Come on, then, Hammond! Come on.

451
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:29,055
Tell us...

452
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,835
How bad was it?

453
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,825
That's what came back.

454
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,370
I've had worse than that! Oh, blimey.

455
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:39,275
That's the actual list.

456
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:44,130
That is the list of everything that was wrong with Granddad's... -that's nomorus

457
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:45,495
We'll pick that up later on, but now

458
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,795
it is time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

459
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,025
My guest tonight has sold more records than The Beatles,

460
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:59,140
but the extraordinary thing is I bet almost none of you have ever heard of him.

461
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:02,277
He is the lead singer with AC/DC.

462
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:05,380
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Johnson!

463
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,750
Can't believe you're here!

464
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,720
What a star! You've come!

465
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,520
Fantastic!

466
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,900
Have yourself a seat, Brian.

467
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:18,635
Thank you.

468
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,475
I am properly fascinated by how you've achieved it,

469
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,280
cos everybody knows Jagger, Daltrey, David Van Day.

470
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:29,510
Everybody knows the lead singers

471
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:30,845
with these big bands.

472
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,830
But Brian Johnson? How have you managed to stay anonymous?

473
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:38,400
I think the band... It's just the way we do things.

474
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,005
Stay under the radar, I think.

475
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,390
You never see you on anything. You're never at a glittering gala do,

476
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:46,795
you're never at Elton John's wild. No, you wouldn't be.

477
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,840
Cos when I said Brian Johnson's coming on the show to friends,

478
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,620
they went, "The cricket bloke? He's dead. "

479
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:56,222
That's Brian Johns-TON.

480
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:58,755
We enjoy keeping quiet.

481
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,625
We can live a normal life, you know.

482
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,190
Is this right? Black Hawk Down, obviously we've seen the film,

483
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:09,685
but it was used as well, AC/DC.

484
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,075
Mike, the helicopter pilot that went down.

485
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,760
He'd been shot and he'd been beaten and they put him in a cell,

486
00:29:16,795 --> 00:29:21,410
and he thought he was finished. They kept coming and beating him.

487
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:24,175
His pals knew that AC/DC were his favourite band,

488
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,810
so they hooked a big speaker on the skid of a helicopter

489
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:31,665
and they played Back In Black and Hells Bells

490
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,450
and they flew over the city and he dragged himself up

491
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:37,165
and took his shirt off and waved it out the window

492
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,410
so they knew where he was and they went down and got him.

493
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,875
that's fantistic, what they really means,

494
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,410
and here is a good friends, you know we were told to each other,

495
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:47,010
you know, it's good one to free him from harm.

496
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:49,685
That is a fantastic story.

497
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,875
We could rap about AC/DC for some considerable time,

498
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,420
but you're here because you are a massive, massive car fan.

499
00:29:58,455 --> 00:30:01,335
Is that not...? Since I was a kid.

500
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,565
My father knew there was something wrong with us

501
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,765
when I'd be walking down the street going, "Javelin, Dad. "

502
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,935
It drove him nuts so he went to the scrap yard and got a steering wheel

503
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,680
and he stuck a stick through it and put it through me bed head and put some pillows on it

504
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,342
and said, "There you go. "

505
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:20,935
What, so that's a car?

506
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,265
That was me car. It was brilliant.

507
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,595
Although there was wallpaper up there, I couldn't see it.

508
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,855
I just saw the rest of the world and I just drove for hours.

509
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,640
so presumably, as soon as I was assumed We're talking here about good, honest,

510
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:35,355
salt of the earth, working-class Geordie upbringing -

511
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,780
the original cars that you finally got once you were old enough, they were all what?

512
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:40,745
cheerful colourful breaking down sort of stuffs

513
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,230
Me first one, which was fabulous, it was a Ford Popular sit up and beg,

514
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:52,060
which had a beige exterior and a salmon pink interior.

515
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:55,605
But it was mine, it was freedom. Brilliant.

516
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,860
You presumably go through the Mini phase at that point. Mini phase was very important

517
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,125
because then you didn't have to hide- t

518
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,470
the Ford Popular round the corner when you went to parties.

519
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:07,385
The Mini was cool. Was it a Cooper?

520
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,415
No, I tried to make it look like a Cooper.

521
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,760
I put them little spready things on the back wheels, and I put go-faster stripes on.

522
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:18,080
But it had sliding windows

523
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,720
and they were very handy with the girls in the back.

524
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:27,027
You could get their...

525
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:31,300
I know what you mean!

526
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,725
Sorry. I'm sorry.

527
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,770
And obviously then AC/DC came along.

528
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:38,695
Yes.

529
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,570
So what did you get? Heavy metal band - heavy metal cars? I did.

530
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:44,185
I love me classics.

531
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,135
I bought an old Triumph Roadster, 1948.

532
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,480
Now I drive a 1928 Bentley Le Mans 4.5 litre.

533
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:57,790
Bloody hell, really? So when you say "drive",

534
00:31:57,825 --> 00:31:58,645
do you use it every day?

535
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,380
I go for the paper in it, you know.

536
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:03,205
It's just the way I...

537
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,930
That's got the throttle pedal... In the middle. that's a bugger

538
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:12,760
Sometimes, you know, when you're going round a corner,

539
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:13,970
"I'll just break...

540
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:14,995
"Oh, bugger!"

541
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,435
It can tighten your bottom a bit.

542
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,515
It makes your cars go like a rabbit's nose.

543
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,520
Do you have a favourite road? Is that something you still...?

544
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,965
cos I also get fed up with people saying,

545
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,490
"I don't know what the point of a nice car is, there's nowhere nice to drive. "

546
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:33,250
Yes, Yes, There's a lovely drive between Newcastle and Carlisle.

547
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,025
there is a place is called Haydon Bridge,

548
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,360
If you turn left there and go up to Alston and down the other side into the Lake District,

549
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,107
it's probably one of the most beautiful drives.

550
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:43,820
Do you know the Buttertubs Pass, North Yorkshire?

551
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:46,235
Every time I've got to the other end of it,

552
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,730
I've always had to get out and pee on the brakes.

553
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,965
I've got a story to beat that!

554
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,490
We were playing at this big airport in Moscow Russia when the coup happened

555
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,475
and Yeltsin was on top of the tank

556
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,710
and he promised all the kids, he said, "Thanks for helping," cos they helped.

557
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:06,400
He said, "What do you want?" They said, "We want rock'n'roll, AC/DC."

558
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:11,220
So we went over and there was about a million people there.

559
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,845
Really a million. Yeah.

560
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,390
There was 30,000 armed guards to look after them.

561
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:19,865
It was getting darker and I was bursting for a pee

562
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,035
and I went outside and there was this little concrete plinth

563
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,170
and I was standing there going, and these two guards went...

564
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:30,475
xxx

565
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:36,460
They were really upset and the translator came and I'd just pissed on Sputnik.

566
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:41,240
But it was just this black ball, I didn't realise what it was.

567
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:45,660
Oh, bless. So what's your day-to-day wheels now?

568
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:48,755
Er, a Phantom.

569
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,030
Me favourite car in the whole wide world.

570
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:54,195
12 funnels of fun there, Jezza!

571
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,095
It is the most fantabulous piece of engineering. Ever.

572
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,020
When I turned 60, I thought, "I'm gonna get meself something special. "

573
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:05,140
Are you over 60?! I'm 62 in October.

574
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,745
Hoo-hoo! I'm impressed.

575
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,950
I am very... Rock'n'roll has suited you.

576
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,815
Yeah, aye, but...

577
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,485
Obviously, we could could sit here and talk cars

578
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,620
and I'd be happy to do that literally all day long,

579
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:21,720
but of cause you came down to do your lap. How was it?

580
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,165
The best time I've had since I started.

581
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,460
I've been sitting in the back of a car getting driven everywhere.

582
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:31,925
I just had a great time.

583
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,610
Who here would like to see Brian's lap?

584
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,655
Yes!

585
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,670
Let's play the tape. Let's have a look how you got on.

586
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,950
OK...

587
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,705
# Is you is or is you ain't my baby..? #

588
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,780
Let's see if this love of cars translates into an ability to drive well.

589
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:53,385
That's... Yeah,

590
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,175
stabbing that one in nicely... Ooh, I say.

591
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,930
That was good. Nice and easy, like gravy.

592
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,685
Wouldn't have thought gravy was easy,

593
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,140
but there we are, that's tidy as well. No real problems there.

594
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:10,255
Keep it cool, yeah, son. Go on, son!

595
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,545
You're being smooth and violent at the same time,

596
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,800
which is quite an achievement. That is bang on.

597
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:20,362
Look That's perfect. That is bang on.

598
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:23,855
# Oh, you must remember this... #

599
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:29,050
Concentrate. No need to ask if you were flat out- through there.

600
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:33,165
I'm guessing this'll be quick. It is!

601
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,740
And now we're coming up to the second to last corner.

602
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:37,785
That's beautifully done.

603
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,300
Gambon, is that going to catch you out?

604
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:47,100
No! here we are, cross the line

605
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:59,150
Because it looks like when Ellen MacArthur came here, not dramatic,

606
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:03,005
but you just looked quick. So.. Where do you think?

607
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,740
I wouldn't bother looking down here. I think it got reasonable...

608
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:09,425
Anywhere in the second middle!

609
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,635
so this is What, just about there.

610
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,600
With Well Spoken man there, Hugh Grant and so on.

611
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:15,815
That would be nice.

612
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,910
well, I got a time there, so what we looking at

613
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:20,535
Jay Kay over the Top 1:45,8

614
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,500
Kevin McCloud and Simon Cowell were 1:45,9

615
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:29,230
So Brian Johnson, the man nobody had ever heard of...

616
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:36,330
You did it in, well... One... forty...

617
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:38,992
I've forgotten.

618
00:36:39,027 --> 00:36:41,585
You're killin' us!

619
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:48,070
.. five... Oooh!point nine.

620
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:54,520
You are the second fastest man!

621
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,580
Brian Johnson, everybody!

622
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,650
Exactly the same as Kevin McCloud from Grand Designs, Simon Cowell,

623
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,170
Brian Johnson, 1:45,9,Brilliant!

624
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,785
Jay Kay will have just babbered himself!

625
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,885
I've so enjoyed having you here today.

626
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
I'm just amazed how many gifts God bestowed you with!

627
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:24,895
Great singing voice, nice chap,

628
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,950
anonymity, and now can drive a car like an angel.

629
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:31,680
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Johnson!

630
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:44,520
What a man! What a man!

631
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,510
Earlier on, we bought three classic- cars from an auction.

632
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,215
A 1953 Lanchester,

633
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,120
a 1977 Citroen Ami 8, and a 1969 MG Midget. It's a Healey! >

634
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:59,165
It's just a Midget.

635
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,505
Anyway, we then discovered, after we'd bought the cars,

636
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,625
that we had just two weeks and hardly any money to get them ready

637
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:11,850
for something called a Regularity Time Trial Rally, which was in Majorca.

638
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,340
Sadly, Hammond had spent all his budget,

639
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,155
and lots more besides,

640
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,290
getting the Lanchester his granddad had built to work.

641
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:26,920
But for once, Jeremy had done a good job,

642
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:29,515
and as usual, so had I.

643
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,450
However, before we could get going, we were given new instructions.

644
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,505
On a classic rally, you need

645
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,555
a co-driver to operate the timing gear and read the maps,

646
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:46,210
But don't worry, the producers have provided one for each of you.

647
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:48,095
They've... I'm not worried.

648
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,160
My betting is these co-drivers, whatever we've got in our mind, now,

649
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:57,700
I'm not certain... Is not what they have provided.

650
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,670
We weren't wrong. James had been given Madison Welsh

651
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:04,985
a glamour model.

652
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,495
Hello. Who has no interest at all in classic rallying.

653
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,480
Have you honestly never done it? Not as a hobby or something?

654
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:15,395
No, I've never done it! Seriously?

655
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,975
! For me, things just keep getting better.

656
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,450
Because this is my co-driver, his name is Joan Verger,

657
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,890
he is the president of the Balearic Motorsport Federation,

658
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:28,585
and an ex-Seat works driver.

659
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,800
Presumably you know the roads in the north like the back of your hand.

660
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:37,880
The mountain... roads.

661
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,205
You speak...

662
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,410
Don't tell me he doesn't speak English.

663
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:49,930
no comprendo

664
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,110
Richard meanwhile had been given a keen amateur mechanic

665
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,770
called Brian Wheeler

666
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,665
Brian!

667
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,735
It does that, you have to imagine this in a rally situation,

668
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,790
so the idea is we get points deducted for being early or late

669
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:15,810
- at the checkpoints we have to get to. - But I can't see.

670
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:19,815
granddad didn't think of that when he built it

671
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,190
the co-drivers didn't fill us with much confidence,

672
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:27,920
and then we saw the cars we'd be up against.

673
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,960
there were Lancia Stratos', Mustangs, Corvettes

674
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:35,072
and endless Porsches

675
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:38,115
10911s, 11, 12...

676
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,445
I've never seen so many 911s. 13.

677
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,705
This Mustang is in our category.

678
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,190
Oh, my God, how am I gonna compete against that?!

679
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:48,637
And then we got even more bad news...

680
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:51,426
Fantastic. You've had a great day?

681
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:54,145
Yeah. Well, when did it start?

682
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,590
Last night was the first stage, and this morning at 8.30am,

683
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,375
we were out there. So, yeah.

684
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,450
Five. OK... Five stages, yeah. Five stages.

685
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:08,455
OK. Thank you for that. What were they saying?

686
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,485
I don't know how this has happened. - I imagine it's James's fault,

687
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,580
but we thought the rally started tomorrow morning. It turns out it actually started two days ago.

688
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:25,650
So, even before we'd started, we knew we had no chance of winning.

689
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:29,140
At the very least, we are competing- against each other.

690
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:30,995
Why don't we just make it a private race?

691
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,010
Whatever it is, it requires precision and patience, so you won't win.

692
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:36,765
I bet you?25

693
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,950
that I beat you. Three-way bet. All right. All right.

694
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,345
And so, the next morning, two days late,

695
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,750
with the wrong co-drivers and the wrong cars...

696
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:53,210
Does anybody here know how to zero

697
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:55,670
on an Austin Healey Sprite?

698
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:57,690
.. we set off.

699
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:58,720
Go!

700
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,650
We've got no gear.

701
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,450
Not got a lot to talk about.

702
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,930
We had to arrive at various checkpoints at specified times,

703
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:23,757
and then complete a number of special stages on closed roads

704
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:28,550
at a precise average speed. This wouldn't be easy in the Healey.

705
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:29,975
This is ridiculous.

706
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,380
My speedometer is saying I'm doing 60mph when I'm doing about 30... No, 20.

707
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:42,715
How are we going to be able to do average speeds when this is saying 60mph?

708
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:48,320
When we stop at the next bit I'll write down some speed and distance formulae for you

709
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:50,135
so you can work out average speeds as well.

710
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,020
There's only two you need to know. How fast we've been going,

711
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:58,920
how fast we need to go, or how long we've taken so far.

712
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:00,265
You can use the two stopwatches,

713
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,630
so you can say for 10 minutes... Mountains!

714
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,515
Does this car smell... healthy to you?

715
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,810
Actually, there is a slightly, um, oily smell.

716
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,630
So the roundabout is at 127, so add another 1km...

717
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,695
Hello?.. Hello!

718
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,590
'Still. Could be worse. '

719
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,600
Granddad didn't do the cooling system so it can be a bit...

720
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,920
It's all falling out.

721
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,855
So how long should we wait? About half an hour, for it to cool down.

722
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:51,550
So we'll then have to go faster to make the... We will have to go a lot faster, and um...

723
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:55,400
break a few rules, I think. It can't go much faster.

724
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,870
Jeremy, meanwhile, was getting into the spirit of amateur rallying.

725
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:05,420
Loser! Loser!

726
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,725
We then arrived at the first closed-road stage,

727
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,680
which we would have to complete at a specified average speed.

728
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:19,732
The speed... Zero.

729
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,715
Si... The speed.

730
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,950
This... at what speed? Quant o...

731
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:28,895
Quanto...?

732
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,220
Which one's too tight? That one.

733
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:33,270
Are you sure?

734
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,940
It's difficult to do this without actually getting hold of the work of the divine potter.

735
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:43,500
Perfecto... No, what? 50? Bien...

736
00:44:43,535 --> 00:44:47,415
50... No? Um...

737
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,170
I decided to just do it flat out.

738
00:44:50,205 --> 00:44:52,870
We're going!

739
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,860
Down into second... Flip the apex!

740
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:01,302
'This made Joan very angry!'

741
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:04,710
No, rapido, no! No, perfecto!

742
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,995
What's that mean?!

743
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,280
Plus lentement? Rapido? Tranquilo?

744
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:13,495
Tranquilo, tranquilo. Rapido.

745
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,875
'Meanwhile, in the Open University... '

746
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,700
When we get to this next one, stop that stopwatch and start that one at exactly the same time.

747
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:22,635
Cos you then have a record of that one

748
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,605
and that one is then timing it to the next one.

749
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,275
In fact, don't. That'll confuse us cos we have to take it away.

750
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,910
Leave that one running. Jot down what the time actually said.

751
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,895
Yeah?

752
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,900
Yeah.

753
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,395
We still weren't at the first stage,

754
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,000
and Brian was less than impressed with Granddad's Lanchester.

755
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,882
THUD Ouch! Suspension's good then.

756
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:51,730
It is. I hardly felt it on this side.

757
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,375
It's good, yes? Finish?

758
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,450
What time? Show me the time.

759
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:59,395
Time! Time, Manuel!

760
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,565
Can't see, can't... I've no idea.

761
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,725
I've just done something and I don't know what it was.

762
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,850
'As it turned out, ‘what I'd done is go way too fast,

763
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:13,850
'which meant Joan had to do yet more sums. '

764
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,545
Maths.

765
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,580
Can't talk to him. He's doing... literally sitting a maths exam.

766
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:24,120
But I bet the conversation in the bar at night is fun.

767
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:25,990
"I did more maths than you today. "

768
00:46:26,025 --> 00:46:28,085
"No, you didn't,

769
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,635
"I did more maths than you. "

770
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,030
'In fact, the only person enjoying this less than me

771
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:38,025
'was James' co-driver. '

772
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,970
Divide 60 by 55. Why do you keep saying that?

773
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:44,585
It's a 60 thing, like the Assyrians had.

774
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,725
There's not 100 seconds in a minute, there are 60,

775
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,990
and that is a decimal... What? It's 0.85. Times 0.85 by 60.

776
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:51,620
Do you- just like saying different numbers?

777
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:54,065
What do I do at this roundabout? Huh?

778
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,710
What do I do at this roundabout? What roundabout?

779
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,940
'Brian and I had finally arrived at the first stage.

780
00:47:02,975 --> 00:47:05,600
'However,... '

781
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,300
Bloody 'ell!

782
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,685
OK,40

783
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,705
40 miles an hour.

784
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:26,385
So I'm driving about half the speed- my car can go in order to win.

785
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:31,720
25 pounds is riding on this, Joan, 25 pounds, which is about 25 Euros...

786
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,330
thanks to Mr Brown.

787
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,345
'To be honest, though, right now, my money was pretty safe. '

788
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:47,520
There would only be other cars here if they were lost in exactly the same way as us.

789
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:49,915
Left or right?

790
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,140
That way. Do you know that or are you just guessing?

791
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:56,160
There is a left somewhere. Is it only...

792
00:47:56,195 --> 00:48:01,010
There's hundreds of lefts in it.

793
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,675
I prefer you do too.

794
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,120
Don't do... Please, don't do that.

795
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:09,635
Now! Go, go, go, go!

796
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,900
'Finally, we were doing our first stage. However,... '

797
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:17,215
Where do I go now, Brian? Forward! Forward!

798
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,880
Can you see out of the car exactly where we're going or not?

799
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:23,335
Well, I can see sort of the hills and the sky. Right.

800
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:26,670
I'll tell you what's happening in front of us. It's straight ahead.

801
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:29,457
I can't get this gear. It's a very big steering wheel, isn't it?

802
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:32,210
Granddad liked to make sure you had good, proper-sized wheels.

803
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:34,460
It makes you look smaller.

804
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,760
Well, now, erm... OK.

805
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,240
Oh, God, look at the steam coming out the bonnet.

806
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:41,520
Oh, my word!

807
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,135
'Realising he'd got off to a bad start,

808
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:50,180
'James was now trying to charm Maddie with some romantic conversation. '

809
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,330
It's not actually an overdrive but you need to treat it as one.

810
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,925
It's actually a ratio of 1 to 1.

811
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,690
It simply locks the input shaft to the output shaft.

812
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:01,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

813
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,700
Do you actually do anything to your hair?

814
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:06,670
I wash it occasionally.

815
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,870
You should wear a hair band. No.

816
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,390
Oh, why couldn't we get one of them?

817
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,180
That's a nice car. I bet that don't overheat.

818
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,580
Just after lunch, we made it to the lunch stop,

819
00:49:26,615 --> 00:49:28,825
'where Jeremy explained that Brian and I

820
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:33,600
'had amassed the biggest number of penalty points in rallying history. '

821
00:49:33,635 --> 00:49:36,840
So, I've got 3,600 points, the lowest points worth.

822
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,837
You've got 41,897.

823
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:42,765
And you've got 44,000.

824
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,490
It's quite close between you two. Yeah.

825

That is now the heating jammed on?

828
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,290
Yes, the only way to turn it off is to stop... And open the bonnet.

829
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:59,035
Lose vital seconds, or hours in his case

830
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,180
because he won't be able to work out how to do that.

831
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,065
'But as we headed off to the afternoon stages,

832
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,690
'strangely, it was in the Citroen where things were getting hot. '

833
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,150
I think it's in there. I can feel it.

834
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,030
Yeah, it's a little tube. There.

835
00:50:16,065 --> 00:50:18,100
Yeah. Ooh! That's little!

836
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,310
Right.

Now, pout.

00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,060
You can't have cracked lips.

839
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,715
I changed from first to third

840
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,270
in my gearbox, which means technically, I short shifted.

841
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,190
When I say short, I don't mean that... I'm not being rude.

842
00:50:38,225 --> 00:50:40,745
You keep saying short, don't you?

843
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,510
No, I meant I short shifted. I wasn't being clever.

844
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,475
In the Healey,

845
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:51,010
my lunchtime smugness was starting to look premature.

846
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:51,982
Hello?

847
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:52,920
Ooh, God.

848
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,545
No clutch.

849
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,770
'This meant I'd have to choose one gear for the stage,

850
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:05,300
'and then stick with it. ' Here we go.

851
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,190
Perfect, perfect. Yes.

852
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,305
It's all going wrong for us this afternoon!

853
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,000
Also, I think the heater is on. Do you know how to turn it off?

854
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,630
'But Joan wasn't going to let anything mess up his maths. '

855
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:25,720
Dale, dale! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

856
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,400
We've got one gear, I can do nothing!

857
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:32,105
Vamos, vamos! Va, va, va!

858
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,300
I can't reach 50 kilometres an hour- on this. It's impossible.

859
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:40,430
Bueno, bueno. Fast, fast, fast! Yes, yes, yes.

860
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:43,370
Your handbag's in the way. God!

861
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,080
They're laughing at the car. They're- not. They're cheering us on.

862
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:48,925
OK, if you say so.

863
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,800
Why don't they speak English?

864
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:53,385
Cos they're Spanish.

865
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,840
'Following the shambles of the morning,

866
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,127
'Brian was now in a right mood. '

867
00:51:58,162 --> 00:52:00,345
Anything to let me know about? No.

868
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,450
What about this massive tight left-hand bend here?

869
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:05,820
I haven't got a map of the route.

870
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:07,725
What?

871
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,610
I haven't got a map of the route.

872
00:52:10,645 --> 00:52:13,425
Come on, you should talk to me.

873
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,840
There should be a constant stream of instructions issuing from you.

874
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,290
Left turn coming up.

875
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:18,205
In a hairpin.

876
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,540
You're just telling me things you can see out the window

877
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:22,850
now you've got a cushion!

878
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,440
Vaya a la derecha. We're losing the brakes.

879
00:52:33,475 --> 00:52:36,487
I'm losing the brakes. Perfecto. Vaya, vaya.

880
00:52:36,522 --> 00:52:39,465
'Because the Healey was in such a bad way,

881
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,110
'I managed to cross the line in a slow enough time for once. '

882
00:52:44,145 --> 00:52:48,670
We've finished. Yay! Yay! Is that good?

883
00:52:48,705 --> 00:52:51,070
Is that good? Ooooh!

884
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,080
And the Loveboat finished on time as well.

885
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:59,880
7.46. Yep. Spot on.

886
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:05,610
Meanwhile, back in PC world...

887
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,380
I didn't mean Jeremy's car was rubbish because it's a midget.

888
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:13,270
I just meant that's what it is.

889
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:15,157
It's an MG Midget...

890
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,010
It... I'm sorry.

891
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,060
Brian, it's making a bad noise.

892
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:23,970
And a bad smell.

893
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,060
This is... I think I may have to stop for a moment. I'm not well.

894
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:33,380
'This meant Richard would miss the final checkpoint of the day.

895
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,125
'James and I had no problems though

896
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,240
'because all we had to do was stick to a motorway.

897
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:43,300
'It was therefore impossible to get lost. '

898
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,970
Which way? Straight on.

899
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,340
Are you sure? No.

900
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,880
Yeah, let's go there, it looks pretty.

901
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:53,177
You don't go there because it's pretty.

902
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:55,405
Well, there should be signs if it isn't.

903
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,695
Can you not work out...? Please can you take your hat off.

904
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,890
Please. Sorry, it's really lovely but I can't see the cars coming.

905
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:06,595
Thanks. Now I've got flat hair. That's not important.

906
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,800
'Mind you, it wasn't exactly plain sailing for me either. '

907
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,070
Come on, please, traffic. Please, please.

908
00:54:14,105 --> 00:54:16,470
How can they have a rush hour in Mallorca?

909
00:54:16,505 --> 00:54:18,635
Nobody does anything.

910
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,205
Get up, throw a donkey off a tower block,

911
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,700
sit in a plastic chair by the side of the road, go to bed.

912
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:27,330
Where does the rush hour come from in that?

913
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,020
Oh, God.

914
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,365
'Day one, then,

915
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,720
'of our first classic rally hadn't been a total success.

916
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:42,730
'However, day two sounded promising- because we were at a track.

917
00:54:42,765 --> 00:54:45,045
'No more maths, no more stopwatches,

918
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,700
'just hour after hour of pedal to the metal action.

00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:51,355
'Or so I thought. '

920
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,150
Each group does two rounds of four rounds each.

921
00:54:55,185 --> 00:54:56,925
The first round of each round

922
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,180
serving as a reference time for the following three rounds...

923
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,175
'It turned out we'd set a time on our first lap

924
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,510
'and then we'd win if we matched that time on the next three. '

925
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:10,462
Is that clear? No, I've got a question.

926
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:12,345
If you break down on your first lap,

927
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,070
do you have to then break down on the subsequent three laps?

928
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:19,845
'I decided to break down before we started. '

929
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,960
Oh, God! Have you seen the oil raining off my chassis?

930
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:27,095
Oh! It's just raining oil!

931
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,610
Come on, she'll do it. She's got to do it. She's a good old girl.

932
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,910
That's fallen off. That's all... Yeah, I meant that.

933
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,690
Have you done the other side? You're going to sparkle.

934
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:47,175
If you or I had done that,

935
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,530
he would kill us. Yes, he would.

936
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,335
'We then hit the track to set our benchmark lap times.

937
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,080
'And I decided, because the Healey was stuck in third,

938
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:02,335
'to keep things steady. '

939
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,690
Slowly, slowly, catchy monkey.

940
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:09,010
Set a nice, smooth lap time.

941
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:11,075
Looking good.

942
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:17,550
'James, obviously trying to impress- Maddie was being more vigorous. '

943
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,035
Like a cross Channel ferry!

944
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,540
Your teddy bear on the spare wheel is not entirely helpful.

945
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,620
'In the Lanchester, it was business as usual. '

946
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:32,640
Was it a sort of boiling hissing sound?

947
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:35,165
No, it was a clunking sound.

948
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,415
Oh, the temperature's right up as well.

949
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,220
You've got to ease up, you've got to ease up.

950
00:56:38,255 --> 00:56:40,845
Yeah, but we've got to get the time.

951
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,110
'Despite everything though, even an official telling me to slow down,

952
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:48,660
'we were all starting to enjoy ourselves. '

953
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,040
I've seen new cars that I wanted to own today.

954
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,762
And you can come here and you can talk to people,

955
00:56:54,797 --> 00:56:57,415
use words like 16 valve and not be embarrassed.

956
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,405
you have not to work for late You can be who you are,

957
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,360
talk about cars, drive like a lunatic on a track.

958
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,600
It's quite nice to be a car person again.

959
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,240
It is.

960
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,045
'Back on the track,

961
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,550
'the Lanchester seemed to be behaving as normal. '

962
00:57:14,585 --> 00:57:17,015
Temperature's gone right up. Yeah.

963
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,680
'I was therefore confident I'd matched my original lap time. '

964
00:57:20,715 --> 00:57:23,950
We did that 29 seconds faster.

965
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:26,335
Did we? Yes. Oh, God.

966
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,635
That's a disaster if we're that far adrift.

967
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,730
'In the Loveboat, James unaware that Maddie had decorated his helmet even more

968
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:37,725
was having 'the time of his life. '

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,670
I think we're coming up to your first stopwatch point.

970
00:57:40,705 --> 00:57:42,935
Two minutes, 36.

971
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,910
Right, reset then. Reset.

972
00:57:44,945 --> 00:57:46,857
1.342.36
1.34, 2.36.

973
00:57:48,726 --> 00:57:50,490
There you go.

974
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,425
'Sadly, our efforts were a bit pointless

Mmmm...

981
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,340
I've got a big Mustang up my trumpet.

982
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,220
I don't like being overtaken.

983
00:58:15,255 --> 00:58:17,360
It's a sign of weakness.

984
00:58:17,395 --> 00:58:21,377
Let's have him.

985
00:58:21,412 --> 00:58:25,360
O- o-o-o-oh! Power!

986
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,400
What's Jeremy doing?

987
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:31,440
Out of my way!

988
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:35,395
Oh, yes!

989
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:39,755
No-o-o, no-o-o, no-o-o!

00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,980

Grrrrrrr!

995
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,040
No, this is very bad!

996
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,025
Oh, yes!

997
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,640
Yes, what do you think of that!

998
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:05,385
Loser!

999
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,515
'But then the penny dropped. '

1000
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:13,400
What I've done, I think, is accidentally got involved in a race with a Mustang,

1001
00:59:13,435 --> 00:59:16,955
and ruined my time.

1002
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,270
'Back at the pits, there was even more bad news. '

1003
00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:23,655
So James May was perfect? Yes.

1004
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,515
Damn it. I don't want to hear that.

1005
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,810
James, you might be in with a shout at beating me.

1006
00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:31,025
Have you got your lap times?

1007
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:34,340
They're pretty consistent. But we're only doing it to the nearest second.

1008
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,090
He was only doing it to the nearest second!

1009
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,045
Hammond,

1010
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,140
he may have a flower on his helmet... What?

1011
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:43,892
.. but he's still James May, so...

1012
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:45,575
Have you put a flower on it as well?

1013
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,770
That's what I was laughing at, there's a flower on your hat.

1014
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:51,960
Have a look. Bloody hell.

1015
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,950
'We now had to wait to see if James had pipped me at the post.

1016
00:59:56,985 --> 00:59:59,697
'But either way, it didn't really matter

1017
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:02,106
'because our three King's Lynn crocks

1018
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:04,445
'had made it to the finishing line.

1019
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,850
'And on the way, they'd wormed their way into our hearts.

1020
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:11,355
'In short, on this glorious island,

1021
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:18,240
'all of us, in our own way, had fallen a little bit in love. '

1022
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,080
This is the bet, 25 pounds.

1023
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:29,065
Yeah.

1024
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:29,100
25 pounds. So, who do I give it to?

1025
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,665
Who do I give it to?

1026
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,570
You give it, Richard Hammond,...

1027
01:00:37,605 --> 01:00:39,085
to James May.

1028
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,540
What?! He is the winner.

1029
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,575
Thank you.

1030
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,550
Anyway, I have to say, all of us have fallen in love with the cars we had out there

1031
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:54,255
to such an extent that for the first time ever,

1032
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,395
after a film, all three of us have actually bought them from the BBC.

1033
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,450
Well, I had to buy the Lanchester, Granddad built it, it's part of the family.

1034
01:01:00,485 --> 01:01:04,040
Now, I do have a bit of a disappointment for you on that,

1035
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:06,435
Hammond, because you see I discovered,

1036
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:10,895
before the rally began if I'm honest, um...

1037
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,130
How can I put this? This particular Lanchester was built

1038
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:17,295
by Barkers, not Mulliners.

1039
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:21,420
What? Which means that what you've done is bought at great expense

1040
01:01:21,455 --> 01:01:23,745
a car built by SOMEBODY'S granddad.

1041
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,735
Oh, God! On that bombshell, ladies and gentlemen,

1042
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:31,700
it's time to end, see you next week, thank you for watching, good night.
