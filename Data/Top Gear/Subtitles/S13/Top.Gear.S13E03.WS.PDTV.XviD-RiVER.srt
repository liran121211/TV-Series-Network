00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:04,472
Resynced, not perfect, but better
Xenzai

00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:09,000
TOP GEAR S13E03

3
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,472
Tonight -
we shout at the Government,

4
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:17,356
a man drives a Subaru
through a building...

5
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:20,997
and a dog goes in a car.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,256
Hello!

7
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:31,874
Hello! Thanks, guys. Thank you.

8
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:33,846
Thanks very much.

9
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,935
Thank you. Now...

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,257
Now, as we know, as we know...

11
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:45,989
nothing in life is very good
and appalling at the same time...

12
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,038
apart from the Jeremy Kyle Show...

13
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:51,627
..and Manchester United.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,578
And all of Burt Reynolds' films.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,309
And actually,
now there's a car as well.

16
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:10,666
This is the latest creation
from the skunk works inside AMG -

17
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,808
the Mercedes SL65 Black.

18
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,304
Good looking, isn't it?

19
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:20,208
In a Jean-Claude
I'm-going-to-kick-you-in-the-face
sort of way.

20
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:24,307
Certainly, with those massively
flared arches and all that ducting,

21
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:26,318
it looks like it might be
pretty fast.

22
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:28,172
But it isn't.

23
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,245
It's mind boggling.

24
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:40,903
I have 660 horsepower
at the disposal of my right foot.

25
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:45,596
That's 50 more than you get from
a Ferrari 599.

26
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,578
Then there's the torque.

27
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:51,824
740 foot pounds.

28
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,635
That's 300 more than you get
from a 599.

29
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:05,466
Of course, to protect the
environment and other road users,
the top speed is limited...

30
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,909
to 199mph.

31
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:23,953
The engine that produces
this almighty oomph is enormous -

32
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:27,354
a 6-litre twin turbo V12.

33
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:31,633
But the rest of the car
is quite simple.

34
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,713
The brakes are steel,
not carbon ceramic.

35
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:38,632
The gearbox only has five speeds,
not the usual seven.

36
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:43,710
The traction control has
two settings - on or off.

37
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:49,470
It even comes with
run-of-the-mill suspension.

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,548
The steering in this is
a bit woolly... No, not woolly,

39
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,991
more sort of nylon,

40
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:59,269
but because Mercedes has thrown
away the silly electronic
suspension,

41
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,548
gone back to a conventional set-up,
it's very predictable.

42
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:12,828
In many ways, then, this is like
an American muscle car -

43
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:17,586
fast, simple and, in some ways,
quite cheap.

44
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:26,864
It costs £250,000 and, yes,
I know that sounds like a lot,

45
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:30,944
but it's £100,000 less than
the McLaren Mercedes.

46
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,023
And is the McLaren £100,000 faster?

47
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:36,823
Well, let's find out.

48
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:41,821
ENGINES ROAR

49
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,542
God, that McLaren sounds dirty.

50
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:49,340
If my children made
a noise like that, I'd make them
sit on the naughty step.

51
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,898
I reckon, in a straight line,
Mr McLaren IS faster.

52
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:03,338
Not by £100,000,
but in the corners...

53
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,217
Hm-hm-hmm!

54
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,496
Smoke coming off the back end!

55
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:16,134
Ten more horsepower, I reckon,
ten more, and I'd have him.

56
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:22,375
But the best thing about the Black

57
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:29,492
is that, despite performance
and the anabolic "look at me!"
wheel arch extensions,

58
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:34,574
it's a normal SL in here.
I've got satellite navigation
and climate control

59
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,052
and iPod compatibility.

60
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,773
I've even got an automatic gearbox.

61
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:42,012
All good so far, then.

62
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:44,530
But it doesn't last.

63
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:51,851
First of all,
it is THE most uncomfortable car
in all of human history.

64
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:56,130
There is no give at all
in the tyre side wall.

65
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,089
There is no give, either,
in the suspension. Look.

66
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:02,167
And look at these seats.
One-piece carbon fibre

67
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,806
from the Mercedes Agony range!

68
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:09,727
You would honestly be
more comfortable on
a Georgian's kitchen wheelback.

69
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:14,006
I can't imagine what Mercedes
was using for inspiration.

70
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:15,485
No, hang on a minute!

71
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,565
I can imagine what Mercedes was
using for inspiration.

72
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,125
Look! A pile of stones.

73
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,125
This is almost identical
to the SL Black.

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,762
I'll just try it out.

75
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:30,322
Oh, hang on.

76
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,244
Hmm. Yeah.

77
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:39,680
Yeah, I would rather go to work
on a cairn than in an SL Black.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
A cairn would be faster, too.

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,041
The problem is,
is that there's so much torque

80
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:52,199
that if you pull out to overtake
a lorry and put your foot down,

81
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,679
the traction control comes down
like an anvil

82
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,478
and you're not going anywhere.

83
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,837
Of course, you can turn
the traction control off.

84
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,158
But don't forget -

85
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:07,396
those back tyres cost £358 each.

86
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,235
Really, the only way you can
drive this car,

87
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:15,594
even when the road is dry,
is slowly.

88
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:18,715
And I don't know, but I think that
rather spoils the point.

89
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:23,994
Then there's the rear spoiler which
comes up at 75mph.

90
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:27,272
So if it's up, you're speeding...
and some policemen will come.

91
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,512
There are other niggles, too,

92
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:34,072
like the fact it's out of fuel
after 250 miles,

93
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,951
and it has the turning circle
of a moon.

94
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,471
Look at this.

95
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:44,790
A normal SL can get round here
no problem at at...

96
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,909
whereas the Black...can't.

97
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,429
That means you're going to
run off the road

98
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:58,146
and damage that low-riding
air-splitter.

99
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:04,906
And I haven't even got to
the worst bit yet.

100
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:10,587
In a normal SL,
which can turn round

101
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:14,986
and run up kerbs without
breaking your back, or itself,

102
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,944
and go more than six feet without
running out of petrol,

103
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:20,863
you have a roof which folds away
into the boot.

104
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:26,863
In an SL Black, to save weight,
the roof doesn't go anywhere.

105
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:31,622
And then we have to go
back to the price.

106
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:35,143
Yes, the Black is good value
compared to the McLaren.

107
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:39,141
But it's five times more than
its little sister,

108
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:44,061
and I'm sorry...
but it just isn't worth it.

109
00:07:54,378 --> 00:08:00,098
Superb, sublime, brilliant,
super-exciting rubbish!

110
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:02,257
But... It is!

111
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:07,377
Am I right in saying that
they've only imported
eight of these into the UK? Yeah.

112
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:13,176
So that means they need to find
eight people in Great Britain
with more money than sense? Yeah.

113
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,775
So who does this one belong to?
Theo Walcott.

114
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:19,133
Go on, then.
Now where are you going?

115
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:23,851
Anything I say now is going to be
libellous, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
I'll tell you what we'll do.

116
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,774
We'll find out how fast
this goes round our track.

117
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:30,013
That means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

118
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:34,652
Some say that he thinks
crisps are animals...

119
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:40,171
..and that if he'd done well
at Wimbledon once in a while,

120
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:43,009
he might have been able to
raise a smile.

121
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,768
All we know is,
he's called the Stig.

122
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,807
Away he goes!

123
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:55,327
Traction control off because,
of course, he can put
those tyres on expenses.

124
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:59,607
Into the first corner.
Can't help thinking this is
going to be a handful.

125
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,725
Oh, yes, it is.

126
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:08,086
Oh, dear. Yes, I'm sorry.
The Stig has gone all Scottish.

127
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,327
He loves to Strip The Willow

128
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:13,885
with all those other Stigs
that the Daily Mail's invented.

129
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:17,085
Just a very big mess in Chicago.
So Hammerhead...

130
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,964
Lord alone knows
what's going to happen here.

131
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:23,243
Under-steer...over-steer...
Under-steer then over-steer again.

132
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:26,723
Every sort of steer,
and all happening practically
at the same time.

133
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:35,522
Is that bagpipes or is it the sound
of someone deflating a cat?

134
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:39,921
Through the tyres -
very, very fast.

135
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:43,759
Now he comes in to
the second-to-last corner,

136
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,079
holding it nicely. Just Gambon left.
Seems to be juddering through that.

137
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,280
Across the line!

138
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,360
I have the time in my hand.

139
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,238
It did it...

140
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:02,997
It did it in one minute 23 dead,

141
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:07,876
so if we look, it's faster than
the original Murcielago,

142
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:12,074
it's faster than the original Zonda,
faster than the original Koenigsegg,

143
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:16,075
which means it's faster than
a lot of cars that are now...

144
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,593
faster than it.

145
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:23,673
And now we must do the news,
and starting off with Citroen,
they've made a new C3.

146
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,392
Here it is.
And, well, it's a Citroen.

147
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:33,031
It looks like that, but the most
important thing about it is, for this
car, they've invented a new word.

148
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:37,353
Word?! They've put it
in their publicity material,
and it's "visiodrive".

149
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:42,189
They confessed they've made that up.
It's a whole new word. Visiodrive.

150
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,549
I'm sort of sympathetic. Why?

151
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:49,267
Because none of the words you'd
normally use to describe a Citroen

152
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:54,587
would work very well in their own
publicity blurb, would they? Like,
flimsy. Plasticky. Lightweight.

153
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,068
Anybody else got
any thoughts on Citroens?

154
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:02,547
Box on wheels. What? Box on wheels.
That's not very good.
That was terrible.

155
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:08,705
Anyway, the point is that if you
want a car that is Visiodrive,
that's your only choice,

156
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:11,344
even if you are
the Sultan of Brunei.

157
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:15,384
Now, pay attention. OK?

158
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:20,745
As men, we all know you should
never, ever buy a woman something
with a plug on it. Yeah?

159
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,303
We know that. Yeah. I did. What?

160
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:24,584
I did!

161
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:29,941
You bought your girlfriend
an electrical appliance?
Yeah. I got her a power drill.

162
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,340
James! James,
she's a ballet correspondent.

163
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,180
That's what she wanted.
She said, "I want a power drill,"
so I got her one. She SAID that!

164
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,660
Do you know nothing?! Women say they
want a power drill but they don't.
They want soap. No... They do.

165
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,699
But it's impossible to buy soap
for a woman. Eh? Hang on.
No, soap's soap. You can't...

166
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,699
Did you hear that, girls?
Soap is soap! But it is.

167
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,858
Go on, then. Buy your
wife some Swarfega. Well, that's...

168
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:59,137
That's an effective cleaning agent.
She'd be chuffed, I'm sure.

169
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:03,416
However, the worst thing
that you would ever have to buy,
ever have to buy a girl,

170
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:09,216
is a handbag. That's bad. Even if,
by some miracle, you got the right
colour, it'd be the wrong shape,

171
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:13,493
it wouldn't have the right
number of pockets,
it would be last season's handbag.

172
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,334
Is there a season for handbags?

173
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,854
Did you hear him?

174
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:19,135
Is...? Oh, yes!

175
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:23,615
What, at certain times of the year,
I can shoot handbags? Yes. OK.

176
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,732
No. The fact is, OK,

177
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:30,171
my wife has a handbag -
I kid you not - it is this big, OK?

178
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:34,371
And in it, she'll go, "I've lost
my mobile phone! Ring it!

179
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:38,090
"Ring it!" "It's in there.
You must be able to see it."

180
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,330
"I can't see it!" The point is,

181
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,090
salvation is at hand, OK?

182
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,408
New type of handbag out this week.
Here it is.

183
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:50,289
Look at that. Yeah. Now,
that is made from Camaro seats.

184
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,569
What? Yeah...

185
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:54,327
And it says in the bumph...
and I'm going to quote, OK?

186
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:57,247
"Try to picture your lady friend
grasping it tightly

187
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:01,607
"and the next vintage car show
you both attend." Ohhhh!

188
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:05,966
So this is made from seat cloth
of a Classic Camaro? Yes.

189
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:09,843
So that's had a Texan's
sweaty buttocks on it? Yes.

190
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:14,403
And now it's a handbag. On the
other side - you can't see it -
are the skid marks... NO! No!

191
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:15,565
Hey! What?

192
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:19,682
My bull mastiff keeps trying to mate
with my Labradoodle.

193
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:24,723
Bear with me, I do get back to cars.
It keeps trying to mate
with my Labradoodle, and I think

194
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:29,642
I've worked out what the results
of that coupling would look like.
Here it is.

195
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,681
Is that a motorcycle and sidecar?

196
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:38,202
Sport of melted into one
hideous lump. It's a Laverda 3CL.

197
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:41,439
The man behind this is a French
medical technician.

198
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,719
Did he not, at any point whilst
building it, just take one step back?

199
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,719
"Agh! It's horrible!"

200
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:53,239
If you know of anything uglier than
that, you should write to us at

201
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:59,437
"I live next door to David Guest",
Top Gear...
LAUGHTER

202
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:01,557
Can I say...? Sorry about this.
Moving on.

203
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,955
On Tuesday, or it might have been
Monday, the Government announced

204
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:08,595
what it called
a level 2 heat wave alert, OK?,

205
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:12,635
for what we used to call
a lovely summer's day.

206
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:17,035
Actually, we quite like
a good heat wave here on Top Gear,

207
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:20,475
because it means we can play
Car Sauna. It's really very simple.

208
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:25,512
You park the car with the engine
running, turn the air conditioning
off, wind the windows up,

209
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:30,071
turn the heater to maximum,
and the first person to get out
is the loser.

210
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,791
You think he's making that up,
don't you?

211
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,870
Because earlier today, while we were
waiting for all you lot to turn up,

212
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,270
this is what we got up to.

213
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,751
It's now 37.8 degrees in here,
as you can see,

214
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,389
before the test begins.

215
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,388
Let's just make it fair, OK?

216
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,308
Whichever one gets out first pays
the other a tenner.

217
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,587
Coming up to four minutes.
Temperature check, please.

218
00:14:56,587 --> 00:15:00,866
Oh, yes. It's 53 degrees
in our Mercedes now.

219
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:03,667
Can you see my face?

220
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,865
Can you see my face now? I'm not
sure they'll want to.

221
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,184
Given that we are made of...
What percentage of us is water?

222
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:11,624
98%. Or less.

223
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:15,984
Water that then evaporates. So what
we are breathing is each other...

224
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:21,264
Agh! Agh! You're breathing my chest!
Agh! Agh!

225
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,783
59.7 degrees.

226
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:28,343
This is a stupid game.

227
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,582
I've changed my mind.

228
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,701
61.9 degrees.

229
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,899
Guys...

230
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,218
Oh, come on.

231
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:50,019
You owe us £10 each!

232
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,176
A good idea.

233
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:04,735
Gordon...

234
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,654
Gordon, if you're watching,
and you're probably not,

235
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:11,733
if you're going to set these
ridiculous heat wave level alerts...

236
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:16,934
What was it we got up to? 62. 62.
..62 degrees is your bottom...

237
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,052
It gets a bit toasty. Uncomfortable.
Yeah. About there.

238
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:24,892
Gordon, they're something else
I discovered in that test,
if you're watching, and that is,

239
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:27,491
I KNOW when I'm too hot.

240
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,651
I don't need the Government to tell
me to have a drink of water

241
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:35,170
and put sun cream on.

242
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,530
Leave us alone!

243
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,408
Anyway...

244
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:46,049
Guys...

245
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:52,009
You'll have to split it.
I've only got a 20.

246
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,487
Don't worry.
I'll put it on expenses(!)

247
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:56,885
Now, the recession.

248
00:16:56,885 --> 00:17:02,326
We all know what caused it. Banks
were lending money they didn't have
to people who couldn't pay them back

249
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:06,327
and now no-one can afford anything.
Yes. And this begs a question.

250
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:11,925
In these difficult times, is there
such a thing as cheap and cheerful?

251
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,162
No!

252
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,283
I mean, when have you ever heard
anyone say,

253
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:24,081
"Right! I'm going to deploy
my cheap and cheerful parachute?"

254
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:27,522
"I could have had an expensive
heart operation

255
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:31,480
"but I decided to go for one
that was cheap and cheerful!"

256
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:37,001
This Perodua Myvi suffers from
the same problem.

257
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:42,959
It costs £7,600, so it is cheap,
but is it cheerful? No.

258
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,078
Brakes are rubbish.

259
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,837
Ride's rubbish.

260
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,597
Seats are rubbish.

261
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,037
That's rubbish.

262
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:58,676
Honestly, I would rather be inside
Paul Scholes.

263
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,874
This is a car you drive
with a long face.

264
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,554
Still, could be worse.

265
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,993
You could be in a Chevrolet Aveo.

266
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:17,635
I like a basic, underpowered car,
I think they can be fantastic fun,

267
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:21,472
so it amazes me that they can
make this thing so dull.

268
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:27,031
The steering is meaningless,
the pedals feel mushy,

269
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,272
the seats are flat.

270
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:31,590
The gear change is out of a...

271
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,911
I think it's out of a
Mark I Cavalier.

272
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,510
No. That's not fair on the Cavalier.

273
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,668
And the cost of all this misery?
£8,500.

274
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,588
The only reason you would
buy this car

275
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,747
is not because it's cheap,
because it's not that cheap,

276
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:51,907
it would be because you hadn't
tried any others.

277
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:57,467
I have! I've tried this,
the Proton Satria Neo.

278
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:01,386
It's actually not so bad
when you're moving.

279
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:05,986
That's not cos it's in any way
fun to drive - it isn't.
The gear change is awful,

280
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:10,224
the engine's got no power low down
whatsoever, but when you move it,

281
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:13,104
at least you're obliged to
look ahead, out of the cabin.

282
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:19,262
Only when you stop do you think,
"I'm sure I saw a nice surround on
that air vent! I'll just adjust...

283
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:23,581
"Oh, no! It's horrible.
And look at all this!

284
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,422
"Ugh! That's not metal, either."

285
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:31,980
At nearly £10,000, the Proton
is the most expensive of the three,

286
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,899
but you do get some unique features.

287
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:41,059
The wing mirrors have been made using
fairground hall-of-mirrors glass,

288
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,498
so when I move my head like that,
all the cars...blbl-bbb-blbl.

289
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:47,778
So that's either a bus, now it's skip
and now it's a big clown...

290
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,417
Soon, we all met up

291
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:55,776
and this was an ideal opportunity
to show Jeremy one of the
Proton's other unique features.

292
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:59,136
Now, it's a sunny day.
Put the visor down.

293
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:01,895
Ha! You can't see a thing!

294
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:05,694
You can't make the seat go down?
You can a bit,
but you have to open the door.

295
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:10,453
So every time the sun comes out, you
then have to open the door? Yeah.

296
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:14,294
Look. They've managed to make
Allen-headed bolts out of plastic.

297
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:16,053
Cos I believe..

298
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:19,970
That's a disappointment.
That's wrong!

299
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,812
Talking of fake, look at this.

300
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:24,291
Ooh! That's not a real alloy.

301
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,210
Are these fake, as well? Yes,
they are. So fake wheel nuts?

302
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,369
A year ago, we'd have been here
with a Ferrari,
a Lamborghini and an Aston Martin.

303
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,811
Now... This is it.

304
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:39,170
We'd chosen as our meeting point
London's financial district,

305
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,570
so we thought it'd be a good idea,
while we were there,

306
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,208
to introduce all the passing bankers
and money men

307
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,367
to the motoring world
they'd created.

308
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,527
What have you got now? XJR. An XJR?

309
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:54,086
And you've got a...? BMW M3. M3?

310
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,366
BMW X5. X5?

311
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,407
So, welcome to the future.
Your future.

312
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:02,605
I'm not sure this is the right car
for me. It's the ONLY car for you.

313
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,126
You'd better get used to it.

314
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,926
Lavishly equipped with doors.

315
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:12,445
I'm not sure it's going to do the
acceleration that the M3 does.
It doesn't. I can assure you!

316
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:17,324
You've been lending money to
Mexicans who haven't got enough to
pay you back, haven't you?

317
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:20,641
You have! That's what you've done,
and now look. Check it out.

318
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,642
That one any better? No.

319
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:24,242
Are all three terrible? Yes.

320
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:27,202
Do you have this every day
going round? Yeah, it does.

321
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,801
Every day, constantly down? Yep.
Thought about
jumping out of a window?

322
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:33,361
It's a bit plasticky. A bit?!

323
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,200
What are you doing at work today?

324
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,199
We are looking into new markets
in European gas.

325
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,118
That might not be a bad thing
for you lot - just flip it down,

326
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:49,718
you wouldn't see the bridge
coming up - everybody's happy.
Have you noticed this?

327
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:52,676
I put that back on earlier.
Thanks(!)

328
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,277
It just disintegrated
while I was looking at it.

329
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:56,715
What's the 0-60?

330
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,515
Excuse me. Good news. What?

331
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:02,754
You know we're here? A distraction?
See the crowds? Yeah.

332
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:07,313
That means that none of them
can actually get into their offices
and lose all our money!

333
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:10,473
It's safe! We're providing
a service to the nation.

334
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:17,033
And then, after we'd moved on,
I came up with another
service for the nation.

335
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:21,871
All the banks that go to
the Government for OUR money,

336
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:25,271
to keep going, make them have,
as company cars,

337
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,030
Perodua Myvis.

338
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:32,672
RBS - you've been really bad. You
can have a Proton "septic nappy".

339
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:36,828
Yeah, Fred Goodwin,
you keep your pension.

340
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:38,510
Just one thing.

341
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,629
Your car.

342
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:45,308
Of course, bankers aren't entirely
responsible for the problems...

343
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:50,509
..which is why we pulled over,
decorated our cars a bit

344
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,105
and went to shout at the Government.

345
00:22:56,506 --> 00:23:00,187
What do we want? ALL: Aston Martins!

346
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:03,066
When do we want them? ALL: Now!

347
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,343
V8 not G8!

348
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:09,744
Give us a Rolls-Royce Phantom now!

349
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:15,263
2, 4, 6, 8, Jacqui Smith's husband
likes to mast...

350
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,503
I can't do that one.

351
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:21,942
Supercars not ministers...
I'm not very good at this.

352
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,902
Mind you, compared to James...

353
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,980
Acceleration not nationalisation...
of the banks.

354
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,898
Although it's easy to make a case
for state ownership of other
industries, such as utilities.

355
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:41,577
Ker-ching! Hit the banks not our
tanks! He means your petrol tanks,
if you were confused.

356
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:46,137
Although, whilst we're at it,
the Armed Forces are under-equipped
for the job they have to do.

357
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:49,136
A policemen then came
to tell us off.

358
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,697
Please don't hit me with
your riot shield.

359
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:56,695
But it was quite hard
to understand him.

360
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:00,654
What?

361
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:04,414
I think that policeman's quite cross.

362
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:09,333
In fact, he was so fed up
that he told us to leave.

363
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:13,213
That's not gone well, our protest.

364
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:16,613
But we were fed up too...
with our cars.

365
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:20,332
So we left them in a stupid place
and went home on foot.

366
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:24,491
This tunnel handles better
than my car

367
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,930
and the interior
is a lot more welcoming.

368
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,572
It's a fact!

369
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:43,328
Um...I should point out the producers
were very angry with us about that,

370
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:47,968
because they said we'd deliberately
just gone and chosen three cars
that we didn't like.

371
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:53,885
Yeah, but we said we'd made a film
to show just how many terrible
cheap cars there are out there.

372
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,844
And that buyers need to be careful.

373
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:58,046
Exactly. Yeah.
But they didn't buy that.

374
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:00,883
They said we had to go out and make
that film again

375
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:04,565
and this time, choose three
cheap cars that we actually like.

376
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,203
Yeah. And we'll be looking at
that later on.

377
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:10,363
Now it is time to put a star
in OUR Chevrolet.

378
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:15,282
Er...over the years, 105 different
people have driven round our track,

379
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:21,242
and yet, unbelievably, only three of
them have ever been called Michael.

380
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:25,121
Well, don't worry -
I can tell you're concerned -

381
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:31,360
because that's all about to change.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands
together for Michael McIntyre!

382
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,918
Jeremy Clarkson! How are you?
Hello. Thank you, Top Gear.

383
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:53,916
Why do announcers always say,
"Put your hands together"? You'd
just go like that, wouldn't you?

384
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:59,554
I think it's like, "Put your hands
together and pray that he's funny!"

385
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:03,113
I gather that, on the way down here,
people were offering you advice

386
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:07,034
as to how you should drive... I got
endless advice. From everybody.

387
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:10,793
There was a woman at home... There's
a woman at home?! She's my wife!

388
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,231
Yeah, my wife gave me advice.

389
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:22,112
The drycleaner told me to turn
the air conditioning off in the car,
because it makes it go faster.

390
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:26,789
The drycleaner is talking sense.
The guy who drove me here said,
"Don't brake."

391
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:32,511
I think he didn't like me very much.
He just said, "Don't brake!"

392
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:37,108
Let's have a look...
Cos you have just boinged into
the public consciousness.

393
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:40,827
Two years ago - Michael who?
And now all these girls...

394
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:45,786
They've been queuing here all day.
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Hi, girls.

395
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:51,106
It's being going well lately.
My show is on the telly
on Saturday night after Casualty.

396
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,506
# Do-do-do-do... #

397
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:54,305
That's when my show starts.

398
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:56,665
What, after it goes,
do-do-do-do?

399
00:26:56,665 --> 00:27:00,424
I'm trying desperately to get
on Casualty to publicise my show.

400
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:03,384
I'd just like to be on a gurney
and then sit up and go,

401
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:05,103
"Watch my show afterwards."

402
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:10,942
That'd be ideal. Anyway,
your early life. School, obviously.

403
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:14,502
University. Is it true you can't
remember what degree you did?

404
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,942
That is true, yes.

405
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:21,381
I did biology or chemistry.
I've narrowed it down to two.

406
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:22,940
But you don't know which you did?

407
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,659
I know it wasn't physics.
Is that good enough?

408
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:28,941
How can you not remember
what you did at university?

409
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:32,818
I remember being in the lab.
I remember there was a lab...

410
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:37,899
I remember finding a girl attractive
on the first day and thinking,
"That'll be the love of my life,"

411
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:42,976
then they gave me a lab coat and
huge specs. I realised the odds were
against me. Was it a girl thing?

412
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,617
Um... University?
Well, it didn't work.

413
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:47,576
If you did biology,
it would've done.

414
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:49,536
My voice didn't break
till I was about 23.

415
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:52,975
When you sound like your mother on
the phone...Hello?

416
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,975
It's not Mummy, it's Michael.

417
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,615
I'll get Mummy for you. Mummy?
Phone!

418
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:01,414
She'd come in...
Hello?

419
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:05,135
I actually had hair under one arm
for a year. That was an odd...

420
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:10,814
It was a difficult transition
to manhood.

421
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,053
But I did buy my first car
to try and seduce women.

422
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:15,291
Which was a...?

423
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:18,052
I got a Triumph Spitfire
convertible.

424
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:23,210
I had it for about six months
and I hit a...

425
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,370
a parked Volvo, which was not...
Of all the cars to hit...

426
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,249
It's not like I was picking them!

427
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,289
And then the owner of the Volvo -
it was outside his house -

428
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,728
he ran out and said...
He was very angry.

429
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:38,367
He came up to the car and said,
"Are you drunk?!"

430
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:43,568
And I was so flustered and I'd been
told if you get into a crash,
don't admit responsibility,

431
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:46,047
so I just said, "Are you drunk?"

432
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:51,445
To which he said,
"I'm at home having dinner.
What are you talking about?!"

433
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:54,724
So, what are you driving
at the moment?

434
00:28:54,724 --> 00:29:00,245
At the moment, I have... My wife's
car and my car - we have two cars.
That's allowed.

435
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:03,483
They haven't banned it yet.
They will, but they haven't yet.

436
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:05,844
I feel a bit guilty about the car
that I got her.

437
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,202
You won't feel guilty, because
I know you like these big cars.

438
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:11,363
I like all cars!
Except for the three...

439
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,802
I got her an X5, 4x4 car.

440
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:15,762
I don't like that. Right. I do.
A BMW X5. Yeah, I like it.

441
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:18,881
It's got seats and you go,
"Urr-urr-urr-urr-uh" like that.

442
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,160
"Urr-urr!"

443
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,000
So it's got adjustable...
I love that, though.

444
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,199
I've never had a car with that.
"Urr..."

445
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:29,479
I try and drive
in the most awkward positions.
As far back... "Urr...urr!"

446
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,358
Another thing with the modern issue
with the car

447
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:37,118
is the parking sensors,
which is brand-new to me.

448
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,238
It senses when the cars
behind you... I love it. Exactly.

449
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:42,676
It goes green and red.
"bup-bup-bpp-bpp-bb-bb-bb-BEEP!"

450
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:45,916
It screams, like there's a little
person going, "Aaaaargh!"

451
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:53,675
It's like there's two little people,
unseen, and they just go,
"No, no, no, no, NO, NO! Stop it!"

452
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:58,035
Why did you describe motorways
as the "highway of life"?

453
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:02,994
Well, after the Spitfire,
I went into some really bad cars.

454
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:08,112
I had my wife's car after that -
we shared that. That was the Mini,

455
00:30:08,112 --> 00:30:10,672
Mini Mayfair. That's all right.
Nice little car.

456
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:13,193
Then I had my Austin Metro Princess,
1.0.

457
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:19,632
It had no fuel gauge, which was a
bit of an issue, because it meant I
had to look up the miles per gallon,

458
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:23,389
then count the miles
on the milometer
to work out how much fuel I had,

459
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:27,150
which worked until the milometer
broke. Then I had to guess

460
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:31,868
what a mile was... Then, ultimately,
I ended up getting it wrong.

461
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:38,308
I ran out of petrol, and I knew
there was a petrol station
quite near and I ran there

462
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:43,147
and I didn't have a jerry can,
and I presumed they'd sell them
in the petrol station.

463
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:46,065
I was queuing up and I completely
forgot the word for jerry can.

464
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:47,306
My mind went blank.

465
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:50,746
There was quite a long queue
and I went, "Hi, I need a...um...

466
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:55,345
"Ooh, I need a thing, you know.
Oh, God, it's a thing
that you put petrol in?"

467
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:57,424
And the bloke just went, "Car?"

468
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:03,983
The closest I got to was
"petrol suitcase?"

469
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:12,022
So this was why, I suppose, cos I
spent a lot of time with the Metro
in the loser lane, the slow lane...

470
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:16,701
Loser lane? ..with the trucks
and the lorries and the horses

471
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:18,861
and the old people.

472
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:22,221
The only way you could feel better
about having such a terrible car

473
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:25,660
is you would occasionally try and
overtake nicer cars on the motorway.

474
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,779
It's quite a manly moment.

475
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,738
You're chugging along at 60,
you're quite comfortable.

476
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,858
You'll see a Porsche
in the middle lane,

477
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:37,297
I'd say to my wife,
"You see that Porsche?" She'd say,
"Yes, what of it?" "I'm having it."

478
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:41,736
She's like, "The Princess couldn't
overtake that Porsche, it's a 1.0!"

479
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:42,815
"I can do this!"

480
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:47,336
You pull into the middle lane,
you start to get excited,
then you get into the fast lane.

481
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:50,615
When you're in the fast lane in a
bad car, you know you don't belong.

482
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:56,653
Big Range Rovers right up behind
you, flashing, "Retreat to
the loser lane, where you belong!"

483
00:31:56,653 --> 00:32:02,334
There are horses in the slow lane,
going, "I've gotta see this.
What's going on?"

484
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:08,012
I think the top speed was about 76.
You put your foot down and the whole
car would shake uncontrollably.

485
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:14,332
It takes somewhere between 40
and 45 minutes to pull alongside
the Porsche.

486
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,931
My wife's going, "I told you!"

487
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:22,129
And you always have to look over,
when you're overtaking,
to see your victim.

488
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:25,690
"Who are you, Porsche driver?"

489
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:38,048
He's normally on the phone. He goes,
"Hold on, I'll call you back.

490
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:40,888
"Some dick from the loser lane's
trying to overtake."

491
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:50,006
I do that to people! "Get back
where you belong!" I am that person.

492
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:52,725
When I'm in the X5 now,

493
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:58,123
if I get overtaken, even if I'm
home, I will get back out and...

494
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:01,564
"Get back to where you belong.
I've worked hard for this car."

495
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:06,323
I've driven hundreds of miles past
where I live, just to overtake
someone back again.

496
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:11,482
Thing is, though, when we asked
if you'd like to come on...

497
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:15,441
Yes. ..you told the person who rang
you up that you'd be incredibly fast

498
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:18,760
going round our lap. No,
I don't know if I did. Did I?

499
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,881
I said I'll try hard to be fast.

500
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:25,798
You said you'd be very fast. It was
more difficult than I imagined.

501
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,558
Who here would like to see the lap?

502
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,678
ALL: Yes!
Come on, let's have a look.

503
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,478
Here we go. I suspect...

504
00:33:36,478 --> 00:33:39,078
Go, go, go!

505
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:41,597
Heading down to the first corner...

506
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:45,276
Oh, my giddy aunt,
that's...ambitious!

507
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:47,955
Ambitiously fast, Michael.

508
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:53,274
OK, now, into Chicago.

509
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:55,673
Again, I'm suspecting
you're going too fast.

510
00:33:55,673 --> 00:33:57,596
Lost a lot of time
with understeer.

511
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,434
That's a screamingly .

512
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:03,233
Straight into the Hammerhead.
Trickiest corner.

513
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:07,513
Did you enjoy this? I didn't
really... I lost track of time.

514
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,832
There we go.
Actually, that's not bad at all.

515
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,911
No, you can relax after that.

516
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,951
Ah! And you are doing!

517
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,429
You are doing...
And that's pretty fast.

518
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,950
I'm impressed with this.
And impressed with that!

519
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,228
God, you really had picked up
some... Second to last corner,

520
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:33,068
that's nicely done!
Here we go, just Gambon...

521
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:36,827
It's gonna be... Oh, my God!

522
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,946
Well done!

523
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,427
You nearly flipped it!

524
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:46,986
You nearly turned
the damn thing over! I nearly did.

525
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:49,744
How close was that to rolling?
I thought that was it.

526
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:50,984
I said my goodbyes.

527
00:34:50,984 --> 00:34:53,504
That was pretty spectacular,
wasn't it?

528
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:56,425
It was a very ambitious
second half to the lap

529
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:58,104
and a very...

530
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,224
rubbish first half.

531
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,943
It was, it was. I know.
Too fast into the corners.

532
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:04,262
Mmm, where do you think?

533
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:05,941
Where do you think you've come?

534
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:10,342
Anywhere in the middle,
I'd be happy with. As the Stig said,
"conditions were perfect".

535
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:16,740
Michael McIntyre, you did it...
in one minute...

536
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:21,098
..forty... I like that.
I'm fine with that.

537
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:24,299
..eight point seven.

538
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,819
You're in here.

539
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,418
Oh, look.

540
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,377
Marky Mark and Michael McIntyre.

541
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,738
That's not a bad time.

542
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:36,296
I'm all right with that.

543
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:39,177
That's right...
Didn't I say in the middle?

544
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:44,375
It's in the middle of the whole
thing! You are the most average man
in an averagely-priced car

545
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,576
we've ever had.
You are also one of the funniest.

546
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:50,376
Ladies and gentlemen,
Michael McIntyre! Thank you.

547
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:08,051
Now...if you are
any sort of a car fan,

548
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:10,411
and you own an internet,

549
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:15,410
you will most probably have come
across a chap called Ken Block
on your "Youbook" site.

550
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,169
Young people tell me he is
an internet sensation.

551
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:23,329
That's why I went all the way
to the United States in America

552
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:25,089
to spend the day with him.

553
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:31,369
I was told to meet him
not at Dunkin' Donuts,

554
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,728
but here, at Inyokern airfield
in California.

555
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,567
I can hear him coming now

556
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:42,046
and I suspect he won't be arriving
in a straight line.

557
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:48,365
No, he's more like a game station
character who has emerged into
the real world.

558
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:59,363
And that's why his films get more
than ten million hits

559
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:01,883
on "Facetube".

560
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,803
Now, by day, Ken is a rally driver.

561
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:10,401
But what's special about him
is the way he sharpens his skills.

562
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:15,560
You see, most rallyists prefer to
practise in the forests of Wales
or Finland.

563
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,399
But Ken prefers to use...

564
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,720
airports.

565
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,041
Thing is, Mr Block, I look at this
sleepy old airfield and this hangar

566
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:31,238
and I think about preflight checks
and the problems of weathercocking
in crosswinds.

567
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:35,276
Looks like a playground to me.
In what way?

568
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:40,718
There's not so many places where you
have a great mix of dirt and Tarmac
and open areas...

569
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:43,916
And parked aeroplanes.
They're nice obstacles.

570
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,714
Obstacles... I mean, the owners of
them probably... Do they know?

571
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:50,196
I'm not really sure.

572
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:54,275
Ken has devised a course
around this place,

573
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:58,034
but he wants to keep the details
a surprise. All I know is

574
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:02,513
he'll be using his specially
strengthened, 380 horsepower

575
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,751
Subaru Impreza rally car

576
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:08,153
and that today,
there's a seat going spare.

577
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:15,110
I, Captain Slow, will be here,
with my bum on the best seat
in the theatre of petrol,

578
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,431
in the royal box of rallying,

579
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:21,151
riding shotgun with
Kenny from the block.

580
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,627
And I don't even have to do pace
notes, because he knows the route.

581
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:31,747
You do, don't you? Mm...

582
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:38,746
Where are we going?

583
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:47,344
Bloody hell!

584
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,703
Mind the aeroplanes!

585
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:07,021
Are you sure?

586
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,260
Door!

587
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:14,580
Here we go again!

588
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:31,778
God, that's unbelievable!

589
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:50,095
Mind the pole!

590
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:04,211
Cor, that was nice!

591
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,729
Where the hell are we going now?!

592
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,569
That's a fire station.

593
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:24,448
Next stop,
Ken's eyeball spin dryer.

594
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:43,127
Tarmac session over,
it was time for a dirt workout.

595
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:44,644
Ooh, God!

596
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:47,003
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

597
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:52,964
Whoa!

598
00:40:55,603 --> 00:41:01,081
Oh, that's Mr Ricky Carmichael,
a good friend of mine. I think he's
come out to play with us.

599
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:05,601
'As it happens, Ricky is the
greatest dirt-biker in history,

600
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:08,240
'15 times undefeated champion.'

601
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
Go get him, Mr Block.

602
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,120
Ow!

603
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,280
Oh, there... BLEEP!

604
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:33,717
'On the straights,
Kenny was much faster,

605
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:36,795
'but Ricky was a genius
at finding shortcuts.'

606
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,635
Where's he gone?

607
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:56,032
'Kenny and Ricky wanted to play with
some more planes.'

608
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:02,192
No, no! Goodbye, viewers!

609
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:14,908
That's the nose of a DC-2.

610
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,868
He's getting away.

611
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:26,308
Not over there, that's a jump.

612
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:29,508
That's a motocross jump. No!

613
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,102
We're alive!

614
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:59,821
That was incredible!

615
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:02,582
God!

616
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,941
Now look what you've done!

617
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,259
Am I right in saying he's coming
to Britain later this year,

618
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:23,859
to play on our track?

619
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,099
Yes.

620
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,177
We could use his aeroplane
as one of the obstacles. Yes! No.

621
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:31,097
The man's useless.
He can't drive in a straight line.

622
00:43:32,457 --> 00:43:35,377
Captain Slow rather missing
the point there. Anyway,

623
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:39,895
earlier on, we sort of suggested
that all cheap cars are rubbish

624
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:43,413
and the producers told us to go away,
put our heads in some books

625
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:48,013
and not take them out again till
we'd come up with a cheap car
that we all liked.

626
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:52,012
After a solid 24 minutes of reading,
inevitably,

627
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:55,295
we'd come up with three cheap cars
that we liked.

628
00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:59,453
So, it was time to go down to our
track to find out which was best.

629
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:04,731
This is my choice.

630
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:07,890
It's a Skoda with a microscopic
diesel engine

631
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,010
and a top speed of 92.

632
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,888
That doesn't sound so good,
but it's called the Roomster.

633
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:16,889
And that sounds great!

634
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:17,929
Roomster.

635
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:21,569
I like to think that's what Marc
Bolan would've called his lounge.

636
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:25,687
This is what I've chosen - the Mito.

637
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:31,086
At £11,500, it costs exactly the same
as Jeremy's diesel-powered van.

638
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,407
But this is an Alfa Romeo.

639
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:40,045
£11,500 for a brand-new Alfa Romeo.

640
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:45,404
You'd have to have a heart of stone
and a soul of custard
to turn that down.

641
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,803
Then James arrived...
in a dishwasher.

642
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:54,124
This may have the engine
from a dishwasher -

643
00:44:54,124 --> 00:45:01,043
just three cylinders and 1,000cc -
but it is the most futuristic
and modern car here.

644
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:08,681
It's called the Toyota IQ and
it's the biggest leap in small car
design since Dinky went bust.

645
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,639
In order to sort out
which is the best car,

646
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:16,559
we've each been allowed
to choose one test.

647
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,518
I'm going first and I've decided
the first test will be...

648
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:22,879
a drag race...obviously.

649
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,676
I'm not feeling confident
about this,

650
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:35,075
because, although I have the same
power as James has in his Zanussi,

651
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:37,196
the Roomster's a lot bigger
and heavier.

652
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,115
0-60 in 16.4 seconds.

653
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:43,154
And that, in English, is exactly...

654
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:47,353
..one year.

655
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:52,594
Got James!

656
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:54,912
Lost James.

657
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:58,873
He-he-he! Not bad.

658
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:04,791
And we're through. Ha-ha-ha!

659
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:11,829
'Shortly afterwards,
the Indesit finished as well.
And then the waiting began.'

660
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:23,269
50.

661
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,065
51!

662
00:46:44,064 --> 00:46:46,543
And in 1976, we went to Tenby,
hired a cottage.

663
00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:50,062
We went there. A cottage? Yeah. You
must've been posh. We had a tent.

664
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:53,903
Ooh, look! Is that him, or is that
just another car that's going past?

665
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:54,981
I don't know.

666
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:57,583
I've actually forgotten
what his car looks like.

667
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:00,901
Power, power, power, speed -
irrelevant.

668
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,659
What's the excuse going to be?
Ooh, tyre pressure.

669
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,701
You lost,
in case you were wondering.

670
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:10,941
This car -
faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo.

671
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:13,378
Yes, of course(!)
How did you make that out?

672
00:47:13,378 --> 00:47:18,018
Well, if a Porsche is doing 30, I'm
doing 35, I could easily get by.

673
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:21,177
What about if it was doing 93?
That would be against the law.

674
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:23,216
He'd hopefully have
his licence taken away.

675
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:26,058
There's another thing about this.
What?

676
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:28,297
That is pure Lancia Stratos.

677
00:47:28,297 --> 00:47:32,057
No, it isn't. I'll grant you...
What do you mean?! It just isn't.

678
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,775
Says the man in the Indesit!
What...come on! Chaps,

679
00:47:35,775 --> 00:47:40,815
I'll just bring you back to
my point, which is that only one of
these three cars is an Alfa Romeo.

680
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:44,733
The Alfa Romeo, which, if you peel
away the body, is a Fiat Punto.

681
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:48,814
It's an Alfa Romeo!
It's a Fiat Punto with Alfa
written on it! This is a Stratos!

682
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:52,413
'It was then my turn to dream up
a test and, since I had a Toyota,

683
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:56,013
'I thought
we should measure quality.'

684
00:47:56,013 --> 00:47:58,730
Right, each car is equipped
with one of these.

685
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,852
It's a decibel-o-meter. This will
measure how loud your car is

686
00:48:01,852 --> 00:48:04,091
through Lionel Richie's head
in the 1980s.

687
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,132
You'll also be sitting on
one of these -

688
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:08,889
this is a vibration
and harshness-o-meter

689
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:12,889
and this measures vibration
and harshness. Right! Let's do it.

690
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,129
It's got three axes
of measurement...

691
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:17,929
Does it produce a number
at the end of the test? Yes.

692
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,288
Right, good. Good. Let's do it.

693
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:25,647
With the equipment installed,
we set off at a scientific 50mph.

694
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:43,364
This may only have a three-cylinder
diesel engine, but it's so quiet in
here, I can hear my hair growing.

695
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:49,644
Jeremy, it's a noise test and the
machine is picking up your voice.

696
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:54,444
After another run,
we pulled over to see who'd won.

697
00:48:54,444 --> 00:48:56,561
How big is my victory?

698
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:58,003
Not great.

699
00:48:58,003 --> 00:49:00,681
You two are neck-and-neck
at 63 decibels of noise.

700
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:04,240
I have 61. So it's better.
It's quieter?! Yes.

701
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,199
Low numbers are better. Vibration
and harshness, Jeremy - 2.1. Yes!

702
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,640
Let's see. Hammond, 1.8. Ha-ha!

703
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,958
And I'm 1.5.

704
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,998
It doesn't matter,
because it is now time for my test.

705
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:20,598
What we're going to do now
is a lap of the track.

706
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:23,356
The Skoda van's
going to cream that(!)

707
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:25,756
While carrying something. What?

708
00:49:25,756 --> 00:49:30,076
A dog. Let me guess -
is it a King Charles spaniel?

709
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:33,995
In fact, I'd lined up Lance,
an Irish Wolfhound,

710
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:39,114
Milly, a Great Dane and Alfie,
a St Bernard.

711
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:46,192
OK, here's how it works, right?
Start the clock,
then you load the dog into the car,

712
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:50,033
you may have to lower
your rear seats, yes?

713
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:52,192
Do a lap, cross the line,
stop the clock.

714
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:53,713
I'll get my dog then.

715
00:49:53,713 --> 00:49:56,993
There is one rule in my test, yes?

716
00:49:56,993 --> 00:50:01,670
Don't drive like an idiot on the
lap. If, when you get back,
this dog looks sad,

717
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,272
you're disqualified.

718
00:50:03,272 --> 00:50:04,711
OK, Lance, come on.

719
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,189
But St Bernards always look sad.

720
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:09,429
Ready? Go!

721
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:11,829
He's in. Oh.

722
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:13,749
I don't need that.

723
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:18,029
No, flat, flat. I can't get it flat.
I've got to... Lance, mind out, mate.

724
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:21,346
'Rearranging the innards
of the Alfa was tricky.'

725
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:23,626
There are three bits to lift up?
Yeah.

726
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:25,947
Are you in? No.

727
00:50:25,947 --> 00:50:30,585
One minute 32 and the dog
is still not in the car.

728
00:50:30,585 --> 00:50:35,464
Up, up. Up, Lance. Two minutes,
nine seconds.

729
00:50:35,464 --> 00:50:37,823
In you get, in you get.
There you go! Good boy.

730
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:41,825
Oh, that's awkward.
This is quite embarrassing now.

731
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:46,222
'Finally, Phil Drabble
was ready to go.'

732
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,062
Now, there's a racing start...
and there's that.

733
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:55,462
That's it, good boy!
Your breath stinks. It's terrible.

734
00:50:55,462 --> 00:50:58,541
This is a brilliant test.

735
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:01,742
There are eight million dogs
in the UK.

736
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:04,578
23% of all households have a dog.

737
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:06,740
Oh-hoh! Urgh!

738
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,740
A car that can't handle a dog,
frankly, is useless.

739
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,738
Oh, God, it's all right.
You're all right. Oh, good boy.

740
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,098
It's the first Alfa to have Alfa
Romeo's new DNA system.

741
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:22,858
What that means is you get a switch
down here that says DNA.

742
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:29,015
They stand for Normal, Dynamic -
which tightens up and sharpens
the throttle.

743
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:33,457
If you put it in All-weather,
that lets the traction control know
it might get slippy.

744
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:38,333
'But, anxious not to be disqualified
for upsetting the dog,

745
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,333
'I left everything in very normal.'

746
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:47,973
Seven minutes... Yeah. Now,
I happen to know that, actually,
that is a very good time

747
00:51:47,973 --> 00:51:50,732
for an Alfa Romeo Mito
with a wolfhound on board.

748
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,771
Does he look sad? No, I wouldn't
say that's a sad dog.

749
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:56,091
Bored out of his mind.

750
00:51:56,091 --> 00:52:01,370
'Maybe my Great Dane would have
a more exciting time.' Go.

751
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:04,810
Come on, Milly, up, up.
There you go. Look at that!

752
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:09,170
There's a water tray for you.
Oh, it leaks a bit.

753
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,450
£11,500, you can lift
the rear seats out,

754
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,009
or fold them down. All I'm going to
do is pull them forwards,

755
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:19,008
which gives Milly a bit more room.

756
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:23,127
Here we go.
How do you feel now, dog?

757
00:52:23,127 --> 00:52:26,805
Yeah! What do you think of that?

758
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:31,885
What it needs is a substantial snack
halfway round the lap, say a leg...
A head.

759
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:35,324
This, of course,
isn't really a Skoda.

760
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:39,484
Peel away the body and underneath,
at the front,
it's a Volkswagen Polo.

761
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:44,363
At the back, it's a Volkswagen Golf.
The engine is from a Volkswagen.

762
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:47,722
And it's so beautifully made.

763
00:52:47,722 --> 00:52:48,922
Sorry.

764
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:53,361
Now, building up speed -
dogs don't mind speed
in a straight line - they love it!

765
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:57,882
Dr Dolittle's on his way.

766
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:59,721
And...

767
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:03,400
Oh, it's not a lumpy yawn!

768
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,559
Delighted! She's had light, space,
air-conditioning...

769
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,919
slobbered on the car,
she loved it so much.
How do we know that wasn't you?

770
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:13,078
Just tell me the time.

771
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:15,439
Four minutes 13. Oh, God.

772
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:18,755
Three minutes faster than you?!

773
00:53:18,755 --> 00:53:23,396
'But would the Skoda be a match
for the genius of the IQ?'

774
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:28,076
This is one of the most cleverly
packaged small cars in history.

775
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:32,355
It is, in fact, the smallest
four-seat car ever

776
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:37,513
and it's all down to very innovative
stuff, like the fuel tank, which is
very shallow and very long,

777
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:40,075
so it doesn't intrude into
the passenger space.

778
00:53:40,075 --> 00:53:43,554
The engine is the other way round
from other front-wheel drive cars,

779
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,592
so the differential and the
transmission are at the front.

780
00:53:46,592 --> 00:53:49,193
That saves more space down here.

781
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:54,871
I think all this will stand me in
good stead with my enormous dog.

782
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:57,831
Three, two, one...go!

783
00:53:57,831 --> 00:54:02,190
Right.

784
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,588
There's no space at all!
The seats go down.

785
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:08,109
Can you stop
interfering with my time?

786
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:11,109
He can't get in! He can! He can't!

787
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:13,468
He doesn't know whether to get in
or mate with it!

788
00:54:13,468 --> 00:54:16,908
Alfie, come on. Drive like that
and hope he can keep up?

789
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:20,506
Alfie, come on. You can stick
your head out the window.

790
00:54:20,506 --> 00:54:22,267
What are you doing?!
That's no good!

791
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,184
Sit up.

792
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:26,466
Alfie! Good dog.

793
00:54:26,466 --> 00:54:29,867
'Eventually,
James's Hotpoint set off.'

794
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,265
Oh, you've got gob
on the gearstick!

795
00:54:33,943 --> 00:54:37,583
Of course, the IQ is a bit like
a small, city supercar.

796
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,904
The wheels are right on the corners,
it's extremely agile.

797
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:44,423
And it has a really small boot,
like the Bugatti Veyron.

798
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:46,262
Thanks for that.

799
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:50,902
Nobody, unless they have no legs,
could possibly sit in the back.

800
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:53,262
Hold on, there's a bit of a...
Oh, bloody hell!

801
00:54:53,262 --> 00:54:56,741
'In James's hands, the dishwasher
was on a very slow cycle.'

802
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,461
Gambon corner - he could spin off
here at any point.

803
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:06,018
Two dogs, coming across the line
in a Hotpoint. Oh, no!

804
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:07,539
Walkies, walkies.

805
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:10,218
Oh, that is
a miserable-looking dog!

806
00:55:10,218 --> 00:55:14,978
Look at that face! Oh, that's
making me sad just looking at it!
That's his normal face!

807
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,579
You want to hear your time?

808
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:19,457
Six forty-eight...?

809
00:55:19,457 --> 00:55:21,657
You beat an Alfa Romeo.

810
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:26,695
That's the saddest-looking spectacle
I've ever seen and it's your fault.

811
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:32,614
If you're from the RSPCA, write to
us at "James May is a bastard,
Top Gear, London".

812
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:41,414
'With the score at one each,
we left the track and headed out
into the real world.'

813
00:55:41,414 --> 00:55:43,374
The idea's very simple.

814
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:49,333
We shall drive to London to see
which one looks best in the
fashionable streets of Notting Hill.

815
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,490
Well, it'll be mine. It just will.

816
00:55:55,490 --> 00:56:03,370
This is an Alfa Romeo, which
is Latin for "yes, I will, but only
because of your special car".

817
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:10,167
'Meanwhile, I'd unearthed a problem
with this, the cheapest version
of the Roomster.'

818
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,609
This just isn't powerful enough.

819
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:15,568
There's never a gap big enough
for you to pull out

820
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:18,648
and get up to 70 before someone's
caught you up.

821
00:56:18,648 --> 00:56:20,326
Here we go...foot hard down...

822
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:26,846
Sorry, sorry. He's shaking his head
and I don't blame him.

823
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:33,365
'In London, we pulled over
for another real world test.'

824
00:56:33,365 --> 00:56:38,163
OK, we brimmed the tanks down at
the track, so now we're in London,

825
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:41,602
let's see who's used the least fuel.

826
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:46,282
I don't feel all that confident
on this one.

827
00:56:46,282 --> 00:56:47,641
£4.16.

828
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:49,722
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

829
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:55,521
The three-cylinder diesel engine...
Yes? Follow me.

830
00:56:55,521 --> 00:56:58,719
Eh? What?! You have to
mash your foot down

831
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,318
just to do 20mph.

832
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:04,839
And that's the result. You're
better off with a bigger engine.

833
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:11,917
Anyway, listen, I've got an idea.
First one to see another one
of their own cars wins.

834
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:15,675
So, if in Notting Hill,
you see an Alfa Mito...

835
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:16,757
I'll go with that.

836
00:57:17,919 --> 00:57:21,916
'As darkness fell, we began to near
ciabatta central.'

837
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:24,517
Cor, this is posh round here.

838
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:30,756
Richard Branson lives up here
on the right-hand side.
Does he have a Roomster?

839
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:33,394
Nnnnnno.

840
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:37,714
We're about to penetrate
Notting Hill, James.

841
00:57:37,714 --> 00:57:41,994
We'll go round that bend,
it will be awash with brand-new IQs.

842
00:57:43,512 --> 00:57:44,793
'He was wrong.

843
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:47,513
'We all were.'

844
00:57:50,191 --> 00:57:53,670
Fiat 500, Fiat 500...

845
00:57:53,670 --> 00:58:00,350
Fiat 500, Fiat 500...Fiat 500.

846
00:58:11,027 --> 00:58:13,266
Hmm.

847
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:19,388
Now, there's a very good reason
why I chose the Skoda Roomster

848
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:22,986
rather than the Fiat 500
as the best cheap car in Britain.

849
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:27,304
It's because, quite simply,
I forgot about the Fiat.

850
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:35,264
But...what if you want a car
that begins with A?

851
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:41,942
'So, there we are. If you want
a small, cheap, good-looking,
practical car

852
00:58:41,942 --> 00:58:46,623
'that's fast, economical and can
carry a St Bernard, remember...

853
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,381
'we know nothing.'

854
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,259
If we'd have done more minutes
of research...

855
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:05,739
we'd have remembered it.
We are numpties, aren't we?

856
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:08,898
If we did a travel programme,
we'd finish up by saying,

857
00:59:08,898 --> 00:59:11,937
"And there you are, the best place
to go on holiday in Europe

858
00:59:11,937 --> 00:59:14,018
"is Belgium.
Oh, no, we forgot France!"

859
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:18,696
I don't like the Fiat 500. Oh, God.
Or France.

860
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,176
That really isn't a bombshell,
is it?

861
00:59:21,176 --> 00:59:25,295
But, we do have a couple next week,
because these two have a race
with Postman Pat

862
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:29,694
and I declare war on the British
Army! See you then. Take care.
Good night!
