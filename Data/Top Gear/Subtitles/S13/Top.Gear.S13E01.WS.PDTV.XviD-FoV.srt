1
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:44,492
Your applause is very kind  because since we were last here,

2
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:47,120
In order to reflect that doom and despondency,

3
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,232
we obviously had to make some changes in this series.

4
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:53,840
So coming up now, what we have is a- taster of what you can expect,

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:05,324
some of the down-to-earth real-world stuff, over the next seven weeks.

6
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:11,356
Get out of my way, Frenchists!

7
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:16,416
How is that happening?!

8
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:21,948
They're hot for James May right now.

9
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:28,384
What do we want? Aston Martin!

10
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:40,260
Dear God!

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,168
Do you actually do anything to your hair?

12
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,200
Well, I wash it.

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,232
They're turning my car into a colander.

14
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,260
What a pillock.

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,104
Sand!

16
00:01:57,144 --> 00:02:02,232
I mended something!

17
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:08,040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,040
Yeah, we messed that up, yeah...

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,136
Yeah, OK, we got... We got that a bit wrong,

20
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,512
cos basically we drew up a list of all the things

21
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:23,512
we're not supposed to do and then we just did that list of things.

22
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:27,120
Yeah, but why not? We don't to doom and gloom, we do fun and games.

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,572
That's exactly right. So let's get on with this letter, which we have received.

24
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:34,416
It says, &quot;Dear Top Gear, what would- your programme have been like

25
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:38,136
&quot;if you were making it 60 years ago?&quot;

26
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:39,280
Simple.

27
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,448
Exactly the same.

28
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:53,888
You join us in 1949 for a race.

29
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:59,356
It's between the fastest car in the world, the Jaguar XK120,

30
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:03,356
the fastest bike in the world, the Vincent Black Shadow,

31
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:09,056
and this.

32
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:15,448
This Peppercorn A1 Pacific Class steam locomotive is not the fastest train in the world.

33
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,824
But because it was completed only three years ago, weirdly,

34
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:27,448
it is the most modern train working in Britain today.

35
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:30,888
So, the race. We would start at King's Cross in London

36
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,104
and finish 400 miles away

37
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:37,480
at the bar of the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh.

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,792
The train would go on LNER's East Coast line,

39
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:43,696
while the car and bike would go up the Great North Road,

40
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:49,076
because it's 1949 and motorways haven't been invented yet.

41
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:54,668
So all we had to do now was decide who'd go in what.

42
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,544
Is this one of your special hats?

43
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,572
No. Do you wear just this hat and nothing else sometimes?

44
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:03,200
Just pick a piece of paper. Come on, Hammond, you go first. OK.

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,212
That's the label. Oh God, yes. Arseholes.

46
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:11,280
And? I've got...

47
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,932
I've got the bike!

48
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:16,852
There is a God. There is a God!

49
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:19,232
That wouldn't really have worked. No, it wouldn't. Ready?

50
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:22,572
May I?

51
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,684
Aww... What do you mean, &quot;Aww&quot;? I'm on the train.

52
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,668
I wanted to go on the train.

53
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,920
I certainly didn't want to go on the train,

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,696
because the Black Shadow was my boyhood dream bike.

55
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:39,604
I mean, as any biker will tell you, this thing is an icon.

56
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,948
Just as all heavy-metal can trace its roots back to Led Zeppelin,

57
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:46,588
all modern superbikes can trace their roots back to this.

58
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,448
This is Genesis.

59
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,448
It really is that important. It's going to be an honour to ride it.

60
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:55,244
If I'm honest, I'm absolutely chuffed to bits to be going

61
00:04:55,284 --> 00:05:00,620
in the car, especially an XK120, because this is the car that made Jaguar.

62
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,920
When it was launched, it was the fastest car in the world - it did 126!

63
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,512
And yet, it was incredibly good value because it was £1,200,

64
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:12,244
which in today's money, is about 35 grand.

65
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:14,104
So you got a Bugatti Veyron

66
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,808
for the price of a middling 5 Series.

67
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,640
It's magnificent.

68
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,260
As the others drooled, I was in for a shock.

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,368
Hi there, how are you? Hi there, how are you. Nice to see you.

70
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,872
So, is that where I'm driving it?

71
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,056
Unfortunately, no.

72
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,776
You're the other side.

73
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:36,528
You've got the fire.

74
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,120
What, I'm shovelling the coal?

75
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:48,056
'I'd be shovelling a lot of coal -

76
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,760
'eight tonnes of it.'

77
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,840
But even so, at exactly 7.23 and a bit, the race began.

78
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,872
Go!

79
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,640
STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS

80
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,684
I've got to get changed! I'll do that now.

81
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:06,776
IGNITION FIRES

82
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,588
Jesus!

83
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:18,480
Absolute piece of cake.

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,760
Obviously, Hammond has to go and put his leather romper suit on.

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,964
I've had to turn a key and press a button and I'm off.

86
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:31,996
What a great idea the car was.

87
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:34,648
What's the top speed of an A1?

88
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:37,996
75. Is that all?!

89
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:41,244
We're limited to 75.

90
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:45,308
Why don't we do 100? They'll never know. Are there speed cameras?

91
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:48,852
Yes. Yes.

92
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:52,040
Finally, I was in my leathers and ready to go.

93
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,996
However, starting a Vincent is quite-tricky if you're a bit...erm, small.

94
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:06,604
IGNITION SPLUTTERS

95
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:11,776
Listen to that. It's a straight six, beautifully balanced...

96
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:14,668
ENGINE SPLUTTERS

97
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,136
This engine in one form or another remained in production

98
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:23,492
until the mid-80s, that's how good it was.

99
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:28,288
All Vincent Black Shadows came with a bloke in a black leather jacket to start it,

100
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:31,560
rather than just press a button, which is so ordinary.

101
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,184
There's no sense of occasion.

102
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:37,888
ENGINE STARTS

103
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:42,528
At race speed, the train needed 33lbs of coal every mile.

104
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:45,824
Feeding it was a massive job.

105
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:54,668
Oh no, I'm rubbish, I'm worse than rubbish!

106
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:59,888
The fact is that Jeremy Clarkson, on this journey, is a stoker.

107
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:04,336
I should think he'll be dead by the end of the platform.

108
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,212
It's so hot!

109
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,824
So noisy!

110
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,604
If you want to know what it's like in here, get under your stairs

111
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:17,232
at home during an earthquake and spend eight hours

112
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:25,040
looking at your central heating system.

113
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,648
Come on, coming through. Black Shadow coming through...

114
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:32,400
'At last, I was on the move.'

115
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,492
When this thing was born...

116
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:35,744
ENGINE SLOWS

117
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:39,996
Oh no! Oh, oh God.

118
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:48,640
A temporary glitch.

119
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,904
I, meanwhile, was praying for a breakdown.

120
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:55,948
But this was unlikely.

121
00:08:55,988 --> 00:09:03,696
The A1s, in the 1940s, could do 250 miles a day, every day.

122
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:08,684
They can do 150,000 miles between services.

123
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:13,980
They were phenomenally reliable.

124
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:25,464
That's just enough steam to get us about another five miles.

125
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,744
Oh, you BLEEP!

126
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,560
Yeah, yeah, thank you!

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,528
At last, again, I was on the move.

128
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:36,104
OK, a few things to get used to -

129
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:39,640
the gear lever is on the other side of the bike.

130
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,448
So at the moment, every time I wantto break, I'm changing gear instead

131
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:48,512
and if I want to change gear, I'm breaking. It's not ideal.

132
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:52,200
The brakes are the originals and surprisingly good.

133
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,572
The only trouble is they're full of asbestos.

134
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:03,028
Already, viewers, I'm at the beginning of the A1.

135
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,560
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

136
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,324
Everything's lovely in Jagworld.

137
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:13,076
The train, however, was doing even better.

138
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:17,512
Where are we? Just gone through Potters Bar, so the M25.

139
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:21,136
We've been under way 13 minutes and already we're at where the M25

140
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:26,244
would be if it had been built, which it hasn't.

141
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:31,964
Though the train had opened up a big lead, it would need to stop four times on the journey for water.

142
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:35,980
That would take time.

143
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,544
Steam engines. They're beautiful things,

144
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,136
they're romantic, the technology is fascinating,

145
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,808
but they were already 20, 30 years out of date by 1949.

146
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:49,492
It's all doomed.

147
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,308
The car is the future.

148
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,280
People can see it already.

149
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,200
We've got a problem.

150
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,104
We've got a problem! With what? We have a problem.

151
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:06,792
We've got a steam leak somewhere, we don't know where. A leak?

152
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,260
If the car had any problems, they weren't from 1949 -

153
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,040
they were from 2009.

154
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,056
Temporary 40mph speed limit enforced by average speed cameras.

155
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:23,104
No-one working!

156
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:28,200
Finally, on the A1, the Vincent wasunleashed and hunting down the Jag.

157
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,464
I am now straddling my boyhood hero.- No, no, wait. That's not right.

158
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:34,920
Between my legs... No.

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,904
No, my point is, think what this was like 50 years ago!

160
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:43,480
There was everybody else, tootling around in Austins and Fords and God knows whatever

161
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,588
dreary nonsense, and you comeharing along on a 125mph superbike.

162
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:51,588
This was so far beyond anything else.

163
00:11:51,628 --> 00:12:00,008
In fact, the Black Shadow remained the fastest production bike in the world until 1973.

164
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,932
To fix our steam leak, we needed to get to our water stop

165
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,008
in Grantham ahead of schedule.

166
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:08,716
We had to fly and that wasn't going to be easy.

167
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:11,464
You are now climbing to 25 miles.

168
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:12,920
What, climbing?

169
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,808
Yeah, it's uphill for the next 25 miles.

170
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:26,120
Keeping this thing at top speed while going uphill meant the shovelling would be torture.

171
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,640
Black Shadow, coming through.

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,212
Traffic jams. Bad for the Jag, great for the bike.

173
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:41,152
Where are you, May?

174
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:44,288
My legs are like jelly!

175
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:48,716
Eight hours of shovelling and plumbing.

176
00:12:48,756 --> 00:13:01,104
'If the shovelling didn't get me, the back draft of soot in the tunnels would.'

177
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:06,932
Seat's nice, smells nice, view's nice, noise is nice.

178
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,716
Morning, moderners.

179
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:15,604
Meanwhile, far behind...

180
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:19,040
This is what the Black Shadow was built to deal with.

181
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,336
Continual, heavy drizzle. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

182
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,744
I love the bike, it's still my hero.

183
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:31,448
Steve McQueen had one, you know.

184
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:36,416
On the train, my furious shovelling- up the hill had produced results.

185
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:41,648
Here's the deal. We're due into Grantham at 9.07 -

186
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,260
It's actually 9 o'clock on the dot.

187
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,168
We've got to be out of this station- by 9.20.

188
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,152
So we've got 17 minutes to refill it with water.

189
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,008
4,000 gallons?

190
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,528
We need 4,000 gallons. 4,000 gallons.

191
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,980
And fix that pipe. Yes.

192
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,088
And, of course, while we were stationary,

193
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:04,980
the others would be catching up.

194
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,056
Come on. We are in the world's fastest car.

195
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:11,792
Peasant!

196
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:17,308
I still ride bikes because it's a bit naughty.

197
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:20,512
And this, the Vincent Black Shadow,

198
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:23,336
come on, it's the naughtiest of them all.

199
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,888
It is just a comic book character.

200
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:37,400
Raif Montague-Smythe had a deadlysecret. For he was the Black Shadow.

201
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,604
That's funny(!)

202
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:44,920
'As the water flooded in, I took some time to inspect this incredible machine,

203
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,668
'which has been made because no-one ever thought to preserve one of the original Peppercorns.'

204
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,480
Then, one day, someone found the original designs in a skip

205
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,184
in York. £3 million was raised and this is the result.

206
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:04,244
It took them 19 years to build it.

207
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:07,260
19 years.

208
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,152
And every single piece had to be made by hand.

209
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:18,104
I mean, look at this beautiful RSJ.

210
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:22,384
You know, if somebody rang me up and said, &quot;Can you make a spring that goes in there

211
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:28,964
&quot;that's exactly the same as the one- that was fitted in the '40s, by hand, and for next to nothing.&quot;

212
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:44,120
It's an exquisite thing.

213
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,260
And another six hours running.

214
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,760
I tell you what, I'll be fitter when I get there.

215
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
I'm sure you will be. Fitter than I've ever been in my life. Or you'll be dead.

216
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,852
Well, if I do, listen, fling me on the fire.

217
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:56,920
Use me as fuel to beat Hammond and May.

218
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,280
With the water loaded and the leak fixed, I rang James.

219
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,184
May, how you doing?

220
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:06,356
I'm about 30 miles from Grantham.

221
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:10,852
30 miles south of Grantham? James, you're not even in the same century.

222
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,728
You are history, May. You are history.

223
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:15,792
You're in the lead but not for long, mate.

224
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:22,384
Trouble is, I'd have to stop for fuel, only I didn't know when.

225
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:25,920
Now, this is worrying. The owner of this car has told me

226
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,920
that when the petrol gauge reads a quarter full,

227
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,232
it's actually empty and it's going to stop.

228
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:33,760
And I've suddenly noticed that it's taken a bit of a dive

229
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,980
and it's about that much above quarter.

230
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:43,888
At the next service station, I chickened out and pulled in.

231
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:47,824
That's already up to £13, 10 shillings and sixpence.

232
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:50,792
In 1949, you could buy a house for that.

233
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:54,716
'Inflation wasn't my biggest problem, though.'

234
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:59,368
Ha! I do believe I'm now in the lead.

235
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:01,684
Ha-ha, ha-ha!

236
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:05,244
Because the Jag drinks fuel.

237
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:07,184
That was a disaster.

238
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,136
Come on, come on, come on.

239
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:15,288
The game of leapfrog between the car and the bike was now on.

240
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:19,932
But could either of us bring down the mighty Tornado?

241
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,964
250 miles to Edinburgh.

242
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:27,280
We just saw a sign. 250.

243
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:34,436
We've got this one in the bag.

244
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:39,904
APPLAUSE

245
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:42,980
Like I said...

246
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,696
Exactly the same. 1949, exactly the same.

247
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:50,964
Same old, same old. And we shall pick that up later on,

248
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:54,640
but now it is time to do the news.

249
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,824
As we know, to try and shore up the car industry, the Government announced that if you scrap

250
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:05,464
your old Singer Gazelle, you get £2,000 off the price of a new car. Why is it just cars?

251
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,076
What are you suggesting?

252
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:10,260
&quot;Dear Government, I've just found some rancid bacon in my fridge.

253
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,528
&quot;Can I have a big pile of money to buy a shiny new lobster?&quot;

254
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:16,324
Would it work for dogs?

255
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:19,888
Cos when your dog's getting oldand incontinent and you have to...

256
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:23,888
Peter Mandelson's going to come round and put your dog to sleep?

257
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,852
He's not going to put it to sleep, he's going to kill it.

258
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,964
Technically, yeah, that's what it...yeah. Any vets here?

259
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:32,904
Cos, you know... You are a vet?

260
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,948
No, a vet student. A vet student?

261
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,356
Well, be careful because I found out the other day

262
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:40,384
vets have one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

263
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:43,948
And I know why. It's because, when you have children who love animals,

264
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:46,728
they always say, &quot;I want to be a vet when I grow older,&quot; OK?

265
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,948
Then they discover when they become a vet all they do is drive

266
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:54,668
around the countryside all day, executing puppies. That's all you'll do.

267
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,572
So, in fact, according to that theory, the only people who should be

268
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:01,356
allowed to be vets are children who hate animals. Yes.

269
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:05,260
You like animals? You're going to spend your life just boof.

270
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,416
&quot;Here little girl. Is this your puppy?&quot; Boof. There it is.

271
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:13,244
Have you chosen your weapon yet? What are you going to use?

272
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,056
I'd have two in holsters. Yeah!

273
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:19,932
Or a croquet mallet for somebody's tortoise that's not well.

274
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:21,888
LAUGHTER

275
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,588
Sorry. We're going to put her off. Work hard and become a vet.

276
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,852
Just don't kill yourself.

277
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,888
I thought vets had the highest suicide rate

278
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:31,560
because they're the only people allowed to have pistols.

279
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,852
What's pistols got to do with it? Cos it's easier.

280
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:38,260
Than what? I've only got a shotgun and it's quite long.

281
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,792
You know, you've got to get your toe in it.

282
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,904
If you had a pistol, you'd have shot yourself by now?

283
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:45,008
Oh, years ago. Vet!

284
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:49,416
I'm sorry but we have gone off topic slightly. Back to Top Gear.

285
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,184
Can I talk about a car again? Yes, go.

286
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,824
News of a new Skoda. Here it is.

287
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:57,288
A version of the Fabia. They've called it the Scout,

288
00:19:57,328 --> 00:20:00,076
so presumably it comes with a 10p piece, a bit of string in the glove box,

289
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:04,920
and pitches up on your doorstep once- a year to ask for a pound to clean itself.

290
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,416
I suppose every summer it goes off and stays in the countryside

291
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:12,212
somewhere and is touched inappropriately?

292
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,588
No, no, James... No, no, James...

293
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:18,464
That's the Skoda Catholic Church.

294
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:21,056
Now, we've gone off topic again, haven't we? Quite badly, yes.

295
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,088
Now, we have some bad news.

296
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,088
Dacia Sandero?

297
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,620
Not the Dacia Sandero. Worse news.

298
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,464
The Peel P50 is no longer the smallest car in the world.

299
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:36,888
Oh, no(!) How will that affect us all, in any way at all?

300
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:42,184
You know those little kiddy cars that do that in motorway service stations if you put 10p in them?

301
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:46,776
A man has taken one of those, put an engine in it and created this.

302
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:49,244
Wow!

303
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:50,368
LAUGHTER

304
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,200
I presume you mean the one on the right, not the Honda!

305
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,464
Now, the only problem is he hasn't really left enough space in it for him.

306
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:02,152
He's trapped himself,

307
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:03,964
Locked in a tomb! It must be scary driving along,

308
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:09,996
only knowing where you are by things that have gone past. And slightly to the side.

309
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,872
I heard that. I can't even be bothered to look.

310
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,808
I can't even be bothered to look.

311
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:18,776
We didn't say anything about, &quot;Richard Hammond's ideal car.&quot;

312
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:20,560
Who said that? Now somebody back there has.

313
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,260
Big fella here with the tattoos.

314
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,948
Getting off topic, just for a moment. I was driving here this morning

315
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:31,492
and I noticed that my Mercedes said on the dashboard. &quot;Your service is due.&quot;

316
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:37,056
I just thought, how Germanic and boring is that? It's very precise.

317
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,028
Then I was thinking, what's going to happen on the 27th day

318
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:43,212
when, inevitably, I still haven't had it serviced?

319
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:45,280
MOCK GERMAN ACCENT: &quot;Cooler, three veeks.&quot;

320
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,544
LAUGHTER

321
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:53,436
It's funny you should say this, because my little Fiat's overdue for a service.

322
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:54,840
I was driving along and all of a sudden

323
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,648
this picture of a spanner appeared on the dashboard.

324
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:02,184
That's what it's calling you. &quot;You are a spanner.&quot;

325
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:04,288
Is that what it is?

326
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:05,824
So if I continue to ignore it like I am doing,

327
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:10,308
it turns into a picture of the end of a bell or what?

328
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:14,572
A map of Tasmania. A big picture of a male chicken.

329
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:18,684
Now, last of all, I want to mention this.

330
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:23,104
Land Rover has launched a mobile phone which they say is as tough as their vehicles.

331
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:26,604
I've got a picture of it here.

332
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:30,200
There you go. What I want to know is why is it covered in diarrhoea?

333
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,104
LAUGHTER

334
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:35,668
It is. Look at it. That is unquestionably excrement.

335
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,400
Maybe they're trying to say it's tough enough

336
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,168
to survive a trip through your digestive system and still be... Oh, my God.

337
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,572
Look who's digestive system.

338
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:47,792
Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Can we get this on here?

339
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:51,696
It's actually Ranulph Fiennes' diarrhoea. It's been through him.

340
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:54,168
What he's actually saying is, &quot;I was all bunged up

341
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,776
&quot;until the phone came out, and thatwas it, it opened the floodgates.&quot;

342
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:57,948
Look at all this!

343
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:00,028
You can see he's just come back from Nepal.

344
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:03,668
He's in a lake of poo! That explains his pained expression. Look at that.

345
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,572
Oh, dear. Do you think he passed the Land Rover as well?

346
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:11,560
Oh my giddy aunt, he did, he ate his Land Rover. Anyway, that is it.

347
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,684
Let's get a picture of Ranulph Fiennes' excrement off the screen

348
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,288
because I want to move on.

349
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,640
See, the thing is, when you're eight, everybody wants a supercar.

350
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,888
But you can never really afford one- until you are 58,

351
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:27,168
by which time your skeleton is too old and too creaky to get inside.

352
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,920
There has never been a comfortable supercar.

353
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
Bit like a comfortable guided missile.

354
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:39,280
Until now.

355
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,904
This is a new Lotus.

356
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:48,260
It's called the Evora.

357
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,448
While that makes it sound like a ladies dress shop in Harrogate,

358
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:59,212
it presses all the right supercar buttons.

359
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:02,840
The engine is in the middle...

360
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,492
It's low...

361
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:06,356
It's swoopy...

362
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:13,028
and it's as agile as a water boatman in a kettle.

363
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:16,808
Woo-hoo!

364
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:20,008
Ha-ha-ha!

365
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:29,728
What a car!

366
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:34,996
Even by supercar standards, this is fantastic.

367
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:39,492
Properly, properly fantastic.

368
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:43,544
Right, I want to go in that direction, now I want to go in that direction,

369
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:50,184
now I want to go there. This is amazing.

370
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:53,480
This is handling by telepathy.

371
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,184
I'm not steering now, I'm simply using the power of suggestion.

372
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:05,888
There we go...

373
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:08,716
Where this differs from a normal supercar, though,

374
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:12,212
is what happens when you crash.

375
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,464
O-o-oh, no!

376
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:15,560
A-a-argh...

377
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,620
Oh...

378
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:24,448
This is not so bad.

379
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:28,620
This car is so comfortable, that when you crash off the road

380
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,232
and end up in a field full of buttercups, it doesn't really matter.

381
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:36,760
You barely notice. If I were in a Ferrari now, driving off-road,

382
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,948
my skeleton would be disintegrating.

383
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:44,604
My torso, well, it would just become a big bag of mush.

384
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:53,088
But in this, the suspension is absorbing the knocks, not me.

385
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:55,920
Where is the track?

386
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,368
It is extraordinary that a car which is soft enough to do this...

387
00:26:02,408 --> 00:26:08,528
..is hard enough to do this.

388
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,980
It's unbelievably good.

389
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,152
It's the only car I've ever driven,- ever, which is a killer attack dog

390
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:18,888
and an old sofa.

391
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:24,492
That makes it perfect for the Saga-lout.

392
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:37,288
And there's more good news.

393
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:40,980
There are seats in the back for your grandchildren.

394
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,480
Although they'll have to adopt the lotus position to get in.

395
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,980
We have a boot which is big enough for all your cat food requirements,

396
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,872
even if your cat is a tiger. I know what you're thinking now,

397
00:26:50,912 --> 00:26:53,824
you're thinking, &quot;Hang on a minute.

398
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:57,824
&quot;If the seats are here and the boot's here and the front

399
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:01,088
&quot;is all full of mechanical witchcraft,

400
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:03,560
&quot;where have they put the engine?&quot;

401
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,464
Well, I'll tell you.

402
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:11,648
It's about here.

403
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:16,368
The average supercar has a massive V1,000,000 engine that takes up all the space,

404
00:27:16,408 --> 00:27:22,932
but the ladies' dress shop uses a small V6 from the car you used to have -

405
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:26,760
A Toyota Camry.

406
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,696
So it's not the most powerful car in the world

407
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:33,200
and its not, surprisingly, the lightest.

408
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,492
Which means, of course, it isn't the fastest either.

409
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:43,088
0-60 takes 5.1 seconds and you'd need an awful long runway

410
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:51,512
to reach the top speed, which apparently is 163.

411
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:58,696
Talk among yourselves.

412
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:02,260
That's 140 and it's time to brake.

413
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,792
They're good. They're very good.

414
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:13,996
The thing is, though, it's a good engine. It sounds meaty- without being deafening.

415
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:18,184
It's torquey too, and it's very economical.

416
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:22,212
You should get 30 miles to the gallon.

417
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:24,932
There are some drawbacks, though.

418
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:28,212
The interior may be spacious and light but it appears to have been

419
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:37,088
put together by someone who thinks a Porsche is the bit that sticks out from the front of your house.

420
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:42,212
Everything sounds and feels...

421
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:45,416
a bit tinny. And there's more.

422
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:48,384
All you can see in the dials is a reflection of whatever weather

423
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:50,588
happens to be prevailing at the time.

424
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,416
The buttons appear to be the result

425
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:57,356
of some primary school painting competition and the sat nav system

426
00:28:57,396 --> 00:29:00,640
is so un-understandable, I'd simply remove it

427
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,560
and use the space to store my Werther's Originals.

428
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:14,324
As a result of this, some say you're better off spending your £50,000 on a Porsche Coxter instead.

429
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:30,716
Trust me on this one, though - you aren't.

430
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:34,260
APPLAUSE

431
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,336
Nothing like an Elise. It's unbelievable.

432
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,244
Very, very good. But...

433
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:44,200
What? 50 grand.

434
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,904
50,000? £50,000. It's a lot. I admit, 50,000 is a lot,

435
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:55,120
OK, for a car made by turnip farmers out of melted down toilet seats.

436
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,852
But if you compare that to a Ferrari 430, and you can, it's the bargain of the century.

437
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:06,168
Yeah, but it's not as fast as a 430.- No, Ferrari 430 is here. 1.22.9.

438
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:11,008
Now, we put that around earlier today and it did a 1.25.7.

439
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:14,512
But look at that. Oh, we'll ignore that...

440
00:30:14,552 --> 00:30:16,008
Oh, that's awkward. The Exige was quicker.

441
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,840
But it's the same as a five-litre Gallardo Spyder.

442
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,008
A tremendous achievement.

443
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:22,480
But we're not going to show you that lap, because instead,

444
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,840
we've got something much, much more expensive.

445
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,308
Yes we have and here it is.

446
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,668
It's the Ferrari FXX.

447
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:35,212
It's a bit like an Enzo except it has 860 horse power.

448
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:41,744
Even though it costs £1 million, none of the 30 people who have bought one have ever taken delivery.

449
00:30:41,784 --> 00:30:45,668
Seriously, OK, you buy this car and then Ferrari keep it at the factory.

450
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,920
Yeah, they will take it to a race track so you can borrow

451
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,184
your car for the day, then they take it away again.

452
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,448
The point is, OK, since it's here and since we believe it could go very near to the top

453
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,728
of our leader board, we thought that you would prefer to see

454
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:02,980
this do a lap in the hands of our tame racing driver.

455
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,288
Some say that he invented the curtain and that he recently

456
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:14,852
submitted a £20,000 expenses claim for some gravel...

457
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:17,244
for his moat.

458
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:21,544
All we know is, he's called the Stig.

459
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:22,904
And he's off!

460
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:25,492
Lots of wheel-spin off the line but this car has lots of power.

461
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:28,464
Almost as much, in fact, as an F1 car.

462
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,744
First corner comes in fast, as it needs to,

463
00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:35,964
to keep the massive wing-generated down-force. Stig, working hard.

464
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:40,244
No music, thankfully, because the FXX doesn't have a stereo.

465
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:42,244
Just look at the way it glides round Chicago.

466
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:45,980
It's like Batman on a track day. Hammerhead, now. How will it cope?

467
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,212
I'm guessing well.

468
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,744
But look how it reacted to that bump!

469
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,416
I've never seen a car do that before.

470
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:55,480
Is the Stig phased? Hard to tell.

471
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,336
But let's assume not.

472
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,744
Follow Through...surely, even with down-force, the mighty power

473
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,840
of the 6.3 litre V12 means he'll have to lift off.

474
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,640
I don't think he did! I don't think he did!

475
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,280
So, just two corners left.

476
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,904
Here we go. And look now, look at the brake discs glowing red hot.

477
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:16,572
This is like a Formula One car. But with a windscreen wiper.

478
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,368
Just Gambon left.

479
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:21,696
Here he comes. Just flies through there, and across the line.

480
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:26,920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

481
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,668
So the Gumpert, 1.17.1.

482
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,384
Ready?

483
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:38,040
1.17.1 to beat.

484
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,696
The FXX did it 1.10.7!

485
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:46,212
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

486
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:51,200
What?! Blitzed it. Unbelievable, unbelievable!

487
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,436
Staggering!

488
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:55,512
Can we keep the doors closed? Why's the door open?

489
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,448
Who opened the door?

490
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:02,448
You can't come in. It's engaged.

491
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:04,604
Is that the Stig?

492
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:08,544
Why would he come in here? The Stig has come among us. I know what this is.

493
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:11,560
I know exactly what this is.

494
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,088
He was telling me the other day he's been fed up with newspapers,

495
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,776
and I suppose internet geeks as well,

496
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:19,560
speculating that he's a photocopier salesman from Bolton

497
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,212
or that he lives in a pebble-dashed house in Bristol.

498
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,840
There has been a lot of that going on.

499
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,996
So he said, &quot;First programme when we're back on air,

500
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:32,416
&quot;I'll come into the studio and I'll show everyone my head.&quot;

501
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:35,136
He said that? You don't think he's...

502
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:39,572
You think he's actually...? Who here wants to see that? Do you want to see that?

503
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:42,684
CHEERING

504
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,356
They're not that bothered. Who wants to see the Stig's head?!

505
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:47,840
LOUD CHEERING

506
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,728
So, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, the Stig!

507
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,668
CHEERING

508
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,544
He's moving towards us.

509
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,416
He's coming on the stage.

510
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,544
Here he comes.

511
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,872
Stand well back.

512
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:09,356
If you'd just like to take a seat here please.

513
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:17,888
The Stig, everybody!

514
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:23,512
First of all, massive congratulations on that phenomenal Ferrari lap.

515
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:25,604
We've never seen anything like that.

516
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:30,368
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

517
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:34,492
I'm buying time here. Because this obviously is...

518
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:38,184
it's a big moment. My heart's fluttering.

519
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:42,288
If you want to do it, on your head be it.

520
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:46,028
Remove your helmet.

521
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:49,232
He's changed his mind. I knew he would.

522
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:51,840
Go on. Be brave.

523
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,260
Show the ladies and gentlemen that you're not a photocopier's...

524
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,728
AUDIENCE: Off, off, off!

525
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,640
They want to see.

526
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,384
It's coming. Is it Susan Boyle?

527
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:12,512
Is it Susan Boyle?

528
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:15,200
Oh, my God!

529
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,076
Stand up, stand up! Look who it is!

530
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:23,728
The Daily Mail was wrong.

531
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,776
Oh, my God.

532
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:32,776
Oh, you've got a head, ears, you've everything.

533
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:38,668
Have a seat, cos there's so much I want to ask.

534
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,852
Where do we start?

535
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:47,980
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

536
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,308
Honestly, where do we start?

537
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:55,852
First of all, did you really once punch a horse to the ground?

538
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:58,640
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

539
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,492
Well, I did think about it,

540
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:03,368
but I have a wife, she loves horses. I ended up on the ground.

541
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,948
The Stig is married to a horse lover.

542
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:08,244
We've established something.

543
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:12,588
Whatever can I ask? Are you illegal in 17 US states?

544
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:18,416
No, that's much too exaggerated. It's only nine, if I...

545
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,824
Nine, illegal in nine US states.

546
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,464
I just can't believe it.

547
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:24,464
Some people have told us that you only know two facts

548
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:28,980
about ducks and both of them are wrong. Is that true?

549
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,152
Well, obviously they don't fly.

550
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,932
Yeah, they're right, you don't know anything about ducks.

551
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:38,244
I can't believe it. The other thing, of course, I've got to ask you,

552
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,668
before you pulled on the white suit, before you were famous,

553
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:43,076
what's your real name?

554
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:45,492
THEY LAUGH

555
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:53,716
Come on, tell us. What is it? It's too amazing for words, all this.

556
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:57,760
Well, you have to keep up some secrets.

557
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,356
Come on, everyone, who is he?

558
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:01,384
It's Michael Schumacher!

559
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:05,232
THEY CHEER

560
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:09,996
And that's brilliant, because...

561
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:12,808
We've got to ask something about Formula One, while you're here.

562
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:17,356
The question I want to ask first of all is, why is Lewis Hamilton all of a sudden coming last?

563
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:19,604
HE LAUGHS

564
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:22,056
He was winning and now he isn't.

565
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:25,824
Do you know the answer? Well, it is- very difficult, occasionally,

566
00:37:25,864 --> 00:37:27,904
when the car doesn't work out.

567
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:34,840
And it's very obvious. Both of those-silver cars are not doing very well.- No, they don't work at all.

568
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,288
This brings me on to an interesting- point about this year's F1 World Championship.

569
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:42,948
Mainly, a big friend of yours, obviously, Ross Brawn.

570
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,368
Because when he was at Benetton,

571
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:48,480
Benetton won. Then he went to Ferrari, Ferrari won.

572
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,336
And now he's got his own team and Brawn are winning.

573
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:56,356
So I don't want to be impolite with- this question, but was it the car?

574
00:37:56,396 --> 00:38:00,028
THEY LAUGH

575
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,232
Do you know what I mean? It's just,- when he was running the team...

576
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:04,872
You're absolutely right. It is.

577
00:38:04,912 --> 00:38:07,760
The secret is what you do with you guys together.

578
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,088
You're a team and it's always teamwork.

579
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:15,436
If you squeeze out every little bit, that's whereyou're proved better than the others.

580
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:19,888
Is it true you had blood tests taken on yourself, obviously not during the race.

581
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:22,280
It'd be impossible for a doctor to run alongside.

582
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,904
But in the pit stops...? It's true. We did before the race, after the race,

583
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,308
But in the pit stops...? It's true. We did before the race, after the race,

584
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,028
in order to seethe development through a weekend.

585
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:34,008
And then adjust the food and all of your supplements that you may have to take.

586
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:38,280
Cut out the curries. I guess, cut out the curries. Hmm...yeah.

587
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,808
Yeah, exactly. So when you look back, what for you- were the sort of great races?

588
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:47,212
You know, I'm getting old.To remember back, all these races.

589
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:51,076
I remember the Hungary one, when you had to do 25 effective qualifying laps.

590
00:38:51,116 --> 00:38:53,528
That was a great conversation with Ross.

591
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:56,640
Ross coming on the radio saying,&quot;Listen, we are in this trouble now

592
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,136
&quot;and we need, kind of,20 laps in these kind of lap times.&quot;

593
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:04,920
And that sounded like qualifying.I said, OK, let's go, let's try it.

594
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,448
20 qualifying laps, one after the other?

595
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:11,648
I don't know, the combinationof Hungary was a special combination.

596
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:16,888
Track, car, everything just got together and we were able to do those times

597
00:39:16,928 --> 00:39:18,244
and it worked out.

598
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:21,932
But we had many of those great events together in all these years.

599
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:24,200
Are you watching this year or have you sort of...?

600
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,668
No, certainly, I'm watching.

601
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,728
I'm travelling to some of the races.

602
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,996
I see them live. And others on TV.

603
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,572
And are you finding it a bit boring- when one person just endlessly wins?

604
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:37,200
THEY LAUGH

605
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:45,572
APPLAUSE

606
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:49,948
When you were racing, were there any guys out there who you thought,

607
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:54,684
&quot;This guy's pretty damn quick&quot;?

608
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:58,384
Absolutely.I mean, I think my best time I had with Hakkinen, quite honestly.

609
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:02,964
That was a period that I really like looking back to,

610
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:07,168
because we had fighting up, really to the limit,to the maximum. And great situations.

611
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,744
And basically have a beer afterwards without problems.

612
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:15,008
Who was rubbish? Hmm? Who was rubbish?

613
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:17,640
You know, my English isn't so good, so...

614
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,980
THEY LAUGH AND APPLAUD

615
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,920
Who was garbage? That's very good.

616
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,088
Have you got any regrets?

617
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:31,308
When you look back, do you think, &quot;I wish I hadn't done that&quot;?

618
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:34,448
I mean, in life, you always have regrets. You always do certain things

619
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:38,056
that you think afterwards you could have done differently.

620
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:42,480
And I'm sure you have someexamples for me. Yep. Three a minute.

621
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,232
No, it's just, I mean, let's be honest, you have a desire to win.

622
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:49,448
That's my nature, yeah.

623
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm with you on that one. I play my son at chess.

624
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,824
If it looks like he's going to beat me, I wait for him not to be looking and nick his queen.

625
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:58,008
Which is the same as running into Damon.

626
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:00,448
THEY LAUGH

627
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:03,492
You know, it's the sort of... You know what I'm saying.

628
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:08,728
It's that kind of, &quot;I'm not going to let you beat me because I'm just better than you.&quot;

629
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:11,104
Can I just ask finally before we move off Formula One,

630
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:14,088
why did you stop? Because you were still winning at the end.

631
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:18,696
What made you wake up one day and say, &quot;You know, I've had enough of racing in F1&quot;?

632
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:20,948
Well, you know,

633
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,824
curry was so attractive to me.

634
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:26,232
THEY LAUGH

635
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,400
It's very nice, it is. It is.

636
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,368
Nowadays, obviously the Stig duties- keep you busy, what, one day a week, I guess?

637
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:40,852
What do you do in the rest of your time? How do you fill your days?

638
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:45,480
Well, I have several areas that I fill up my time with.

639
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,572
Being, obviously, a Ferrari adviser is one part.

640
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:52,212
And being a Bacardi ambassador for...

641
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:57,088
That's an interesting one. I heard about this. You're an ambassador for Bacardi. Yeah.

642
00:41:57,128 --> 00:42:01,696
A lot of girls here, yeah, a lot of ambassadors for Bacardi. They're nodding.

643
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:04,920
I see lots of potential here. Exactly.

644
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,604
The Breezers will sail through here.

645
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:09,184
Now, I think it's a great job.

646
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:16,200
The thing is though, Bacardi have actually asked us to show a clip, OK, of you and not a drink.

647
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,544
But here it is. This is the clip we've been asked to show.

648
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:27,668
Opera singers.

649
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:31,492
And then there's a man here with mud.

650
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:34,572
THEY SING

651
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:37,668
That's wide.

652
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:42,480
And then you get into another car and then crash into a cone.

653
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,604
There. Now, there we are.

654
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:48,008
Forget me on this, forgive me...

655
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:50,948
APPLAUSE

656
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:54,728
I have, quite literally, no idea what that's all about.

657
00:42:54,768 --> 00:42:57,948
Are they saying don't drive with mud on the window?

658
00:42:57,988 --> 00:42:59,792
Or don't drive with people singing?

659
00:42:59,832 --> 00:43:03,324
I mean, basically, we tried to put out a message,

660
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:06,384
kind of almost the opposite of what you did on the North Pole.

661
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:10,168
Don't drive with James May? I'll support that message.

662
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,324
Leave the gin and tonic, I heard something.

663
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:15,648
Is this a drink-drive...? We weren't driving!

664
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:19,728
We were sailing. It was frozen oceans so we were allowed. So it's a drink-drive thing?

665
00:43:19,768 --> 00:43:22,604
What we're trying to get over is to the young generation,

666
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:26,668
alcohol and driving is not really something that you should mix.

667
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,728
And the campaign is drinking and driving don't mix.

668
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:32,620
I mean, we don't want to stop people from drinking.

669
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,200
I have had lots of fun after racing in whatever championships with my mechanics and engineers.

670
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,620
Who'd like to see some photographs of Michael?

671
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,336
AUDIENCE: Yes!

672
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:49,168
We may have a photograph here of a man who's entirely sober. There we go.

673
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,948
There's another picture I'd like to show.

674
00:43:51,988 --> 00:43:56,356
Who was sick on this man?

675
00:43:56,396 --> 00:44:01,776
And what's that? A fridge. Yes, it's a fridge. You pushed it over.

676
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:04,288
No, it must have been my brother.

677
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:06,696
So here's a clear message, everybody.

678
00:44:06,736 --> 00:44:10,560
Drink responsibly or you'll wind up looking like that.

679
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,324
In a room with a fridge on its side.

680
00:44:14,364 --> 00:44:17,872
Can we just talk about cars if, I may? What are you running now?

681
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,168
I have a nice 500 Fiat.

682
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,948
Is it the Abarth? Yeah. That's a fantastic car.

683
00:44:22,988 --> 00:44:25,492
It is. And you, actually, what do you drive most of the time?

684
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:27,872
Family car, like a Croma.

685
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,336
Fiat Croma? Yeah.

686
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,324
THEY LAUGH

687
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:36,840
That's a fantastic bombshell on which to end this interview.

688
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,996
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Schumacher drives a Fiat Croma.

689
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:42,728
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

690
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,696
So there you are everybody, The Stig!

691
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:51,640
The Stig, everybody! Thank you very much. The Stig.

692
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,288
It was him, always. I can't believe- it. That was just a weekend gag.

693
00:44:57,328 --> 00:45:04,512
Anyway, fantastic, but tonight we are in 1949.

694
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:06,888
Yeah, well, you're always in 1949.

695
00:45:06,928 --> 00:45:10,136
Yeah, whatever. We're in 1949 and we are having a race.

696
00:45:10,176 --> 00:45:14,400
I'm in a Jaguar XK 120, which is the fastest car in the world.

697
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:22,168
Richard Hammond is on the Vincent Black Shadow, which is the fastest motorcycle in the world.

698
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,400
And Jeremy Clarkson is on a steam train.

699
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,464
Yes. Now the start line was here in London and the finish line would be up here in Edinburgh.

700
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:28,760
And we have left the action,

701
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,152
Jeremy was in the lead, just approaching Doncaster.

702
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:38,560
I was in second place and as you would expect, captain slow was bringing up the rear. Steady.

703
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,744
Hoping to take me from behind.

704
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:44,696
Yeah, alright.

705
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:47,260
And then press home his advantage and take Jeremy in the tunnel.

706
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:58,088
Stop saying things like that. You know what I mean.

707
00:45:58,128 --> 00:45:59,948
Come on, come on.

708
00:45:59,988 --> 00:46:02,852
'To try and stay ahead of James, who was being cautious

709
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:05,464
'with his petrol gauge, I was stretching my fuel stops

710
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:08,356
'to the last possible moment.'

711
00:46:08,396 --> 00:46:11,104
Any minute now, this bike is going to start stuttering

712
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,776
and I'm gonna have to pull... There's a lever down here

713
00:46:12,816 --> 00:46:15,448
to switch it to the reserve tank

714
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:23,008
and then I have to really panic about getting some more petrol.

715
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:28,088
This is it! Doncaster, my home town, the home town of the original A1.

716
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:30,232
The home town of the Mallard,

717
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:33,212
the fastest stream train of them all, the Flying Scotsman.

718
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:37,872
The greatest steam train of all.

719
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:41,604
That's my old girlfriend's house.

720
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:44,244
I might have had sex in... or is that it?

721
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:48,604
No, I think that's it there.

722
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:52,244
Here I am. Grim-faced at the wheel of my Jag.

723
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:58,008
Time for some overtaking. Tally Ho.

724
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:01,136
I had no choice but to stop for fuel.

725
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:04,620
As a result, James is going to overtake me.

726
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,212
There's nothing I can do.

727
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:08,336
'And sure enough...'

728
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:11,368
Oh my word, it's Richard Hammond.

729
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:14,760
HE LAUGHS

730
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,888
'Several miles ahead, I too was stationary, taking on more water.'

731
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:23,560
Hammond, where are you? I'm about 30 miles south of Doncaster.

732
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,840
Oh dear. We're in York.

733
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,728
What? Where's James? He's just overtaken me but his Jag is drinking fuel,

734
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,996
so with a bit of luck, he'll have to stop for fuel before I do.

735
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:36,872
Or he'll catch fire?

736
00:47:36,912 --> 00:47:39,120
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT

737
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,384
What's that noise? It's me being told off not use a mobile phone by the man.

738
00:47:43,424 --> 00:47:49,920
Go and tell him it's 1949. So we can't have mobile phones?

739
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,932
Yes! That was wheel spin on a 96-tonne train.

740
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:55,512
That is a steam train, isn't it?

741
00:47:55,552 --> 00:48:02,028
It's not got some nuclear device on board as well?

742
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:10,008
'No. What it had on board was a fresh crew and that meant a fresh set of muscles.'

743
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:15,076
Holy cow. The whole train is now really zigzagging.

744
00:48:15,116 --> 00:48:21,904
I got a tank slapper in a train at 75mph.

745
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:28,996
HIS BIKE CHOKES

746
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:32,168
Three minutes early. We're early.

747
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:35,996
Three minutes? Yeah. You're doing a good job.

748
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:41,244
'James was now in front of me, but my bold fuel strategy would keep me in the game.'

749
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:44,964
OK. Settling into the cruise now.

750
00:48:45,004 --> 00:48:48,512
Looking good and going well.

751
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:54,716
The bike running absolutely like a metronome.

752
00:48:54,756 --> 00:49:01,436
'Meanwhile, on the train, I'd been told I could cook lunch in the world's most fearsome Aga.'

753
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:04,028
Who is on for a bacon sandwich?

754
00:49:04,068 --> 00:49:07,280
'It didn't go well.'

755
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,184
Oh, no!

756
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:11,040
Right up the chimney!

757
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,840
So bacon just flew out of the top of our train? Yeah.

758
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,464
Shove over, you dozy cow.

759
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:23,904
'In a bid to close the gap on the Pacific Class Aga, James had become captain road rage.'

760
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:26,260
Get in the left-hand lane!

761
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,904
I'm trying to beat the train, you imbecile!

762
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:35,696
Yay, look at that. That's good!

763
00:49:35,736 --> 00:49:39,840
'They told me that coal-fired eggs would be delicious.

764
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,588
'They were lying.'

765
00:49:43,628 --> 00:49:48,808
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

766
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:54,668
'Still, could be worse.'

767
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:58,168
Quick summary of the turn my life has taken.

768
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:01,808
I'm 20 miles south, not north, of Doncaster.

769
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:05,104
I'm by the side of the A1.

770
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:09,604
In the rain. The motorcycle is slightly broken.

771
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:11,448
What I did was leave the fuel tap on,

772
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:15,028
the reserve tap on, so the bike pulled a lot of slugs through

773
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:19,996
from the bottom of the fuel tank, clogged up the left-hand carburettor and now has stopped.

774
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:22,648
That's the situation.

775
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:25,728
It is, however, a very manly pursuits, motorcycling, I'm enjoying it.

776
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:28,824
Testosterone surging around my system.

777
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:32,308
Or it could be rain, actually. It's getting in. It's rain.

778
00:50:32,348 --> 00:50:36,168
Surging around my system.

779
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:39,760
'James was overflowing with Top Gear sympathy.'

780
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,280
So, you're fine, but the bike is in bits.

781
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,920
A bit. What a rotten bit of luck.

782
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,716
If you don't mind taking your head and boiling it,

783
00:50:48,756 --> 00:50:50,028
that would be wonderful.

784
00:50:50,068 --> 00:51:03,544
He's had it. It's me and Jezza.

785
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:08,260
'But this crew, with me shovelling,- were a match for anyone.'

786
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,588
Hold tight. It's a little rough through Durham and the cathedral.

787
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:17,824
Durham Cathedral. We're in Durham.

788
00:51:17,864 --> 00:51:23,920
We're doing 75mph through the city centre. Oh, yes.

789
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,744
Don't know if I'm gaining. Keep calm and carry on.

790
00:51:28,784 --> 00:51:31,400
Ah, we're motoring now

791
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,492
Wo-ho!

792
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:39,684
HORN SOUNDS

793
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,448
'Ahead lay our biggest stop.

794
00:51:41,488 --> 00:51:44,640
'Half-an-hour in Newcastle to take on water and more coal.

795
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,008
'But despite this, I was still confident.'

796
00:51:48,048 --> 00:51:52,760
We are so far ahead, it's embarrassing.

797
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,368
'However, there was a surprise in store.'

798
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:01,776
Now Black Shadow rides again!

799
00:52:01,816 --> 00:52:04,544
HE SINGS A THEME TUNE FOR HIMSELF

800
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:08,808
We could just throw in the towel. That's not the Black Shadow's way.

801
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:11,640
HE CACKLES

802
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,728
'Then, as the train slowed for Newcastle,

803
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:16,136
'there was another surprise in store.'

804
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:21,212
Where are you now? We are you? about 20 miles south of Newcastle.

805
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:23,840
20 miles south of Newcastle? Yeah.

806
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,904
You're going to go in the...

807
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:27,648
Only 20 miles?

808
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:31,076
Yeah. I'm gaining on you.

809
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:35,436
The car's only 20 miles south of Newcastle.

810
00:52:35,476 --> 00:52:39,744
Bingo, bingo, here we go.

811
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:42,728
So, we're stationary for 34 minutes? That's correct, yes.

812
00:52:42,768 --> 00:52:48,184
He's going to come past. He's ten miles ahead of us went we set off?

813
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:50,120
We've some work to do, then.

814
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,964
'Still, could be worse.'

815
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,416
This, I think, is still that rain

816
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:58,604
that we had left behind but I got caught up in it again

817
00:52:58,644 --> 00:53:02,620
because I was delayed having to rebuild my carburettor.

818
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,932
As a result, getting quite wet.

819
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:07,776
Very wet. So...

820
00:53:07,816 --> 00:53:11,308
HE SINGS HIS THEME SONG AGAIN

821
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:12,668
It's Saturday morning

822
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:19,056
and the continuing adventures of the Black Shadow continue.

823
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,808
'As I was loading the coal...'

824
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:22,560
PHONE RINGS

825
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,648
Sorry!

826
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:25,308
'..the phone rang.'

827
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:27,324
James, what's happening?

828
00:53:27,364 --> 00:53:30,964
I'm terribly sorry, old chap, but I've just gone past you.

829
00:53:31,004 --> 00:53:33,824
You're in the lead? I am.

830
00:53:33,864 --> 00:53:37,104
Quickly, made millions of coals go in there.

831
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:41,560
Enjoy your time in the lead because it will be short lived.

832
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,588
What an appalling optimist.

833
00:53:44,628 --> 00:53:50,232
114 miles to Edinburgh.

834
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:52,544
Both the train and the car had to do another stop.

835
00:53:52,584 --> 00:53:56,288
And from here on, big chunks of the A1 were single carriageway,

836
00:53:56,328 --> 00:54:00,512
so I wasn't popping the cork just yet.

837
00:54:00,552 --> 00:54:02,852
'However, in this stunning part of the world

838
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:08,416
'and with the sun coming out, I was falling in love with the XK.'

839
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:11,168
I'll be honest. When I first fired the old girl up

840
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,852
I thought well, that's lovely, it's only a matter of time

841
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:17,040
before there is an ignition issue, a carburettor issue,

842
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,324
a bearing issue, but no, it's wonderful.

843
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:24,808
The engine was designed in the evenings during the war,

844
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:27,260
during the blackout, usually.

845
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,792
The body was shaped by the boss of the company.

846
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:32,776
The whole thing was completed in a matter of months.

847
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:36,280
And look at it. I love it.

848
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,512
And I will win.

849
00:54:38,552 --> 00:54:43,416
'Not if we had anything to do with it.'

850
00:54:43,456 --> 00:54:49,288
Come on! Ten miles! Ten miles! That's all we've got to make up.

851
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:54,964
Dual-carriageway. Oh, God, this engine's good.

852
00:54:55,004 --> 00:55:00,620
Come on! Oh, yeah, we are working.

853
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:09,008
Oh, just give me a chance, just a chance. I'm in the fastest car in the world.

854
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:13,744
I'm doing this to beat a car. Why am I doing it?

855
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:16,588
'Still, could be worse.'

856
00:55:16,628 --> 00:55:24,244
HE SHOUTS IN PAIN

857
00:55:24,284 --> 00:55:26,792
Oh, the pain.

858
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:32,904
South of Berwick, it was still neck- and neck. But James had a problem.

859
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:36,356
Come on!

860
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:42,948
Nobody coming out of this thing owns that Fiesta.

861
00:55:42,988 --> 00:55:45,716
This is what happens when you make petrol stations

862
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,384
into supermarkets as well.

863
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:51,288
People spend hours in buying bloody bananas and croissants

864
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:58,920
and other things that you don't need.

865
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,572
Yes, yes, in the car, in the car. Don't worry about the handbag.

866
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:09,996
James's lengthy fuel stop was just what we needed to close the gap.

867
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:12,824
But then...

868
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:18,480
Where's the BLEEP water gone? What? Where's the water gone?

869
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,512
There's no water getting to the boiler?

870
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:23,400
We need to get water in the boiler now.

871
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,964
It's not going to blow up, is it?

872
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:28,920
Not yet. This is a worry, now.

873
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,888
These are supposed to be full of water,

874
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:35,168
but as you can see, there's just a tiny little dribble.

875
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,760
There's water, but nothing's coming out!

876
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,212
If we lose all the water, the fire has to come out.

877
00:56:39,252 --> 00:56:42,888
Otherwise we've got a disaster.

878
00:56:42,928 --> 00:56:45,168
I'm now about 65 miles away from Edinburgh.

879
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:48,076
I can't get hold of Jeremy, he's obviously on the move.

880
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,648
Too much noise for him to hear the phone.

881
00:56:50,688 --> 00:56:53,696
Now try it. Just lever in water.

882
00:56:53,736 --> 00:56:55,620
One of the water injectors that feeds the boiler

883
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,416
had stopped working.

884
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,492
We've got to ease up now,purely because we are losing steam.

885
00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,728
I need to shovel. Sorry?

886
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:13,464
You want me shovelling?No, I need to shovel. I understand.

887
00:57:13,504 --> 00:57:16,464
The speed is right down. The water is right down.

888
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:18,872
He's shovelling madly.

889
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:21,760
And that means only 50mph.

890
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:28,448
Should be 55, 60mph, until we can get it back.

891
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:31,152
Temperature, oil, everything. No, it's fine, it's fine.

892
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:34,308
Everything's fine.

893
00:57:34,348 --> 00:57:38,088
'After several tense moments, relief.'

894
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:41,056
It's coming back. It just came back?

895
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:43,288
Cooled down and came back.

896
00:57:43,328 --> 00:57:46,996
You know how they say steam engines have moods?

897
00:57:47,036 --> 00:57:50,368
It was its time of the month for about ten minutes.

898
00:57:50,408 --> 00:57:58,120
The sea, we're going along the sea.

899
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,436
'This was turning into a great race.

900
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:05,212
'For two of us.'

901
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:06,872
OK.

902
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:08,308
Time to get back on.

903
00:58:08,348 --> 00:58:09,996
My hero. That's a good thing.

904
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:12,448
Um, just past Scott's Corner now.

905
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:17,308
About 150, 160 miles yet to run. I can't feel my right hand at all.

906
00:58:17,348 --> 00:58:19,056
But this, you know, this is,

907
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:24,588
this is a marathon, not a sprint.

908
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:26,620
As we left Berwick for the final charge,

909
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:32,280
the question was, had our injector problem given James back the lead?

910
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,120
Hello. Hey, Clarkson, are you north or south of Berwick?

911
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,184
North. North?

912
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,368
Yes. You're joking.

913
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:44,120
Yeah, but not by much.

914
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,964
How far north of Berwick are you?

915
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:48,212
Less than 10 miles. How far?

916
00:58:48,252 --> 00:58:51,152
Less than 10 miles.

917
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:55,904
17? No, less than 10.

918
00:58:55,944 --> 00:58:57,872
30?

919
00:58:57,912 --> 00:58:59,588
Less than 10!

920
00:58:59,628 --> 00:59:03,492
HE LAUGHS

921
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:09,336
What a cock end, honestly.

922
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:16,744
Come on, Mr Clarkson, get shovelling. What? Keep shovelling! Sorry!

923
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:19,244
Oh, God, the road narrows down to one lane.

924
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:22,716
That's going to slow me down.

925
00:59:22,756 --> 00:59:26,400
Come on! Get more in it!

926
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:34,212
I really want to win.

927
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:36,728
Oh, God above.

928
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:40,308
One of the farm lorries is overtaking the other one on the only dual carriageway bit.

929
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:51,684
You selfish turd!

930
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:52,840
What the hell was that? That's a wheel-spin.

931
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,056
You've got wheel spin at 70mph?

932
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:58,492
At 70mph! Yes!

933
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:02,840
Where the hell's Jezza? I wish I knew.

934
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,648
We are now coming alongside the A1.- It's just here.

935
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:10,512
Where is he? Where is he?

936
01:00:10,552 --> 01:00:16,716
This is as close as it's ever been.- If I see that green monster appear on the right...

937
01:00:16,756 --> 01:00:21,212
20 minutes, not even 20.

938
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:24,528
Edinburgh. 116 miles, that just said.

939
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:28,716
So it's still very much a three-way race.

940
01:00:28,756 --> 01:00:32,280
There can't be more than about seven or eight miles between us.

941
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,076
Oh, God.

942
01:00:34,116 --> 01:00:38,056
We've got a red.

943
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:42,384
No, it's not. It's two yellows, it's two yellows.

944
01:00:42,424 --> 01:00:46,744
What's happening is, we're following a stupid commuter train into Edinburgh.

945
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:48,996
He's stopping at every station.

946
01:00:49,036 --> 01:00:52,512
He's stopping at every station, which is causing us to slow down.

947
01:00:52,552 --> 01:00:58,104
Less than ten miles to go.

948
01:00:58,144 --> 01:01:02,464
We'll ram it. Ram the stopper train.

949
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:05,492
He could have gone past.

950
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:13,416
That's green, green. Go, go, go, go, go!

951
01:01:14,456 --> 01:01:18,200
We need acceleration out of this thing. These lights have really put us behind now.

952
01:01:20,201 --> 01:01:23,201
It is a few  miles following the city-centre signs.

953
01:01:26,202 --> 01:01:30,202
Cole, fire, fire, steam, speed.

954
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:20,588
  Unlike James May, I will only run to television.

955
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:44,589
You have permission to say a cock.  You should not laugh! Jeremy, speak to me

956
01:02:53,756 --> 01:02:57,448
I never want to see another steam  train. Well done, mate, you did

957
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:05,824
very well, because that was man  contact. Have you heard from

958
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:13,825
Hammond? Oh, God! The feeling is  coming back. God, that is worse! It

959
01:03:13,826 --> 01:03:26,826
just hurts! What's that shows is  that even 60 years ago cars were

960
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:31,827
better than trains. That is not  really a bombshell, is it? I know

961
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:37,828
what is a bombshell. You will  probably wondering why Michael

962
01:03:37,996 --> 01:03:50,036
Schumacher never did a lap in the  Suzuki. Well, don't worry, he did.

963
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:58,772
He has stalled! Oh, my God. Michael  Schumacher has stalled. He is off

964
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:03,236
now. That is not good! He is  obviously not used to a manual. Oh,

965
01:04:03,276 --> 01:04:08,644
no, here we go, first corner. That  is not the right line! That is

966
01:04:08,684 --> 01:04:16,864
badly wrong. Look at the way he  holds that rien de as he heads

967
01:04:16,904 --> 01:04:23,520
towards Chicago. He is not going to  make it, he is going off. Oh, no!

968
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:31,488
He got the camera! It is OK! He has  smashed the windscreen. His E-flat

969
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:41,444
have? No, I do not think he is!  Coming up to the tyres. He is going

970
01:04:45,584 --> 01:04:52,744
the wrong way! Going the wrong way!  Here he is, final corner. Michael
