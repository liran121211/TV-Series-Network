Top Gear S13E04

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,440
Tonight, the fastest man in the world on our tracks.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,200
They don't call him Bolt Of Lightning for nothing.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,600
The slowest man in the world falls asleep.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
And we literally set fire to Dorset with a machine gun.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,080
Thank you everybody, thank you.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,040
Thanks very much. Hello.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,720
Hello and welcome.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,040
Now, fast Fords.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,120
What they do is demonstrate that you don't need a plum in your mouth

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,760
and a double-barrelled surname to get on in life.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,200
The RS Capri is Harold Wilson.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,760
The Sierra Cosworth is Bruce Springsteen.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,120
And then of course there is the Escort Cosworth, proof that God wears a donkey jacket.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,120
I love a fast Ford. And now there's a new one.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,320
It's called the Focus RS.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,200
And let's cut straight to the chase.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,680
It costs 25,000 which is family saloon money.

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,400
But its top speed

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,880
is 163 miles an hour.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,120
There's a reason for that insane speed.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,360
A Volvo engine.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,240
It's the same one they used in the Focus ST but now it has new pistons,

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
a new intercooler, a new inlet manifold.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,120
And a new type of turbo.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,160
The result is a front-wheel-drive car that produces 300 horse powers, which is impossible

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
Asking the front wheels of a car to do the normal job of steering while handling let's say more than

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,280
170 brake horse power is like asking a man to wire a plug while juggling...

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,040
penguins,

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,120
while making love to a beautiful woman

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,120
while on fire, on stage, in front of the Queen.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,600
It's all going to go wrong.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
To try and make sure it doesn't, the RS has a new type of

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,640
front differential featuring things that only James May can understand.

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
But does it work?

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,600
So, watch the steering wheel, OK? Hands off.

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,640
Yep, that's torque steer, look.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,560
The power is actually turning the wheel, and violently turning it.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,360
So the diff hasn't fully cured that problem.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,600
But what about cornering?

41
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,040
You can actually feel the whole system working through the wheel. It's odd.

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,240
I have to say though the grip is absolutely phenomenal.

43
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
Look at that.

44
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,680
Eventually of course you will slide wide. But only after your face has come off.

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
This is an amazing car.

46
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,560
And let's not forget, shall we, that without behind the noise...

47
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:04,040
and the power, and the massively flared wheel arches, this is still a Ford Focus.

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,320
It has a big boot, a fold-down rear seat.

49
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,800
Sat nav and air conditioning.

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,160
You might think this is a bit garish.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,400
The sort of car that would turn up to court with its hat on back to front.

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,000
You might think your BMW is better.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,080
But when it comes to offering the maximum amount of fun

54
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,800
with the most amount of practicality for the least amount of money,

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,840
I honestly can't think of anything which even gets close.

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,960
Oh, I can!

57
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,480
This is a Renault Megane R26R.

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,440
It weighs 19 stone less than the standard hot Megane because it has no sound dampening,

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,200
no sat nav, no radio,

60
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,040
and even a titanium exhaust system.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,600
And the result of all of that, this car has just been round the Nurburgring 8 minutes 17 seconds.

62
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,040
No other front-wheel drive car has ever been around faster.

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,240
So if it's fun you're after, forget Jeremy's fat Ford, this is what you want.

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,640
Hammond. Yes, what? Let me ask you a question.

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,040
Yes, go on. How many horse powers do have in your Renault?

66
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,760
227.

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,560
227. So that's 73 less than I have in the Ford. Shall we count them?

68
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,800
One, two, three... Yes, it's got less horse power because it needs less because it's lighter.

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,480
How much does your Ford weigh? 1.4 tons.

70
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,320
About 200 kilos more than this. It's a sports car.

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,880
Power, Hammond, is everything. No it isn't, it's lightness.

72
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Power. No, it's not. It is. It isn't. It is.

73
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,480
It isn't. It is. Well, it is a bit. Do you know what?

74
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,320
We should settle this and there's only one way. Yes.

75
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
A race. A drag race. Yes.

76
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,240
And I'm thinking not just a conventional drag race, let's make it a Le Mans style drag race.

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,640
Come back here. What, where you run to the car? Run to the car.

78
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,480
That car's quite a long way. Run to the car. Belt on, engine on, whoom!

79
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,960
OK? Ready? Aye. Steady.

80
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,840
Yep. Go!

81
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,040
You see, I'm in all ready.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,400
Right, belt on.

83
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,640
I don't have a belt, I have a harness but that's OK.

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,240
No, that's... Oh, God, I'm sitting on it.

85
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
That's not right.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,040
What do think of that? Let's do...

87
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
I won the race, came back to the start line, you haven't even begun.

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
What's the matter? Four-point harness.

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,440
Hammond suggested we had a new race where we started in the cars.

90
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,800
Whoa! Come on!

91
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,760
Oh, he's got a bit of a quick start.

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Lightness versus power. Ha, ha, ha.

93
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,280
Not enough in line, the light weight helped there but now the power comes in.

94
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

95
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,840
I had you up to 120. And then what happened?

96
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
How much does that cost anyway?

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,280
25,000.

98
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,920
There you go, that's 2,000 more than the Renault.

99
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,280
What's this? Ah, yes, that's to save weight, it's thin.

100
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,840
That's not thin. It's lightweight, that's the point.

101
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,480
Look at this. Yeah? It's to keep the weight down low so that the bits high up the car are light.

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,920
It's a polythene bag.

103
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,360
That's to make it... I'd love to know just how much room there is in the back for somebody of my height.

104
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,840
Oh no, it's all full of scaffolding. Yes, and that makes it better through the corners. Better than what?

105
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,720
Better than that thing for a start. Let's have a look in here, shall we?

106
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,280
No radio. You don't want a radio in there, it's about weight. You want to listen to the engine.

107
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Passenger airbag? Who cares about them?

108
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,960
You've got just one airbag. Yes. There's nothing...

109
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,480
Yes, because it's been stripped out.

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,760
Let's look at the opposite end of the scale. The winning...  Let's just have a look.

111
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,800
Stereo, yeah, big unit. And what's this big stick down there?

112
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,520
Just push that. Yeah.

113
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,600
Voice control?

114
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
Voice control.

115
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,240
Put the radio on please?

116
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
No, don't be stupid.

117
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,560
COMPUTER VOICE: Important speech commands for radio are... Oh God!

118
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,720
How does that help you go faster?

119
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,760
Let's just go to the graphic equaliser, shall we?

120
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,240
I don't want any of this on my sports car.

121
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
The thing that gets you...

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,840
What do you mean? None of this has anything to do up with a hot hatch.

123
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,800
No, the whole point of a hot hatch is that it should do everything.

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,080
Yours just does fast, and not very well.

125
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,360
After another hour of bickering, we swapped cars.

126
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,760
And both of us were in for a big surprise.

127
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,480
That's a lot of power.

128
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
God, it's quick on the corners.

129
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,320
Then it all turned into a big race.

130
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,720
It looks like I have myself a big green Ford bearing down.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Every time I catch up on the straight...

132
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, this is better on the braking. And I can turn tighter.

133
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,160
Oh, I'm over steering! Oh no!

134
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,600
Power. Reeling in.

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,160
Ha-ha.

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,840
Soon the film crew realised it would all end in a big crash and tried to stop us.

137
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,600
Please come back in.

138
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,840
What? Having too much fun.

139
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,920
The crew's going mad for some reason.

140
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
What? CREW: Got to do tracking shots. Come on, stop carrying on!

141
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,880
What were you thinking? We've got other shots to do.

142
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,000
It was him. The sun's going down.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I wanted to come in. I actually did say we should go in.

144
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,000
After a whole day's testing we arrived at three conclusions.

145
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,000
One, the Renault is the best to drive on a short blast.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,480
Two, the more powerful more comfortable Ford is better to own on a day-to-day basis.

147
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,040
And three,

148
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,120
if you had your heart set on one of these before the banking crisis came along, don't worry,

149
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,400
because you can now have just as much fun

150
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,640
for a whole lot less.

151
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,480
Fair point. Fair point. Exactly

152
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,360
Craftsmanship. That's good, that's good.

153
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,960
It's a good car.

154
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,840
It is. But obviously as an overall engineering package there is only one choice.

155
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,440
Yes, there is. The Ford.

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,200
I completely agree with absolutely nothing you're saying.

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,520
Tell you what, we will sort this out by finding out which is the fastest round our track.

158
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,800
That of course means handing them over to our tame racing driver.

159
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,080
Some say that he is absolutely baffled by urinals.

160
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,400
And that on reflection this was a bad week to launch his debut single.

161
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
It's a tribute

162
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,240
to Farah Fawcett.

163
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,560
All we know is he's called The Stig.

164
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,280
There we go. Now the Renault is going to be fastest.

165
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,960
Yeah but look, it's straight into the lead. But wait till we get to the first corner.

166
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,840
There we go. It will still be ahead, I knew it. Look at that.

167
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,000
Look at the Renault clinging on like a kitten to your curtains.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Aha, but now what's going to happen? The Focus is still rolling.

169
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,680
Is that music coming from your Renault? No.

170
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,200
No, because it hasn't got a stereo.

171
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
No bagpipe music, how is that a bad thing?

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,880
Look at it roll. The Ford can't stay on the track.

173
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Watch the Ford.

174
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,600
Scuffing its door mirrors as it goes through. Just shut up. What a mess!

175
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,280
Cornering level from the Renault.

176
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,800
Now it's all straight from here on in. 300 horsepower.

177
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,560
There we go.

178
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,000
The cheese-eating surrender monkey is now going to be...

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,120
200 horse power hauling its massive bulk.

180
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,880
Here we go, coming up to the second to last corner.

181
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,800
I admit, yes, the Renault will be good through here.  And the Ford...

182
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
That is superb.

183
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,160
Absolutely magnificent last bit. Exciting.

184
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,480
Across the line!

185
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,200
The Ford did it. Ford first.

186
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,040
The Ford did it in 1 minute 29.3 seconds. There it is.

187
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
A good time, OK, OK.

188
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,840
But the Renault, what did it do?

189
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,880
Oh God, I've forgotten.

190
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,280
No, come on, tell us. It was on the tip of my tongue, I can't remember.

191
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,120
Can I just say if you're watching this on the Sky Plus, welcome. You haven't missed much.

192
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,400
Just a crummy Renault driving around quite slowly.

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,680
Just tell us what the Renault did it in?

194
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,080
1.28.01. 1.28.01!

195
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,080
That's brilliant. A victory for the Renault.

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,640
Doesn't matter.

197
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,040
It doesn't matter. It can't go on the board. What, why?

198
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
It's on slicks. These are slick tyres. They're road legal.

199
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,160
There's no tread on them at all.

200
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,800
They're road legal. They're morally wrong. What?

201
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,840
Morally wrong?

202
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,160
So, you're going to report me to the Church in England now?

203
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,520
Yes, and then you'd be in trouble with the baby Jesus.

204
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,640
For my tyre treads?

205
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,680
And now the news and we begin the news with a new Lamborghini.

206
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:26,160
Here it is. And that has been named after the recently retired chief test driver Valentino Balboni.

207
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,400
I bet they wouldn't have called it after him if he'd been named Ken Shufflebottom.

208
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Their new chief test driver is called Max Venturi. No, he's not.

209
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,280
He is. He is, honestly. That's his real name.

210
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,600
Nobody outside of a comic strip is called Max Venturi, Lamborghini tester.

211
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,680
You don't need a driving licence to be a Lamborghini test driver.

212
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,520
You just turn up for the interview, go, "I'm sorry,

213
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm drunk and mad but I'm called Velociraptor Clint Thrust."

214
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,800
"Right, you start on Monday."

215
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,240
It's a limited edition. They're only don't make 250.

216
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,360
It's 138,000 which is 10,000 less than the regular car.

217
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,080
But that's because this is rear wheel drive. The others are four wheel drives.

218
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,120
But what I really like about it is that stripe. This one? Yeah.

219
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,080
It goes over the seats as well.

220
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,240
Does it? Yes, it carries over the roof and over the seats.

221
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,360
I like that stripe so much I'd be prepared to buy the whole car just to get it.

222
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Can I just offer one word of warning to anyone who's thinking of buying Gallardo? James, for you.

223
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,560
Have you seen this?

224
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,800
That's a burning Gallardo.

225
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
Have you seen this?

226
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,120
That a burning Gallardo.

227
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
Have you seen this? That a burning Gallardo.

228
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,320
I know, but have you seen this? That's a burning Gallardo!

229
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
What about this?

230
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,320
Burning Gallardo. What about this?

231
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,080
That would be a burning Gallardo. That's ridiculous.

232
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,360
So I go into the dealer and I say, "I'd like a Lamborghini, could I have one that's not on fire?"

233
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,040
The thing is, I have to say, this is what makes driving a Lamborghini so exciting.

234
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,720
You drive a normal car and it's not on fire.

235
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,640
Hey, now listen, Goodwood Festival of Speed last weekend as I am sure you know.

236
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,360
This is a celebration of all the great cars or the brilliant cars we have seen over the years.

237
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,080
Renault turned up with this.

238
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,240
I kid you not. Look what it says here on the picture they sent us.

239
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,640
The Renault ZE, that stands for zero emissions, Renault ZE concept wows Goodwood Festival of Speed.

240
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,520
Wrong word, should be "ruins".

241
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,440
What are they talking about?

242
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,080
How many children said, "Dad, can we please go to Goodwood Festival

243
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,240
of Speed cos I really want to see a zero emission Renault van?"

244
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,520
Yes, how many of those kids went back to school the next day, "Did you see the chrome-plated Bugatti?"

245
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,880
"No, but I saw a Renault van with green windows, yeah."

246
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Right, what else have we got?

247
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,560
Right, now Hammond, have you seen this?

248
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
It's for you. Oh, it's a Zonda.

249
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,120
This thing, this is Zonda Cinque.

250
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,160
It's got a new front splitter, new diffuser.

251
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,280
But what they've done is invent a new composite fibre

252
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,920
to make this thing.

253
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,520
The body of it is made, it combines carbon and titanium to make carbotanium.

254
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,440
It's straight out of a comic. And it's made of carbotanium.

255
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,160
Carbotanium. It's a good job they didn't call it titbon!

256
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,080
Anyway, that's got quite a lot of power.

257
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,960
678, 217 miles an hour, 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds.

258
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,880
It's right up your street, Hammond.

259
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,640
Do you know the most impressive statistic about this car?

260
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:34,720
It does 124 miles an hour to zero in 4.3 seconds.

261
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,200
Just in case, let me just time that for you.

262
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,560
So you're doing 124 now.

263
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,440
Brake, 100, 50 and you've stopped now. That's immense.

264
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
124 to... It's just unbelievable.

265
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,720
You would feel that. That could actually quite literally make you sick, decelerating at that rate.

266
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,120
In fact, I did a calculation. That is the equivalent of minus 1.3G.

267
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,400
Your sick would come out really quickly.

268
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,920
All over the dash of your Zonda... Bits of carrot.

269
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,320
And you did a calculation on how quick the sick would come out?  Oddly enough, I have

270
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,840
Your sick, Richard Hammond, if you braked from 125 miles an hour to 0 in that Zonda

271
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,000
would accelerate out of your mouth at 12.9 metres per second squared.

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,080
James! Nobody's bothered. Now, anyone here been to China?

273
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,240
OK, the thing is, when you're there you are often tempted to buy one of those fake watches.

274
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,920
Yes, because you just think, oh yes,

275
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,120
that'll get everybody fooled. Oh, it's stopped.

276
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,200
The thing is there's a Chinese company now called Geely

277
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,560
and they have launched a fake Rolls-Royce. Oh, give over.

278
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,000
Got a picture of it here.

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,920
If there is ever any budget cut on The Apprentice, Alan Sugar could turn up in that,

280
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,400
nobody would be any the wiser. It's identical!

281
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,520
It's almost like they said, what does a Rolls-Royce look like, down the phone.

282
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,480
Mind you, you think the overall shape is bad, you know the Flying Lady on the front.

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,240
We've got the picture here of the one that is actually on Alan Sugar's car. There it is.

284
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,400
Would you like to see the one on the Geely fake?

285
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
Yep. Here it is.

286
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,320
Oh God!

287
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,880
They just made that out of a bit of foil and the top of a cigarette packet and twisted it into shape.

288
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
It's got no head. It's terrible.

289
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,080
Anyway, listen, that is the news. And now we must move on.

290
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,240
One of the questions we are forever being asked is, which is fastest, a car or a letter?

291
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,600
Yeah, it's a very interesting question, so we decided

292
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,880
we would race against Her Majesty's postal service.

293
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,200
Job number one, find ourselves a first class set of wheels.

294
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,320
And this could very well do the job.

295
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,560
Porsche's first ever four-door saloon.

296
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,640
It's called the Panamera and it ought to be good

297
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,560
since it's taken them 61 years to get around to making it.

298
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,200
You said in our last series that this looks like an Austin Maxi.

299
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,480
Yes, I did. I'm not so sure now.

300
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,680
Anyway, more of the car in a minute. First though, our race.

301
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,480
We are currently down here in the Scilly Isles

302
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,040
which is the most south-westerly part of Britain.

303
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,040
And the finishing point is all the way up here in the middle of the very remote Orkneys.

304
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,080
Yes, and in a moment that man is going to pop that letter in the letter box.

305
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Shortly after that, Postman Pat will pick it up.

306
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,920
And then it will be on its way to Zanzibar Bungalow, Birsay, Orkney.

307
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,600
Right, so basically it is our job to defend the honour of the car

308
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,640
against the might of the Royal Mail and everything at its disposal.

309
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,120
So we must get their first because, if we don't,

310
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,680
we are effectively saying, don't buy this Porsche, buy a stamp.

311
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah, I'm inclined get a wriggle on. Go.

312
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,520
I took the wheel for the first leg.

313
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
Load it up. Excuse me. Thank you.

314
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,120
You're driving the next leg.

315
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,920
You've only driven it 200 yards.

316
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,400
As we hit the open sea,

317
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,720
our rival swung into action.

318
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,640
The letter would travel by helicopter to the mainland

319
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,440
and then onwards via four plane journeys to the Orkneys.

320
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,880
Passing through several sorting offices along the way.

321
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,800
Delivery time was before noon the next day.

322
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,520
That must be the helicopter with the letter on it.

323
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Well, we've lost! But I haven't driven the car yet.

324
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,280
In fact by the time we landed in Penzance,

325
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,360
the letter had all ready been on the mainland for an hour and a half

326
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,880
and was now at the sorting office in Truro.

327
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Next stop for us, the ferry at John O'Groats in Scotland.

328
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,120
830 miles, Go, go, go.

329
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,760
Let's see what its overtaking ability is like.

330
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,720
Significant. It goes like a stabbed rat.

331
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:41,240
This particular stabbed rat is the cheapest version with a 4.4 litre 394 horse power V8.

332
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,760
Top speed 176 miles per hour.

333
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,000
Price, just over 72,000.

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
And I know it's got some extras.

335
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah, this one has everything.

336
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,880
It's got leather interior, 3,000.

337
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,200
Wheels, 930 quid.

338
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,680
What, you don't get wheels normally?

339
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,840
Doppelkupplungsgetriebe DPG.

340
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,800
That's the gearbox, yeah.

341
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,840
2,289 quid to you.

342
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,800
Sun roof, 946 quid.

343
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Heated multi-function steering wheel, 700 quid.

344
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,480
And to finish off, ceramic brakes,

345
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,040
5,235 quid.

346
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,040
I've just discovered something so brilliant that you are going to get excited.

347
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,920
There are five dials on the dash.

348
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,440
Yeah. Look at that. Sat nav.

349
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,600
You get the moving map in the dial. Oh, oh!

350
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,520
You're not going to crash doing this? Yes, I am!

351
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,080
It does 0 to 60 in 5.4 seconds.

352
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,480
Slower than an M5 but that is quicker than a Quattroporte.

353
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,720
The Quattroporte is the car it has to beat in my book.

354
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,440
I know it's flawed but it is fantastically charming.

355
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,840
I like that car. The ridiculousness of it. Yeah.

356
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,960
It's wonderful. This is a Porsche, it won't have any ridiculousness.

357
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
No, this is German.

358
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,640
Now, as road testers, we're supposed to approach every new car with an open mind.

359
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,360
Hammond however was struggling.

360
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,760
I'm not sure I want it to be any good.

361
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,320
Are you still one of these people who wants Porsche to only ever make the 911? Yes.

362
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,880
So in Hammond's Britain would everybody who wants to buy a Porsche be forced to buy a 911?

363
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
Yes. You'd walk into the shop and I'd say, "I'd like a Porsche please."

364
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,160
And they'd say, "Certainly sir, what colour would you like?"

365
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,520
You'd allow them to choose the colour? Yeah.

366
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,720
We overtook the letter whilst it was still

367
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,120
bumbling around the sorting office and pressed home our advantage.

368
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,000
But as darkness fell, it was on the move again.

369
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,840
Now heading to Exeter airport.

370
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,120
We knew this because we'd fitted it with a tracking device.

371
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,400
This is like being in a Bond movie.

372
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,960
Location, on the A30, 1.27 miles north west of Longdown.

373
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,000
We are miles ahead. We are miles ahead.

374
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,560
Yeah, we're abeam, almost abeam in Cardiff.

375
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,760
What does abeam mean?

376
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,280
Alongside. Why don't you say close to Cardiff then?

377
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,200
The other good news was that because we weren't in Vietnam or anywhere foreign,

378
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,160
I had control of the catering.

379
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,960
What I'm proposing is this.

380
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,520
A bag of crisps each.

381
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,920
A sickly sugar-riddled drink. And then a Jaffa Cake.

382
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,320
Dinner gave me indigestion as did the news from the computer.

383
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,400
The letter is now at Exeter airport.

384
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,760
Where, after a bit more sorting, it would be shooting on to a plane towards East Midlands airport.

385
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,480
How long do you reckon it would take to fly there, from Exeter to East Midlands airport?

386
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
That's going to be an hour? It can't be more than an hour and a half I wouldn't have thought.

387
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,000
No. Wouldn't it be great if we passed East Midlands airport before it got there?

388
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,520
In fact we've got to. If we don't do that, we're stuffed. Get your toe down.

389
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,560
Progress was good. That is until we hit Birmingham.

390
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,920
Miles and miles and miles and miles.

391
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:31,440
Meanwhile, the Royal Mail army, 160,000 strong with 30,000 vehicles

392
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,360
and planes at its disposal, was now really flexing its muscles.

393
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,760
Nobody at all doing anything whatsoever.

394
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,160
What have you got working on the road? Tiny mice that I can't see?

395
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,880
It's taken off. We are doing 16 miles an hour.

396
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,240
It's probably going 300.

397
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,800
This could cost us the race.

398
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,880
Since we were crawling, we pitted for fuel and a driver change.

399
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,200
And then mercifully the roadworks ended.

400
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,680
This thing covers miles like nothing I've ever been in. I know.

401
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,280
The seats are excellent I have to say.

402
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,200
No complaints whatsoever about the seats.

403
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,040
OK, simplest question.

404
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,320
Does it feel like a Porsche? No.

405
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,400
Thus far I'd agree, no, I don't think it does.

406
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,360
But we have as yet only driven it on motorways and A roads.

407
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,280
Very true. So we can't arrive at a verdict on this car

408
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,320
until we've done the windy bits on the top of Scotland.

409
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,840
Just after midnight the laptop spewed out a mail update.

410
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,320
The letter is at East Midlands airport.

411
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,120
So at the moment we still have the lead because we were further north, just passing Warrington.

412
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,680
We are ahead. Well ahead.

413
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,040
We are, but it's going to get on another aeroplane and then it goes cracking all the way to Scotland.

414
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,800
It's an immense operation. This is a big car.

415
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,080
But it's nothing compared to the scale of the operation against which we have pitched it.

416
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,360
Right now though I had a more immediate problem.

417
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,720
And it was sitting in the passenger seat.

418
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,160
I am going to take your mind off the journey with

419
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,440
some Royal Mail trivia.

420
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,160
Do you absolutely have to?

421
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,560
How many addresses do you think there are in the UK?

422
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,800
That's a fairly easy one. 12.

423
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,400
12 addresses?

424
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
I don't know, do I?

425
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,480
28 million. Why is that an easy one?

426
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,440
Because you know there are roughly 28 million households.

427
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,400
Why would I know that? Because everybody knows that. No they don't.

428
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,520
I don't. How many incidents a year are there of postmen being bitten by dogs?

429
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,280
2,735,000.

430
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,520
No. 5,000. Which monarch...

431
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,280
How many of these do you have?

432
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,560
James managed to bore me all the way up to the Lake District.

433
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,880
But then he was distracted by news from the laptop.

434
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,480
It is effectively overhead.

435
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,760
The letter is now belting ahead.

436
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,400
It's going to be in Edinburgh in no time.

437
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,960
Yes, I would guess within 25 minutes.

438
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,120
How can we possibly win this?

439
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,920
At 1.30 in the morning the roads were clear.

440
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,080
But when the plane touched down in Edinburgh we were still a good 80 miles behind.

441
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,720
It's a big centre. There's a lot of postcodes in there.

442
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,280
But they have got a lot of people working there, I suspect.

443
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,840
They obviously did because just over half an hour later,

444
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,600
while we were still south of Edinburgh,

445
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,480
the letter was in the air again.

446
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,800
It's tracking up to the north of Scotland at a helluva lick.

447
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,280
I'm going to do some more time and distance calculations.

448
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,040
Oh, good(!)

449
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,960
Bless you. Bless you.

450
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,840
Bless you. Bless you.

451
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,640
Bless you.

452
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,600
In the end, the calculation was quite simple.

453
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,320
By the time our letter arrived at RAF Kinloss, it had opened up a crushing lead of 115 miles.

454
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,480
The only good news was that my co-driver had become mercifully quiet.

455
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,760
OK, we've lost. Don't be defeatist.

456
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,560
No. It was not the time to throw in the towel just yet

457
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,520
because the letter had now slowed down as it trundled on the lorry towards Inverness sorting office.

458
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,040
By contrast, we had miles of stunning roads ahead.

459
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,880
Time to see if this thing drove like a Porsche.

460
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,040
We're going for full sport.

461
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,480
Feel that!

462
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,160
It's pelvis-shatteringly quick, this car.

463
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,680
And that's not all. The Panamera has almost perfect

464
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,960
weight distribution.

465
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,720
The lowest centre of gravity of any big saloon

466
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,960
and it's lighter than any rival except the featherweight Jag XJR.

467
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,840
It even has magnesium window frames to keep the lard at bay.

468
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,560
Put all this together and, in the corners, it was a class act.

469
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,880
The only thing I could criticise this thing for, having no sense of drama and theatre about it, it has.

470
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,400
It's bonkers. It's massive.

471
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,240
It does things that a super car does, only it's got four doors.

472
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,280
Are you saying you like it, then? I'm saying I think I prefer it to an M5.

473
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,920
There you go, I'd go for the Mazza. This is very good but it doesn't really move me.

474
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,920
However, because it's so fast, it did put us back in the game.

475
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,840
We've just passed the letter because we've just gone past Inverness.

476
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,680
And the letter is still in the Inverness sorting office. So, we've taken the lead again?

477
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,480
This was the world's biggest game of leapfrog and, as we got closer to John O'Groats,

478
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,080
the letter zoomed overhead, bound for the Orkneys.

479
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,600
This is ridiculous even trying to catch it. Let's try anyway.

480
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,720
Only thing is, it's not going like the clappers anymore.

481
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,000
The bad news is, that means it's landed in St Kirkwall.

482
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,400
It's on Orkney.

483
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,560
We now had less than two hours before the letter got sorted

484
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,880
and postie would be on his rounds, heading for Zanzibar bungalow.

485
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,720
I'm sorry but we've blown it.  He could fall off his bike!

486
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,480
It's arithmetic. I don't want him to fall off his bike.

487
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,320
Obviously that's a terrible thing to happen but if he did, we'd win.

488
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,800
If by some fluke, we beat the letter to Zanzibar cottage our conclusion

489
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:37,280
would have to be - the postal system in Britain is absolutely brilliant everywhere except on the Orkneys.

490
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,760
Or, if you need to post a letter, you could do it the old-fashioned way and by a 39p stamp and let somebody else

491
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:51,400
do it, or spend 90,000 on a Porsche, drive yourself over night, 870 miles, and deliver it by hand.

492
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,600
So it's not cheap.

493
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,560
But it's making sure.

494
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,800
There's the ferry!

495
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,160
The boat journey would take an agonising 45 minutes.

496
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,800
And that wasn't the only bad news.

497
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,080
It says here the signal's been lost. Is that because we're at sea?

498
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,960
It might be. But more importantly I've got a text here

499
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:27,480
saying the tracker has been switched off by the Office, so we don't know where the letter is.

500
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,760
It keeps the tension up. Keeps us going. It means we've lost, doesn't it?

501
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:44,840
By the time we landed it was almost 11 o'clock, so we knew that postie they would be on his rounds.

502
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:52,280
Go, go, go, go! It was us in a V8 Porsche against a man in a Vauxhall Combo van.

503
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,040
This is an annoying time to be stuck behind a lorry.

504
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,240
Extremely.

505
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,280
Do you see any red vans? No.

506
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,200
Can you stop driving like such an arse? It's not going to make any difference.

507
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm driving quickly - that will make a difference in a race.

508
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,520
That was it. It's right up here.

509
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,040
It's half 11.

510
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,760
The stress is killing me.

511
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,720
Right, that's it there.

512
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,040
This is it.

513
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,640
If it's there, it'll be on the mat.

514
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,080
Let's just check inside.

515
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,800
That means we just have to sit here and wait.

516
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,600
There's an envelope.

517
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,480
That's Truro, that's it, we've lost.

518
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,120
Hang on!

519
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,000
What you're saying is, if you want to get something to the top of Scotland, buy a stamp.

520
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,120
Yes.

521
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,080
I have to say, the Queen's head is better looking than this.

522
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,800
Actually, I don't think it's that bad. Hammond! All Porsches are ugly.

523
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
This looks like a mangled ape.

524
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,320
Look at it. It'll grow on you.

525
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,520
When will it grow on me?

526
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,720
N-n-no, it hasn't, and it never will, James, it never will.

527
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,120
So I tell you what we're all going to do now. We're going to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

528
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,760
My guest tonight has got three Olympic gold medals.

529
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,160
And unlike the Stig, he didn't steal them after a full-on fist fight with Sebastian Coe.

530
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,320
Ladies and gentlemen, Usain Bolt!

531
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,360
How are you? OK.

532
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,160
Usain Bolt! Have a seat.

533
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,360
That is an honour. Thank you so much for coming.

534
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,920
Thank you so much.

535
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,040
How many times have you watched your 100-metre gold medal run in China?

536
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,800
Ah, a lot. A lot? Yeah, a lot.

537
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,760
I want to watch it one more time,

538
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,520
so it's going to be a lot and one. Here it is. Let's have a look.

539
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,640
Let's remind ourselves of the moment.

540
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,240
They get away first time. Powell has got a good start.

541
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,760
Here comes Usain Bolt. Usain Bolt streaking away from the field.

542
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,560
It's going to be Usain Bolt for Jamaica. That is superb!

543
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,600
It's a new world record!

544
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,280
He has blown them all away.

545
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,000
Usain Bolt is the Olympic champion!

546
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
How fast was that?

547
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,480
That was 9.69, actually. 9.69 seconds.

548
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,920
What's interesting about that,

549
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,240
and I'm sure people have noticed this,

550
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,040
we've got it in slow motion - just the last bit of it.

551
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,000
As far as I can work out, you're celebrating. It was a world record, wasn't it?

552
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,240
It's a world record and, for the last 10 metres,

553
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,080
you were basically going, "Yeah, what do you think of that?"

554
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,760
In the lead and...

555
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,200
There you go.

556
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,640
You'd just set a world record!

557
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,360
How did you know? How did you know you were so far in the lead you can afford to go...?

558
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,040
The last part of my race is the best part of my race

559
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,280
so after I get to top speed, it is hard to catch me.

560
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,160
Now, there's another thing as well.

561
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,240
We have seen that moment of him slowing down and celebrating.

562
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,400
There's a still photograph that I found of you crossing the line.

563
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,360
Can we just have a look at this?

564
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,160
Just put this up? Watch this.

565
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,200
You set a world record with your shoelace undone.

566
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,560
I don't know what happened there. Well, I do, it just came undone.

567
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,800
It's the speed, it's the speed. And 100 metres, from an early age, wasn't even your speciality?

568
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
No, it wasn't, actually. Mainly the 200 metres

569
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,200
was my speciality, and I do the 400 metres, but I hate the 400 metres. I hate running 400 metres!

570
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,880
I'd hate running to there! What's the matter with the 400 metres? The training is so hard.

571
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
It's really intense.

572
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,560
Because it's a long distance, and you get something called lactic acid, you probably wouldn't know!

573
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,320
He's right! He's right!

574
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,520
Let me tell you something, Bolt - fat men are harder to kidnap.

575
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,760
Actually, what was the last 100 metres you ran?

576
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,920
9.86. 9.86. Cos when I was about 17, I used to do 12 seconds.

577
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm only really 2.3 seconds slower than the fastest man in the world.

578
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,120
That's nothing! I must be, what,

579
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,680
the fifth fastest guy in the world!

580
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,040
I was coming here today and I was looking through a magazine,

581
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,920
and I came across something interesting.

582
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,560
The sexiest men.

583
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,200
100 sexiest men. And you're, like, what, 87?

584
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,920
And you're not looking so sexy! 87?!

585
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,840
87th!

586
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,640
And, in 97th place...

587
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,000
Richard Hammond's not in it!

588
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
But nor are you!

589
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm just... I can't do this.

590
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,560
If I come in there, then there's going to be nobody else

591
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,120
on that page! Can you just give me an idea of

592
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,480
your training regime in order to be able to break world records?

593
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,120
For me, I train, like, six times a week, three hours a day.

594
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,640
Only three? Yeah. Don't let the three hours fool you - it's very intense work!

595
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,040
Forgive me for saying this, but there's a quote, a direct quote

596
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,680
from you. This was, I think, the day of your 100 metres gold medal.

597
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,480
You know what I'm going to say!

598
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,160
It said, "I didn't have breakfast, woke up at 11:00,

599
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,000
"sat around watching TV, then had some chicken nuggets..."

600
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,400
Oh, no, it gets better! "Slept for two hours, then went back and got some more nuggets."

601
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,040
Is that for real? Was that...?

602
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,280
The reason why I did that, actually, was because I didn't trust the food, really.

603
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,960
In China.

604
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,040
I was saying, "I want to make sure I eat something I know."

605
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
So I got nuggets!

606
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,760
I'm sure about nuggets!

607
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,520
OK, your cars.

608
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,280
I've really got to go on to your cars.

609
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,600
First of all, do your management people - I guess you must have them -

610
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,840
do they try to keep you out of fast cars? Yes, they do.

611
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,720
They do? Because you might...?

612
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,240
Crash them or something. So how come you had an M3?

613
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,120
My sponsors, actually, when I won at the Olympics,

614
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,680
my sponsors, Puma, they said, "What do you want?"

615
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,960
And I said an M3, because I really wanted one.

616
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
And they bought it for me.

617
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,640
They bought you an M3? Are they mad?!

618
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,320
And what happened to it? Uh...I write it off!

619
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,040
It was not a pretty sight.

620
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,160
I'm really embarrassed to tell you this -

621
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,600
we've got a photograph.

622
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,080
Who'd like to see the photo?

623
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Yes! Let's have a look.

624
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,760
Has this been rolled? Yeah. Three times, actually.

625
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,960
Were you OK? Yeah!

626
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
I was good. The only problem I had,

627
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,040
when I came out, I was barefoot, and I got sticked by prickles, actually.

628
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,120
Prickles? What, thorns? Yeah. That was the only problem I had, actually!

629
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:43,200
Now, when we discovered you were going to be able to come on, you said you were going to be fast

630
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,400
on our track. Is this just a competitive thing, or do you really think that you're a quick man?

631
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,480
I... I think?!

632
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,560
I proved that I am a quick man, but if I'm the fastest man in the world,

633
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,920
I need to show the people that I am a fast driver also.

634
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,000
Who would like to see Usain's lap?

635
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,240
Let's have a look!

636
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,760
Run the tape.

637
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,080
'It's a nice start.'

638
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,760
Focus! Eyes on the prize, let's go!

639
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,600
'That's nice and aggressive. I am liking the first corner.

640
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,960
'Yes, tidy!'

641
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,080
Think Michael Schumacher!

642
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,120
'Michael Schumacher wouldn't do this! Well, he didn't do this - he got lost.'

643
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,000
They don't call me Bolt of Lightning for nothing!

644
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,600
'Hammerhead - obviously, you've got to concentrate here.

645
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,120
'Did you do much training for this? No. Nah.'

646
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,760
This car sucks!

647
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,880
'Here we go.

648
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,880
'I presume you were flat through there.'

649
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,040
I love you, come on. I love you!

650
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,080
'Yes!'

651
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,200
Just keeping doing it that way, keep doing that for me. Keep doing it that way.

652
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,440
'That's... I am loving that, that's fantastic!

653
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,680
'And this one...

654
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,760
'Nearly got the back wheel off the ground! That's impressive! And there we are!'

655
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm wondering, will you be the fastest Jamaican we've ever had?

656
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,840
I'm guessing you will be! Where do you think?

657
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,800
Well, I've got the time here.

658
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,240
He's leaning forwards, look!

659
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,920
What you're supposed to do now is this - "Hell, I'm not bothered!"

660
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,920
But you are! Yeah!

661
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,400
Usain Bolt, you did it...

662
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,800
What are we looking at up at the top there? Anything faster than 1:48 is obviously quite good. You did it...

663
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,720
..1 minute...

664
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,800
..46.5.

665
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,920
You are very near the top!

666
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,080
Well done, mate. Now... A-ha...

667
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,400
The thing is, how much do you weigh?

668
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,480
In pounds I weigh 210.

669
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,040
210lb? Now, the power - the weight, rather - makes a huge difference in that car.

670
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,560
That's why Lawrence Dallaglio, a rugby player, he was hugely quick,

671
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,240
but he did a 1:47.4 because he weighs about 17 stone.

672
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,480
The Stig tells me, if you'd have been a little man,

673
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,160
Jay Kay-sized, Simon Cowell, you would have been right at the top.

674
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,000
It's only the weight that's getting you down.

675
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,240
Get yourself on a diet...!

676
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,440
We'd love to have you back. Ladies and gentlemen, Usain Bolt!

677
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,200
Now, as I'm sure you all know, the popular playground game British Bulldogs

678
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,200
has been banned in most schools because people in safety glasses say it's too dangerous.

679
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,600
But, children, what if you were to play it with cars?

680
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,920
Yep. Specifically, could you get five miles from one side of a tank-proving ground in Dorset

681
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,920
to the other while a team from the British Army tries to stop you?

682
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,960
'This is the playing field we'd selected.

683
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,920
'And this is the car I'd be using.

684
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:44,840
'An eight-year-old 8,000 Mitsubishi Evo VII which had been modified by a previous owner.

685
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,640
'On the downside, he'd removed the airbag.

686
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,000
'But on the upside, he'd uprated the suspension, toughened the brakes

687
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,840
'and fitted variable boost control to the engine.'

688
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,800
I've got the boost turned all the way up,

689
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,080
so it's producing 500 brake horsepower. 500!

690
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,960
Top speed is the same as before, it's limited to 155.

691
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,240
But it now does

692
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,720
nought to 60 in 3.2 seconds. 3.2!

693
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,620
Of course, because it was born in the world of

694
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,740
rallying and has four-wheel drive, it can do this kind of speed

695
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,300
whether it's on Tarmac, ice, snow, gravel,

696
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,620
or, indeed, the scrubland of Dorset.

697
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,900
Here, it just comes alive. Turn it,

698
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,060
feel the back end step out! Plant the power!

699
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,580
It's telepathically brilliant.

700
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,980
'But then it would need to be, because I was going up against this lot.'

701
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,220
I thought they'd just have a load of crummy Land Rovers that would

702
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,620
fall over every time they went round a corner.

703
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,660
'Nevertheless, I was still feeling confident.'

704
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,060
Do you know what an Evo is?

705
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,580
Yes. Car, white. Good on the roads.

706
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,500
But you're going to struggle round here!

707
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,540
Rally tyres. Have you seen ours?

708
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,660
It's 500 horsepower, this thing.

709
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,700
Have you got 500 horsepower?

710
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,460
1500. 1500? I have pencil sharpeners with more than that.

711
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,900
When you've bottomed out in that hole over there... Yeah?

712
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,060
..and your car's in bits,

713
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,780
then we'll see who's laughing.

714
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,340
I love your enthusiasm.

715
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,300
I like hope. Hope propels a man. Keep that hope

716
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,780
until you find me at the finish line, the other side, having made it. We'll see.

717
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,740
'The spearhead of their miserable and pointless attack would be the Jackal.

718
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,540
'Designed in a shed in Devon and now used by even

719
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:13,460
'the American special forces, it has a 5.9 litre diesel engine.

720
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,220
'So it will do 90 miles an hour...

721
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,740
'..everywhere.

722
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:26,500
'It's clever, too. The petrol tank is covered in a skin that forms a new layer over bullet holes.

723
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:32,500
'And the undersides are designed to deflect explosions away from the people on top.'

724
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:41,180
The idea is that this fast, nimble, go-up-anything vehicle will herd me towards this, the Mastiff,

725
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:47,260
which apparently is designed not to look frightening in a war designed to win hearts and minds.

726
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:52,780
Whatever. And then, waiting to pounce will be this... which is a Fiat van.

727
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,980
'The Panther. Even though it's built by the same company that makes the Panda,

728
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,940
'it costs just shy of half a million pounds.'

729
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:09,220
The reason why it's so expensive is that it does come with an awful lot of warning stickers.

730
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,980
'And a television.'

731
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,700
Look at this!

732
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,180
Full 360-degree traverse. Accurate to at least 1,000 metres.

733
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,700
I've got to get one of these for my car!

734
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,860
Look at that! That's something you won't be seeing, it would just be, "Boom!" A blur.

735
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,940
Anyway, thanks, chaps. No problem.

736
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,820
Best of luck with your ice-cream van with a gun on it.

737
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,500
'This is what scares me the most.

738
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,740
'It's called the Trojan, and because it's part tank, part bulldozer,

739
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,740
'it's the king of wherever it damn well wants to go.

740
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:55,860
Now, you're probably thinking this is all very jolly, but how are they actually going to bring me down?

741
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,380
Strong words? Rude gestures? This is Top Gear -

742
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,700
we don't mess about. They're going to be using their guns.

743
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,740
And they won't be firing blanks either. As a measure of my confidence,

744
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,180
the ammunition they're loading is live.

745
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,860
Right, active diff on...gravel.

746
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,420
I've just found a packet of these in the centre console!

747
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:34,380
So the previous owner, he liked to be safe in bed, but he disconnected his airbag!

748
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,180
I hope I haven't been ambitious with this live-fire thing.

749
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,620
I promised my wife we'd go out for dinner, and that'll be difficult if I'm full of holes.

750
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,140
Here we go!

751
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:59,660
'Right. Five miles to the finish, and I needed to build up an early lead.'

752
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,380
Oh, sh...!

753
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,140
That was close.

754
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,260
There's the reminder I'm not going fast enough!

755
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,940
Doing 70 miles an hour, and that damn thing is right up my trumpet!

756
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,900
'But then the Evo girded its loins.'

757
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,220
Oh, there's the turbo boost!

758
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,220
Live with this!

759
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,380
The good thing is, at this speed, he can't fire his gun.

760
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,980
Not without shooting every rambler in Dorset.

761
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,820
This is just fantastic.

762
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,700
Condom man may be a bit peculiar,

763
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,780
but God, he knew how to set up a car!

764
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,700
That is a big lead now.

765
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,540
Come on, come on, come on.

766
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,900
Oh, my God.

767
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:06,300
How am I going to get over that? Hide, hide. When in doubt, go into sleep mode.

768
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,380
There's one there.

769
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,020
They can't see me!

770
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,780
It looks like they've got themselves a Titan.

771
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,620
Basically, a Challenger tank with the turret removed and the machine on top.

772
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:29,500
It can span a 24-metre gorge in 90 seconds.

773
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:34,740
So he's building that so they can get from one side of the playing field to the other.

774
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,340
So he won't be expecting this.

775
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,380
Here we go! It's a beautiful bridge!

776
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,940
Go, go, go!

777
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,580
'I was now halfway to the finish.

778
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,140
'But they were back on my tail.'

779
00:54:53,140 --> 00:55:00,420
This is a much more exciting way of playing British Bulldogs. Oh, my God!

780
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:08,180
'And on this rough part of the playing field, I couldn't use the boost to pull away.'

781
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,020
I'm being herded! I'm being herded by a Jackal!

782
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,980
That's a bad noise!

783
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:22,460
Through the trees, hide. The trees are bulletproof, in my mind.

784
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,860
He's up there! He's got the high ground!

785
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,140
Oh, God, help!

786
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,900
Right, time to go.

787
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,100
'Lady Luck then put a minefield between me and them.'

788
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,660
One zero now in position, out.

789
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,780
What are they doing?

790
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,900
'They were sending in the Trojan to clear the mines.'

791
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,500
It just goes straight through!

792
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,700
You see that Jag there? It's the last person to play British Bulldogs with the Army. Poor car.

793
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,740
Run away, run away!

794
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,420
I'm starting to think I might not win this.

795
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,340
Now, wait, wait.

796
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,820
This is perfect. I'm coming up behind the Trojan.

797
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,540
Oh!

798
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,020
What I'm doing now is genius.

799
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,820
I'm using the Trojan as a shield.

800
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:04,740
And even if they do see me, there's nothing they can do about it because the gun is on the other side.

801
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:11,660
What's that noise? What are you doing? What are you doing?!

802
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,020
Stop it, you're spoiling it!

803
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,300
'Eventually, he did put me down, but the car was a wreck.

804
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,980
'And that, it seemed, was that.'

805
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,660
Woah, woah. Hold on.

806
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:46,660
You lost. That's because I was up against this lot and a 60-ton tank. You were up against a letter.

807
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,860
Can I just ask about the car? Yeah.

808
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,300
It was ruined. Yes, it was, but there's a very good reason for that.

809
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,780
You see, the thing is, that car used to belong to a drug dealer.

810
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,340
And the judge who banged him up said his car had to be destroyed, OK?

811
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,980
And I thought, rather than let the police put it in a crusher,

812
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,060
why don't I give it a heroic fighting chance?

813
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,780
So the bloke who used to own that car... Yeah, condom man. Yeah, him.

814
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:20,100
He was watching that, probably in his prison cell, on the telly, thinking, "That's my car!"

815
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,700
Yep. And it gets worse. How can it get worse?

816
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,220
Because it was only damaged.

817
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,580
There's one and a half miles still to go.

818
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,980
The game's still on!

819
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:41,780
Not brilliant, if I'm honest. Quite dusty, a lot of pollen. A lot of pollen.

820
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,980
Come on! Now I'm no longer bulletproof!

821
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,500
Come on, come on!

822
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,740
Charlie, Charlie, one plus, to your front, white Evo,

823
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,940
600 metres, rapid fire.

824
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,100
They're shooting again! They're shooting hard now!

825
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:27,460
I'm taking hits! I'm taking a lot of hits!

826
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,900
Oh, my God.

827
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,300
Stop shooting! Stop it!

828
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,620
'But they wouldn't.

829
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,260
'And soon, they'd taken out the engine and the on-board camera.'

830
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,860
You've set fire to Dorset with your tracers!

831
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,420
Stop it!

832
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,980
'Then their tracer round set fire to the car as well.'

833
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,860
We'll call it a draw!

834
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,540
'They seemed happy with that.

835
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,500
'Unlike, I suspect, the man whose car it, er, was.'

836
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,820
You really weren't joking. These are real bullets.

837
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,460
Oh, yeah. Hundreds of them. I said it was live fire.

838
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,060
And they all missed you! Yes!

839
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,300
Is this a 50 cal exit wound here? Where? Here.

840
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,540
Oh, yes. That one - we've worked it out - it went in here, OK?

841
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,140
It went through the chassis, through the petrol tank - I'm not joking -

842
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:46,740
it went out there, then it went all the way across Dorset, Devon, Cornwall,

843
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,820
and do you remember that postbox in the Scilly Isles?

844
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,380
It actually hit that. You know the 50 cal?

845
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,100
This is the air-conditioning matrix we rescued from the burning wreck.

846
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,620
This is a normal bullet hole.

847
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,020
That is a 50 cal bullet hole.

848
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,900
Do you know what? What? I find this a little bit depressing.

849
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,660
Because it was the bloke who dealt drugs - it wasn't his car, was it?

850
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:12,340
I know what you mean. But it is going to catch on. I'm afraid next week we are

851
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,860
going to find a benefit cheat and fling his microwave off Beachy Head.

852
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,780
Yeah. We are the enforcers! We are!

853
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,860
And on that bombshell, it's time to end. Goodnight, see you soon!
