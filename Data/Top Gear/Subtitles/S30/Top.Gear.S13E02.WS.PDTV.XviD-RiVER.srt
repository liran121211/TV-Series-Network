00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,984
Now, every year 50,000 17-year-olds

2
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:48,985
past their driven test and have to by a car.

3
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:52,332
And because they're 17, the car they want
is sporty and cool and preferably turbo charged.

4
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:57,700
Trouble is, their parents want them- to have
something that is slow, cheap and safe.

5
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,920
And the insurance companies would rather they didn't have anything at all.

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,028
So, to sort all this out, the producers gave us each a typical budget of £2,500,

7
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:07,516
told us to pretend we were 17-year-olds

8
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:11,120
and then go out there and buy cars that would please us as 17-year-olds,

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,312
our parents and the man from the Pru.

10
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:18,436
This is genuine, genuine consumer advice. Well, mostly.

11
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:22,328
Sort of. At first. LAUGHTER

12
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,684
There are any number of cars on offer these days

13
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:26,684
for that kind of budget -

14
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:31,168
even this 1997 BMW 7 Series.

15
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,932
Great car, ABS, air bag, so it's safe in a crash.

16
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:40,388
Parents will love it for this reason. And kids'll love it cos, well, it's cool.

17
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:43,652
'Back at the Top Gear office, and pretending to be 17...'

'..I set about sorting the Bimmer's insurance.'

20
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,560
How much?!

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,516
7,000 what? Pounds?!

22
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,420
I've been very sensible here. Look at this. I've found a Suzuki Liana,

23
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,732
which is small, sturdy, safe... Yeah.

24
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:04,388
£1,300... Yeah. Gives me £1,200 to spend. What, on insurance? Yep.

25
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:07,528
That won't be enough. £1,200, I guarantee it won't be enough.

26
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,312

James May. No, Adam Smith, sorry.

36
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:44,608
£2,500 is 15 times more than the car is worth.

37
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:53,140
No, but what you're saying is I'm going to write it off completely 15 times a year.

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,732
Premiums for 17-year-old girls are half what they are for 17-year-old boys. Seriously

39
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:00,640
Premiums for 17-year-old girls are half what they are for 17-year-old boys. Seriously

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,360
Half the money. Well, there's a Top Gear top tip right there.

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,484
If you're a 17-year-old boy and you need car insurance, slice your penis off.

42
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:08,080
I would have done. I did.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,452

44
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,968

45
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:14,656

Not on this one. not on this one. So, you turn up at the school, here's my turbo.

104
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:41,972

109
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:06,864
With my budget of £0, I'd fitted a girl-enticing water bed in the back.

112

and shag-pile carpet, which is more a sort of a bath mat.

We will pick that up later on. Can I just point out that before we do move on,

192
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,292
if you do decide to put yourself on your parents' insurance, and you have a crash,

193
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:13,264
and the insurance company find out that it was really your car...

194
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,248
Which they will if it's got a body kit on.

195
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:17,640
Even half a body kit. Whatever!

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,968
The point is if the insurance company find out it WAS your car,

197
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,168
they won't pay out.

198
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,296
Then they can prosecute you and you might have to go to jail.

199
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:29,012
And then one day, you'll be in the showers and a big, strange man...

LAUGHTER

203
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:43,216
While filming that, it was amazing - it brought back that excitement of first learning to drive

204
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:48,420
when we were 17 and the driving test and passing it - well, not passing it in your case...

205
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,516
What do you do on a driving test if you don't pass it? You...

206
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:55,408
I failed, all right! I failed first time. Yes, I did.

207
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:58,216
Failure. Why did you fail?

208
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,856
A traffic light went red as I came up to it and the examiner said, &quot;Proceed as you normally would,&quot;

209
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,408
so I gave it a bootful. LAUGHTER

210
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,888
I failed.

211
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:09,344
Presumably, you passed first time? No. I failed. Really?!

212
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,048
You failed?! What, you got lost?

213
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:14,108
We were going along and all of a sudden, he hit the dashboard

214
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:17,672
and he said, &quot;Look out, there's a small child in the road!&quot;

215
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:20,828
and I said, &quot;No, there isn't,&quot; and kept going.

216
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,720
Cos there wasn't. So you were just being pedantic?

217
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,768
No, I was being correct. He was anticipating an emergency stop, not an argument, you fool! Was he?

218
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,784
Yeah, that's it. Actually... What? While we're on the subject,

219
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:36,800
at the other end of the scale from our failure, you turned up with some scissors in your pocket,

220
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,204
ready to cut your L-plates off the car.

221
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:42,080
True. It's optimistic. I didn't see it as a driving test,

222
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,128
so much as a confirmation of my excellence.

223
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,984
LAUGHTER

224
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:49,268
That's really what it was. When he said, the man,

225
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:52,676
whatever he was - the instructor...- Examiner. ..examiner - when he said,

226
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,720
&quot;Congratulations, Mr Clarkson, you've passed,&quot;

227
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,092
what I heard was, &quot;Congratulations,- Mr Clarkson, you are the best driver I've ever seen in my life.&quot;

228
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,408
You can imagine my surprise 36 hours later to find myself in a field,

229
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:11,284
surrounded by sheep that were no longer alive and bits of what used to be my mum's Audi.

230
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:15,784
&quot;How did this happen?! I'm the best driver in the world and I've gone and stuffed it!&quot;

231
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:19,860
Right, can we now do the news? Last week, we were talking about the Government's scrappage scheme,

232
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,888
which is important and we got distracted

233
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:28,096
by talking about playing croquet with tortoises. Dead tortoises.

234
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:32,284
We mustn't do that again, because the scrappage scheme genuinely is important.

235
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:37,548
To prop up the car industry, the Government is encouraging you to scrap old cars and buy new ones.

236
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,360
The trouble is that the cars people- are buying are Korean,

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,268
which means the Government is using our money

238
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:48,768
to help Kim Jong-il buy nuclear weapons.

239
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:52,532
That's the wrong bit of Korea. Don't be so pedantic!

240
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:56,316
It's hardly pedantic, Jeremy. One is a free market economy making- a harmless hatchback

241
00:14:56,356 --> 00:15:01,472
the other is a totalitarian regime,- allegedly making weapons of mass destruction.

242
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:06,328
When a nuclear bomb drops on your house, don't come crying to me about your distinctions.

243
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:09,880
Why would the South Koreans nuke Hammersmith?

244
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,720
They use American guidance systems?

245
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,656
LAUGHTER

246
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:17,532
We're going off-topic again! Can we get back?! Yes. Get back to the scrappage scheme.

247
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:21,396
This is an important point. It is more ecological - and this is a fact,

248
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:25,552
the Green Party agree with us ONLY on this point -

249
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,960
it's more ecological to keep an old car going

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,928
than it is to scrap it, throw it away and build a new one. True fact.

251
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:37,736
If you've got an old car - we really are on-topic here -

252
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,928
if you've got an old car, it has to be serviced by someone.

253
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:43,300
That someone is going to be under an arch at the end of your road,

254
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,756
and not Kim Jong-il. LAUGHTER

255
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:49,456
Now, you know the Ariel Atom? Yes. You drove one last year. Yes. When you stepped out of it,

256
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,408
did you think, &quot;Bit slow&quot;? No, I didn't.

257
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:56,944
Everyone had said it's superbike fast and I thought, &quot;Oh, come on, don't be ridic...argh!&quot;

258
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:01,928
It's insanely fast. That one had a supercharged 4-cylinder Honda engine out of a Civic, yes? Yes.

259
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:06,272
They've now come up with this, which has a supercharged V8 engine.

260
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:09,176
They're saying it's got more than 500 horsepower

261
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:11,800
and the car weighs less than half a tonne.

262
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,224
So that is more than 1,000 horsepower per tonne.

263
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:21,144
That's just staggering. A Bugatti Veyron, to put that in perspective,- is 521bhp per tonne,

264
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:24,816
so it's nearly twice as powerful. It'll be too fast to see.

265
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:30,144
It'll be there, then not there. There'll be a thin film of what was- the clutch on the road.

266
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:33,456
It's £100,000, but I don't believe cars can get better than that.

267
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:37,408
What if you're an antique dealer? That'll be limiting for... It's not.

268
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,756
That's what this is on the back for.

269
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:44,488
You strap wardrobes, chests of drawers on there and... They've thought about it. See?

270
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:48,612
You know Vauxhall? Yes. Canadian company now.

271
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:51,960
Vauxhall has done a supercharged version of the VXR8.

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,504
Here it is - it's called the Bathurst.

273
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:59,352
That makes the worst noise... What?! It makes the best noise!

274
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:04,848
The supercharger, that screech! It's brilliant. The mechanical whine... It's deafening!

275
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:08,708
It's like driving along - what's that opera singer called - Katherine...er...Jenkins!

276
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:14,008
It's like her having what DH Lawrence would've called a &quot;crisis&quot;.

277
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,400
A what? A crisis.

278
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,084
Lady Chatterley, goes in the barn with the gardener, in the hay,

279
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:22,632
some things happen, then she has a &quot;crisis&quot;. Oh!

280
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:26,476
A crisis...yes. That's what it sounds like, a constant Victorian crisis.

281
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:31,024
That's my point, it's a brilliant noise. The supercharger whine is a mechanical driving sound.

282
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:34,288
That does make other brilliant noises. No, the best noise

283
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:39,680
made by any car is my Mercedes - which is now only 19 days away from- its first service,

284
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,692
so the cooler will be mine in 19 days, right -

285
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:49,304
but that, between about 2,750 and 3,500 revs on three-quarter throttle,

286
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,196
that is the best noise in the world.

287
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,632
I thought... What?

288
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:58,276
..the best noise that had ever come- out of a car came out of the stereo- in my 17-year-old Golf

289
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,692
until you two touched it inappropriately.

290
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:03,744
LAUGHTER

291
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,052
Actually, while we're on the subject of this,

292
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:06,320
last week, James did talk about touching people inappropriately

293
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:16,772
and the Daily Star, in an editorial, says that we've upset the Scouts and the Catholic Church

294
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:20,196
and that we can add those two august organisations

295
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:24,088
to other people we've offended, including lorry drivers, Scots, Malaysians,

296
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:28,664
Germans, blind people, anti-hunt protesters and smokers.

297
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:35,040
I'm sorry, but this sort of gutter press claptrap gets so far up my nose.

298
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,288
How dare they? How dare they suggest that we would be rude to smokers?!!

299
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,916
LAUGHTER

300
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,040
That is the end of the news.

301
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,040
Now, at this point, Jeremy usually rushes off to drive a car very quickly around our track.

302
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,996
This week, it was my turn

303
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:56,072
and I thought, &quot;Why just do it at the track?&quot;

304
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:57,696
WIND HOWLS

305
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:06,960
HOOFBEATS

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,336
Arabia. Visitors here get all misty-eyed about camp fires

307
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,808
in the sands of time, and you can see why.

308
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:19,432
But the truth is, the place is shot- through with a love of speed...

309
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:24,716
'..which means it's the perfect place to go for a run in this -

310
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:31,824
'the brand-new Lamborghini Murcielago.'

311
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:35,276
Over there is downtown Abu Dhabi.

312
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:39,448
Between me and it is a four-mile, arrow-straight stretch of highway.

313
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,760
ENGINE REVS

314
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,792
And...it's closed.

315
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:47,696
How lucky is that?

316
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:52,288
TYRES SQUEAL

317
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:57,356
Oh, what a noise!

318
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,384
140.

319
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,792
150.

320
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:05,200
160.

321
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,104
170mph.

322
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:14,528
Whoa!

323
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:23,336
Whoa. You've just met the Lamborghini Murcielago LP670-4 SV,

324
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:29,088
or, to put it in plain English... the fastest Lamborghini ever made.

325
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:33,212
'It's also the last Murcielago that'll ever be made,

326
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:38,872
'because a brand-new replacement is coming next year.

327
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:43,716
'But rest assured that the old one won't be going quietly,

328
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:51,232
'because from every angle, this last hurrah looks absolutely evil.'

329
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,104
GROWLING

330
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:55,920
I mean, just look at that exhaust.

331
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:07,668
If a Toyota Prius came up behind and saw that, it would wet its pants.

332
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:12,932
'So, LP670-4 SV.'

333
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:19,640
The SV stands for Sport Veloce, something they've tagged their hardcore models since the Miura.

334
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,480
The &quot;4&quot; is the 4-wheel drive.

335
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,280
The LP stands for...something.

336
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,292
The 670 is the horsepower, which is 30 more than the last one

337
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:35,528
and also, quite a lot.

338
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:40,904
'And whilst they've added power, they've also been busy stripping away weight.'

339
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:44,248
It's 100kg lighter than the standard car.

340
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:48,904
It's got a lighter exhaust system, more of it's made of carbon fibre

341
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:54,888
and it does all add up, because the results are astonishing.

342
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:58,728
0-60, 3.2 seconds.

343
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:02,684
Top speed, 212mph.

344
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:07,420
'They've also taken away the radio,- but that's fine by me.'

345
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,888
Because that noise...

346
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:15,280
That glorious noise!

347
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,156
This V12 has basically been around since the Miura

348
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:21,828
and it too will die along with this car.

349
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:24,952
And it is just as if it's howling,

350
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:32,248
&quot;You'll miss me when I'm gone!&quot;

351
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:38,624
'And I'm not the only one who thinks this car has a human soul.'

352
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,748
All car-makers release official info with every new car

353
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:44,748
and, usually, this stuff is pretty dry.

354
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:48,000
Here's Mercedes talking about the exhaust on the SL Black.

355
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,968
They say, &quot;The new design reduces exhaust gas backpressure.

356
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:54,624
&quot;The acoustic side effect of this is to produce

357
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,688
&quot;a distinctive 12-cylinder sound from the two trapezoidal tailpipes.&quot;

358
00:22:57,728 --> 00:23:03,216
By contrast, here's Lamborghini's latest info. They say that this exhaust, in this car,

359
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,968
makes a sound that ranges from, &quot;the heavy rumble of a stormy night,

360
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:13,408
&quot;through the trumpeting of mighty elephants, to the roar of a raging lion.&quot;

361
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:23,048
You just get the sense that before this car dies, they actually wanted- to make it come to life.

362
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:26,344
They've certainly done that.

363
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:30,528
It isn't just a lighter, faster Murcielago - the weight loss

364
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:35,484
has transformed it into a completely different car.

365
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:38,732
The steering is just so sharp,

366
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:41,640
the brakes so effective.

367
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,064
Don't get me wrong, it's still a big, scary car,

368
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:50,608
but it's so light and nimble on its feet. Sand!

369
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:56,220
Yeah, this'd be a lot easier if the desert would stay still.

370
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,204
'The price for this outrageous curtain-call?

371
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:03,640
'£270,000.'

372
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,144
Actually, that's quite cheap.

373
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:08,688
It is!

374
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:14,828
'Because I think this thing can run- not just with mere supercars...

375
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:21,736
'..but with the more rarefied and expensive hypercars.'

376
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,688
There it is!

377
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:31,188
That's an SLR 722 - like an SLR, only more.

378
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:35,268
That is hypercar royalty, right there.

379
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:38,608
'So, since we still have the roads to ourselves,

380
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:41,892
'let's see if the 722 can keep its royal status

381
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:44,424
'in a race between the lights.'

382
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:49,892
I think it's got what it takes. Let's find out.

This is it! Come on, little Lambo!

Ah-ha-ha!

387
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,172
Try that on, fella.

388
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,800
160.

389
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,960
170 through the centre of Abu Dhabi. Hello!

390
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,924
Ohhh!

391
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:16,552
He's ahead but only just!

392
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:19,016
Man, this is close!

393
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:25,832
It's close!

394
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:28,348
Red light!

395
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:32,144
Whoa! Braking up to the red light quite hard.

396
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:33,736
RICHARD LAUGHS

397
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:37,424
That is a truly ridiculous game.

398
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,924
It was unbelievably close.

399
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:43,680
I was there, alongside hypercar royalty. Compared to that,

400
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,552
this is a snotty little ragamuffin.

401
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,612
And that's a hundred grand more than this.

402
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:52,424
Quite a swan song.

403
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,736
'Yep, in its dying moments,

404
00:25:54,776 --> 00:26:04,272
'the Murcielago has become one of the all-time supercar greats.'

00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:08,488
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

406
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:17,568
There's some evidence on these seats that you had a crisis.

407
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:18,988
But it's magnificent.

408
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:20,240
It's such a...

409
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,488
It's such a pantomime car and the best thing is,

410
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:24,144
underneath the exterior there is a serious actor trying to get out.

411
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:25,912
It can really do the job.

412
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:30,048
Thing is though, you've always said- that your favourite supercar is the Zonda F, OK?

413
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,048
So, which would you choose?

414
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh, no that's cru...that's...uh.

415
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,836
Come on. That's like asking me to choose between my children.

416
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,144
Come on!

417
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:40,488
No, the only way to sort this out

418
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:43,552
is to see how fast this is round the track.

419
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:45,332
Speaking of which...

420
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:49,992
Last week a man came here claiming to be The Stig.

421
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:51,304
LAUGHTER

422
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,476
You may have seen it, OK?

423
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:54,040
Now, maybe he is, we don't know.

424
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,348
OK, maybe he is.

425
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:59,992
But what we do know is that he set a time of 1 minute 10 seconds in a Ferrari FXX round the track -

426
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,020
top of our leader board.

427
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,428
We subsequently discovered he was doing that on slick tyres.

428
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:08,612
Now, we have rules on this Power Board here, OK.

429
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:12,804
You can't use slicks, so this time is coming off.

430
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,864
What? BOOING

431
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:18,068
Oh, boo?! LAUGHTER

432
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:20,272
This is a dictatorship.

433
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:21,992
If you want to live in a democracy,- go to Iran.

434
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:23,616
LAUGHTER

435
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,084
I have to work with that, week in week out.

436
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:28,176
It's now time to find out how fast this is round our track

437
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:31,100
which means we must hand it over to our tame racing driver.

438
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,272
Now some say that last week

439
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:35,600
he was found in a locked room tied to a chair

440
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,992
with German piano wire...

441
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,272
LAUGHTER

442
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:47,384
..And that this week, MPs turned him down for the job of Speaker.

443
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:54,804
All we know is that's three things he has in common with Margaret Beckett.

444
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,584
And he's off!

445
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,256
Another similarity is, of course, very thin hair.

446
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:03,412
Right, coming up to the first corner and he's coming in very hot.

447
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:05,208
I had a go in this Lambo earlier,

448
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,276
found a surprising amount of understeer.

449
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:12,692
Stig seems to have it all under control at the moment though.

450
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,488
Oh, good, no music again this week,

451
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:18,428
because, as Richard said, the lightweight SV has no stereo

452
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:22,488
but why would you want one with that V12 concerto behind you?

453
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:26,460
Hammerhead. This is where understeer should rear its head.

454
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,848
Look, at that, Stig neutralising it with 661 horses of fury!

455
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:34,916
Brilliant driving!

456
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:36,840
And the third thing, obviously,

457
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,804
is a love of caravan holidays in the Dordogne.

458
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,288
OK, there he is through the Follow Through.

459
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:44,432
Stig says this car can be flighty

460
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,556
so that's probably why he's lifted off through the tyres.

461
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:50,448
That is incredible. OK, just two corners left.

462
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:55,352
You can see Stiggy's little, possibly German paws working hard there.

463
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:57,588
Spit of flame on the overrun,

464
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:00,132
this car really is Widow Twankey with a wing.

465
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,448
APPLAUSE

466
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:06,180
Great lap but where does it go?

467
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,384
Hammond, you have the time. I have the time.

468
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:10,200
OK. Here we go.

469
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,508
It did it in...

470
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:14,400
1.19 dead!

471
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,088
It has graduated up from supercar to hypercar.

472
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:21,884
It's as fast as an Enzo! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

473
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:23,040
It's moved up.

474
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,616
That's...

475
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,976
JEREMY CLEARS HIS THROAT Mind you...

476
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,840
Zonda F.

477
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,792
Yes, well, I guess we've got to let the board decide.

478
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,120
It doesn't lie, the F's faster.

479
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,288
So that's the one you'd choose still?

480
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,212
Yes! OK, now...

481
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:41,056
it is time to put a star in our reasonably-priced car.

482
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:43,900
My guest tonight, he's just done everything really.

483
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,744
He's the voice of the Harry Potter audiotapes, Blackadder,

484
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:51,808
he's recently driven a taxi all the way around America.

485
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:55,648
Started out in life, his career, with a &quot;Laurie&quot; so, in fact,

486
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:58,416
the only thing we can be sure he hasn't done,

487
00:29:58,456 --> 00:30:00,384
is murder a prostitute.

488
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,040
LAUGHTER

489
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,920
Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Fry!

490
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

491
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,604
Thank you for coming back, have a seat.

492
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,696
Hello, everybody. Hello.

493
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:14,776
Wow.

494
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:17,400
Where's the rest of you? Oh, gosh, well...

495
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,168
I've never seen anything like it. Oh, you are kind.

496
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,808
What you're really saying is

497
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:24,932
you've never seen anything like itbefore when I was so grotesquely fat.

498
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:27,572
You were a sizeable chap and now you are a rake.

499
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:28,948
Oh, thank you.

500
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:30,168
How much have you lost?

501
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,888
Nearly six stone.

502
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,232
Yeah, gasp. Thank you.

503
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:39,008
APPLAUSE

504
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,932
How?

505
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,336
I started by walking a lot just every morning.

506
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:45,212
LAUGHTER No, you're pulling that face,

507
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:50,368
but walking is made magnificent by audio books.

508
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:53,776
Just list all the books that you'venever read that you wanted to read.

509
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:57,076
For example, I've just had Tim Robbins in my ear

510
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,088
reading The Great Gatsby.

511
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:02,120
It is about the supreme experience you can have.

512
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,904
And you eat up the miles. Do you do your books in audio-book form?

513
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,572
I have no idea. You would know, you'd remember.

514
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,044
I've never read them out.

515
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,776
Right. I mean you are the mo...

516
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:14,448
I wonder if there is a single household in Britain

517
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:16,888
that doesn't go to sleep at night

518
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:20,184
without the sound of you wafting out of the children's bedrooms.

519
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:22,076
Is it just me or is it every child goes...?

520
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,480
I had a man shout at me,

521
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,512
&quot;My children go to bed with you.&quot;

522
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,808
LAUGHTER

523
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:31,340
It staggers me, you've managed to lose all this weight

524
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,652
even though recently you spent how many months in America?

525
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:38,088
Oh, yes - about eight or nine months- all told.

526
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:41,572
You did a lot of driving, the whole- thing in your London taxi. Yeah.

527
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:44,088
Nobody loses weight in America.

528
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,404
You're right and that's what brought me to it.

529
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:49,904
I finished the American thing last year

530
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:54,984
and by about a month or twoafterwards I was at my full 21 stone.

531
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:57,000
It's life on the road, the freeways

532
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,700
and those truck stops and places just...

533
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,060
You visited Detroit in your...

534
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,776
I did. I actually went to the General Motors Headquarters

535
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:09,684
and was taken round in a brand-new Cadillac by the designer.

536
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:11,876
This was only about six months before

537
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:14,480
General Motors was basically bankrupt.

538
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,236
Yeah. And he said, &quot;We're still the biggest automobile company in the world.&quot;

539
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:23,156
He said, &quot;All my life has led up to this, I've designed my own Cadillac.&quot;

540
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:27,592
He grew up in a family who... His father worked in Ford.

541
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:31,000
And when he went to college to do automotive design

542
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,388
and he told his father he'd got a job,

543
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:36,748
his father said, &quot;That's great, son.&quot; He said, &quot;..At GM.&quot;

544
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,968
And his father didn't talk to him for two weeks.

545
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:41,372
If he'd tried that in Australia! Oh, yes!

546
00:32:41,412 --> 00:32:44,048
In Australia they have pitched battles between fans of...

547
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:48,844
Can you imagine here someone with a Vectra beating a Mondeo owner to death

548
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,236
with a bat? LAUGHTER

549
00:32:50,276 --> 00:32:51,608
They're like that over there.

550
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,264
Yeah.

551
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,000
I've got to move on to this.

552
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,168
Because you are a big fan of Twitter.

553
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,080
Yes.

554
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,780
I was reading it the other day

555
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,440
when you said you'd got from Norwich to London

556
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,108
in a time that was impossible if you hadn't driven in bus lanes.

557
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:08,248
Yes, all right. I didn't say that.

558
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:11,528
I didn't say it was impossible if I hadn't driven in bus lanes,

559
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:14,124
others said, &quot;You must have used bus lanes.&quot;

560
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,204
It is illegal for me to drive in bus lanes.

561
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,856
Even though you drive a taxi?

562
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,560
I do drive a London taxi.

563
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,764
Do you think, &quot;I'm not going to go in that bus lane&quot;?

564
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:23,516
LAUGHTER

565
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:25,968
I...sometimes...

566
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:28,856
You read that thing, it says from seven till something.

567
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:30,752
&quot;Oh, well, that must be now.&quot;

568
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:33,360
LAUGHTER My favourite as you drive down here,

569
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,372
you'll see it on your way home,

570
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:37,624
in Guildford it said there's a bus lane.

571
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:40,968
And it says, &quot;Buses and good vehicles only&quot;.

572
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:43,576
It says &quot;goods&quot; but in my mind, I just think,

573
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:46,408
&quot;This a Mercedes. It's a good car.&quot;

574
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:49,528
I can be at the track hours faster than everybody else.

575
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,528
It's like ones that say, &quot;access only&quot;.

576
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:55,248
I want access through this!LAUGHTER

577
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:56,688
Going back to Twitter, I'm fascinated

578
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,720
you find the time to do that. Everything you do

579
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,784
you tell, half a million people are now following you.

580
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:04,452
Yes, it's become rather a large number.

581
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:07,424
When it started it was a few thousand and it's grown and grown

582
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,112
and now everybody knows about it.

583
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,144
I don't Twitter, obviously,

584
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:11,784
but the thing we do share is a love

585
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:14,608
of a specific type of mobile telephone.

586
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:18,548
Yes, we stroke it, we love it, it has applications that are astonishing.

587
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:21,000
OK, this application business -

588
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,956
I've only recently been introduced to it.

589
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:25,472
You told me about the one

590
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:27,676
where you can play it as a reco... Have you got that?

591
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:29,036
Yeah, oh yes, it's the...

592
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:35,924
Ocarina's the one where you actually blow on it.

593
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:37,160
And what's that other one?

594
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,908
This one might not be quite so upyour strata but it's called Grindr.

595
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:41,736
And this... AUDIENCE MEMBER LAUGHS

596
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:43,328
Hello!

597
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:44,268
LAUGHTER

598
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:45,284
Over there.

599
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,936
Who here knows what Grindr is, hands up.

600
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:50,128
No-one's going to now. Who made that noise?

601
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,984
Somebody must be next to the man that went &quot;Huh-uh-uh!&quot;

602
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:53,984
It's...

603
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,000
What is Grindr?

604
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,488
It's basically a gay-cruising application.

605
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,080
LAUGHTER

606
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,676
When you load it...

607
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:02,940
Get this, when you load it,

608
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,656
up appear all kinds of faces and pictures

609
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:09,488
and what's so amusing is, you press them and it goes like,

610
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:11,812
&quot;Hi, I'm Mike, hello...&quot;

611
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:14,564
and it tells you how close they are.- It says he's 20 yards away.

612
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:17,328
No! Yeah! You can find the nearest,- cruising homosexual with that.

613
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:18,396
LAUGHTER

614
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:20,736
Yeah.

615
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:22,768
Is there one...? Come on!

616
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:24,688
Let's have a look.

617
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:26,736
Who here...? Come on, Stephen, there must be one in here.

618
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,532
I have to turn it on.

619
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,580
Talk amongst yourselves for a moment.

620
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,676
Anybody who's got Grindr turn it on.

621
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,568
Let's see if anybody's got it.

622
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:37,628
Just making sure mine isn't on. LAUGHTER

623
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,644
I've got to get one of these. Imagine in traffic jams?

624
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:42,768
LAUGHTER

625
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,300
Here we are. Here's some...

626
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,328
These are all homosexuals then? Yes.

627
00:35:46,368 --> 00:35:47,688
LAUGHTER

628
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,396
You see... He's nine miles away, I'm afraid.

629
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:52,532
Where is he nine miles away?

630
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:55,064
We can drive there, I've got my Merc, we can get there in a jiffy!

631
00:35:55,104 --> 00:35:58,224
There's no-one near enough. There's nobody in this room?!

632
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:00,724
Some of them show rude parts which you won't want to see.

633
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:02,488
Bloody hell! JEREMY LAUGHS

634
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:08,284
Now...

635
00:36:08,324 --> 00:36:11,160
It's a car show, I knew there was something.

636
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,680
And of course you came down here to do a lap.

637
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,440
Did you do it in your taxi?

638
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,068
No, I drove in the reasonably-priced car.

639
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:20,912
Am I allowed to reveal the truth? It's rather embarrassing,

640
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:23,440
I drove in two reasonably-priced cars because the first one,

641
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,288
I won't say I totalled it but...LAUGHTER

642
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:30,632
I...I gave it a few bangs and it started dripping oil

643
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:34,320
and we obviously thought that was not safe to have.

644
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,428
Would anybody here like to see any of these bangs?

645
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:38,600
AUDIENCE: Yes!

646
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,768
Let's play this tape and see how you did in the sort of run-up.

647
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,224
Let's have a look.

648
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:46,408
It's the second-to-last corner. Yes! Oh, that's a high speed.

649
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:48,612
Nice work(!) LAUGHTER

650
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,208
Here's the second attempt...

651
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,800
Held it...not held it.

652
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,768
Yes, G-force is there.

653
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:58,004
OK, there's a third attempt.

654
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,348
Oh, BLEEP! LAUGHTER

655
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,896
Well done, Stephen, brilliant! APPLAUSE

656
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:07,816
That's courage!

657
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:11,848
Every time, I said to myself, &quot;Smoothly.&quot;

658
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,240
What happens when I'm behind the wheel?

659
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,724
&quot;Argh!&quot; It's just... And so I lost goodness knows how many seconds.

660
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:20,256
I am so angry with myself but I had a great time.

661
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:22,520
Who here would like to see Stephen's real lap?

662
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,428
AUDIENCE: Yes!

663
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,520
Good, let's have a look.

664
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,992
That's a smoking start.

665
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:31,128
This is going to be smooth.

666
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:35,128
It might not be fast but let's make it smooth, Stephen, smooth.

667
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:37,664
That's very good. Let's have a look...that's a smooth line.

668
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:41,176
Perfect. That's the line The Stig teaches.

669
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:44,768
With his... That's fantastic!

670
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,272
Quite smooth, maybe too smooth.

671
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:49,692
LAUGHTER

672
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:52,816
A big dip there, that was heavy on the brakes.

673
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,864
Possibly could have been heavier still, actually,

674
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:56,880
because that's a bit of understeer.

675
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,616
My word! It's hot too and I can't even claim it's wet

676
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:07,916
except around my face! Ah!

677
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:10,368
Hammerhead, this is the one that sorts out the men from the Grindrs.

678
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:11,896
LAUGHTER

679
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,444
That is bang-on, Stephen.

680
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:18,276
Ah, you bitch. Oh, come on! LAUGHTER

681
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:19,680
Here we go.

682
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,460
That's quick, that's very good.

683
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,848
Ah!

684
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:26,916
You're having a crisis! LAUGHTER

685
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:29,884
Here we go into the... Did he get it right this time?

686
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:32,432
That is bang-on, cutting the corner nicely.

687
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:35,568
Coming up to Gambon and...

688
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:38,848
Yep, that just about kissed the apex and there we are, across the line!

689
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:42,276
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Dear me!

690
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:43,712
That was smooth.

691
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:45,556
Oh, well, it was smooth.

692
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:47,788
So...

693
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,728
I'll give you the one. Oh, that's good.

694
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:53,304
That means that you've beaten Jimmy- Carr, you've beaten Brian Cox.

695
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,696
Who else do you think you beat?

696
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,916
It would be nice to beat Michael Gambon,

697
00:38:57,956 --> 00:38:59,944
because that would put me between him and Jools.

698
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,696
If I beat 1.50 it would be something- but I doubt I did.

699
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:06,200
The problem is you were beautifully smooth

700
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
but smoothness needs to be teamed with speed.

701
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,636
Oh, no... And as a result,

702
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:17,508
you had a very smooth but quite steady 1 minute 51 dead.

703
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:19,840
Oh, no!APPLAUSE

704
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,588
Oh!

705
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:24,024
Well...

706
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:25,616
I could give you a &quot;hot&quot;.

707
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:28,508
Give me a &quot;hot&quot;. I wanted a &quot;hot&quot;.

708
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:31,072
I could give you a hot, it was a hot day and, of course,

709
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:32,304
we on Top Gear are responsible for it.

710
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:34,180
Is that Alan Davies? Alan...

711
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,288
1.50.3, is that Alan D there? Alan Davies. I'll never hear the end of that.

712
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:41,568
Do you know what? I could be guaranteed that Alan doesn't watch Top Gear.

713
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:43,948
So, if you just go back and say, &quot;I did 1.47...&quot;

714
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:46,648
LAUGHTER He'll never know.

715
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,616
Ladies and gentleman, Stephen Fry!

716
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:59,368
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

717
00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:01,152
Excellent.

718
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,760
Now...

719
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,120
Earlier on we bought, insured and customised three cars

720
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,356
that we feel are ideal for 17-year-olds and their parents and the insurance companies.

721
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah, I had a bit of a problem in the first challenge

722
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,324
when I sort-of ripped the body kit off the back on my Hyundai.

723
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:22,024
Yep. Jeremy broke the back window of his Volvo with an anarchy flag.

724
00:40:22,064 --> 00:40:23,964
It's a bit of a long story. Yeah.

725
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:30,648
Anyway, coming up now is the most realistic challenge ever attempted on British television.

726
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:32,480
It's something we've all done.

727
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,792
We were told to turn up at our parents' house

728
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:39,260
and get up the drive at three o'clock in the morning...

729
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,200
three hours after we'd said we'd be in, without waking them up.

730
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,872
The winner would be the one who could do it the most quietly.

731
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,248
OWL HOOTS

732
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:53,416
'At three o'clock the next morning,

733
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:56,716
'the man with the decibelometer was in place.

734
00:40:56,756 --> 00:41:00,684
'And I was first to go.'

735
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:04,008
Oh, God. Ugh!

736
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:10,620
'Despite the odd squeak from me, things were going well.'

737
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,008
Ugh!

738
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:16,760
WHISPERS: Yeah, this is a professional job.

739
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,292
What I'm doing is reversing the car in

740
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:26,776
so that it hides the back and my mother won't see what I've done.

741
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:30,592
Find out the noise.

742
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:38,728
50.4 decibels, that's like custard rustling, absolutely soundless.

743
00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:43,684
'Then it was Jeremy's go with the big, heavy Volvo.'

744
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:46,496
SHOUTING: Oh, for God's sake!

745
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:47,932
Yeah, that would be him.

746
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,748
Come on. Come on!

747
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:52,920
Ugh! Oh, God!

748
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,108
'Mercifully the drive finally levelled out.'

749
00:41:56,148 --> 00:42:03,184
Come on, you stupid lump of Swedish lead.

750
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:08,028
Oh, my God!

751
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:11,560
SMASHING GLASS

752
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:24,280
THEY LAUGH

753
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,420
I might get in trouble.

754
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,840
Don't make too much noise, you'll wake them up, mate.

755
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,344
Oh, my God!

756
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,560
It's the anarchy flag.

757
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,060
That's what did it! That's what did it.

758
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,292
Say it was stolen by anarchists

759
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:39,624
and they buried it in the summer house. Job done!

760
00:42:39,664 --> 00:42:43,780
'Jeremy decided it would be quieter- to drive out of the wreckage.'

761
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,184
SMASHING GLASS

762
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:48,904
Oh, no, no, no!

763
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:53,000
Shhh!

764
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,720
There's no damage!

765
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,560
Well, I think that's maybe pushing it a bit.

766
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,032
This...

767
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:00,936
and there's quite a lot of damage there.

768
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:02,496
An awful lot.

769
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:04,876
'Hammond had possibly pipped me on this one.'

770
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,296
What was yours? 50.4.

771
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:08,516
50.4?

772
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:10,576
66.1!

773
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:13,216
My Mum and Dad, they didn't wake up.

774
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:16,236
It's a good job they're heroin addicts.

775
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:19,452
'Then it was my turn.'

776
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:22,360
I can do it on the engine cos the engine's quiet.

777
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,236
The interesting thing is what James

778
00:43:24,276 --> 00:43:26,856
would have been out doing till late as a teenager.

779
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:30,484
How long does choir practice go on?

780
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,236
I can't actually see where the drive goes.

781
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:36,484
JEREMY CLEARS HIS THROAT What?

782
00:43:36,524 --> 00:43:40,732
Is that the controller...?! RICHARD LAUGHS

783
00:43:40,772 --> 00:43:43,452
Ready, steady and...

784
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:52,828
LOUD TECHNO MUSIC For God's sake! No!

785
00:43:52,868 --> 00:43:57,920
You're so unfunny.

786
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,800
God above!

787
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,360
'James had lost this challenge...

788
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,296
'quite badly.' JEREMY AND RICHARD LAUGH

789
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:07,608
Shall we go in and go to bed?

790
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:08,548
Hold it! Hold it!

791
00:44:08,588 --> 00:44:09,704
Right, wait.

792
00:44:09,744 --> 00:44:14,812
Can you smell smoke on my fingers? THEY LAUGH

793
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:19,676
The following morning, we were told- to report to our test track for the- next challenge.

794
00:44:19,716 --> 00:44:24,984
Oddly though, the man in the white coat was nowhere to be seen.

795
00:44:25,024 --> 00:44:26,548
What was the actual colour of your car?

796
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:27,704
Red, it actually...

797
00:44:27,744 --> 00:44:30,048
No, no! Amber gold.

798
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:33,048
Oh... Amber gold. Can you remember the exact colour of yours?

799
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,016
Sunrise yellow.

800
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:44,608
Lads!

801
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:48,328
This man's destroying your Volvo. Are you going to sort him out?

802
00:44:48,368 --> 00:44:52,144
'The psychopath with the forklift then did the same to my Golf

803
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:54,240
'and Hammond's Hyundai.'

804
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,452
Ah!

805
00:44:55,492 --> 00:45:00,000
Mind the body kit!

806
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,268
This does feel like a terrible...

807
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:05,064
Well, hopefully... This had better be good.

808
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:09,676
Ha-ha, &quot;As you are 17, it is certain that at some point in the near future,

809
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:12,268
&quot;you will roll your car.

810
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:15,456
&quot;So, you must now mend it in such a way

811
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:19,048
&quot;that your parents won't be able to spot the damage.

812
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:24,580
&quot;This is to find out how easy they are to repair.&quot;

813
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,924
Right, well we'd better get these... Let's get them indoors... Yeah.

814
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:33,268
..and break out the hammers.

815
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:36,924
'Richard, however, decided he didn't need a hammer.'

816
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:40,552
And straightaway, I've improved it.

817
00:45:40,592 --> 00:45:41,628
God, a horse of a...ah!

818
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:44,048
Ah! Argh!

819
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,908
You don't need hammers and shouting.

820
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:50,016
See this bit here, small scuff,

821
00:45:50,056 --> 00:45:55,080
watch that disappear thanks to the magic of polish.

822
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,584
'With the roof done, I now have to sort the bonnet.'

823
00:45:58,624 --> 00:46:03,708
Here's a tip. Should you ever roll,- your coupe, stylish,

824
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:12,116
and need to straighten a dent, here's what you do.

825
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:14,756
That's not...ugh!

826
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:18,440
'Jeremy, meanwhile, was cheating.'

827
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,328
One thing I've learned is that all firemen have at some point crashed their cars when they were teenagers.

828
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,768
So, I've borrowed a fireman. Did you ever crash a car?

829
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:29,080
I certainly did.

830
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,504
You were 17? RS Turbo, straight through a fence.

831
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:36,504
So you understand the plight of the 17-year-old who's stuffed his Mum's car.

832
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,536
Feeling the pain.

833
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:46,304
So, do you think you could use some fireman equipment to make that like new?

834
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:48,848
That's not what they're for.

835
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:51,288
There were no fires in Surrey -

836
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:56,004
it's too middle class.

837
00:46:56,044 --> 00:46:58,612
Spray it the same colour as the car.

838
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:01,736
'After just two hours of hard work...'

839
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:04,332
It's very important to turn the cloth frequently.

840
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:08,176
'..we had made no difference whatsoever.'

841
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:10,348
KNOCKING That's plastic.

842
00:47:10,388 --> 00:47:11,928
I had to do plastic too because

843
00:47:11,968 --> 00:47:15,096
the fireman's lift has changed the shape of the windscreen hole.

844
00:47:15,136 --> 00:47:17,600
'Then another challenge arrived.'

845
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,176
Let's have a look.

846
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:22,724
OK.

847
00:47:22,764 --> 00:47:26,364
&quot;You will now race against the clock to see which car is the fastest.

848
00:47:26,404 --> 00:47:28,116
&quot;You have to go down the main straight,

849
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:29,664
&quot;round the Hammerhead, do a handbrake turn

850
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:32,040
&quot;and come back the other way.&quot;

851
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,256
That doesn't sound very hard.

852
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:36,880
Oh, hang on, no, it says, &quot;The track has been littered with obstacles

853
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,616
&quot;and you'll have five seconds added to your time for every object you don't hit.&quot;

854
00:47:41,656 --> 00:47:46,692
Don't hit? Well, that's what it says.

855
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:47,960
'It was right.

856
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,240
'The track was littered with all the flotsam

857
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,320
'that teenagers like to crash into.

858
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,256
'And then, at the finish line, there was a gap between two parked cars

859
00:47:58,296 --> 00:48:03,488
'that everyone, except a 17-year-old, can see isn't wide enough.

860
00:48:03,528 --> 00:48:05,428
'We also discovered that our handbrake turns

861
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:08,864
'would be judged by three teenage girls.'

862
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:11,176
That actually makes sense because as men,

863
00:48:11,216 --> 00:48:14,960
we know that nothing turns a 17-year-old girl on more

864
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,928
than a good handbrake turn. God, yeah, fact.

865
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:20,804
It's like a peacock has its plumage, those birds in the jungle,

866
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:24,224
they attract a mate with dancing about. We have the handbrake.

867
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:26,120
That's what it's for.

868
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,772
I have no feathers... But I can do this!

869
00:48:27,812 --> 00:48:31,040
Interestingly, girls will always say, &quot;No, we're not interested.&quot;

870
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,728
Oh, they never show it!

871
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:34,368
They never have ever shown it.

872
00:48:34,408 --> 00:48:37,428
They're suppressing it very well. Very effectively.

873
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:39,896
'Armed with this new information about women,

874
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:43,164
'James decided to get some practice...'

875
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:44,820
TYRES SCREECH

876
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,848
'..while we talked to the girls.'

877
00:48:46,888 --> 00:48:49,040
I've got a motorbike.

878
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,132
That's nice. Yeah.

879
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:53,024
Have you seen him? He's rubbish.

880
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:57,008
I did one yesterday at Glastonbury and it was brilliant.

881
00:48:57,048 --> 00:48:58,696
And...

882
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:00,916
Urgh!

883
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:02,728
That's him being rubbish.

884
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,480
I did a huge one.

885
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,276
He just can't do it, he can't do it

886
00:49:06,316 --> 00:49:09,960
and he's got no penis cos it came off once.

887
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,200
'With James cleared off the track, I lined up for the off.'

888
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,804
Oh, that was a blinding start!

889
00:49:17,844 --> 00:49:20,228
What do you reckon his approach is going to be?

890
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:22,104
Mmm... Fast. Violent.

891
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:24,256
Oh, gotta hit this.

892
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:26,928
Missed!

893
00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:29,400
Oh, that's the bus shelter, the bus shelter's good.

894
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,568
This is like any 17-year-old coming home from work.

895
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,884
He's got to the flower stall.

896
00:49:35,924 --> 00:49:40,604
My God! That's substantial. Yee-ha!

897
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,916
That was strangely satisfying.

898
00:49:42,956 --> 00:49:45,792
Roadworks.

899
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:48,696
That's good. Wheelie bins.

900
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,716
Fantastic!

901
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:58,400
'Sadly the handbrake turn was a disaster.'

902
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,996
There's nothing I can do about the washer bottle,

903
00:50:01,036 --> 00:50:04,288
that is a consequence of the accident.

904
00:50:04,328 --> 00:50:06,824
Oh! That was still there!

905
00:50:06,864 --> 00:50:10,288
Holy cow, through we go!

906
00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:14,948
Yes!

907
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:17,572
'James was next.'

908
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:20,088
Yes, yes, do it!

909
00:50:20,128 --> 00:50:23,728
LOUD TECHNO MUSIC Oh, for God's sake.

910
00:50:23,768 --> 00:50:25,260
No!

911
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,228
He's missed the car.

912
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:29,996
Oh, neat!

913
00:50:30,036 --> 00:50:31,604
'Down the back straight it was hard to see

914
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:35,260
'why he'd bothered with a helmet.'

915
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:40,244
MUSIC: &quot;Morning&quot; by Grieg

916
00:50:40,284 --> 00:50:46,776
UPPER-CLASS ACCENT: Mum, I've been to the Post Office.

917
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:53,932
'But then as he approached the girls, all became clear.'

918
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:56,528
They're hot for James May right now!

919
00:50:56,568 --> 00:51:00,696
I might as well have cut my penis off for all the good that did.

920
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:02,436
Good idea! Quick!

921
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,852
I know what you're thinking, I want to do it too.

922
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:08,152
There you go.

923
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:13,604
WHISTLING Perfect.

924
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:15,200
Yeah!

925
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,728
Oh!

926
00:51:16,768 --> 00:51:18,388
That's not gone quite as well.

927
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:22,008
'So now it was all down to me.'

928
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:25,368
So they've both missed the car, the first obstacle. I won't.

929
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:28,560
Go!

930
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,856
Yeah, you see! Oh, yeah!

931
00:51:30,896 --> 00:51:33,760
35 seconds before he moved more than a yard.

932
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,088
It's round the Hammerhead the normal way.

933
00:51:39,128 --> 00:51:44,156
Oh, what a pillock.

934
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:48,776
You all right?

935
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:50,156
Dead.

936
00:51:50,196 --> 00:51:52,436
Really? Yeah.

937
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,184
Yeah. Anyway...uh...

938
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:56,748
Back to the studio.

939
00:51:56,788 --> 00:51:58,088
That's my line!

940
00:51:58,128 --> 00:52:07,000
APPLAUSE

941
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,028
Luckily, children, I got better.

942
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:12,700
You might not be so lucky.

943
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,840
Yes, it's like my penis. That grew back.

944
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,248
Yours might not.

945
00:52:19,288 --> 00:52:21,280
Anyway...

946
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,984
Let's have a look how we all did.

947
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:26,720
No real surprises in the scoring until we get to the repair section

948
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,468
where I got 2, Hammond got 4,

949
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:30,920
James, you got -100.

950
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,280
LAUGHTER Is that a minus?!

951
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,888
It's a minus. Oh, come on!

952
00:52:33,928 --> 00:52:35,480
What did you expect? You failed to address

953
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,640
the ruined bonnet, the crumpled roof,

954
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,328
door mirror missing, all these dents.

955
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:43,516
All you did was concentrate all your time on one scratch

956
00:52:43,556 --> 00:52:46,156
and it's still here! Look! LAUGHTER

957
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,764
I ran out of time!

958
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:51,156
You proved what I've said all along, polish doesn't work.

959
00:52:51,196 --> 00:52:53,012
It can't get rid of anything.

960
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:55,608
When do you ever see the NHS go, &quot;Oh, that's a nasty head wound,

961
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:59,484
&quot;We'll get some T-Cut on it.&quot; It doesn't get rid of anything!

962
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:01,124
You ended up with a really clean scratch.

963
00:53:01,164 --> 00:53:02,516
Exactly!

964
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,624
Let's move on. We've got the lap of crashes.

965
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:06,876
Jeremy, you got 121.

966
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,528
I got 103.

967
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:13,000
Hammond, you got -174.

968
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,080
Oh, what? So conveniently I just happen to get minus the number of points I have?

969
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,764
Yes. Right. LAUGHTER

970
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:22,688
There's no other words, you're on nought.

971
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:24,560
OK, but now, now is the big one -

972
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,064
the handbrake turn.

973
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:34,108
Our teenage judges said they were prepared to award up to 5 points for a really good one.

974
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:37,236
5 points? That means I can't possibly win.

975
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:39,204
SQUEAKING No. What's your car doing?

976
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:41,732
Can I just say, it can't stop that happening.

977
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:42,956
LAUGHTER What happened was...

978
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:45,640
You see the thing is, this got clobbered here,

979
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,548
the headlight washer and it's blown- the fuse and that just is constant,

980
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:51,856
it's been going on since we filmed it in March.

981
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,548
Jeremy Clarkson, it is now between you and me. Yes, it is.

982
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:57,752
Like last week, like the train So your handbrake turn... Yes.

983
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:59,440
..what did it get?

984
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,188
The girls awarded me...

985
00:54:02,228 --> 00:54:03,656
LAUGHTER

986
00:54:03,696 --> 00:54:06,092
..nothing!

987
00:54:06,132 --> 00:54:08,168
No poi... Why do you do that?

988
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,328
Why can't you admit that you are turned on by handbrake turns?

989
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:13,064
Just give in to it! Just go with it!

990
00:54:13,104 --> 00:54:14,956
You know this as a man.

991
00:54:14,996 --> 00:54:18,064
There's nothing else going for you.- No, come on!

992
00:54:18,104 --> 00:54:19,520
That is what does it.

993
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,032
You think we're immature when we do them. Yeah.

994
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:25,656
But you don't! Secretly... We do!

995
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,000
You have a crisis.

996
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,812
LAUGHTER

997
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:31,188
I bet you when cars... I'm sorry.

998
00:54:31,228 --> 00:54:35,520
Can somebody... Can you just...?

999
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,424
This is consumer advice as well. Shut up!

1000
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:43,576
This is also consumer advice... The door handle's come off!

1001
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:47,128
Can you go in there and make that noise please stop?

1002
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:49,188
Can you open the door?

1003
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:51,844
Just tu... Can you turn the key?

1004
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:54,092
Yes!

1005
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:58,092
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1006
00:54:58,132 --> 00:55:00,220
Oh, now that's...

1007
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,784
Come on, you're turned on now!

1008
00:55:02,824 --> 00:55:03,720
LAUGHTER

1009
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,112
Anyway, I got nought? Yes.

1010
00:55:05,152 --> 00:55:10,628
And that means you are now 3 points behind me.

1011
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:12,316
So if you got 4,

1012
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:14,296
the girls gave you 4...

1013
00:55:14,336 --> 00:55:16,940
They did, didn't they? They did. What did they give you?

1014
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,800
Nothing.

1015
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:25,784
Yes! I am victorious! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1016
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,720
Fairly beaten.

1017
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,080
Hold on! No, no, no.

1018
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,532
Think about it. Think what you're applauding,

1019
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:35,688
because what we're saying then is

1020
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:42,644
that the best, THE BEST car for a 17-year-old is a beige Volvo estate with a broken back window.

1021
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:45,208
Yep, that's what my children are getting.

1022
00:55:45,248 --> 00:55:47,736
Anyway, that is the end, you'll be relieved to hear

1023
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:51,048
of the consumer advice for this week.

1024
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:52,960
No, no it's not because there is some more.

1025
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,644
Earlier on in the show, before I was...killed,

1026
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:58,940
I was in Abu Dhabi testing the new Lamborghini Murcielago

1027
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,172
and, in fact, I'm still there because now it's time for the moment

1028
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:06,208
petrolheads all over the world have been waiting for -

1029
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:16,688
the first-ever showdown between the- two fastest road cars of all time.

1030
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:19,552
This car, you're familiar with.

1031
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:24,864
The Bugatti Veyron, the Concorde of the road.

1032
00:56:24,904 --> 00:56:29,004
The meeting point for the most amazing collection of numbers.

1033
00:56:29,044 --> 00:56:30,816
One million pounds,

1034
00:56:30,856 --> 00:56:33,208
one thousand horsepower

1035
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:40,864
and a top speed of 252 miles an hour.

1036
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:44,320
But spin the clock back 15 years and in the 1990s,

1037
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,068
this was the ultimate road car -

1038
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:52,768
the McLaren F1.

1039
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:57,048
Like the Bugatti, the McLaren is an orgy of mind-bending numbers.

1040
00:56:57,088 --> 00:57:01,020
It was the fastest with a top speed- of 240 miles an hour.

1041
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,224
It was the most expensive, costing half a million pounds in 1993

1042
00:57:05,264 --> 00:57:07,836
and like the Bugatti,

1043
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:12,196
the McLaren was built utterly without compromise.

1044
00:57:12,236 --> 00:57:14,740
The engine bay was lined with gold

1045
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,272
because gold is the best heat reflector.

1046
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:20,084
An entirely new and unique gearbox had to be developed

1047
00:57:20,124 --> 00:57:22,664
because no existing gearbox could survive the torque

1048
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:26,272
from the 6.1-litre BMW engine.

1049
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:31,836
It was the first carbon-fibre-bodied car.

1050
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:35,020
And although these cars have so much in common,

1051
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:40,740
the McLaren and the Veyron are actually poles apart.

1052
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,600
Whereas the Veyron is loaded with technology,

1053
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,912
the McLaren gets...nothing.

1054
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:52,052
No traction control, no ABS.

1055
00:57:52,092 --> 00:57:59,456
It's gizmo cupboard is completely bare.

1056
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:01,052
The F1's creator wanted his machine to be

1057
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:05,100
just the greatest, the purest driving machine

1058
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:10,712
in the same way that Bugatti's creator wanted it to be the most amazing technical achievement.

1059
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:17,928
And that shines through in the way they feel.

1060
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:20,992
Changing gear, it's like sliding a bolt action forward on a rifle,

1061
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:25,120
that well-oiled, mechanical, metallic feel.

1062
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,008
And you sit slap-bang in the middle- for that racing-driver sensation.

1063
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,384
Oh, dear lord!

1064
00:58:32,424 --> 00:58:38,960
HE LAUGHS

1065
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,412
OK. What I shall do now is climb out of the McLaren F1

1066
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:46,040
and get in to the Bugatti Veyron.

1067
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,664
Not a bad day this one so far!

1068
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:52,976
Right, to business.

1069
00:58:53,016 --> 00:58:55,648
Because for the first time ever,

1070
00:58:55,688 --> 00:59:01,916
these titans will now go head to head in a one-mile drag race.

1071
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:05,432
I shall be in the Veyron.

1072
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:08,848
And in the McLaren, a man who has no idea

1073
00:59:08,888 --> 00:59:12,744
that he's about to make history.

1074
00:59:12,784 --> 00:59:20,304
He is quite excited though, he saw his first camel today.

1075
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:22,616
Actually, I'm quite glad it's him in that car

1076
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:26,524
because today that McLaren is worth two million quid.

1077
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:31,104
If we do come together though, he does know the drill -

1078
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:35,148
run and meet at the border.

1079
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:39,588
Nearly ready. On paper, the Bugatti's got over a thousand horsepower,

1080
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:43,960
370 more than the McLaren but the McLaren weighs less.

1081
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,208
So it's got more power to weight. Nought to sixty the Bugatti should...

1082
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:51,568
I don't know, this is the real world.

1083
00:59:51,608 --> 00:59:56,416
We'll have to see what happens.

1084
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:57,448
'Three

1085
00:59:57,488 --> 00:59:58,664
'two,

1086
00:59:58,704 --> 01:00:00,168
'one,

1087
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,008
'go!'

1088
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:03,792
Yes, this it!

1089
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:06,168
Forward into history.

1090
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,540
What? How is that happening?

1091
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,088
How is that happening?

1092
01:00:13,128 --> 01:00:17,152
The old pretender is still there, it won't give up its crown!

1093
01:00:17,192 --> 01:00:21,228
We're now doing 240 kilometres an hour.

1094
01:00:21,268 --> 01:00:24,104
Come on, Bugatti!

1095
01:00:24,144 --> 01:00:26,056
I'm reeling him in.

1096
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:29,448
1000 horsepower, there's no way past that.

1097
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:33,040
I'm gonna take it, yes!

1098
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,792
HE LAUGHS

1099
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,728
300 kilometres an hour.

1100
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:41,132
320 kilometres an hour!

1101
01:00:41,172 --> 01:00:44,640
Yes!

1102
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,544
320 and I have clearly taken it!

1103
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:54,760
The Bugatti takes the prize.

1104
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,040
APPLAUSE

1105
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,512
Honestly, what's in that? Hairs.

1106
01:01:00,552 --> 01:01:02,448
Hairs on the back of the neck.

1107
01:01:02,488 --> 01:01:05,716
Straight road.

1108
01:01:05,756 --> 01:01:10,336
And of course what we've proved there is that the Bugatti Veyron,

1109
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:13,044
which we know to be the fastest car- in the world,

1110
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:16,260
is faster than another kind of car.

1111
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,008
LAUGHTER Yes!

1112
01:01:18,048 --> 01:01:20,932
Yeah, you don't get that kind of information everywhere!

1113
01:01:20,972 --> 01:01:24,248
And so, on that bombshell, it's time to end.

1114
01:01:26,972 --> 01:30:24,248
Sync by Frozen
