1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,920
Tonight, we save the entire world.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,040
We test a fat spaniel from Jaguar.

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,400
And we annoy France's
second-best racing driver.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,040
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,320
Thank you!

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,120
Hello, hello, everybody.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,480
Hello and welcome.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,640
Now.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,440
All keen drivers will tell you that
front-wheel drive modern cars are
for the weak.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,440
And that if you're at all serious
about your driving, you have to have
a car with rear wheel drive.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,640
And we agree with them,
even James May.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,520
But our producers disagree.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
They think we're talking claptrap.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,240
So, to try and prove their point,
they gave each of us £1,500,

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,000
told us to buy a
rear-wheel drive car with it,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
and then go to Calais,

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
where we would be given
a number of stab wounds.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,720
No, not stab wounds...hats.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,920
No, what's the word?

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,760
CALL FROM THE CROWD
Sausages! Not sausages!

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,320
Challenges! Yes, that!

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,840
Mmm, Calais.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,480
Beautiful.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,880
But it has been enlivened
this morning by the arrival
of this magnificent Porsche 944.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,560
And this is the S2 model,
the last and the best.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,840
Three litre engine, at the front,
rear wheel drive,

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,000
and the gear box is at
the back as well.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,360
Now, that does mean the, um...

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
..the boot floor is a bit shallow.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,240
But really, that's a small
price to pay, frankly,

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
for engineering balance,
engineering perfection.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,760
It is remarkable that you can buy a
car as good as this,

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,240
for £1,500.

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:12,240
And equally remarkable that someone
should spend £1,500 on what can only
be described as a Datsun.

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,200
A-ha! That's utterly hideous.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
It is. Now, let me
just talk you through.

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Nissan 300 ZX.

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,240
Headlines, technical stuff.
Three litre V6,
four-wheel steer, twin turbo.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,600
I bet you Paul Raymond
had a Nissan 300 ZX.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It's a pornographer's car, isn't it?
It is a pornographer's car.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,720
And then, the 1980s arrived.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,000
MUSIC: Theme to "Minder"

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Oh, Lord!

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,360
We're on the set of Minder!
Terry McCann is here!

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,040
All right, Tel?

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,800
I wanna see claret on the pavement!

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,240
The Capri 2.8 injection. The last
hurrah of the common man's coupe.

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,360
I love these things. It's fantastic.
It's terrible.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,160
Seriously? It's hateful.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,440
All I would say is,
BMW 635, 323, 325,
I saw all of these for £1,500.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah, I know.

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,440
But didn't you always want a Capri?

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,960
Yes, but the producers aren't going
to say, "The winner is the one who
always wanted their car most."

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,600
'Hammond and I then
discovered an interesting
feature on Jeremy's Porsche.'

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,720
RICHARD AND JAMES: One, two, three...

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
Yay! Oh, sorry! Did I hit you?

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,160
You actually hit him in the plums!

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,000
He does that, he
actually goes for them.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
When I was mended, we were
given a challenge.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,520
Right. You will now drive your
£1,500 rear-wheel drive cars
to a racetrack! Yes!

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,880
It's called Circuit de Lac... Circuit
de something or other. The only
drawback is, it's 500 miles away.

62
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,960
A Nissan. 500 miles, that's
just...I'm there.

63
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm not entirely confident about
that, if I'm being brutally honest.

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,480
Our convoy hit the autoroute
for the long drive south.

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,920
This car has done 201,000 miles.

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
That's very nearly
Earth to the moon.

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,120
And it feels...like it's done
201,000 miles.

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,440
My window switches have come out,

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,440
my boot release has come out,
sunroof is broken,
rear wiper is broken.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,320
There were, however, no quality
issues at all in Paul Raymond's car.

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,480
So it's done an indicated 103,000
miles. And do you know what?
It feels as tight as a drum.

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Everything is
electric and everything works.

73
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,920
Air-con, cruise control,
controls on the steering wheel.
Nothing had that back then!

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,280
54.9 miles into our 500-mile
odyssey, and some of the
gauges have starting working.

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,400
Soon, the producers told us
to pull in at a rest area,

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,880
where, weirdly, we were given
another challenge.

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,680
We're going to a racetrack,
we know that.

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Should one of your cars not make it
to the destination...

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,160
That'll be you.

80
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,960
..producers have provided a back-up
car that also has rear-wheel drive.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,320
That'll be all right, then. 
That's very generous.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,200
That's... I have wondered.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,080
It's not that, is it?

84
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,720
'It was.

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,800
'And for us,
Morris Marinas spell trouble.'

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,400
I should explain, viewers, we've had
a few run-ins with the Morris Marina
Owners Club over the years.

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
We keep breaking them.

88
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,880
Not out fault. The last one
really wasn't our fault,
a piano just fell on it.

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,200
It rains pianos at our track.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,800
So, is that thing gonna follow us in
the usual... It is, isn't it?

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,520
It did follow us, waiting to pounce.

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,040
But, for hour after hour, our three
cars - even the Capri - ran without
a single problem.

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,360
What we should have said at the
start of the programme is,

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,920
"Tonight, three middle-aged men
drive reliable cars across France
without incident."

95
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,360
Of course, as night fell,
our luck ran out.

96
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
Are you saying that the
rear lights don't work?

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,120
Well, I'm not blinded by it. Look.

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,080
Only that one's not working. When
you're driving there's nothing.

99
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,680
'Normally, this would put the
world's least practical man
in the Marina.'

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,000
'But, for the first time in
his life, he decided to
try and fix something.'

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,120
If I mend this, you lot are going to
have to stand back in amazement.

102
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,240
The thing is, he's actually,
genuinely changed a bulb.
He's done it.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,960
I mended something!

104
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,840
I mended it! You changed a bulb.

105
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,400
Well, it's never happened before.

106
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,400
This opened the floodgates.

107
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,240
It's like losing your virginity.

108
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,000
There's a sense that I've unlocked
a treasure chest of possibilities.
I want to mend lots of things, now.

109
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,360
'That night, at the hotel,
"Jez'll Fix It" went berserk.'

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,720
Here we go.

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,360
Look at that! My boot release switch
is now back in.

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,600
I would never have attempted this
before, but now I can.

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,240
Well, it gives us some time on our
own, which is nice.

114
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Hang on, where was it? Ha-ha!
Electric window switches
are now back in.

115
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,800
Oh, no, wait a minute. The sun-roof.
I could just fix that, couldn't I?

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,000
The next morning, my show-room
fresh Porsche led our little convoy
on to the race track.

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,480
It's not a bad looking track. 
It looks great.

118
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,840
Bit nippy. I look forward to giving
it a... Oh, here we go.

119
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,760
"You are in France." Yes.

120
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,440
"The country that practically
invented front-wheel drive,
and have stuck with it."

121
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,920
Yeah, they have.

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,400
"And so, the Stig will now set a lap
time in a very French and very
front-wheel drive Renault Twingo 133.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,880
I thought France
made the Stig violent. 
Evidently not, he looks calm.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,640
All you have to do is beat his time.
You get one point for every second
you are faster than him,

125
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,000
a point lost for every
second you are slower.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,480
How can a Porsche 944 S2 be slower
than a Renault Twingo?

127
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,120
I've got a three litre, twin turbo
V6. I know, Stig's good... 
Why are you looking like that?

128
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,240
I've driven one of those,
they're really fast.

129
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
It's a shopping car. Relax!

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
Go!

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,400
He'll have torque steer,
he'll have under-steer.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,480
We're gonna have the tail
drifting out nicely. 
Elegant, sweeping drift.

133
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,240
'Despite the front drive Renault,
the Stig was very quick.'

134
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,520
Finish.

135
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,960
1:32:31.

136
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,880
Who's going first? Baggy not me. 
Baggy not me. Baggy not me.

137
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,240
That's too late. Aww!

138
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,160
Go!

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,760
Was that the crummiest start you've
ever seen from a human being? 
It wasn't good.

140
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,040
There is one quite important thing,
I have no idea of the way
around this circuit. 

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,400
It's the fast and the furious, this.
Very furious, I should imagine,
knowing Hammond.

142
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,880
Oh, for God's sake,
where's the BLEEP apex?

143
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,920
'Soon, though, I was in the groove.'

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,720
Oh, you can see already,
she's drifting round. Yes!

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,160
'And then, soon,
I was out of it again.'

146
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
Oh, he'll be
clenching in there, now!

147
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,640
I meant that!

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,880
'With Hammond out, it was my turn.'

149
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,400
That didn't go as well as I'd hoped.

150
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,320
'Soon, though, I was revelling in
the 944's rear-drive balance.'

151
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,600
Here we go, you see? Front wheels do
the steering, I then plant the
power at the back.

152
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Oooh! Oops...

153
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,960
You're just feeling
the perfect weight. It's all
just absolutely magnificent.

154
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,080
I may have missed the apex
quite a lot there, but...

155
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,040
Here we go. Come on, Porsche!

156
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,760
Confident.

157
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
RICHARD CLEARS HIS THROAT

158
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
Now, the Stig, 1:32. Yeah.

159
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,040
Jeremy Clarkson. One thirty...

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,240
Yeah, I made a bit of a mess of it,
Yeah.

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,200
But it's OK! Because everything now
hangs on James!

162
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,680
How can the world of
rear-wheel drive now hang... 
On James May in an old Capri?

163
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,520
I want you to win this for the
prog-rock generation.

164
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,400
So I should think King Crimson,
Pink Floyd... Yeah. Genesis.

165
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Unfortunately, like prog-rock,
James's lap is gonna last 48 minutes
and make no sense to anyone.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
GO!

167
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Here we go.

168
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,840
I don't know if I've ever mentioned
this. James isn't a fast driver.

169
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,600
Come on, come on! Come on for the
honour of rear-wheel drive!

170
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,800
That's gotta be good.

171
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,320
1:32 to beat.

172
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,720
1:48. What?

173
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,640
But I was going like hell!

174
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,360
'Following our terrible failure,

175
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
'The Stig broke out his portable,
rear-wheel drive drifting car,

176
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,480
'to show the front-wheel drive
generation what they're missing.'

177
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
'And because we are
all eight years old,

178
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
'we thought we'd have a go.'

179
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,080
'But there was a hitch.'

180
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,040
Hammond. Is there any steam coming
from your car?

181
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,080
None whatsoever, no, no, yours?
There's none coming from mine.

182
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,360
However, there's quite a...

183
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,080
How are you going to be able to
drift when you can't see where
you're going?

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
It'll blow off when I'm going along.

185
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,760
Have you got any tea bags?

186
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,400
It's harmless. This is what
happens when you push a
car to the ragged edge.

187
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,640
Which you haven't done.

188
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,880
'Sadly, by the time Terry McCann's
kettle had cooled down,

189
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,520
'the producers were ready with their
next challenge.'

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,720
What are those things?

191
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,960
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
The middle one is exactly the
same colour as my bike.

192
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,360
That one... Yes, my
Christmas present bike.

193
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,680
That's funny, because
the thing on the right looks
suspiciously like my drum kit.

194
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,160
Well that's what I was thinking,
it looks like my piano.

195
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,880
It can't be, because
we smashed that to bits.

196
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
Exactly. But I bought another one.

197
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't imagine it's coincidence,
and it's there. This is...

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Here we go. "You will
accelerate from nought to
60 miles per hour and then brake.

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,720
"All within 200 metres."

200
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,680
I know what they're there for.

201
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,160
"If you fail to pull up, you will
not only lose points, but something
dear to your heart as well."

202
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,320
Pianos are really heavy.

203
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,800
You're gonna crash into
your piano in about a minute.
This is a stupid idea.

204
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Airbag, no.

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm wearing a crash helmet to protect
me from my own motorcycle coming
through the windscreen.

206
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,000
Traction control, no.

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,920
I've really gotta get on
the brakes with this.

208
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,960
Anti-lock brakes. Don't know.

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,560
Remember to brake at 60, remember to
brake at 60, you stupid boy.

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
Yes, it's a good start.

211
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,320
Come on, brake.
Good change into second.

212
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,080
40. No!

213
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,080
Come on, car!

214
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,280
60... 60, now!

215
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,400
Cock!

216
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
That didn't look good for James.

217
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,440
Look at your Capri.

218
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,800
Never mind the sodding Capri,
look at that!

219
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,240
I think, this...
You could get these in order...

220
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm sorry, mate. I'm really sorry.

221
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,360
You're not sorry!

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,880
'Then, for James, things got worse.'

223
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
Is this normal?

224
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
Of course it's not bloody normal.

225
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,880
Look at it this way -
no more challenges.

226
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
Good. Oh.

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
Apart from that one.

228
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,800
What now?

229
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,880
"So far, real-wheel drive has not
been relevant in any way."

230
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Steady on!

231
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,960
"So you will now drive to
Val Thorens in the Alps, to see if
some use can be found for it there."

232
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
What's Val Thorens?

233
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,640
Well, it's a skiing resort.
I've been there.

234
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
Is it far?

235
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
115 miles.

236
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,480
With bits of piano sticking out
the front. That's a long way.

237
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,040
Don't need that. 
Oh, yeah, good luck to you.
There's nothing wrong with the car.

238
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,360
It's got a dent in it, that's all.
Come on,

239
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,400
Val Thorens.

240
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,960
He just drove over this.

241
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,000
APPLAUSE

242
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,080
That's from back in the days when
Porsche could style cars. 
It was a good looking car.

243
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,360
It was. We'll pick up on that later,

244
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,200
because now we're going
to do the news.

245
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,040
Yes, yes. And the people who
have collaborated with Google
on their Smartphone

246
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,880
have turned their attention to cars. 

247
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,160
They've researched motoring and come
to a conclusion. Their conclusion is
this, and I can quote -

248
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,920
they say, that humans
are not meant to drive.

249
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
LAUGHTER

250
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,400
We're not meant to use ovens,
either, or wear shoes,
but that's just ridiculous.

251
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
That's the conclusion they've come
to, and they've come up with this!

252
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,760
It's called the Autonomobile.

253
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
LAUGHTER

254
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,560
I can tell you like it,
I can tell that.

255
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,240
You'll notice there's no steering
wheel or brakes or any controls at
all for you to operate.

256
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,040
It's the Autonomobile, it does it
itself, you see?

257
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,280
Yes, it's very clever. You get in
it, you tell it where you want to
go, and then it says -

258
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,360
and I'm gonna make sure
I get this right - 

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,040
they say you "sit back, enjoy
the view with a nice wine,
cheese and a baguette."

260
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,080
Oh, lovely.

261
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,400
How lovely.

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,560
I think this is a brilliant idea. I
genuinely like the idea of sitting
about with a glass of wine,

263
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,840
some cheese, and going home.

264
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,800
However, there is one problem with a
sort of laser-guided, radar-guided,
satellite-guided car.

265
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,360
We know - because it's
statistically proven -

266
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,760
that half of all plane crashes are
caused by pilot error, yes?

267
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,880
Yeah. We also know,

268
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,720
that planes can take off, fly and
land by themselves, yes?

269
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,840
This is a fact.

270
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,400
So, if you remove the pilot
from the plane, you would
half the number of crashes.

271
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Stands to reason.

272
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,160
However, would you get on a plane
that had no pilot?

273
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
BOTH: No.

274
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,480
You see? Then that's
the problem with this.

275
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,360
Great idea, but the problem is, you
just happen to know, this has been
invented by a brilliant man.

276
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,760
But, five years down the line,
it's going to be bought
by someone called Keith.

277
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,920
Keith is going to wake up one day
and think he can service it himself.

278
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,240
Yes.

279
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,760
Which means you wont be able to
relax in your Autonomobile.

280
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,720
Because you'll be thinking,

281
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
"I know that somebody called Keith,

282
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,240
"reading the Daily Star
and watching EastEnders
is coming the other way."

283
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,280
LAUGHTER

284
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,200
And there's going to be
a horrible accident.

285
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,800
It's all rubbish. What?

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,240
Cars that drive
themselves were invented ages
ago. They're called taxis.

287
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,840
LAUGHTER

288
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,560
Right, now, news from India.

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,680
There's a company over there, car
company, Tata, they've got a large
car division.

290
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,120
Got a new car out, here it is.

291
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
It's the Jaguar XJ.

292
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,440
It's quite striking to look at.

293
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,080
The interior is gorgeous as well. It
looks fabulous, look at that!

294
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,280
It costs £50,000 to £90,000,
depending on the model,

295
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,080
the direct injection V8, two new
diesels, with 271 and I think...

296
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,320
270... 271...

297
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,680
Nobody gives a pig's arse about
all that Diesel stuff.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,800
It's a new XJ, the important
question is, "Is it a proper Jag?"

299
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,440
What you mean is,
is this car slightly caddish?

300
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
That's what you mean.

301
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,520
Yes.

302
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Is the person who drives it... Oh,
what's the word, I'm not quite sure

303
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,000
how to sum it up, but they're the
sort of person who'd go away for the
weekend with his wife to a hotel,

304
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
some romantic place, and spend the
entire night flirting outrageously
with the waitress.

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,560
And it's OK because he's got a Jag.

306
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,640
LAUGHTER

307
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,760
You can get away with anything!

308
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,120
"I'm terribly sorry,
I ran over your dog." "Oh!"

309
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,160
"In my Jag."

310
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
"Never mind."

311
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,800
Is it fair to say, do you think,
that no Jag driver is ever entirely
trustworthy,

312
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
but it's in a really nice,
likeable way?

313
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,760
Because if you went to a prison -
forget the stabbists
and the stranglers,

314
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,680
the ones that are in there for
a bit of tax-dodging -
I bet 80% have got Jags.

315
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
You know what I mean, don't you?

316
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,080
Have you got a Jag?

317
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,160
Who here's got a Jag?

318
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
You've got a Jag? Look at him!

319
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,560
He goes away with a girl
for the weekend and then goes,

320
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,200
"Awfully sorry."

321
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,560
"Bit of an issue with the wallet." 
"Do you mind, awfully, settling this
while I go warm up the Jag?"

322
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,360
LAUGHTER

323
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,200
The thing is, I think that is
just a brilliant, brilliant
piece of design, because

324
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,800
it's a Jag. But it's kind of modern.

325
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,280
That's an absolutely
fantastic looking car, that.
Can't wait to have a go on in it.

326
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
Oh! Guys, guys, guys, guys. I want
to show you this.

327
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
It's a speeding ticket,

328
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,440
which was issued in California, OK?

329
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,320
We see here that the car in question
is a Bugatti two-door.

330
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm guessing a Veyron.

331
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,920
Speed limit on the road, 65 miles
per hour. Recorded speed, 210.4.

332
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,120
Whoa!

333
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,080
APPLAUSE

334
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,720
Yeah, what about that?

335
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,920
Unbelievable.

336
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,960
If he'd done that in this
country, you'd be put in
prison for 2,000 years. 

337
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,560
Do you want to know what
the fine in California is

338
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,880
for doing 210 miles per hour
on a road with a 65 miles per hour
speed limit?

339
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,320
You get, basically, the maximum fine
a judge can impose is 500. 

340
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,640
For 210 miles per hour.

341
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,240
And if you do it again,
it's just 750.

342
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,760
So, goodbye. We're off. 
Yeah, that's it!

343
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,560
Why aren't we there
doing what we do? I know!

344
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,600
This is the worst country for making
a car programme.

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,680
Honestly, I think we should go,
that is civilised behaviour.

346
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,000
Now. Bad news.

347
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,560
It's about this,
the Honda FRV it's called.

348
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,520
It's a six-seater car, it had
three seats in the front,

349
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,880
three in the back. Well, Honda say
it's been such an enormous success,
they're dropping it.

350
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,600
The problem with this car is
with the picture they sent us,

351
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
which is when the car
came out a few years ago.

352
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,040
Nobody wants to drive around
with a small girl's severed
head on the dash.

353
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,720
The worst thing about this was that
when it came out, we all got
suckered into it and thought,

354
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,320
"Three in the front, three in
the back, it makes sense,"
but it doesn't.

355
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,120
If you think, I've got two daughters,

356
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,560
so if I have one girl in the
front between me and my wife,
that leaves one girl on her own!

357
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,360
You're just gonna have an argument
every time you go near it!

358
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,680
Exactly. It's not gonna work. 
That's not the worst bit.

359
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,280
It could be worse if you had your
wife in the front, and both
daughters, and you sat in the back.

360
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,720
Oh... But you do see that
occasionally.

361
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,880
The mother in the front and
a bloke in the back.

362
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,040
It's tragic. There's
nothing more pathetic.

363
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,320
It's the most
pitiable sight you can see.

364
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,800
She's effectively saying,
"You've given me the baby,
now get in the back." Yeah.

365
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,320
No.

366
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,480
That concludes the news, OK?

367
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,640
That concludes the news,
and now, if you don't mind,
I want to talk about the BMW M5.

368
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,040
You see, what we have here
are two cars.

369
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,840
One of them is a spacious,
practical four-door saloon.

370
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
The other is a blistering,
growling monster.

371
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,840
For 24 years, this has been
the ultimate sports saloon.

372
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,960
But now, there is a new Jag.

373
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,320
The new XFR doesn't look much like
a blistering, growling monster.

374
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,080
There are no bulges in its flex.

375
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,600
There are no scoops.

376
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,320
There's no Cheshire-ishness at all.

377
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,720
It looks like it might
even be a diesel.

378
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,480
It's the same story on the inside.

379
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,720
Sitting in an M5 is like actually
sitting in a laptop.

380
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,280
It couldn't be more geeky, even if
the sat-nav voice was Buffy.

381
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,000
In the Jag, though, all I've got is
a steering wheel and some pedals.

382
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,400
It even has an automatic gearbox.

383
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,760
Don't be fooled by the
plain-Jane simplicity, though.

384
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,200
Because the speed of this thing is
simply unbelievable.

385
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,280
Right. That is nought to 60 in four
and a half seconds, and look at it.

386
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,920
80...90...100...

387
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,400
110...115...it's supposed to be
limited to 155, but, look!

388
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,440
165 and it's still accelerating!

389
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,280
That's unbelievable!

390
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,760
What's it limited by?

391
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,560
"If you don't stick to 155, I shall
jolly well write to the
Daily Telegraph about it."

392
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,360
'The key to this rampant savagery is
an all-new, all-Welsh supercharged
five-litre V8 engine.

393
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,280
'There's no other word.
It's fantastic.

394
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:56,000
'And there's more good news.
At £60,000, the Jag is
noticeably cheaper than an M5.

395
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,440
'It's also quieter, and
it's way more comfortable.'

396
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,480
It is uncannily comfortable.

397
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,200
It's so soft and so absorbent,
it's like sitting on a fat dog.

398
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,640
You can't really believe it'll
go round a corner at all,
leave alone like this.

399
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm doing that wearing brogues!

400
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,360
'To keep it planted,
it has an electronic diff
like you get on a Ferrari.

401
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,040
'And suspension that adjusts itself
hundreds of times a second.'

402
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,680
You can be just inch-perfect,
even when you're driving like
a complete lunatic.

403
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,200
Whoa! Ha-ha!

404
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,480
So easy!

405
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,320
So, this is two cars as well. It's
amazingly comfortable and quiet

406
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,400
when you're not in the mood
for fun and games,

407
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,240
and it's savagely fast when you are.

408
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,680
But, can it really be as
fast as an M5?

409
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
Let's find out.

410
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,920
Both cars produce as near as makes
no difference, 500 horse-power.

411
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,520
And both weigh about the same.

412
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,280
There are some differences,
of course.

413
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,560
He can rev to 8,000, I can only rev
to six and a half.

414
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,400
He's got ten cylinders, I've only
got eight. He's got seven speeds in
his gear box, I've only got six.

415
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,000
BUT I have 80 more torques
than him. 80!

416
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,480
I've got so much torque,
I could tear a hole in TIME!

417
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,880
Yes, he's got better brakes,
but coming out of the corner,

418
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm gonna unleash my meteorite of
torque, here we go!

419
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,720
This is getting hot, hard and
dangerous now. I need to stay cool.

420
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,920
There's the air-con.

421
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm not for a moment
going to suggest that this
is better than an M5.

422
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,560
But it's as good as. And praise
doesn't get higher than that.

423
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,680
Boot full of stolen videos.

424
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,000
So, right, on the track,
the Jag is as good as the BMW.

425
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,560
..Nearly.

426
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,760
On the road?

427
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,040
Honestly, I think on
the road it's better.

428
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,720
Tell you what we'll do now, we'll
put some maths into the mix.

429
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,240
Because we'll find out how fast
it goes around our track,

430
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,280
and that means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

431
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,880
Some say he has 12 GCSEs,
all in domestic science.

432
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,960
LAUGHTER

433
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,320
And that he's been producing
artificial sperm for years.

434
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,080
Even though we have
repeatedly asked him not to.

435
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,880
All we know is
he's called the Stig.

436
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,560
And he's off!
503 Welsh horsepowers!

437
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,280
Charging him down
to the first corner.

438
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,440
This is still a two-ton car, so
let's see how it battles the laws
of physics here.

439
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,040
Looking nice so far.

440
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,120
And a lovely little slide
on the way out.

441
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,880
BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYS ON THE RADIO

442
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,840
The sound of bits, there,
being served in a stomach lining.

443
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,520
Chicago.

444
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,160
There goes the tail again,
this thing really is a
leathery drift machine.

445
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,760
As he comes into the Hammerhead.

446
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,280
The Jag's clever diff runs
in open mode when you don't
need limited slip...

447
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,040
That doesn't eliminate under-steer.

448
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Fortunately, Stig does with a boot
full of supercharged goodness!

449
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,520
BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYS ON THE RADIO

450
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,640
Terrible smell of oats all of a
sudden. There he is through
the follow-through.

451
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,080
Punishing its tires, battling on
well. That was fast.

452
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,800
Here he goes, second to last corner.

453
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,520
More over-steer, and up to Gambon,
wonder what will happen here.

454
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,320
Yep, there goes the tail again.
And across the line!

455
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,400
APPLAUSE

456
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,360
Now...

457
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,840
Here we are, look. BMW, M5.

458
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,560
1:26:2.

459
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,520
Now, I expected the Jag to be a
little bit slower than that.

460
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,080
And it was.

461
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,840
Unfortunately, just half a second in
it. But, look at it this way,

462
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,360
If you have an XFR, "Do you know,
I've lost my wallet!" You never have
to pay for anything.

463
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,560
Now, normally, that would be that.

464
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,000
However, these days, as
I'm sure you know,

465
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,600
the amount of tax you pay on a car
depends on how much carbon dioxide
it produces.

466
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah, and according to official
figures, the XFR produces 292 carbon
dioxides per kilometre.

467
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Which is very impressive,
no other car of its type
gets even close to that.

468
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,400
But, predictably, Jeremy
thought he could do better.

469
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,280
As we know, plants absorb
carbon dioxide, and
then breathe out oxygen.

470
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,760
So why not put plants in the
exhaust system of your car?

471
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,080
Impossible?

472
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,800
Well, Alan Titchmarsh might say so,

473
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,880
but, er, what does HE know?

474
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,160
What we have here is a Range Rover,

475
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,000
which now has the same 5 litre V8
that you get in the Jag.

476
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,880
At the back, we have tubes
which takes the exhaust gases

477
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,040
into this greenhouse, which is full
of plants - tomato plants,
on this occasion.

478
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,840
And that means the tailpipes emit
no greenhouse gases at all.

479
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,800
What you're looking at here,
ladies and gentlemen,

480
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
is the future.

481
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,360
It really is impossible to
overemphasise the importance

482
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,480
of what has been achieved here
today.

483
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,800
Look at what I'm driving.

484
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,440
A big, heavy, thirsty
four-wheel drive car,

485
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,520
and the only waste product is
some juicy tomatoes!

486
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,240
GLASS SMASHES

487
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,040
You thought Greenpeace would save
the world, but no!

488
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,680
It's Top Gear! We've done it!

489
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,960
Where's it gone?

490
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,280
APPLAUSE

491
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,400
Why are they applauding?!

492
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,680
Well done(!) I know there was
a bit of glass on the runway.

493
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,280
Yeah, brilliant. Brilliant Top Gear
WOULD have saved the planet,

494
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,080
except you smashed your greenhouse
to bits. I admit, it didn't go
brilliantly. But you also said

495
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,160
that you weren't giving out any
greenhouse emissions at all. Yes.

496
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,480
That's rubbish cos you only had 100
tomato plants. How many tomato
plants do you need

497
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,840
to get rid of the emissions
from a Range Rover?

498
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,960
400,000.
LAUGHTER

499
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,120
Seriously? And we've worked this
out. To accommodate that many,

500
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,160
your greenhouse would have to be
six miles long.

501
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,880
I can tell why you two
aren't astronauts. Eh?

502
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,920
Who here has seen Apollo 13? Yeah?
You know what I'm on about.

503
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,920
That bit when Houston telephones
the astronauts in the spacecraft

504
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,280
because carbon dioxide is building
up and they need to build something
to get rid of it. Remember?

505
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,440
Yes? Good. These two would go,
"We're a bit cold and frightened!"

506
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,800
Whereas I am Commander Jim Lovell.

507
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,480
I didn't give up
after my greenhouse failure.

508
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,640
I came back, rolled up my sleeves
and came up with another idea.

509
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,960
Oh, God!
If you fire up the Jag, right?

510
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,840
ENGINE STARTS
What we've got is a gasometer.

511
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,320
And its prong is up that exhaust.
What it's telling me

512
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,200
is that 15% of the gas

513
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,560
coming out of this exhaust pipe

514
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,480
is carbon dioxide.
Come here and verify that for me.

515
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,320
It's actually 14.5%, yes?
OK, yeah. Yeah.

516
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Right. Take the prong out

517
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,080
because, on this side,
on THIS tailpipe, I've modified it.

518
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,600
Got tubes feeding into
this Apollo 13 homemade filter...

519
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,160
LAUGHTER
..which is full
of lime soda crystals,

520
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,560
which are used to absorb the carbon
dioxide in those huge
Australian mines, OK?

521
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,680
We're gonna pop the prong in the top
because the gas is going down there,

522
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,960
through the crystals, out of there.
Let's have a look

523
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,440
at how much carbon dioxide
THAT'S producing...

524
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,760
It's none. What, nothing?! NONE?!

525
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,000
Absolutely NO carbon dioxide
is coming out of that car.

526
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,120
Wow!
APPLAUSE

527
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,320
Now, I know we have a reputation on
Top Gear for cocking about, OK?

528
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,440
But on this occasion, we aren't.

529
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,480
This is not a Toyota Prius
or a stupid G-Wiz,

530
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,840
it's got a 5 litre, supercharged V8,

531
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,320
and all that's coming
out of this tailpipe

532
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,920
is nitrogen and oxygen, which is...?

533
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,400
Air. Hang on a sec. What?
These little rocks of yours.

534
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,960
Yes. They absorb carbon dioxide?
They absorb it, yes.

535
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,040
So, how far can you go
before they get all clogged up
and can't absorb any more?

536
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,720
On a motorway...

537
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,200
six miles.
LAUGHTER

538
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,320
With something that size. How much
does it cost for a new box of rocks?

539
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,440
£75. Oh, God!

540
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,400
I know. Barnes Wallis had setbacks,

541
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,360
but he persevered, and I'm sure,
if science can make
genetically-modified wheat,

542
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,080
they can make those absorb more.
I really do think

543
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,640
that we're onto something here.

544
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,720
Shall I go and work on it?
Yes, go and work on it

545
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,240
because it is now time to put a
star...in our reasonably priced car.

546
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,760
We're often criticised
by politicians and newspapers

547
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,000
for being sexist on this programme.

548
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,760
Well, tonight we answer those
critics because my guest is a girl.

549
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,760
And a dead fit one!
Ladies and gentlemen, Sienna Miller!

550
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,360
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

551
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,600
Hello!

552
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,360
How are you? I'm good. Have a seat.

553
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,400
I like that - "Yeah!"

554
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,600
This is momentous stuff.

555
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,480
Even as we speak,
James May is out the back

556
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,560
looking up in his dictionary
what "girl" means.

557
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,160
Yes, he is.
Now, you weren't actually born
to be in theatre, you were born...

558
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,160
IN a theatre. Literally? Literally.
Mum went into labour in the
Nutcracker Suite in New York,

559
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,200
and stayed, throughout the labour,
to finish the show.

560
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
So you were born in... That makes
you an Americanista. Well, both.

561
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,200
My mum's English, my dad's American,
so I have two passports.

562
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,000
You went to boarding school
in England. I did.

563
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,160
I heard that while you were there...

564
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,400
Oh, God. How can I put this? You
got into trouble for doing things
with a rabbit.

565
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,280
Oh, my sweet Lord! I did not do
anything personally with a rabbit,

566
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,720
I got another rabbit to do something
to another rabbit to get
baby rabbits. And it worked!

567
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,920
They really do do it like rabbits!
Fair enough.

568
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,240
So you went into films, obviously.
Yes. Having been born in theatre.

569
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,480
Most of them, let's be honest, have
been quite brainy, quite Channel 4.

570
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,000
To you, boring - just say it.
No, I liked Layer Cake, that bit...

571
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,440
Oh, God! Yeah. You remember the bit
in Layer Cake?

572
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,520
AUDIENCE: Yes!

573
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,360
That was a long time ago,
it's all gone tits up since then - 
or tits down!

574
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

575
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,440
I can't believe I just said that!

576
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,600
You see... Oh, God.

577
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,600
You say that, but your new film,
which is called GI... GI Joe.

578
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,200
GI Joe. That's not sort of cerebral
at all. No. Everything blows up.

579
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,000
Lots of guns, leather. It's perfect
for Top Gear. Leather? Yes.

580
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,360
Really?

581
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,080
Normally we don't show clips,
but on this occasion, I think

582
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,280
we can struggle into doing that.
Let's have a look.

583
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,200
We're running out of time! Eject!

584
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,840
This has only just begun.

585
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,640
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

586
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,360
Just one thing. Why did the film
company send us a clip
without you in it?!

587
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,840
I was in it! I had a black wig on!

588
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,640
Let's get this straight. This is GI
Joe, who's the American equivalent
of the Action Man toy. Yeah.

589
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,920
Well, he's not called Joe, Joe
is an elite force of fighter...
world protector people.

590
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,280
But I'm on the bad camp, the Cobra
camp. Oh, you're a baddie? I am.

591
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,400
I understand there's a record set
with it, with cars? We blew up

592
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,880
112 cars, destroyed 112 cars,
which is a record.

593
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,480
The Blues Brothers held it before.
Yeah. So, 112? Yes.

594
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,440
But you're still some way behind us.

595
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,720
Probably quite far behind you!
112 every 20 minutes.
I've added one to that today,

596
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,640
I think, with my lap.
We'll find that out later.

597
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,280
Before that, though, I want to talk
about fashion magazines.

598
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,080
They always talk about the Sienna
look. We should look at what you're
wearing now. It's not very exciting!

599
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,560
I should've brought another T-shirt
for after my lap, it's quite sweaty.

600
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,360
Have you not changed since...? No!
I didn't realise it would be that
scary! It's soaking wet!

601
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,000
Pop it off if you want to.
LAUGHTER

602
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,640
I say the same to the male guests.

603
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,600
I mean, you are a trendsetter.

604
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,160
I suppose the problem is, it does
make you a massive paparazzi target.

605
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,400
But I sued them all, and won!

606
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,800
I was the first to sue and win on
harassment, so now they can't do
anything. I saw two of them

607
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,120
the other day, and I ran. They were
like, "We can't." And I was like...

608
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,560
I flashed them!
It was the best feeling!

609
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,880
That's fantastic!
APPLAUSE

610
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,200
Yeah!

611
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,240
It's true, you really genuinely did
set legal history.

612
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,680
I did! How bad was it for you?

613
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,040
Every day, probably 15 people
following you everywhere.
Did they chase you?

614
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,200
They were being mean. Shouting,
"Slapper." I can handle that,

615
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,800
but kicking the car and trying
to make you scared.
Do they chase you in the car?

616
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,040
Yes, did you ever have car chases?
Yeah, tons. Really? Yeah.

617
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,600
The other night,
James and Richard were leaving here,

618
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,640
and someone was beside them on
the M4, taking pictures of them,

619
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,160
and he drove his Mini into the back
of the car in front.
That was a result!

620
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,240
We need to talk about your driving
test because I'm confused.
You recently took your driving test.

621
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,440
I passed my driving test last week.
Just last week?! Five days ago!

622
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,600
APPLAUSE
Thank you! Five days?!

623
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,840
Five days.

624
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,120
Now, I'm very baffled because
you've been driving for years.

625
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,440
No, I haven't! I found a loophole.

626
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,080
Which is? My father lives
in the US Virgin Islands,

627
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,800
which is a Caribbean island, which
is technically part of America.

628
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,360
So I got a licence there that meant
I could drive in America and England

629
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,400
for a year, as an American.
It was an interesting driving test,
for sure.

630
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,040
I had to drive down the street
and back.

631
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,040
And that's the test?
Window down, he had the reggae on!

632
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,600
That's the test in the Virgin
Islands! Exactly! There's a top tip

633
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,200
for anybody finding it a struggle
to get a driving licence here!
Pop over there! Slip over there.

634
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
So, how is your driving record?
Good, bad, indifferent?

635
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,720
Mm, the first time I drove,
I wrote off a car,

636
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,200
so not good. My best friend and her
brother had a little car on a farm
that they lived on,

637
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,200
and I pretended I could drive, and
got in it, and pushed the
accelerator instead of the brakes,

638
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,680
through a concrete bollard...
Ditch, fence, cows out...

639
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,800
stuck. I had to climb out
of the window covered in oil.

640
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,040
And that was your first ever
experience? It was.

641
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,880
Then you drove around the Virgin
Islands, which can't have taken more
than five minutes. No.

642
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,600
Then you took your driving test five
days ago. Yes! And now you're here!

643
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,480
We've never had
a better-qualified person, really,

644
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,200
to do our lap! How was it out there?
Did you enjoy it?

645
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,560
It was pretty scary. I've never
really driven a stick shift.

646
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
You deserve credit, genuinely, if
you've never driven a manual car,

647
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,440
and belting round with the Stig.
Yes. Who would like to see
Sienna's lap? Oh, no!

648
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,800
AUDIENCE: Yes!
Let's have a look at this! Oh, God!

649
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,440
TYRES SQUEAL

650
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,280
Is that your first wheel spin start?
Yes.

651
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,240
I'm gonna nail it.

652
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,640
Oh, I say, that was brave! Not
accurate, but brave! It looks slow!

653
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,480
No, it's not.

654
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,120
Excuse my language. Oh, BLEEP!

655
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,880
Potty mouth!

656
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,720
That's impressive, nobody's gonna
complain about that.

657
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,240
I just passed my driving test...

658
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,280
I really should not be doing this.

659
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,520
I love the straight-out
arm position. I know!

660
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,040
It looks so slow! It doesn't!

661
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,720
It looks the same as this
every week.

662
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,680
Oh, BLEEP!

663
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
I'm letting women down!
There's nothing wrong with it!

664
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,560
That's quick. How will you be
through the tyres...?

665
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,360
Oh, my God! Mummy!

666
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,480
Holy cow!

667
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,840
That is fast!

668
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,000
You're having a crisis!

669
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,240
Oh, it's off again! And you held it!

670
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes, you got it! That's it, Gambon!

671
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,040
And you made it across the line!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

672
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,280
That's a cracking lap!

673
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,560
Now... Oh, God!

674
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,560
So, where do you think, then,
on the...?

675
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,760
It felt quite slow, watching it
back. It felt so fast
when I was doing it!

676
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,120
I have no idea. Tell me it's good.

677
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,360
You did it, Sienna Miller, in...

678
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,720
one minute...

679
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,760
..forty...

680
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,880
AUDIENCE: Ooooh!

681
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,720
..9.8 seconds! Yeah!

682
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,640
That is not bad because
that puts you... Oh!

683
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,000
What a nice place to be!

684
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,280
That's all right!
Anything above 1 minute 50

685
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,640
we always say is quick. OK. I beat
Gambon, that's a first. You beat
Michael Gambon, Alan Davies,

686
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,040
Steve Coogan. For someone
who's never driven a manual car,

687
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,640
and only been driving a week,
it was amazing!

688
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,760
Thanks! Now, best of luck
with your new film. Thank you.

689
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,400
Ladies and gentlemen, Sienna Miller!
Thank you!

690
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,680
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
Thank you! Was that all right?

691
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,480
Now, tonight we are in France,

692
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,040
demonstrating the virtues
of rear-wheel drive with one
of our Cheap Car Challenges.

693
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,280
When we left the action, I'd crashed
into a piano, and we were on our way
to a ski resort in the Alps.

694
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,240
All three of our £1,500 cars
are running well,

695
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,960
so none of us is in danger of needing
the back-up car, a Morris Marina,

696
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,360
which is a good thing,

697
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,720
because we're bound to break it,
and the Morris Marina Owners Club

698
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,840
already sort of hates us

699
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,800
and wants to kill us.

700
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,960
All is perfect
aboard the mighty Nissan.

701
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,640
All was perfect in the Porsche too.

702
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,520
However...

703
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,360
There's something coming out
from under the bonnet.

704
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,440
Did they forecast fog in your car
this morning, James?

705
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,640
It's like driving through a horror
film. Chaps, my car's started
making some really bad noises.

706
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,120
Started?!

707
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,880
'We had to pull over.'

708
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,240
# Marina... #
LAUGHTER

709
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,200
I wish this was smelly-vision,
because you would not...

710
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,520
That smell of a car. You know when
a body's been in a flat for
nine months

711
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,640
and people ring up and say...
That's a distinctive smell.
..there is a smell.

712
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,640
You really think you're gonna get
that going? Yeah. You're just not!

713
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,600
'We decided to help...

714
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,000
'by leaving.'

715
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,480
I'm just thinking, on these big
foreign Top Gear cheap car
challenges,

716
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,680
the cars always make it.

717
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,080
And James won't want to be the one
that lets the side down.

718
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,560
I don't know if you can see this,
but I've got some fairly dramatic

719
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,600
wheel wobble going on here.
RATTLING

720
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,120
I can fix this.

721
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,400
I can fix anything.

722
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,480
'With my new mending powers,

723
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,880
'I worked out
I'd lost a wheel weight.'

724
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,080
How much, 5g, something like that,
possibly? Goodbye, Jeremy.

725
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,280
'Hammond decided to help
by leaving.'

726
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,680
It just needs some weight.

727
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,160
Funny euros!
They're like wheel weights.

728
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,640
Sometimes, I amaze even myself

729
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,800
with my brilliance.

730
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,200
Gaffer tape them on.

731
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,040
Let's go.

732
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,680
It's worked!

733
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,840
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

734
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,320
At 60, the exact speed it was bad,

735
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,800
it's now perfect.

736
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,000
RATTLING STARTS AGAIN

737
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,120
However, at 62...

738
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,960
'At the next town, Hammond and I
re-grouped to wait for May.'

739
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,720
Can I just say, we've now been
waiting, what, half an hour?
Easy, yeah.

740
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,760
Now, if it's... More, 40 minutes.

741
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,040
If it's 40 minutes,
he must have mended the Capri.

742
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,160
Because if it was ruined, he would
have just got in the Marina,

743
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,000
so he must be in the Capri.

744
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,360
'My logic was exactly 100%...

745
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,400
'wrong.'

746
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,200
HE'S HERE!

747
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,040
Oh, God, it's Pinky and Perky!

748
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,200
He's failed!
Let's embrace the failure.

749
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,720
That suits you. Thank you. It does,
I'm sorry. You know we've had
problems

750
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,080
with the Morris Marina Owners' Club?
Problems?! They declared a fatwa
on us! Exactly. This car... Mmm.

751
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,160
..you have to understand this,
belonged to the wife of
the president. Right.

752
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,400
Just take care of it. Your comments
should be addressed to... Ahem! Why?

753
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,520
I don't want you to drive into this.
This used to belong...

754
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,160
to the wife of the President of...
Where was it? France. ..France.

755
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:42,280
'Hammond really wasn't impressed
with James' new wheels.'

756
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,360
I'll guarantee that nothing exciting,
vibrant, dynamic,

757
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,800
new, creative,

758
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,000
hopeful or beneficial in any way
to humanity has ever been done,

759
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,360
thought of, or driven to
in that drab,

760
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,760
dreary, entirely beige,
wilfully awful pile of misery!

761
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,800
Oh, come on, it's not so bad.

762
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,160
Erm, it's well-equipped.

763
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,440
No, it isn't well-equipped,
to be honest, it's got one dial.

764
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,520
It's tastefully upholstered.

765
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,960
It isn't tastefully upholstered,
really, it's brown.

766
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,400
But the seats are velour,
and look how well it's worn.

767
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,040
'Soon, we began to climb into
the mountains.'

768
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,720
Now, look at this. We have snow.

769
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,920
And if we have ice, I have
the chassis to deal with it.

770
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,440
This is more like it!

771
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,240
Don't tell me rear-wheel drive
isn't more fun on this road.

772
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,920
TYRES SCREECH

773
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,520
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

774
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,880
Come on, Hammond, live with this!

775
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,200
This is brilliant.

776
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
£1,500.

777
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,600
Drives down here, hardly uses
any fuel and now look at it!

778
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,120
Belting up an alp.

779
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,240
TYRES SCREECH

780
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,320
Twisty, this is where the
Morris Marina comes into its own.

781
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,560
CLUNKING

782
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,800
'Meanwhile, further up the road,

783
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,880
'I'd had an idea.'

784
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,200
Now, remember, viewers,
Hammond broke my drum kit. So,

785
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,760
as he waits down there
for James to arrive...

786
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,600
Oh, God!
JEREMY LAUGHS

787
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,600
What if it were to go down the hill?

788
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,600
Very funny!

789
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,800
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

790
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,480
Oh, I'm sorry(!) What do I do now?!

791
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,360
May's here. Oh, joy!

792
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,000
Did you break my drum kit?

793
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,240
Yes! Have you got a cold car now?
Not...

794
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,480
No, not cold...

795
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,920
I'm going to die!

796
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,320
Fantastic! Driving a car
that terrible...that old.

797
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,360
See his Targa roof? Yeah.
LAUGHTER

798
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,880
It may have fallen in the raging
torrents. I've no idea how(!)

799
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,320
The faster I make him drive,
the colder he'll be.

800
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,960
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

801
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,160
That's quite cold now.

802
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,960
Really very cold, in fact.

803
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,720
That does mean war, I'd say.

'As night fell, we reached
Val Thorens, still wondering

805

'what our final challenge might be.'

00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,720
Rear-wheel drive...

807

'The answer lay
just round the next bend.'

809
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,040

'It was. And the next morning,
the producers had entered us

Watch this.

815
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,000
Agh!

I applied even more speed.'

helped us onto the track,

some practice.'

00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,560
Easy.

You blithering idiot!
Don't keep doing that to me!

827
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,640
How is this racing?
It's just fighting!

828
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,360
It's just not racing.

829
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,680
Aah! Aah! No!

830
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,840
Oi, do you mind?!

831
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,920
Oh, I'm gonna hit the Marina!

we stormed into the first corner.'

Yes, I'm winning, I'm winning!

834
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,400
Get out of the way! I'm not winning!

835
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:18,280
This doesn't work. It's impossible.
It's a very slow accident in slow
motion. Could we get snow tyres?

836
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,880
Yes. Spiky things. Yes.
Snow tyres...

837
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,360

May I look inside your car, James?
Please do. It'll still be awful!

Look at that! Can I say briefly,
from the outside,

854
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,880
it does actually look quite good.
It looks quite serious.

855

And then, Hammond... Yes?

856
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,320

Yes, I'm sitting in a snowdrift.

861
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,480
How did you get your roll cage in,
in the end? Well, work.

862
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,960
I've got door bars. Oh, well,
that's a very thorough set-up.
It's a very thorough job.

863
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,200
Now, I'm looking forward to this,
because I think a Porsche
will look good drifting.

864
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,640
You couldn't do this
with front-wheel drive.

865

'We were feeling confident.

00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,920
'And when we saw the cars our French
rivals had, that confidence grew.'

867
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,720
These are all just little hatchbacks.
That's a Kia.

868
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,440
And a BMW 1 Series.

869
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,560
I've got a V6 and a twin turbo.
This is the crib sheet, right,
on these cars, yes?

870
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,200
They have a top speed of...

871
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,440
80.

872
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,480
Even your Marina
can go faster than that, 80.

873
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,400
And it says here, "Cars rarely
exceed 50-60 mph during a race."

874
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,440
Wow, look at that! I haven't got one
of those. Did you fit one of those on
your Marina? No. A windscreen wiper

875
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,320
on the side. They're obviously
expecting to go sideways... Look!
..with their wayward handling.

876
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,040
'The other drivers -
including a youth

877
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,680
'and an old bloke - didn't look like
much of a threat either.

'But then I spotted
a familiar face.'

879
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,360
Where? There. It's Olivier Panis.

880
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,520
What, the designer?

881
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,000
Please tell me
you've heard of Olivier Panis?

882
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,200
Panis is a type of Italian bread,
isn't it?

883
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,080
Formula One racing driver.
Formula One.

884
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,760
Won the Monaco Grand Prix.
Oh, I knew that. Really? Won it.

885
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,440
I suppose it's unfair to ask for
tips when we're gonna thrash you,
but... Not at all.

886
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,080
..what would you say we had to do
to not hit things?

887
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:10,960
Well, it's quite hard, because
this car is four-wheel... Four-wheel
drive? Drive, yeah, and turning.

888
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,160
The rear-wheel also turning... Oh.
..it means to turn the car
much quicker.

889
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,320
Like yours. Yeah.

890
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,480
It's very, very sporting of you to
let us bring Porsche, Nissan 300ZX.

891
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,640
Much more powerful cars.
And the Morris. And the Morris.
It's like bringing, well, longbows

892
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,920
to a bow and arrow fight.

893
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,520
Yeah, it is, thank you. I thought
you were gonna say something really
inappropriate then. I did wonder!

894
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,840
I mentioned Agincourt once,
but I think I got away with it.

I cannot believe
I'm in a race with Olivier Panis,

898
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,480
France's second best racing driver.

899
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,680
Quite often, racers find it difficult
when they get too hot.

900
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,560
This won't happen today.

901
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,760
Here's my plan. I'm gonna take the
one in front on the left-hand side,

902
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,960
cut across to the right,
then I'll be alongside Panis
for the first tight right-hander.

903
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,880
He's bound to swing left,
they all do that in Formula One.

904
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm going right.
That'll surprise him.

905
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,760
Here I go!

906
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,680
We're off!

907
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,080
They may have got away from us
a bit there. How did they do that?!

908
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,840
'It turned out
they weren't crummy hatchbacks.

909

920
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,840
He's taken me as well.

921
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,800
That's right, put me in there.

922
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,160
No, no, really, help yourself(!)
We're being humiliated!

sideways monkeys!

925
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,480

particularly annoying.

A Morris.

00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,600
I'm gonna have to kill myself!

972
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,160
Ah...

973
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,040
I believe I won. Hammond, you idiot!
What?!

974
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,200
You threw my roof away,
and as a result, the inside
of my windscreen froze up.

975
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,160
Every time I went round a corner,
there was this wildly fishtailing
Datsun!

976
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:12,360
Every time I went smoothly round
a corner, there was some idiot
in a multi-blue Porsche ramming me

977
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,880
and sticking me in the ditch!
I believe this is what's know as
racing drivers' excuses, isn't it?

978
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,080
No, I'll tell you what I believe.
What? I believe that as a result of
our... Erm, exuberance.

979
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,960
..revenge... Yes.

980
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,560
..we must now conclude

981
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,080
that the best rear-wheel drive car

982
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,840
that money can buy
is the Morris Marina!

983
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,640
Yes! And do you know what? What?

984
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,680
I think the Morris Marina
Owners' Club are gonna be
thrilled with that.

985
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,320
I think it will finally make amends.
They'll forgive us. They will,
finally! Finally.

986
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

987
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,280
What are we gonna do?!
What are we gonna do?!

988
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:03,560
We're gonna be killed and eaten
by Morrismen! Look, we did explain
in the last series that we're based

989
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,360
next to an air-freight piano removal
company. Absolutely.

990
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:11,040
They're called Careless Air. Yes.
And now, they have a French
sister company

991
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:17,520
called Piano Avion Malheureusement.
Yes, I read about that in Helicopter
News - they're based in Val Thorens.

992
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,200
Exactly. So, if you're watching,
Carla Bruni, OK, wife of
the President of France,

993
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,320
it wasn't our fault your Marina got
broken. No. And now, gentlemen,

994
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,760
if I might make a suggestion...

995
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,880
run! Yeah, good one. See you
next week, everyone! Bye! Bye!
