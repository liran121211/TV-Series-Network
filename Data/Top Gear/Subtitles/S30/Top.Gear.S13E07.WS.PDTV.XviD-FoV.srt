1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,040
Tonight, Richard has a crisis...

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,920
..some sheep on our track,

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,960
and James and I go
to the lavatory.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,080
Good evening! Hello! Hello,
everybody. Thank you very much!

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,720
Thank you very much! Thank you!

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,960
Thank you!

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,880
Yes, and welcome to the
final show in the series.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,440
AUDIENCE: Ah!

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,280
Sad. Now, as I'm sure you know,

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,600
we don't often do consumer advice
on this show. But tonight, we are.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,360
Because, if you were in the market
for a large, fast, spacious,

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,400
executive saloon car, you'd imagine
that you'd be spoilt for choice.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,720
Me, too.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,760
However, Richard Hammond,
who is quite mad,

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
has decided that every single one
of them has a fatal flaw.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,560
It really doesn't matter
which one you pick.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,640
Take this, for example - the Audi S4.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,320
Yes, it's fast, and it's
well built, and it's safe.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,120
But it has one big problem -

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,280
it's built entirely for businessmen.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
And real businessmen are not
The Apprentice,

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,200
Dragons' Den, Richard Branson, all
helicopters and hostile takeovers.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,240
They're actually quite dull.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,000
And work in Swindon.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,960
Their cars aren't cars.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,320
They're uniforms -
silver or black paint,

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,720
maybe a splash of wood on the dash,
and that's your lot.

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,200
It doesn't matter where you go -
Audi, Mercedes, BMW - they're all
so obsessed with what each other

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,240
is doing that they all end up
making exactly the same car.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,520
So, if you don't want a businessman's
sports saloon, what do you do?

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,000
Especially if, like me,
you're a bit of a...

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, what we need right now is
something to come and save the day.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
This looks promising.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
If you were watching
earlier in the series,

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
you'll have seen Jeremy
going on about a car

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,560
that sounds like it's having
a Lady Chatterley crisis.

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,960
And this is it.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,480
The Vauxhall VXR8 Bathurst edition.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,040
The interesting bit
there is the Bathurst bit.

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
Because this car is Australian,

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,480
and the Bathurst is Australia's
most famous race.

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,560
Basically, it's a place where
Holden and Ford fans go to
have a massive fist fight.

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,240
And then in the interval,
when the paramedics go in,

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,560
sometimes a car race breaks out.

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,240
And this car, with its
supercharged 6.2 litre V8,

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,800
is one hell of a fist fight.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
I just love the sound
of a supercharger.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,680
That whine, you can hear it now,
that shriek.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,560
It's an Outback choir, you've got
the tenor of the supercharger,

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
and then the base of the V8.

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,240
And it gets better, this button here,
it says "Bimodal" on it.

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,960
And if I press that,
it adjusts valves and things,

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,040
in the exhaust system,
and makes it louder.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,920
What this car does is go to 11.

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
I fear that anyone
who likes the Bathurst

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,200
is probably quite a bad businessman.

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,320
The world of PowerPoints
will not take you seriously.

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,080
But the consolation is, when your
business does eventually go bust,

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,120
there's no way in hell will the
bailiff will ever catch you! Ha-ha!

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,920
0-60 takes just 4.6 seconds.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,600
Top speed, a limited 155mph.

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,480
Of course,
the Germans will do that, too.

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,040
But they won't dish out as
much fun when you do this.

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,520
HE LAUGHS

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,600
Apparently,
the suspension is adjustable.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,320
Presumably from oversteer, to,
"Oh, dear, we've just crashed!"

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
RICHARD LAUGHS

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,360
Just astonishing!

69
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm sorry, if this car doesn't
move you, that is your problem,

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
not the car's. It's just a fact.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,160
It costs £45,000, and for that,
you get almost limitless vulgarity.

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,760
No spoiler is too big.
No vent is too gaping.

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,200
No supercharger too red.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,080
In short, the perfect fast saloon
for anyone who's not a businessman.

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm thinking, actors, vicars,
professors, erm, children.

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,640
But what if you're a
builder or a farmer,

77
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,440
or anyone who has to move
around loads of stuff?

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,800
They really are in a petrol-head
wasteland, because often as not,

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,000
they have to drive about in
something as slow and dull as this.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,760
I'm sure it's practical,
but 0-60 comes up in...

81
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,960
well, I've been on the go some time
and it hasn't happened yet.

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,880
And that's just not fair.

83
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,680
Ideally, what you need is a
combination of that...and that.

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,600
If only such a thing existed.

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
And for the second time today,

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,160
unfortunately, it's Australia
that comes to the rescue.

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,360
This is called the Maloo, which,
in Aborigine, means thunder.

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,840
Now, strictly speaking,
because it's Australian,

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,480
this isn't a pick-up, it's a ute.

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,840
And you can now buy it in
this country for £37,000,

91
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
which sounds like quite a lot.

92
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,600
But you haven't seen yet how it
can enrich your life.

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,280
Say you're at the lights next to
the IT boy in his supercharged Audi.

94
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
ENGINES REV

95
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,640
In a normal pick-up,
when the lights went green,

96
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,000
he'd leave you in a cloud
of business dust.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,280
Not in this one.

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,120
Reining him in! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm sorry, fella!

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,080
This is the fastest ute in the world.

101
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,640
0-60, five seconds.
Top speed, limited to 155.

102
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,400
That means you can
worry people in 911s.

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,800
And it's all down to a huge
419 horsepower, 6.2 litre V8.

104
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,960
But that's enough maths. Time
for a quick ute history lesson.

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,440
It started in the 1930s,
when a farmer's wife wrote
to Ford of Australia,

106
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
complaining that there was no car
that could take her to church
on a Sunday,

107
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,960
and the pigs to market on a Monday.

108
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,720
The answer was, the ute,
and the Australians

109
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
have worshipped them ever since.

110
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,840
You might think that because it's
basically a piece of farm machinery

111
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,400
with a big engine, drag racing
is all it can do. Not so.

112
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,600
The Maloo loves corners.

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,360
In fact, it gets a bit carried away.

114
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,560
Ha-ha!

115
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,960
Yep, there's no weight on the
back end, so it is a bit lively!

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,440
And adding weight to the back
doesn't work that well, either.

117
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,960
Oh, no!

118
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,240
My hay-based solution system
needs refining, but the fact is,

119
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,160
the next time you wake up and realise
that you're not a businessman,

120
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,400
but you like a fast car...

121
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,120
..remember, the Aussies
are here to help.

122
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
I had a good point,
it's a good point.

123
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,000
Is that your idea of
consumer advice? Yes.

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,040
You really are a steak and kidney
lock opener, aren't you? Oh, yes.

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
But we must now find how fast
these cars go round our track.

126
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,080
And that of course means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,840
Some say that he cut
that man's hair.

128
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,360
And that if HE compensated a soldier
for getting wounded, he wouldn't
try to take it all back again.

129
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,080
CHEERING

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,840
All we know is,
he's called the Stig!

131
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,520
And they're off.

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,840
Extraordinary whining from
the Bathurst, just distant

133
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,320
thunder from the Maloo,
as they go down to the first corner.

134
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,440
Straightaway, the front heavy
ute is getting frisky.

135
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,400
Bathurst responding, with a slide!

136
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,760
Oh, my God, how many bagpipes
are we hearing there? Two? Seven?

137
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,000
One, with a hole in it?

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,240
He's round Chicago
and now we're at Hammerhead.

139
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,000
Maloo does not look like the easiest
thing in the world to drive.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,360
And the Bathurst is just a
supercharged portable drift machine.

141
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,720
Look at it! Fantastic.

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,800
That is literally the most painful
drone I've heard

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,560
since James tried to explain
fuel-injection to me.

144
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,320
Two corners left.

145
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,640
Bathurst's really getting its
tail out. And now, if we look,

146
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,200
the Maloo is as well! Sideways
cars from an upside-down country!

147
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

148
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,480
OK. You first, Hammond.
OK. Your pick-up truck.

149
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,600
My pick-up truck did it in 1.27.1.

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,160
It's as fast as an Aston Martin DB9.

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,800
That's unbelievable!

152
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,960
What a car!

153
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,440
Hang on, the Bathurst...

154
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,800
the Bathurst did it in 1.26.3.

155
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,400
So it's about the same as a BMW M5.

156
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,920
And that really does make
it the perfect car

157
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,880
for anyone whose business is
selling pegs and heather.

158
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
And now the news and the big
news this week is a new Ferrari.

159
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,680
Here it is. It's the F430
Scuderia convertible.

160
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,920
And if you are one of the 499 people
who have ordered one of those,

161
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,640
all we have to say to you is,
"You big daft cock."

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,960
Big mistake. Error.
A massive mistake.

163
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,800
Because while you were doing that,
Ferrari were working on this.

164
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,160
This is the replacement. Well,
yes, exactly. That's the 458 Italia.

165
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,680
And I have to say, from the front,
it looks absolutely exquisite,

166
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,280
but from the back, it looks even
exquisiter. How do you feel now?

167
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,240
How do you feel now?

168
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,360
It's just beautiful. And what's
more, this is fantastic to drive.

169
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,040
How can you possibly know that?

170
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,200
Nobody's driven it yet.

171
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,520
Because, a-ha! History teaches us
this, because every single time

172
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,320
the Ferrari Formula One team
is doing well, their road cars
are rubbish.

173
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,640
And every time their Formula One
car is doing badly, their road
cars are brilliant.

174
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,800
And this year,
do you see what I'm saying?

175
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
They can't win anything,
even an egg-and-spoon race.

176
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
He's right. The problem is,

177
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,520
if you've only got 100 people
working for you

178
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,200
and 50 of them are completely
bogged down designing a
windscreen wiper for a road car,

179
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,480
you haven't got enough people
left to win the championship.

180
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,840
And do you know why? Formula One
cars are designed by men and men
cannot do two things at once.

181
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,960
No, that's a good point. We can't.
Am I right? Yes, exactly.

182
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,920
We'll admit that,
we cannot multi-task.

183
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,120
"Don't ask me now, I'm
putting this pen away.

184
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,760
"Now you can talk. Hold on.

185
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,200
"OK, talk now. I breathed in.
Hold, I'm breathing out."
We can't do two...

186
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
Just breathing in and breathing out.
Is enough for us to be occupied.
Absolutely.

187
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,720
Now, people, can I just get serious
for a moment? Would you mind?

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,640
It's just that we've heard that
over in Amsterdam at night,
various drunken louts,

189
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,600
there's no other word for them,
have been picking up Smart cars,

190
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,520
and throwing them into the canal.
We've got a picture here.

191
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,880
Seriously. No, no, no...really.
Apparently, it only takes four
people

192
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,560
to pick one of those things up
and just lob it in the drink.

193
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,720
Now, I bring this up because
I'm just slightly worried

194
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,240
that over here in England people
might start picking up those
little electric gee-whizzes,

195
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,680
and throwing them in the river.
Can you imagine how awful that
would be for Mr Weird-beard

196
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,440
if his pride and joy were to
find itself in the Thames?

197
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,280
I really cannot urge you
enough not to do that.

198
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,760
Thinking about it, if you did lob
an electric car into a river,
wouldn't it kill all the fish?

199
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,080
Zzz! And they'd all float on the top.

200
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,000
Would it do that?

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,920
Are there any electricians here?

202
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,400
Yes. Would it electrocute...

203
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Why aren't you at work?

204
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,720
Would it electrocute the fish?

205
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,240
No. Why?

206
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
The voltage is too
low and the amps...

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,040
So it turns out it's fine to
throw a gee-whizz into a canal.
Can't advise that. Yeah, it's OK.

208
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm not convinced by that,
though, because I think
electricity is a mystery.

209
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
It is.

210
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,560
I don't actually believe in it.
You don't believe in electricity?

211
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,240
No, nobody really understands it.

212
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,120
What you are witnessing
here is Asperger's made real.

213
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,200
Is that what makes my
wee smell funny? No!

214
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,280
Oh, no, that's asparagus.

215
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,680
Now, you may have heard a
few days ago that Michael Schumacher

216
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
is standing in for the
injured Felipe Massa, OK?

217
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,760
Interesting timing. This is the
last programme in our series.

218
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,840
No more cars to test till
November on the track.

219
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,120
Suddenly, he's available.

220
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,280
We're not saying anything,
it's just those are the facts.

221
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Those are simply the facts.

222
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,800
Actually, I do want to
talk about Felipe Massa.

223
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,560
Obviously, he was injured
in the Hungarian Grand Prix
when a spring hit him

224
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,840
in the face at 140mph.
I'm just staggered he wasn't killed!

225
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,880
Yes, because he weighs about
the same as what, a bag of sugar?

226
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,040
The thing is, he was wearing one
of those new regulation carbon-fibre

227
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,960
crash helmets and they are
unbelievably strong.

228
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,400
Because the injuries he's got,
as far as I can work out, are
very similar to the ones you got.

229
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Yes, possibly, yes.
Frontal lobe damage,

230
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,520
so that's personality, emotional
control, spatial awareness, all of
that. Hopefully getting better.

231
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,760
Does that mean that if he
gets better - and, God,
we're all praying he does -

232
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,120
that he's going to become an
irritating little arse?

233
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
I mean, it's a thought.

234
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,840
It could. You never know
with brain damage.

235
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,440
Or he could come back to work
and discover the people he
works with are,

236
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,480
well, they've become quite
incredibly irritating.

237
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,280
And quite fat. It can happen.

238
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,840
Anyway, look, Felipe, I
know you're not watching

239
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,360
because you're in Italy or wherever,
but we are thinking of you.

240
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
Everybody here wishes you a
speedy recovery. Good luck.

241
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,640
Now, you know we used to say in the
olden days that all bad drivers

242
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,840
drove Volvos, particularly bikers,
OK? Now this was a good thing,

243
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,040
because you knew where the bad
drivers were.

244
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,440
You saw a Volvo, you knew it
was a bad driver. All was well.

245
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,280
Then Volvo started making good cars,
the T5 and so on,

246
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,040
the bad drivers dispersed.
We didn't know what they were in.
So what are the bad drivers in?

247
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,800
I think quite a few
ended up in Micras.

248
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,680
Nissan Micras?
You might be right, yeah.

249
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,520
I think quite a few
ended up in Kia Sedonas.

250
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,040
I think Korean cars in general.
If I see one coming towards me,
I pull over,

251
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,280
get out, hide behind a
tree until it's gone.

252
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,960
You just don't want
to take any chances.

253
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,560
The thing is this, if you buy a
rubbish car, what you are saying
is, "I have no interest in cars."

254
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,000
If you have no interest in cars,
you have none in driving. If you
have no interest in something,

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it means you're no good at it,
which means you must have your
driving licence taken away.

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,560
I went on the internet this week
to compile a series of clips

257
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,000
of people having parking accidents,
you know, minor bumps and scrapes.

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,600
See if you can spot something
that all the cars have in common?

259
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,160
Here we go.
Now what's that? That's a...

260
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,520
Which one are we looking at?
That one? That's a Hondo.

261
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,760
We're not talking here about a
good driver, are we? Because
they've got the pedals muddled up.

262
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,400
OK, right, it's a Skoda!

263
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,920
Big gate there. Oh dear, no.

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,040
Worst car in the world, is it...
It is, it's a Neon.

265
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,360
I believe this to
be a Chrysler Neon.

266
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,480
Anybody driving one of those,
take their licence away
or that will happen.

267
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,760
It's incredible!
I think that is a Pontiac.

268
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes! That's gone wrong.

269
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
Now here we are, we're
in Britain for this one.

270
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,040
That's a bad driver, he's
got a bus but he's made it.

271
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,440
And here comes the Honda! Oh! No!

272
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,200
It's a perfectly valid theory
because if you had absolutely
no interest whatsoever in how

273
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,960
the human body worked, you wouldn't
get a job as a surgeon, would you?

274
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,800
If you haven't got the interest,
you can't do it. You shouldn't be
allowed to do it.

275
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,080
Exactly. I mean, it would be like
asking him to cook Sunday lunch.

276
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,120
Could you cook a Sunday lunch?
Yeah, you boil the meat
or whatever... You see?

277
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm not interested in food, so
I'm not interested in cooking.

278
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,000
There you are. You wouldn't ask him,
because he's not interested,
to cook you any food.

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,880
You wouldn't ask me to do the
washing up, you wouldn't ask
James to direct a porn film.

280
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,160
You say that. I think I'd actually
direct quite a good porn film.

281
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,680
If you directed a porn film,
it would be you arriving

282
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,200
at the house of the woman in
the stockings and negligee.

283
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,920
"I've come to fix your boiler."
And then you'd just fix it.

284
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,640
Might do. What's wrong with that?

285
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,440
Now, that is the end of the news. So
we are going to move on with this.

286
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,160
Ever since 1963, when Volkswagen
invented the concept

287
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,360
of modern television advertising,
they have been king of the hill. OK?

288
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,040
And they still are,
thanks to ads like this.

289
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,320
This is the man
who put a million on black...

290
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,280
and it came up red.

291
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,440
This is the man who
married a sex kitten,

292
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,680
just as she turned into a cat.

293
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,880
This is the man who moved into gold,

294
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
just as the clever money moved out.

295
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,000
This is the man...who drives...

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,320
a Volkswagen.

297
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,160
Everyone must have something in life
he can rely on.

298
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,880
Now that's all very well, but you
see, every week we make films in
which the clouds go backwards,

299
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,280
a super car spins around, metaphors
get tortured, and they last for
what, five minutes, six minutes?

300
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,720
Yes, quite. So how hard can it be
for us to make a car advert,
which is over in 30 seconds?

301
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,880
Well, the producers decided
that James and I should find out.

302
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,920
Feeling like candidates for
The Apprentice, the two of
us got dressed up as ad men,

303
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,040
and went to the glittering West
London offices of Goodyear,
Stickleback and Bunsen burner.

304
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,240
There, the ad execs showed us
the car we'd be advertising - a
diesel version of the new Scirocco.

305
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,600
What would be your suggestions,
to do a commercial for a Volkswagen?

306
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,400
At the heart of all good
Volkswagen advertising,
there is always a product truth.

307
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,200
It's not sort of flimflam, it's
always based on a truth that
comes directly from the product.

308
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,280
But you never did one
that said, "The new Beetle -

309
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,640
"celebrating over half a century of
Europe's greatest mass murderer."

310
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,680
No, cos you pick on a truth
that matters, you idiot. What?

311
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
You pick on a truth that matters.

312
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,040
I think what you're saying
is, if you take Peugeot,
"The drive of your life,"

313
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,720
that line has nothing to do
with any Peugeot product,
all of which are dreadful.

314
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
It's just an ad man went, "The drive
of your life" is a good line.

315
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,600
That's that point there about
you've got to look for it,
you've got to try the product out,

316
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,320
you've got to drive it,
experience it, and find out what
the real truths of the product are.

317
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
We ought to go to drive the car.

318
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,840
At first, things were looking good.

319
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,920
The clever thing about this is,
it doesn't really cost all
that much more than a Golf.

320
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:16,160
So, it costs the same as the Golf,
but you stand out because you've got
a Scirocco, which is better-looking.

321
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,240
Quality is exceptional.

322
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,880
Just the fit and finish of
everything in here is superb. Yes.

323
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,360
It's practical for a coupe.

324
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,080
I don't know of any coupe
currently made that's got more
space in the back then this has.

325
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Right, let's try some sporty
driving and see if it's sporty.
I'm gonna put it into sport.

326
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,880
And here, on twisting,
country lanes, there weren't
any problems, either.

327
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,440
Brakes?
The brakes are good, actually.

328
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,080
The brakes are good,
steering's good.

329
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,680
So what you're saying is, as a
sporty car, it's pretty good? Yes.

330
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,760
But, we then got
to the elephant in the corner.

331
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,720
Right, come on.
Is it fast? Put your foot down.

332
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,000
BOTH: Not.

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,120
So, that's a good five seconds of
absolutely nothing in fourth gear.

334
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,800
But if I change to third, OK...

335
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,920
Right. ..then I run out of puff, so
I've got to go back to fourth again!

336
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,520
It's the same as all diesels,
you have just a morsel,
and then it's gone.

337
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,560
So, performance? No. No.

338
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,040
The bottom line is this -
this particular Scirocco
is a good car, ruined.

339
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,080
We both agree, do we not?
The car is a stupid idea.

340
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,280
A car that looks like this
should have a petrol engine.

341
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,440
Let's make that absolutely clear.
Our personal view is that you
should not buy this car.

342
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,920
However, we are now charged
with selling it.

343
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,480
So, what? What?

344
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Back in Apprentice land,
we outlined the problem.

345
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,160
As far as I can make out, the
Volkswagen Scirocco is a pretty car,
and what they've done is,

346
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,240
they've put the engine
from a canal boat in it.

347
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,040
And we have to somehow make
that seem like a good thing.

348
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,280
The idea of building that sort
of car with that sort of engine
deserves the strap line,

349
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,200
"What the bloody hell
were you thinking of?"

350
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Which isn't really going
to work as an advert.

351
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,080
It's not, no. You're starting from
a negative, where you should

352
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,400
start from a positive. You're
saying, "You've ruined a Scirocco."

353
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,280
Whereas, you should be saying,
"You've improved diesel." Ah!

354
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,960
So that you make diesel more
exciting, rather than make
Scirocco less exciting.

355
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,880
Edward de Bono here has hit
it on the head. We've made
diesel more interesting.

356
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,760
Not VW Scirocco less interesting.

357
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,440
You see, that's why he's
sitting there.

358
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,080
And we're sitting here
in rubbish clothes.

359
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,800
James and I then tried
some blue-sky thinking.

360
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,280
Imagine, if it just said,
"Volkswagen Scirocco," across
the screen, "Diesel."

361
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,320
And then a polar bear just
stood there and just went, "BOOM!"

362
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,520
No. I'm going wrong.

363
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,320
What if we do a campaign based
around the idea of great
ecclesiastical figures,

364
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,920
from Thomas Becket down - would have
driven, had they had the chance,
the Scirocco diesel?

365
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Cos it would be shit.

366
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,280
OK, what about the car just
approaching in the distance,

367
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,640
so you've got the advertising stuff
with the road, that famous road that
they use in Spain,

368
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,360
where it winds round and the
hills...you've got swelling music,
and the Scirocco.

369
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
No, that's a cliche.
I would just stop right there.

370
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
Are you listening to this, James?

371
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,920
An advert has to say almost nothing.
It's just got to go...WOW!

372
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,600
Hasn't it? And BANG!
With a huge explosion.

373
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,560
Well, point five on how to do a
Volkswagen ad is, "Speak to the
reader, don't shout, he can hear you.

374
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,360
"Especially if you talk sense."

375
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,680
You don't blow his head off.
It's important that the advertising
has intelligence.

376
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,000
It can't just be explosions.

377
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,200
Feeling like ad men,
we went to the lavatory.

378
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,040
And then we went to the track,
where I let Jeremy make our
first intelligent advertisement.

379
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,600
The new VW Scirocco Diesel.

380
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,960
It's explosive!

381
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,040
What d'you think of that?
It's rubbish.

382
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,680
Why is it rubbish?
It's not funny, and it's not true.

383
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,000
We've been to see those clever
blokes in the agency, they've told
us what VW advertising is like,

384
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,760
how can you hint at 55 miles per
gallon, with an explosion?

385
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,080
Well, what have you got?

386
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,760
The new VW Scirocco Diesel
produces 138 horsepower,

387
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,600
and 236lb/ft of torque.

388
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,320
So, it's faster
than you might think.

389
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,360
And there's room in the back
for your mother-in-law.

390
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,400
Unfortunately!

391
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,240
'The Scirocco TDI - your
mother-in-law will love it.'

392
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,880
That's the worst advert I've
ever seen. Your criticisms?

393
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,480
Way, way too much information.
And mother-in-law jokes, James,
I mean...

394
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm identifying my market.

395
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,680
They're old people,
old people made mother-in-law jokes,
that'll make them feel useful.

396
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,080
Why didn't you get someone
blacked-up going,
"The Camptown Races"?

397
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,760
Cos they used to watch the
Black And White Minstrel Show?

398
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,760
James, it's not an idea.
You can't tell mother-in-law jokes.

399
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,120
I fear you and I, we're going down
two very separate roads here.

400
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,200
James decided to do more
blue-sky thinking,

401
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,640
while I rushed off to make an ad
that had no explosions in it.

402
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,280
Here we go.

403
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,800
Yeah, I was in a terrible accident.

404
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,160
Well, I ran out of petrol,
I was on the hard shoulder

405
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,680
waiting for the breakdown van,
and I was hit by this massive truck.

406
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Yeah, that happens a lot.

407
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
But it won't happen to me.

408
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,080
I've got the new Scirocco Diesel.

409
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,760
It does 55 mpg!

410
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
'The new Scirocco TDI -

411
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,760
'for people who value their arms.'

412
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,120
So, the VW Scirocco driver
is deeply unpleasant?

413
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,920
He's not deeply unpleasant,
it's funny!

414
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,600
Children love a bit of that.
Old people love a bit of blood.

415
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,720
Old people won't like that.
It reminds them of the Blitz.

416
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,160
Think of the customer.
You're saying, "Buy this car

417
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,520
"if you're smug and you revel
in other people's misfortune."
You can't put that on a car ad!

418
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,960
He's offering him advice! He's
saying, "Get a Scirocco Diesel..."

419
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,640
It's a bit late, his arm's come off!
He'll have the other arm!

420
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,760
OK, close-up on
Jeremy's tongue, please.

421
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,040
We pressed on with some more ideas.

422
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,280
She loves me not... Action!

423
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,440
I bet you any money
this stays intact.

424
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,400
Did it? No.

425
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,240
Right, right, right.
Right, right, right. Left! Left!

426
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,040
James then decided
we needed a jingle.

427
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,800
# Diesel Scirocco

428
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,840
# Gets you down to Morocco

429
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,040
# On one fill-up of diesel

430
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,400
# At 55 mpg-iesel... #

431
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,480
Then I decided we
didn't need a jingle.

432
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,840
Yes! They're here!
Imagine now, James.

433
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,920
Explosion! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

434
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Massive fire coming
from the gunship...

435
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,960
Left, left, left!
Right, right! Left, left, left!

436
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,640
Oh, for God's sake!

437
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,040
Action. The New Scirocco Diesel.

438
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,080
Truly biblical economy.

439
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,680
This isn't working, is it?
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,040
Finally, after much trial and
error, we had an ad that we
could show to the Alan Sugars.

441
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,960
Check this out.

442
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,760
This is the new Scirocco TDI.

443
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,560
It's pretty fast.

444
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,600
But a Mazda RX8
will kick its backside.

445
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,960
And an Alfa Brera
will vomit in its face.

446
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,000
They'll have to stop
for fuel, though.

447
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,240
And you won't.

448
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,280
Get ahead.
Get a new Scirocco TDI.

449
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,920
Stunned is the word I'm... The first
thing I'd say is that,
how fast is that Scirocco going?

450
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,880
Do you ever see car adverts with cars
going fast in them?

451
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,080
So, you aren't allowed to show,
in a car advert, a car going fast?

452
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,720
No. No? No.

453
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,000
Also, I suspect, with
some enhanced sound.

454
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No, we never... No. There's...
No, that was the real sound.

455
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,840
There's screeching tyres in there,
massively accelerating engine...
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

456
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,880
It's not just the driving, it's the
sound that you put in.

457
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,000
Happily, we had an idea
which would save the day.

458
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,040
We will go off this afternoon, and
I can mend that advert.

459
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,560
OK...

460
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,960
I believe we have a cure.

461
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,320
You remember the one yesterday...?
Yep.

462
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,520
How could we forget it?

463
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,280
This is the new Scirocco TDI.

464
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,880
It's pretty fast.

465
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,480
Get ahead, get a new Scirocco TDI.

466
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,240
You see, we've
addressed the speed issue.

467
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,120
No, you haven't. It says he's doing
29. The rest of the footage

468
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,720
of the car is exactly
the same, so there's no difference
in the promotion of speed whatsoever.

469
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,800
When we talked to you,
truth and honesty

470
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,280
were two of the things
we talked about,
and that feels dishonest.

471
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,080
Well, it's still going,
it was probably going 59.

472
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,200
And how fast were the other cars
going?

473
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,880
They were going 59
as well. So, twice as fast...

474
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,760
The rest of the ads didn't
go down that well, either.

475
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,240
THEME TUNE FROM MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE

476
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,600
# Common rail injection, you know
that's the new direction... #

477
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,320
The new Scirocco TDI,
for people who value their arms.

478
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,080
Don't you think that is tip-top?

479
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,760
No.

480
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:55,680
Right...
Desperate, I decided to show them
our remake of one of their classics.

481
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,280
This is the man who
put a million on black -

482
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,840
and it came up red.

483
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,040
This is the man
who married a sex kitten -
just as she turned into a cat.

484
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,240
This is the man
who moved into gold -

485
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,960
just as the clever money moved out.

486
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,680
If only he'd waited for the
new Scirocco TDI to go on sale.

487
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,440
The Scirocco TDI.

488
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,360
Life's not so bad.

489
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,400
Simple, tight...

490
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,360
You are showing in your ad there
a suicide. Yes.

491
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,320
You should be able to imagine that
the regulatory body does not allow
depictions of suicide.

492
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,480
I mean, it's pretty positive.

493
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,560
You either get shot through
the head or you have a VW.

494
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,440
Nick and Margaret invited
us to get out of their office
and go back to the drawing board.

495
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,680
Jesus Christ!

496
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,880
D'you know why an ad man won't look
out of the window in the morning?

497
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,280
No. Cos then he'd have
nothing to do in the afternoon.

498
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,040
But then, while Jeremy was
being ridiculous, I had an idea.

499
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,480
If we couldn't use speed,
why not set the ad in a location
where speed is impossible?

500
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,840
A funeral! Job one,
get ourselves a black Scirocco.

501
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,080
I couldn't help noticing, it's the
petrol one. We'll dub canal boat
noises on.

502
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm gonna talk to the mourners.

503
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,680
Yes, just get them in the car.

504
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,520
This is a tragedy, it's a loved one.

505
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,640
It will all be resolved in
the VW Scirocco Diesel.

506
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,360
ENGINE REVS AND TYRES SCREECH

507
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,760
Who's driving that...?
Who's driving the Scirocco?

508
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,640
Jeremy. Well,
he's got the wrong idea altogether.

509
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,560
My driving made James quite cross.

510
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Let's do the funeral thing
seriously, then, at the end,
we've got the message about the VW.

511
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,960
It's not complicated.

512
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,840
The funeral can be done seriously,
but there's nothing to stop a war
plane coming in the middle?

513
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,840
There's me. Cos I'm directing.
Soon, he was even more cross.
So, you're driving the hearse...?

514
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm driving the limousine...

515
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
EXPLOSION

516
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
Clarkson!

517
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
TYRES SCREECH

518
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,440
None of that is going in.

519
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,760
We're not doing
a comedy Carry On funeral,
we are doing a real funeral.

520
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,800
James and I couldn't even agree
on how to direct the actors.

521
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,160
OK, madam, this is where
we'd like you to cry.

522
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
In a dignified,

523
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,520
adult, genuine grief, rather than...

524
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,560
Take a good sniff
of this onion, ready?

525
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,720
There we go. There we go, now cry!

526
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,240
Cry! Cry!

527
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,680
To get James out of my hair,
I sent him to look for a crow.

528
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,480
Crow? A crow.

529
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,200
Have you ever seen a funeral scene
in your life without a crow in it?

530
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,520
There'll be one in a
tree, or in a field.

531
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,480
That left me free to
direct the graveyard scene.

532
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,600
So, if you're mourning, look sad.

533
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,840
You're just professionally sad.

534
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,440
You...should be in a bikini,
I think, to balance it out.

535
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,440
So, good, OK.

536
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,520
No, wait, hang on, it's a funeral.

537
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,840
Yeah, it should be a black bikini.

538
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,320
OK. Roll cameras...

539
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,760
Back! With the graveyard done, all
we had left was the closing shot.

540
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,440
The shot has got be quite long,
because there's quite a bit of
information to get in at the end.

541
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,600
No, the back should... No! No!
Yes! Yes!

542
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,040
Get the wheels straight.

543
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,520
James! Yes?
Do you want mourners in this shot?

544
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,840
No.

545
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,920
It's untidy. Action.

546
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,400
And pull out... James! What?

547
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,960
I've fallen out of the basket thing!

548
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,480
Anyway...

549
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,600
Finally, though,
our masterpiece was ready.

550
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,960
Argh!

551
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,600
With its advanced, two-litre,
common rail diesel engine,

552
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,880
the new Scirocco TDI -

553
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,880
quiet enough for any occasion.

554
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,080
So...

555
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,600
Bang!

556
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,400
Now, that didn't go down very
well, and it was all his fault.

557
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,560
Why did the car blow up at the end?

558
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Because you wouldn't let me cut
one of the mourners' arms off.

559
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,080
Why was that woman in a bikini?

560
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,280
Because I am a genius, and you're
a fool, and that is why, after

561
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,040
that advert was rejected,
as well as all the others,
we decided to split up.

562
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,080
Yeah, we decided we'd make one more
ad each, but this time, instead of
taking them to Nick and Margaret

563
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,800
to judge, because they loathed
everything we did,

564
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,760
we thought we'd bring them here, and
let you decide which one is better.

565
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,120
OK? And the winner,

566
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,520
the winner gets this
pair of exquisitely slim
advertiser's spectacles.

567
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,680
Yeah! Here's mine...

568
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,280
Hear that, James?
The sound of silence. Nobody...

569
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,040
Oh... No! Why are you applauding?!

570
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,360
It's cerebral. That would work on
BBC Four, where there's
no commercials!

571
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,560
And now behold to bask in the
turbulence of my magnificence.

572
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,120
This is my ad.

573
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,920
A state of emergency has been
declared in Poland as
the mass exodus continues...

574
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Sources in Warsaw report mass panic
as those left in the city make
increasingly frantic

575
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,560
efforts to escape.

576
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,680
..thousands of people crammed
into... Military leaders say...

577
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,840
..the country's road network.

578
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,000
The army says it's now powerless
to prevent the ongoing mass exodus.

579
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,840
When in doubt, use the war.

580
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,520
Now, the time has come to vote.

581
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,480
All of those who think that James's
plant advertisement has won,
raise your hands.

582
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,920
Six or seven quite bright
people in the audience.

583
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,960
And all those who think my
Berlin one has won?

584
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,480
YEAH!

585
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,960
Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen, thank you!

586
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,760
Now, a special moment is upon us,
because, you might have thought it

587
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,960
had gone away, but oh, no, because we
are going to do the Cool Wall! Yeah!

588
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,840
It's here!

589
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,200
Take them off!
I can't see a damn thing.

590
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,040
What have we got first?
We'll start off with
this, it is the Ford Focus RS.

591
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,400
Now, this is a
brilliant car, there's no denying it.

592
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,600
What d'you you think of it?
I like it. You like it. It's green.
Is it relevant, is it cool?

593
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,960
Cool. Yeah. Don't like the colour.

594
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,520
At all. Is the car...?

595
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,680
No. No? No, and that's odd, because
he looks like he's got an ASBO.

596
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,240
That is the thing about this car...
It's brilliant. Yeah.

597
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,000
But it's for the bloke
who's always the first to start
the singing on the aeroplane.

598
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,560
You know, the fellow whose
holiday sombrero is too big to get in

599
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,800
the overhead locker, and that's what
he drives. You're wrong.

600
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
Nobody who's got one has
been on an aeroplane -

601
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,280
they get stuck in airport security
with their ASBO ankle bracelet.

602
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,200
Yes, that's... It's a great car,
but sadly, it's got to be. It's got
to be uncool.

603
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,040
The Lamborghini Murcielago SV.
What are we thinking?

604
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm sorry, there's a man in here...
Coming in!

605
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,760
What was that? Seriously uncool.

606
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
Seriously uncool.

607
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
Come with me.

608
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,280
I want the ladies and gentlemen
to see this.

609
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,920
The Amish here.

610
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,480
You think this is...?

611
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,440
Seriously uncool.

612
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,200
Would you think it's uncool?
Cos it's a mad sports car.

613
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,960
What's the matter with mad sports
cars? Seriously uncool. How long
before he stabs me?

614
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,200
No, I think this man is
representing... Cos he's...

615
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,720
He's right, ladies and gentlemen!

616
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,000
He's right? Because every time I see
a man, and it is invariably a man...

617
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,400
Go back to the audience, please.

618
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,720
Every time I see a man
getting out of one of these things,

619
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,400
and it is invariably a man, I always
think, that man is wearing a thong.

620
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
Is this just something you like
to think about? I'm confused.

621
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,680
Nobody with boxer shorts has
ever bought a Lamborghini.

622
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,800
What? BLEEP I bought a Lamborghini.
Oh, my God! You in a thong!

623
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,160
Ah! Ah! No! It is, I'm afraid, not
seriously uncool, but it is uncool.

624
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,720
Now, this is a BMW Z4.

625
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,040
We like this car. Very much. Not
the old model, not for wife
swappers, nobody's ever

626
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,640
slept with somebody called Muriel
who's married
to Frank, who has one of these.

627
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,760
But we'd like to put it in
the cool section of the board.

628
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,400
Actually, it's resisting. Ready?

629
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,040
It's the weirdest thing. It won't go
in the cool section, and
there's a very good reason for that.

630
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,120
Yeah. The good reason is, James May
has said he's thinking of getting rid

631
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:06,080
of his Porsche Boxster and getting
one of these. And, well, that means,
that's all that can happen!

632
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,200
That's all it'll do! We can't put it
anywhere else! It won't go!

633
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,960
Now, this is the Nissan 370-Z, OK?
Now, this, as far as I can work out,
is for the sort of chap who likes

634
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,240
a stag night. Me and the lads,
you know the sort of bloke.

635
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,920
He's the sort that sends you those
e-mails that take you ten minutes to
open, and they're not funny.

636
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,520
That's why this is cool -
you're talking about

637
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,680
the bloke who doesn't complain
because you've given him the
wrong olive.

638
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:42,000
The man who has one of these has
never eaten an olive - he just has
pork itchings. He's a lager lout.

639
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,400
No, he drinks lager, what's wrong
with that? He drinks Stella.
It's just lager.

640
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,680
It's not just lager! You'd be
at the bar, saying,
"Have you got anything Italian?"

641
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,160
This is an old gag but what
are you gonna do about that?

642
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,040
Thank you, that old favourite.

643
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm hearing a strange mooing noise.

644
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,240
But you're
mistaking this for a democracy, and
it isn't one, it's a dictatorship.

645
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,360
Oh, dear, Hammond's
gone off in a huff.

646
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,640
Good! Anyway, now, I want to
talk about the Range Rover.

647
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,360
If you asked me, and you're
a small boy, what is the
best car in the world?

648
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,400
I will say, it's a Bugatti
Veyron, but the truth is...

649
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,280
What are you doing?

650
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,800
Oh, yes!

651
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,480
Oh, yeah!

652
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,280
Woah! That'll do. I'll tell you what.
Can you...?

653
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,120
Can you reach it there, shorty?

654
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,240
I can still reach that.

655
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,040
Look, he can't reach it,
poor little fella!

656
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,920
Oh! Tell you what,
from up here, it is going.

657
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,880
I reckon about there, there you go!

658
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,080
What?! No!

659
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,440
What I've just done, ladies and
gentlemen, is hit the kill switch!

660
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,320
Come on, then, come down!
It doesn't work! It's broken!

661
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,840
You see the Zonda,
your favourite car in the world?
Yes... No!

662
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,760
No! That's not right!

663
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,200
See if we put it down here... Yes!

664
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:43,080
Oh, look. And that. And that.
Look, I can have so much fun!

665
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,760
No, that's just...!

666
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,720
Can I come down now?

667
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,240
Nnnnno. Because it's time to put a
star in our reasonably-priced car.

668
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,920
What can I say about my guest
tonight? As the star of Rain Man,
Top Gun, Days Of Thunder,

669
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,280
Tom Cruise has almost certainly
been interviewed by him.

670
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
American chat show legend Jay Leno!

671
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,960
Thank you, thank you very much!
Thank you! I'll have a seat.

672
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,040
Have a seat! This is amazing.

673
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,800
You've been hosting your own show
in America now for what, 17 years,
five nights a week? 17 years, right.

674
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,000
I never thought the day would
come when you'd be here!

675
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,760
This is my favourite show.
We get it on BBC America.
I enjoy watching it.

676
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,760
And as soon as I got some free time,
you were gracious enough to invite
me, and that's why I'm here.

677
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,200
How can we...? The world's biggest
petrol head... Well... Apart from
Geri Halliwell.

678
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:01,720
..we've ever had here. I'll get on
to your show, if I may. You recently
had Obama Barack on...

679
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Right. Which makes you... No, it's
the other way round, isn't it? Yeah,
but I'm somewhat dyslexic, so that's

680
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,600
all right with me. If people are
gonna choose their names from
Scrabble tiles, I... Anyway, so,

681
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,080
is it easy to get an American
President on the show, or
is it a bit complicated?

682
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,560
It's interesting, the difference.
I had him on as a
candidate twice before.

683
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,040
And each time he would come with his
jacket like on his finger,
with two guys.

684
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,360
As President, oh, my God.

685
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,400
Armies, literally armies come in.

686
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,120
They do a sweep of your staff, and
they go, "Are you Jeremy Clarkson?
Yes. Don't come in tomorrow.

687
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,400
Why? I said don't come in tomorrow!
What, just a background check think?

688
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,880
If you had a joint in your
sock in 1972, you don't...

689
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,960
And that's what they do.
You don't come in, you don't...
We were never told why.

690
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,320
You're just told not
to come in that day.

691
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,720
How weird. And does he phone
work when he's arriving, or is
that all shut down as well?

692
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,200
All cellphones within
60 miles are monitored.

693
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,440
So, be careful. So, everybody
within 60 miles of Barack...?

694
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,440
For key words, if there are certain
key words, they will track you down
and beat you senseless.

695
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,680
We're never more than 60 miles from
the Queen here, are we? We're 60
miles from the Queen.

696
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,840
That's got to be comforting, hasn't
it? I have to say, in terms of
America.

697
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,080
I used to think it was like going to
a prison, just with more food.

698
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,800
When you came home, you felt
like you were coming back to
a free country.

699
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,160
Now, it's the other way
round. You have these speed
cameras here... Just, nothing!

700
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,520
Like, see, in LA, people would say,
why don't you just shoot them out?

701
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,160
Exactly.

702
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,720
In LA, a day doesn't go by, you
don't see a Styrofoam cup stuck
over the lens of a speed camera.

703
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,320
It's not just speed cameras, there's
cameras to monitor everything.

704
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,600
Everything you've done since
you got here.

705
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,360
I'm talking about at the urinals,
I'm talking about in bed, sometimes.

706
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,760
Really? Oh, yeah,
Mr Brown has been recording that.

707
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,720
All right.
I hope he has enough tape!

708
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,240
Now, normally, at this stage,
when we've got people here,

709
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,720
I get to the point of the interview
where I say, talk about your cars.

710
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,760
OK. And they go, I've got
a Honda Accord, and my
wife's got a Toyota Prius, OK?

711
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,000
I just need you to understand how
big a petrol head we have here. OK?

712
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,840
So this is just his cars. Ready?

713
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,200
Dodge Viper, Packard
Caribbean, Chevrolet Corvette,
E-type Jaguar, Bugatti Type-37,

714
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,920
Lamborghini Espada, Chevrolet
Corvette ZR-1, Lamborghini Countach,

715
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,800
Brough Superior, Bentley Turbo-R,
Shelby Mustang 350-GT, Citroen XM,

716
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:52,560
Fiat Millicento, Corvette Z-06,
Bugatti Type-57, AC Cobra 427,
Lamborghini Miura-S...

717
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,280
Dodge Challenger,

718
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,040
Lagonda V-12, Bentley Speed Six,
Ford Model T,
another Lamborghini Miura,

719
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:08,120
Dodge Challenger RT, that's page
one. There's page two. D'you wanna
see page three? There's page three.

720
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,200
How the hell do you decide what
to go to work in in the morning?

721
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:18,160
Who wouldn't do that if they could?
I would, I must confess.
But see, I only have one wife.

722
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,520
I have one woman...

723
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,120
I have one woman and 150 cars.

724
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,680
Thank you!

725
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,240
See? Women know this...

726
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:37,360
Wouldn't you prefer your man coming
home reeking of transmission
fluid rather than cheap perfume?

727
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,280
Do you spend a lot of time
going to car shows?

728
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,720
That's really all I do, I work
in my garage, I like working on cars.

729
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:49,360
You'll like this story.
I had my McLaren F1 out,
I took it to a car show.

730
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,600
I see these two
LA gang members, scary guys,

731
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,160
tattoo, the thing on the neck
with the cross, the tear on the...

732
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,920
The whole bit. And they're looking
at my car, and I'm like, "Oh, boy!"

733
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,920
One of them says, "Gordon Murray
designed this, right?"
And I went, "Yeah!"

734
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,520
Then the other guy asked about
David Stephen, and I realised,
I'm prejudging people.

735
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,560
I assumed that because
they look different from me,
that they're criminals.

736
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,120
I felt bad about this.
I said, "You ever
been in one of these?" "No."

737
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,880
I said, "D'you wanna go for a ride?"
They said, "Yeah!" And I realised,
maybe this is a mistake, OK?

738
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:30,440
As big as they were outside, they
were enormous in the car. The guys'
head, and when that tattoo is here,

739
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,880
you know? With the
misspelled die, and everything.

740
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,600
All right, so, we're driving along.
Guy goes, "Go up here in the
hills, there's no traffic."

741
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,200
Oh, all right, so...

742
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,680
It's not good at this point.
There's a place called Canaan
Road, above Malibu.

743
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,520
There's some tunnels,
which go through the mountain.

744
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,320
I said, "Tell you what, I'll nail
it through the mountains, you guys
have got to hear the F1 McLaren."

745
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,520
I fly through the tunnel, 125.

746
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,800
As I come out of the tunnel,
police car right here.

747
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,920
Pulled over. And now I've got two
gang guys...

748
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,360
They're gonna run a check on these
guys, it'll be drug dealers, my
McLaren will be towed,

749
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:19,160
they'll drag it to impound,
I'll be arrested for going 100
and... Cop pulls over.

750
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:25,560
The Highway Patrolman goes, "Know how
fast you're going?" The two guys go,
"We're police officers." No way!

751
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,040
They were undercover,
they were undercover!

752
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Exactly! It was like the
greatest day of my life.

753
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,080
That's just complete win-win.

754
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,040
We don't get that at the
Goodwood Festival Of Speed.
A couple of gang members...

755
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,920
American drivers...

756
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,920
I was talking to Stephen
Fry about this when he came
on a couple of weeks ago.

757
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,720
One of the things we notice,
if you

758
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,120
want to change lanes, you indicate,
nine times out of ten, the guy will
let you pull in.

759
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,320
That never happens in America.
Why can't people see that
you need to pull off...?

760
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,200
Because we're working on the
computer, we are drinking a soda,

761
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,720
we are doing any number of things
way more important than driving.

762
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,920
I do a thing - called Headlines -
we'd show advertisements
for different products.

763
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,920
And one was a laptop that fit on your
steering wheel, it clamped in,
so you could do this...

764
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,360
And this was legal!
They were selling this!

765
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:27,320
It had a cup holder here,
so you could work the internet
while you were driving your car.

766
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,920
And learning so much!

767
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,720
Now, obviously, you came here
to do a lap, in a car with a
steering wheel on the correct side.

768
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,800
The steering wheel is on
the wrong side. The spring
was broken in the shifter.

769
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,920
Yet, in that British tradition,
I soldiered on. How did it go?

770
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,960
OK, I mean, as long as I don't
get beat by Helen Mirren, I'm OK.

771
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,640
Helen Mirren, where is she?

772
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,680
Where is she? There she is, 1.52.8. 
I think I did better than that.

773
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,880
Shall we find out how Jay got on?
Yes!

774
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,640
Here's your lap, in a Lacetti.

775
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,160
There we go, we're off,
plenty of smoke on the start.

776
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,760
Race car driving's
like sex, all men think
they're good at it.

777
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,920
So, you've got a smooth style there.

778
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,440
We could learn a lot from...
Oh, very smooth.

779
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,160
Much like the sex.

780
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,040
If it doesn't go well, blame it on
the car. Dressed up as Malboro Man.

781
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,880
Oh, I can't say that, can I?

782
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,960
Dressed up as Cowboy Man.
That's smooth again.

783
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,560
That's a little better, at least
I didn't miss a gear that time.

784
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,400
This is the Hammerhead,
this is where you can make
or break your lap.

785
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,880
You must be pleased with that.
Seems all right.

786
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,200
Looking good. Looking very good
coming out, maybe a little bit fast.

787
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,640
The Stig is quite a good instructor,
considering...he doesn't talk.

788
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,840
Let's have a look at this. This
is flat out through there.

789
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,200
Not bad. Yeah. Oh, that's quick!

790
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,600
That was very quick.
Brake, down to third.

791
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,960
Come on, this is the hard...

792
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,120
Yes! That's what I call a corner!

793
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,640
Now, it's Gambon.

794
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,400
That's Michael Gambon, around there,
maybe too much understeer.
But across the line!

795
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,120
Let's find out how you got on.

796
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,480
All right.
You did it...in one minute...

797
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,120
Yes?

798
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,080
..40... Yes?

799
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,000
..8.8.

800
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,160
You're way faster than Helen Mirren!

801
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,680
Oh, all right. You are...

802
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,440
In the middle of the pack.
..between Doctor Who and Will Young.

803
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,160
Actually, I did that once in LA.
Yeah.

804
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,360
This is a good place.

805
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,520
Are you the fastest American?
I'll take fastest American.

806
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,080
I'm just looking.

807
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:03,120
No, Mark Wahlberg! Mark Wahlberg.
You're the second fastest American!
Second fastest. Wow!

808
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,360
There we go, Jay Leno, everybody!

809
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,480
Jeremy, thank you, thank you,
everybody! Thank you so much!

810
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,280
Still here, obviously.

811
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,160
Now, at this point, I should be
down there, by that car.

812
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,080
But I'm not,
obviously, so please bear with me.

813
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,560
What that car is,
is the Aston Martin Vantage,
that's the smallest car they make.

814
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:33,400
But they just fitted it with their
510 horsepower, six-litre, V12.

815
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,000
And Jeremy decided to take it out
to see what it's like.

816
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,680
Well, it's an Aston Martin
Vantage, with a V12 engine.

817
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,200
So, what d'you think
it's gonna be like?

818
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,680
It is fantastic.

819
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,440
It's wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful.

820
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,880
What it makes me feel, though,

821
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,400
is sad.

822
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,480
I just can't help thinking that,
thanks to all sorts of things -

823
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,440
the environment, the economy,
problems in the Middle East, the
relentless war on speed,

824
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,360
cars like this will soon be
consigned to the history books.

825
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:00,800
I just have this
horrible, dreadful feeling that what
I'm driving here...is an ending.

826
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,480
Good night.

827
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,840
