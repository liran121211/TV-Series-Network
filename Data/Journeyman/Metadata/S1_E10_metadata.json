Dan's worries about the possible effect of leaving behind a digital camera seem unwarranted, until he discovers his darling son Zac has been replaced by a girl, which his wife wants to keep instead anyhow. He has to deal with the Cuppers in both time zones, guessing Christopher's tech-nerd-friend Dewey Boyd is the key.
