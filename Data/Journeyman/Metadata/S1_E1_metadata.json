His next trip back in time also has his path cross the woman's, and now she is the mother of a teenager. Figuring this woman is the focus of his current trips, Dan is confused when his next trip occurs years after the woman's death . . . but then he comes across the daughter and the focus shifts to her and the father she never knew. He even encounters the father alone on another airliner, as well as running in to Olivia, herself traveling through time.\u2014Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1036114", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 196, "number_of_episodes": 13}
