Hearst cuts ties with Wolcott and makes separate arrangements with Swearengen regarding the camp's \"celestials\", and E.B., who suffers from gastric difficulties. Tensions in camp boil over between Andy and Cy, as well as in \"Chinaman's Alley\". Swearengen orchestrates new elections, and sends Bullock home to his wife.\u2014WyattJones", "Mining magnate George Hearst has arrived in Deadwood and begins to shake things up. He starts to check out some of the properties he's bought and makes an offer on the hotel that E.B. Farnum can't refuse. He also calls on Al to deal with the issue of the Chinese whores. They come to an understanding and Swearengen backs Wu in getting rid of his rival. Cy Tolliver wants Hearst to do something about Francis Wolcott and the killing of the three prostitutes at the Chez Ami. It's the first he's heard of Wolcott's tastes and fires him. Wolcott has his own ideas on how to go out in style. It's also the day for Alma Garret and Whitney Ellsworth's wedding. Neither is quite sure they are doing the right thing and in a chat of sorts with her late husband, Alma explains her thinking on the subject. Charlie Utter returns to Deadwood just in time for the wedding celebrations and is amazed to see Calamity Jane bathed and in a dress.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0556291", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 1852, "number_of_episodes": 36}
