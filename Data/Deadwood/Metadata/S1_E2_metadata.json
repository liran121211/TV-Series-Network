Meanwhile, Bullock and Star attempt to buy property from Swearengen, who suspects an alliance between Wild Bill and the hardware fellows.\u2014WyattJones", "Word spreads pretty quickly through Deadwood about Seth Bullock and Wild Bill Hickok's shooting incident in the night. Neither of them believe it was Indians who attacked the family and that proves to be correct when Al Swearengen gets it out of some of his underlings that they attacked them to get whatever gold they might have had. Al is none too pleased and is worried about just what Hickok in particular is up to. He decides Hickok has to go and wants ones of his flunky, Jack McCall, to dispatch him. Doc has Sofia, the young Norwegian girl, under his care but he too knows what would happen if the culprits learned she survived, so he makes the point of telling everyone that she is not likely to recover. Seth and business partner Sol Star also want to buy the property they've been renting from Al but he drives a hard bargain, one that Seth refuses to accept. Brom Garret meanwhile doesn't have much luck on his first day panning for gold on the claim he bought for $20,000 from Al.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0556297", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 2589, "number_of_episodes": 36}
