At the Gem, while Swearengen readies for another showdown with Bullock, infighting between Silas Adams and Dan Dority yields more feed for Wu's pigs. Doc Cochran is surprised by Calamity Jane, who has returned to camp in a state of inebriated deterioration.\u2014WyattJones", "Seth Bullock has much on his mind since his most recent encounter with Al Swearengen and the arrival of his family. His wife Martha is his dead brother's widow and the boy is actually his nephew. He did the right thing by marrying her but there doesn't appear to be much emotion there. He's clearly in love with Alma but needs her to decide on what she wants to do. He also has to retrieve his gun and badge from Al Swearengen, where he left them before their fight. Most expect there will be a bloodbath but Swearengen has a surprising response. Meanwhile, dissension is growing at the Gem with Dan and Silas Adams ready to go at each other any time.
