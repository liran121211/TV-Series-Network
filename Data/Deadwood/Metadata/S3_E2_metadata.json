Al accepts Hearst's invitation to listen to the political speeches from his \"balcony\" at the hotel. He makes it very clear to Al that he expects Alma's claim to be handed over to him and leaves Al with a memento of his visit to the hotel. The four candidates for office - Bullock and Harry Manning for Sheriff and Farnum and Star for Mayor - don't exactly have an enthusiastic audience for their speeches. Calamity Jane however finds a very receptive audience in the schoolchildren as she tells them her tales of being a scout for General Custer. Alma is not well and Doc Cochran tells her she will lose the baby. Cy Tolliver, still recovering from his wounds, is surprised by the sudden re-appearance of Andy Crane.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0556305", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 1592, "number_of_episodes": 36}
