Bullock soon crosses paths with another new arrival - legendary gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok - and clashes with the formidable boss of the Gem Saloon and occasional deal broker, Al Swearengen.\u2014WyattJones", "Deadwood is a rough and tumble gold mining town in the American West where, in 1876, there is no law enforcement. Seth Bullock, a former Marshal in Montana Territory and his partner, Sol Star, relocate to Deadwood to open a hardware store. There's lots of money around and business is quite brisk. Also relocating to Deadwood is the legendary Wild Bill Hickok, whose reputation strikes fear in most men. Lastly, there is the local wheeler-dealer, a relocated Brit named Al Swearengen. He runs the saloon which includes a healthy dose of gambling and prostitution. Al doesn't put up with much nonsense, whether it be one of his whores who shoots a client for beating her up or a drunk he's used to swindle money from a rich easterner who is desperate to get his hands on a gold mining claim. When a man comes into town claiming that Indians killed a family just out of town Hickok, Bullock and others investigate and find a survivor. Al's biggest concern is that his saloon patrons will leave to go see for themselves.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0556296", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 3361, "number_of_episodes": 36}
