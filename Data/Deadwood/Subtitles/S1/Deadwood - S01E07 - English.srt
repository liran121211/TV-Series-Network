1
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,834
That's what McCall
was ridin'.

2
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,393
All right.

3
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,066
Evening.

4
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,566
Evening back.

5
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,998
Look at that paint,
Charlie.

6
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:18,699
I seen it.

7
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,809
I had a happy
just like that.

8
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,723
Foundered.

9
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:26,575
Makes me miserable
reminiscing on it.

10
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:28,331
Do you know the owner?

11
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,471
If he'd sell the horse
is what he really wants to know.

12
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,606
Well, I don't know
if he'd sell.

13
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:36,013
But the fuckin' jerk's
in that bunkhouse.

14
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,486
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.

15
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,394
Jack McCall.

16
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:18,916
I'm done.

17
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:20,775
I don't wanna
play no more.

18
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,482
Bein' a loudmouth
cunt,

19
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,529
I guess some time
since he's been here,

20
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,935
this fella who don't
wanna play no more

21
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,554
probably spoke of killin'
Wild Bill Hickok.

22
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,534
Well, we're
Bill Hickok's friends.

23
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:46,428
- I'm Seth Bullock.
- I'm Charlie Utter.

24
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:49,765
And if you got your head blown off
sittin' here with your back turned,

25
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:52,001
that'd be as fair a play
as you gave him.

26
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,391
Guess you wanna
soften him up some

27
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:13,402
before you
make your offer?

28
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,209
My plan is to take him
to Yankton for trial.

29
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:21,209
If you got a different idea,
you can ride ahead.

30
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,281
Nah.

31
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,526
Let's take the cocksucker
to Yankton.

32
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,376
I don't know of
a Henry Anderson in camp,

33
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,164
but that don't
mean there ain't.

34
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,502
This was took of him
in the Union Army.

35
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:43,161
He'd be 12 years
older now.

36
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,760
Could you
let her hold it?

37
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,353
With so much showing,
it's pretty near fallin' apart.

38
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,110
Here.

39
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:51,867
Third from the middle.

40
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:56,693
Right uh...
right there?

41
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:58,043
Yeah.

42
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,020
That face don't...
don't look familiar.

43
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:02,167
Thanks for lookin'.

44
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,732
You definite
he's in these hills?

45
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,431
Wrote from Bismarck,

46
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,509
said he'd send for us
when he got set up.

47
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:08,890
I just gotta say

48
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:12,307
it's no guarantee your dad's
anywhere near this area.

49
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:15,196
And there's no fuckin' joy
in me telling you that,

50
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:18,543
but it's the goddamned truth
and the way human beings are.

51
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,516
- Said he'd send for our mother and us.
- Is your mama here?

52
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,824
She passed.

53
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:29,080
Sorry.
Well, good luck.

54
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:31,537
Do you know of...
of work for me?

55
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,513
- No.
- She can get work right here.

56
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:36,464
- No, sir.
- No, thank you.

57
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:42,541
- Can you push a broom?
- And I could start now.

58
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,178
Four bits a day.

59
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,973
I bet you'd like
the first in advance.

60
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,764
If you wouldn't mind.

61
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:51,822
Same for her,

62
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:54,318
as regrets for me
being such a ruffian.

63
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,399
Here you go, honey.

64
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:00,560
If I don't fire him first,
you can pick him up at 10:00.

65
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,987
Thank you, sir.

66
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,372
I'll wait
for you, Miles.

67
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,381
Find a safe place
to wait, you hear?

68
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:14,895
We teach a special
sweepin' technique here.

69
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,177
Follow her lead.

70
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,185
It's all right, son.
It's all right.

71
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,072
Um... excuse me.

72
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,424
I'm required to be
at the graveyard.

73
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,953
The Widow Garret is
laying her husband to rest.

74
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,848
I'd have bet
a month's wages that burial

75
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,636
would've took place
in New York City,

76
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,461
if I had a fuckin'
payin' job.

77
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,278
The uh... wet cloth
to his lips

78
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:05,996
seems to give him
some relief.

79
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:08,966
- All right.
- Thank you.

80
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:22,183
What do you think
of my patient, Doc?

81
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,873
You might wanna steer clear
of his reflection for a while,

82
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,365
but you're symptom-free.
You ain't contagious no more

83
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,315
and you can't get
re-infected, so...

84
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,146
Them as heals under my care
stay fuckin' healed.

85
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:32,773
Thanks, Doc.

86
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:34,339
I got clothes
for you back here.

87
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:39,334
Hereafter in Calamity,
I'll be sure to call for Jane.

88
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,411
You gonna stick
around the camp?

89
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,459
I believe I will
for a while.

90
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,704
Good, 'cause I wanna
monitor your activities,

91
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,587
find out what you do that weighs
so heavy on your conscience.

92
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,276
When I first come
on you in the woods,

93
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,454
all you could say
was, "I apologize."

94
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:55,174
Before you exhibit your Johnson,
I'm gonna see to this fella.

95
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,639
So long.
Good luck to you.

96
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,373
- Good luck to you.
- All right.

97
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,224
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.

98
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,181
Now I'm gonna
lay this cloth on your fuckin' lips.

99
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,886
There's Mr. Star
to collect us.

100
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:22,205
Mr. Star has been
ever so attentive.

101
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:25,563
- Very considerate.
- To you.

102
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,109
When we leave the hotel,
my boss will be watchin'.

103
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,321
Shall I reel and stagger?

104
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:44,835
I...

105
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,941
I know the risk lying
to him has put you to.

106
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:50,941
I've... I can't imagine why I'd make it
the subject of humor.

107
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:53,598
You're feeling better.

108
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:01,690
- Am I early?
- Good morning, Mr. Star.

109
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:03,192
I'll be ready
in just a moment.

110
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,569
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.

111
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:07,740
Wait, wait in here,
with Trixie.

112
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,337
I'll just
be a moment.

113
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:30,486
That widow ain't high.

114
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,437
Maybe waiting till
after the service.

115
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,253
When she'd wanna get good and fucking
loaded is before the fucking service,

116
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,675
against all
the fucking carrying on.

117
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,243
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.

118
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,593
Meaning all that whore's been telling
me the last 10 fucking days

119
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:52,085
about seeing the widow taking the dope,
and your own fucking assurances,

120
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:55,671
you verify that she's loaded
personally... you're both full of shit.

121
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,270
I checked in
on the woman daily.

122
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:01,203
If I was fooled, perhaps I've chosen
simplemindedness, Al,

123
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,218
over realizing
a certain friend

124
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,739
has used me as an instrument
of purposes he concealed.

125
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,306
Say what
you're gonna say,

126
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,769
or prepare for eternal
fucking silence.

127
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,535
I don't believe
you commissioned me

128
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,261
to make an offer
on the widow's claim

129
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:15,989
to keep the regulators
off you, Al.

130
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,856
I think someone found something
out there you want.

131
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,906
Assume you ain't
been privy

132
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,636
to the ins and outs
of that matter

133
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,877
for the sake
of fucking conversation, huh?

134
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:28,117
I mean,
was I asleep, E.B.,

135
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,967
when you and me
declared undying loyalty

136
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,684
and full faith
mutual disclosure

137
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,022
about every fucking detail
of every fucking move

138
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:39,253
- we were ever gonna make together?
- You used me as a pawn, Al.

139
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:43,346
And you fucked up the game
is the central fucking present issue.

140
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,953
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?

141
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,885
Is that such
an inconceivable proposition?

142
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,221
- Yeah, you got a percentage, E.B.
- How big?

143
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,220
2% of the first million,
half a percent after.

144
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,673
You wanna feel
a damp palm, Al,

145
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,748
select either
of these hands.

146
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,276
Just get to the funeral, E.B.
Go to 20 if you have to.

147
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:10,033
Just get that
fucking claim.

148
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,370
20 if I have to.
My word.

149
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:18,219
What a handsome man.
Wish I could tell you I recognize him.

150
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,786
Thank you anyway.

151
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,388
- Your dad, I expect.
- Yes.

152
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,337
You have reason
to think he's out here?

153
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,029
He wrote us from Bismarck
he'd be prospecting the hills.

154
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,914
- "Us" being?
- My brother.

155
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,702
He just got
work over here.

156
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,560
Good for him.

157
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,765
So it's just
the two of you?

158
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:37,801
Our mother passed,
why we come from Buffalo.

159
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:40,208
- You're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.

160
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,663
- Uh, Henry?
- Yes.

161
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,744
Out here looking
for her father, Eddie.

162
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,573
Her and her
older brother.

163
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,478
Got a photograph, I don't...
I don't recognize the likeness.

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,796
No.

165
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,871
- Henry Anderson?
- Yes.

166
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,529
- Yeah, I don't recognize him.
- Mm.

167
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,103
What are you gonna do
while your brother works?

168
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:03,525
Work too, while we're looking to set
aside, if we have to move on.

169
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,093
Ah, if Dad doesn't
turn up here.

170
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:08,036
Yeah, what do you do?

171
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,722
Cook, clean,
sew, sweep.

172
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,245
Uh-huh.

173
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:17,995
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess I learn pretty quick.

174
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,615
Maestro.

175
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:27,490
We are strangers
and sojourners.

176
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,637
Mr. Garret's
burial place

177
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,977
is a great distance
from New York City.

178
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,222
But his heart...

179
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,389
Ingrid... Marta.

180
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,979
- And on the great day...
- Mama.

181
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,353
- His Father will take him into it.
- Papa.

182
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,247
As He will all who
confess His Son savior

183
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,159
from wherever
we may be put to rest.

184
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:52,256
Our hymn is
"A Mighty Fortress."

185
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:57,479
? A mighty fortress
is our God ?

186
00:12:57,513 --> 00:13:02,782
? A bulwark
never failing... ?

187
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,605
- My sympathies, madam,
- ? Our helper... ?

188
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,134
but, my own
requirements force me

189
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:08,931
to ignore
what's seemly.

190
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:11,552
I must decide where
to place my capital.

191
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,714
Might raising my offer
to say, $19,500, uh,

192
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,506
prompt you
to an immediate answer?

193
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,852
- No, Mr. Farnum.
- ? Doth seek to work us woe ?

194
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:27,936
? Lord Sabbath,
His name ?

195
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,420
- ? His craft and power... ?
- I would as soon not see Bill now.

196
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,664
I'll see him
some other time.

197
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,725
Come on.

198
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:42,367
? On earth is not
His equal... ?

199
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,508
I will require a decision
within 24 hours...

200
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:46,968
Please, stop speaking
to me, Mr. Farnum.

201
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:50,141
? Did we in our own
strength confide ?

202
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:55,709
? Our striving
would be losing ?

203
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:01,878
? Were not the right man
by our side... ?

204
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:10,716
? The man of God's
own choosing. ?

205
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:21,880
I hope you ain't gived up
on that little runt of a girl, Al.

206
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,293
Oh, do you worry
for her, Dan?

207
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,300
Wandering the muck
of our thoroughfare,

208
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:28,059
her tiny self
all but swallowed up in horseshit?

209
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,272
Hey, kid!
Come here.

210
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:37,369
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.

211
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,796
What are...
what are we doing?

212
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:43,123
Waiting.

213
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:50,552
And out the door
he'll go,

214
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:52,529
and prompt as
a Swiss fucking timepiece

215
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:55,670
three big-tittied whores will now emerge
from behind that screen.

216
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:02,452
He lines 'em up
at two-foot intervals,

217
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,497
smock tops down,

218
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,927
and all but
sprints past 'em,

219
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,311
giving their
titties a lick.

220
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,522
And if he misses
a titty,

221
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,797
does not let himself
retrace his steps.

222
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,353
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, then he goes on his way home,

223
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,207
relieved for the day.
What's your name? It's Miles, huh?

224
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,582
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.

225
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,761
Strange, huh, Miles?

226
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,615
But something you gotta
know about specialists.

227
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,687
They pay a premium

228
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,509
and they never
cause fucking trouble.

229
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:30,477
I sometimes imagine in my declining
years running a small joint

230
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,235
in Manchester, England,
catering to specialists exclusive.

231
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:36,565
And to let 'em know they're amongst
their own, I'll operate from the corner,

232
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,965
hanging upside down
like a fucking bat, hmm?

233
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:44,624
- We're not such bad sorts here, huh?
- No, sir.

234
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:47,628
So do you wanna ask your sister
if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?

235
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:50,963
- You don't really mean that.
- Of course I don't mean it.

236
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:54,062
How dare you suggest
I'd mean a thing like that, huh?

237
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,322
I did my part.

238
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,014
Raised our offer to 20
and demanded answer within the day.

239
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,939
But what,
you cocksucker?

240
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:05,005
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.

241
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:07,944
I expect she'll wanna
take counsel with him.

242
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,434
Tell the whore
I wanna see her.

243
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,125
And I trust this doesn't
alter our agreement.

244
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:17,196
I trust you know
2% of nothing's fucking nothing.

245
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,663
That fella from Montana

246
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:22,414
I knew to trust won't be
able to assay your claim.

247
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,554
I see.

248
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,632
We'll engage someone local,
and I'll keep an eye on him.

249
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:30,316
As I've decided to stay
in camp, Mr. Bullock,

250
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:31,780
at least
for the near term,

251
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,344
I hope you'll feel absolved
of those responsibilities

252
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:38,638
towards my interest that you undertook
at Mr. Hickok's request.

253
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:41,059
I prefer to see
'em through.

254
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,274
They're properly mine.

255
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,994
I even feel marginally
capable of shouldering them

256
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:49,129
and I certainly realize
that you and Mr. Star

257
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,435
have responsibilities
of your own.

258
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,677
Are you firing me,
Mrs. Garret?

259
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:00,262
I'm offering you
absolution.

260
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:02,340
Otherwise
I'm staying on.

261
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:18,627
I'm so sorry
you were hurt.

262
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,394
So, how hard are they
coming at you to sell?

263
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:26,627
I could confide

264
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,382
that in an effort
to blur my judgment,

265
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:31,457
Mr. Swearengen
engaged intermediaries

266
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:33,188
to indulge me
with opium.

267
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:36,356
But that would entail
acknowledging that

268
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:38,661
I've had a weakness
in that direction.

269
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:41,886
Uh...

270
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,276
more appropriately,
uh, I could add

271
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,189
at the graveyard
Mr. Farnum raised his offer

272
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:51,101
$7,500,

273
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:54,491
presumably also on
Mr. Swearengen's instruction,

274
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:57,665
and set a 24-hour
limit to my reply.

275
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,997
Under the circumstances,
I'd say that's coming pretty hard.

276
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:05,534
Please forgive me for
making you uncomfortable, Mr. Bullock.

277
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:08,191
I had better manners
before I began to abstain.

278
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,691
That's all right.

279
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:17,662
Anyways, are you at risk
for the smallpox?

280
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,601
I was inoculated
in New York City.

281
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:25,277
The child whose life you saved
presumably has not been,

282
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,097
but I assume she's
safer under my care

283
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,880
than traveling in a covered wagon
with strangers.

284
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,053
Anyways, I'll
line up the assayer.

285
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,683
Thank you.

286
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:42,935
You are changed.

287
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:47,864
You seem to be too.

288
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:51,199
Our stock's depleted,
but we are offering a 100% discount

289
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,825
on any item that
catches your eye.

290
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,035
I've got money.

291
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:57,145
Our special get-
acquainted-with-those-

292
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,288
we'd-like-to-get-
acquainted-with sale.

293
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,225
Mr. Utter.

294
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:09,370
I brought these
pickaxes for you to sell.

295
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:12,472
There's two sifters on that
black cayuse out there.

296
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,851
Mighty grateful, sir.

297
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,270
You got this place just
about built, don't you?

298
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,480
Saving the last
master-strokes for Seth.

299
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,306
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you.

300
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:26,737
Hello.

301
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,562
Hey, that's that
little girl, isn't it?

302
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:31,537
Taking care of her
for Mrs. Garret.

303
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,881
As much as she favors you,
she could be yours.

304
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:41,173
I lost the receipts
for my costs.

305
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:44,080
Maybe while you was busy
saving my partner's life.

306
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:47,794
Let me get these
sifters for you.

307
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,861
See if you can make
those accounts add up.

308
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,680
I don't know if
you heard me inside

309
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,403
thanking you for
helping my friend.

310
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,090
I heard you.
It's all right.

311
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:14,292
I'm sorry
you lost yours.

312
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,836
All right.
Thank you.

313
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:24,943
Welcome back,
Mr. Utter.

314
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,891
We've had a mild
increase in rates,

315
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,362
but I do have
a room available.

316
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:30,161
I'll see.

317
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,518
What do you want,
Mr. Farnum?

318
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,931
I have a message
for Trixie

319
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,298
that's looking
to that orphan child.

320
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,495
- She's to see her longer-term employer.
- I'll tell her.

321
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,376
You know
who that is?

322
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:50,669
I know she works
at The Gem.

323
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,968
And even so, admit her
to your trade at public hours.

324
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,816
Congratulations, sir,
on your advanced thinking.

325
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:00,646
Al wants you,
Trixie.

326
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,127
Stickler for
self-delivered messages.

327
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,467
Our dad ain't here.

328
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:14,155
I know it,
even if my brother don't.

329
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,837
Maybe he never even
tried to get here.

330
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,911
Or maybe he did try
to get here and couldn't,

331
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,642
maybe something
happened to him.

332
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,654
There's so many ways
it could be, Flora,

333
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,964
it's not much point
deciding which it was.

334
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,773
He'd never think that,
though, my brother.

335
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:34,467
Must be how
he needs to do.

336
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:36,812
I ain't a virgin...

337
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,503
if you wanna know that.

338
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,297
I had a boyfriend
in Buffalo.

339
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,166
Well, was you upset
to have to leave him?

340
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:47,106
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

341
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,156
I was upset.

342
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:54,410
At the same time
he was a stupid son of a bitch.

343
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:56,808
And rough.

344
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:02,751
Here.

345
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,360
You can't tell
my brother about him.

346
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:15,393
He'd make it back to Buffalo
and shoot Lewis in the head.

347
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,335
All that way in defense
of your virtue?

348
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:22,558
That's more trouble
than I ever took with it.

349
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,196
Cy.

350
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,573
Lazarus risen.

351
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,733
Look at you,
you son of a gun.

352
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,326
Hello, Cy.

353
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:49,918
Good to see you,
Andy.

354
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,745
Don't be afraid
to shake with me, Eddie.

355
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:53,952
I ain't contagious
no more.

356
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:55,614
Highly becoming outfit.

357
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,293
I'm here for
my belongings.

358
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,234
Look...

359
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,836
they're gone, Andy.

360
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,144
Measures to stop
the spread.

361
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:09,599
Ah hell, the important
thing is you're well.

362
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,293
I'll front you
whatever you need.

363
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:12,956
Let's get something
going, hmm?

364
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:16,377
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.

365
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:20,604
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, Andy.

366
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:23,870
Oh, and we ain't
getting nothing going.

367
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,815
All I come back for,
Cy, was my things,

368
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:28,672
and you tossed
them too.

369
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:31,770
Why don't you take this and get yourself
outta that clown outfit?

370
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:33,597
Once you've cooled off
a little,

371
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,382
think how you'd have done different
when somebody showed up

372
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,002
in the shape you was in
and my responsibilities to meet.

373
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,651
Better than to throw him
in the woods to fucking die?

374
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,576
Then don't think
about nothing, Andy.

375
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,045
Use the money
for a whore

376
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,086
and a toot and go join
the fucking circus.

377
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:56,221
Did you
turn her out?

378
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:58,358
Her brother's
gonna be a problem.

379
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:00,852
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother

380
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:02,781
if we have to kill
the cocksucker.

381
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:07,285
That's an interesting
piece of strange.

382
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,465
Ain't you a picture?

383
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,112
- What is it?
- Hmm?

384
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:30,613
Oh, am I detaining you
in some way?

385
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,519
Am I fucking
imposing?

386
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,321
Mrs. Garret's
to sit down with Bullock.

387
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:40,945
I thought you'd
want me over there.

388
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:43,603
Oh yeah, so you can bring me
a full and fair report, huh?

389
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:46,324
But will the widow have her
wits about her, Trixie, huh?

390
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,596
Or will they be
passing the opium pipe

391
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:52,111
like heathens between 'em,
her and fucking Bullock, hmm?

392
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:54,769
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.

393
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,531
I'm in fucking
wonderment.

394
00:24:56,567 --> 00:25:00,178
I'm waiting to be kept happy
by the next fucking fairy tale.

395
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,872
Do you want me
back at the hotel

396
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,014
or do you wanna
do something to me?

397
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:09,011
Now why would I want you
to go back there, huh?

398
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:11,434
Or rely on anything
you said transpired

399
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:15,536
after you lied
about her taking dope, huh?

400
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:18,932
Her being high...

401
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:20,688
wasn't gonna have
nothing to do

402
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:23,091
with whether or not
she sold you that claim,

403
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,012
and she wanted
to get off the dope.

404
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,213
And that little one needs
someone to care for her...

405
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:34,670
and maybe get her
the fuck outta here.

406
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:38,353
And I knew it
wasn't gonna be me.

407
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,578
So you want me
back over there

408
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:44,138
and to tell you what
they fucking decide?

409
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:49,319
Or do you wanna rip
my fucking guts out?

410
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:57,768
You get
back there quick.

411
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,669
Don't kid
yourself, Trixie.

412
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,518
Don't get
a mistaken idea.

413
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:36,800
Mr. Utter.

414
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,793
This is where Bill
got killed, huh?

415
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,270
Uh...

416
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,990
I'll be sorry about that
for as long as I live.

417
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:54,055
Can you tell me
about it?

418
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,610
Yeah.

419
00:26:57,578 --> 00:27:00,130
It... it was
about sun-up

420
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,558
over at that
Bella Union joint,

421
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,567
Mr. Hickok plum
gutted McCall at draw.

422
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:10,272
And now here Mr. Hickok
was at poker again.

423
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:13,759
Say a couple hours
of daylight left

424
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,701
and in come that
coward McCall.

425
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:21,858
Walked up on him
and shot him in the head.

426
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:28,516
Bill never know
when he come in.

427
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,600
Uh, those of us
that did,

428
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:36,386
we didn't have no inkling
of what he intended.

429
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:41,022
He just murdered him,
right where he sat.

430
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,435
If I may, sir...

431
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:46,009
This is here where

432
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:48,986
Wild Bill was sitting
when McCall entered from the front,

433
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:51,166
approached the table,
causing no apprehension

434
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,755
'cause he had often
frequented the game.

435
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:56,576
Of a sudden,
McCall produced a revolver

436
00:27:56,611 --> 00:28:00,440
and shouting "Take that, damn you!"
He fired.

437
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:03,831
Muzzle couldn't have been three inches
from Wild Bill's head.

438
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,591
Now I'm told that Hickok
fell dead immediately,

439
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,251
but I won't
testify to it,

440
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:12,565
because the bullet, after it passed
through Wild Bill's brain,

441
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,135
struck me
in my right wrist,

442
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:17,689
and I lost several seconds
to pain before regaining my senses.

443
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:22,935
Sir, you have my word
as eyewitness to the rest,

444
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:27,132
and I suppose this wound
as added proof for the doctors

445
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:30,516
they feared crippled me
in the hand I use to write.

446
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:35,671
I will take the murderer's
bullet to my grave.

447
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,597
Thanks.

448
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,383
Aces over eights,

449
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:53,755
as I just now recall.

450
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,050
That is the hand
that Wild Bill had.

451
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:01,810
Sure, Captain. Sure.

452
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,930
You like how
that falls?

453
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,746
Sure.

454
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:13,811
- Do you like it, Flora?
- Why not?

455
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,963
I'd prefer you happy, honey,
but if you can't be,

456
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,390
you need to pretend at it
better than you're doing

457
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:23,320
or you're gonna be
hungry and cold

458
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:25,719
and getting done to you
for nothing outside

459
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:28,305
what you'd have made money
to live on and save up besides

460
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:30,646
if you acted
the part in here.

461
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,843
I thought I only had to act it with them
that wanna stick it in me.

462
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,108
You never know who
that might be, Flora.

463
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:41,586
There you go.

464
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,406
I prefer you
happy.

465
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,547
Or at least
pretending better?

466
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,450
I think
he's dead, Doc.

467
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,658
Could you tell the litter bearers

468
00:30:08,692 --> 00:30:10,731
not to make so much of getting
this one outta here?

469
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:23,813
- Has young Joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.

470
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,371
As flesh must,

471
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,776
to be restored
by the Savior's return.

472
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,628
Oh, Mr. Bullock is
back among us,

473
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:38,031
and also,
also Mr. Utter.

474
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:40,846
Does Charlie
know about Bill?

475
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,768
They were together,
Mr. Bullock and he.

476
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,425
They'd captured
Jack McCall.

477
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:47,333
I hope that's only the beginning
of what they fucking did to him.

478
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,763
- Gave him over to federal authorities.
- Gave him over?

479
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:53,897
- Rendered unto Caesar.
- Jesus Christ.

480
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:58,822
Mr... Mr. Bullock was
struck by an Indian's axe.

481
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,731
Marked like the first-born
of Adam and Eve.

482
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,661
- Are you drunk?
- No.

483
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,667
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.

484
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,872
All right, Reverend.
All right, Reverend.

485
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:14,250
All right.

486
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:20,072
You're all right,
Reverend. All right.

487
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,078
He marks us sinful

488
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,188
and forgiven
by confession.

489
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:30,633
All right.

490
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:34,080
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.

491
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:36,707
All right.

492
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:38,949
You listen to me now,
Reverend.

493
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:41,735
You are goddamn exhausted,

494
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,591
and you give yourself
no respite.

495
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:46,177
These seizures
may owe something to that,

496
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:48,289
but it also
wouldn't surprise me

497
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:51,394
if you had a lesion
in your goddamn head,

498
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:53,570
and that's what's
giving you the seizures

499
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:57,251
and generating your chats
with the goddamn divinity.

500
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,223
No goddamn offense intended.

501
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:04,638
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here,

502
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,645
- and get yourself some rest!
- Go on, Reverend.

503
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,263
Doc's tired too,

504
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:14,465
the only reason he's
talking so fucking harsh.

505
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,589
Could not the lesion be

506
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,944
the instrument of God's
instructive intention, Doctor,

507
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:28,191
if I am so afflicted?

508
00:32:28,228 --> 00:32:30,016
Well, of course it could,

509
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:33,629
His ways not being ours
and so forth.

510
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:37,179
But could He not,
Reverend, just want you

511
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:40,895
getting out of here and getting yourself
some goddamn rest?

512
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:03,129
- You have to go now.
- We don't have to do nothing,

513
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:05,207
I'd pay the same price
just to sit with you.

514
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:08,542
My brother works in this place up here,
and he keeps a hard watch.

515
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:10,429
If you wanna stick it
in me tomorrow,

516
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:12,219
you better let me
go in by myself.

517
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,906
- What time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, I guess.

518
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,503
I'll be receiving
around noon.

519
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:21,652
All right, Flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.

520
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:22,807
You're swell.

521
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:36,150
Evening.
Evening, miss.

522
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,351
- You're early.
- Yes.

523
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:42,519
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.

524
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:45,850
I knew you would've had a cheerier
look on your face if you had.

525
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:49,658
Let me get you a place to sit away
from these rough sons of bitches.

526
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:55,960
Hey!

527
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:58,896
Do your drinking at the bar
or get the fuck out of here!

528
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,422
You have a seat here.

529
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:10,998
I'll get you a beverage. Do you want
a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?

530
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:13,204
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.

531
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,095
Did she find her dad?

532
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,381
Her chances of finding
her dad are greater than yours

533
00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:25,072
of walking out
of this door upright,

534
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:27,282
unless you shut
your fucking mouth.

535
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:29,228
You got it?

536
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,448
Swearengen's had his hand
on the tiller

537
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:37,006
far as getting dealing
with this epidemic.

538
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:38,606
Is that so?

539
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,653
Yeah, the dead don't
drink or chase women

540
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:42,797
must be his thinking
on that subject.

541
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:48,529
That Indian fought
like hell.

542
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,985
I'd guess you did too.

543
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:54,672
Charlie figured out
how it must have been.

544
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:59,017
The Indian had to kill me
for coming on the burial place,

545
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,580
and maybe it had been me, too,
that killed his friend,

546
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,196
cut his friend's head off so he wouldn't
have eyes to see the sunset

547
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:07,208
all those years
he'd be lying there dead.

548
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,421
So he had to kill me
for that too.

549
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,743
And he couldn't
before he'd laid hands on me

550
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:15,152
or the killing
wouldn't be honorable.

551
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:18,632
We fought like fucking hell,
I'll tell you that much,

552
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:21,127
and I never once had
the upper-hand.

553
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:23,689
It just happened out
the way it happened out.

554
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,596
He was just trying to live,
same as me,

555
00:35:27,632 --> 00:35:30,980
and do honor to his friend, and make
some fucking sense out of things.

556
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:32,747
And we wind up that way,
and I wind up

557
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:36,329
after beating him till
I couldn't recognize his face.

558
00:35:37,423 --> 00:35:39,277
For Christ's sake!

559
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:47,494
That Indian saved
Jack McCall's life,

560
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:50,730
- I'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.

561
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,102
Brian MacDonald's not coming.
I want his recommendation

562
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,082
who should assay
that widow's claim.

563
00:35:58,124 --> 00:36:00,741
- Whose?
- Swearengen's.

564
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,058
Shit, Seth.

565
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,578
Get his opinion, too, who should guard
that henhouse we're gonna build.

566
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:22,533
So... are you okay?

567
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,603
- Yes, and you?
- Yes.

568
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:28,006
They're nice here.

569
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:31,356
And Mr. Swearengen,
he's funny as all get-out.

570
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:36,384
So what place would make
a better score?

571
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,352
Where I'm working.

572
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:43,358
But why not
take 'em both?

573
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:52,645
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.

574
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:56,099
- Should I be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?

575
00:36:56,134 --> 00:36:58,075
Come here.

576
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:05,309
What do you
think of that?

577
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,643
I think that son of a bitch better stop
looking evil at that little girl.

578
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,944
So was it McCall improved
your appearance?

579
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,256
No.

580
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:24,414
Whoever got the job done,
I hope you gave as good as you got.

581
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,450
It's good to have you back,
with me being superstitious

582
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,497
and all hell breaking loose
when you left.

583
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,676
I'm here to talk
about Mrs. Garret.

584
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,462
They planted her husband
this morning?

585
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:36,472
I wrote a man about
coming to assay her claim,

586
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:38,935
- but he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.

587
00:37:38,977 --> 00:37:41,343
I want you
to nominate someone.

588
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:43,100
Do you?

589
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,373
So if any way
his work was mistaken,

590
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:47,318
I'd be coming after you.

591
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,774
- You would?
- Yeah.

592
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,199
Since I got nothing to do
with the venture,

593
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,278
what if I decline to make
the recommendation?

594
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:59,133
Then you better hope
whoever I find does his job right,

595
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,849
'cause I'm still
holding you accountable.

596
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,413
I ain't involved.

597
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:07,059
E.B. Farnum offered
on her claim.

598
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:10,298
Farnum's your water-boy and I know
what you've been trying to do to her.

599
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:13,649
So here you come
in all nobility...

600
00:38:14,653 --> 00:38:16,376
threatening me
with a dire result

601
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,649
if the property
of that widow's husband

602
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,594
thought worthless
from when it sold,

603
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:23,320
turns out not
to be pinched out.

604
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:26,106
You and I know how it is,
Mr. Swearengen.

605
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,751
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake,

606
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,412
or I come for you.

607
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:34,838
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?

608
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,369
I guess I'd better be.

609
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,995
Then close your fucking store,
'cause being ready for me

610
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,888
will take care
of your waking hours

611
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:44,467
and you better have someone to hand the
task off to when you close your eyes.

612
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,412
We understand each other.

613
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,457
Al! Al!

614
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:57,745
Jesus fucking Christ!

615
00:38:57,784 --> 00:38:59,856
Walk right past me,
Your Holiness,

616
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,651
so I can shut
my fucking office.

617
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:04,660
Al!

618
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:06,767
Go on! Stare at her now!

619
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:09,229
Huh? You like
fucking little girls?

620
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:10,677
Take a look at
that little girl

621
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:13,045
'cause she's the last thing
you're ever gonna see.

622
00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:16,208
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- Let him down!

623
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:18,100
Let him fucking down!

624
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,232
Or should I have had him
hold him up?

625
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,348
You heard what I said
about the widow.

626
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:44,753
Oh yes, Your Holiness.

627
00:39:44,787 --> 00:39:47,088
You heard me too.

628
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,456
So I take it this was
a fair fucking fight, yeah?

629
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:02,950
Yeah! That's right!

630
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:05,358
Two free drinks for everybody.

631
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:08,076
And drinks all night for them
that help with the disposal.

632
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:09,573
That's me!

633
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,384
I'm sorry that
you had to see that.

634
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:16,358
Shut the fuck up, Dan, and get her
the fuck away from here... now!

635
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,765
Come on.

636
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,621
I'm sorry,
Mr. Swearengen.

637
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,305
I warned him
not to look at her.

638
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,164
I warned him.

639
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,188
Fucking pussy.

640
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,244
That Joey passed
this afternoon.

641
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:41,764
Been suffering awful.

642
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,352
But that frog-looking
fellow left the tent

643
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:47,460
that I found up
in the woods,

644
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,565
left the tent fucking cure pronounced
by the Doc himself.

645
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:54,977
And in the dumbest looking
outfit a grown man ever wore.

646
00:40:57,227 --> 00:40:59,398
Who's there,
God damn it?!

647
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:01,441
Who the hell's
it look like?

648
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,658
How the fuck do I know
who it fucking looks like? It's dark!

649
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:13,282
Jesus Christ, come upon a person
unawares in a fucking graveyard!

650
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,102
I heard you was
back in the camp.

651
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,421
I heard you and that Bullock
got the cocksucker did for Bill.

652
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,437
Was Bill dead
by the time you saw him?

653
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,056
Yeah, he was
already dead.

654
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:50,717
Why did he let
that son of a bitch get to him?

655
00:41:50,756 --> 00:41:52,381
I don't know,
Charlie.

656
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:57,146
Anyways, people don't
scare me past speaking,

657
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:59,554
I come up here nights
tell him the fucking news.

658
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:18,394
Go ahead.

659
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:32,757
Charlie avenged
your fucking murder.

660
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,279
And that Bullock fella
was with me that you seemed to like.

661
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,741
Although it occurred to me to wonder
why they didn't do

662
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:40,856
for the cocksucker
right on the fucking spot.

663
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:43,512
Is that something we need
to get into in front of him?

664
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,713
You got the biggest mouth
in the territory. You talk to him.

665
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,789
Tell him
whatever you want.

666
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:57,659
I got that mail route
in Cheyenne that we talked about.

667
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:03,159
I was bringing back
supplies to them hardware boys

668
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:05,498
and I run into
that Bullock fella.

669
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:09,907
He was out there looking
for that McCall

670
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,802
that... that killed you.

671
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:15,893
And he run into
some heathen boy

672
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:18,451
and he had one
hell of a fight.

673
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:21,905
Boy, and he just...
he got...

674
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:23,506
he got f...

675
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,651
he got f-f...

676
00:43:26,618 --> 00:43:28,406
Fuck.

677
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:34,317
Can l...

678
00:43:35,353 --> 00:43:37,392
can I tell him
some more tomorrow?

679
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:40,528
Sure, what the fuck
you asking me for?

680
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:42,226
I don't make
the rules.

681
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:48,399
Wanna go back
to the camp?

682
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:51,154
Please.

683
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:04,433
And what must Mr. Bullock
have been thinking

684
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,633
as I inflicted my personal confidences
upon him?

685
00:44:07,669 --> 00:44:10,516
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.

686
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:12,436
At least he kept
a decent privacy.

687
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:16,911
I have to go
back to The Gem.

688
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,681
He's waiting for me now
to tell him

689
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:24,562
yours and Mr. Bullock's
thinking about selling the claim,

690
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,699
and I won't be able
to lie anymore.

691
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,746
Next I tell
will be my last.

692
00:44:28,787 --> 00:44:30,925
So I better just
get back there.

693
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:33,328
Mr. Swearengen
discovered our deception?

694
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:35,118
- Yeah.
- How?

695
00:44:35,154 --> 00:44:38,502
- Looking at you walk out of the hotel.
- He did not.

696
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:41,611
I was careful to see he
wasn't watching in the window.

697
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,129
It don't matter,
Mrs. Garret.

698
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:47,590
The point is,
I gotta go back.

699
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:49,671
And you need someone
to look to this child,

700
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:51,467
and with choices
bigger elsewhere

701
00:44:51,505 --> 00:44:53,228
and nothing I can tell
to hold you here,

702
00:44:53,264 --> 00:44:55,685
maybe you better
think about selling and getting out.

703
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:58,761
Would you wanna
take the girl and go?

704
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,865
Where?

705
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:07,239
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could go to New York.

706
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:10,954
L- I could have my relatives
there see you established.

707
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,964
What the fuck?

708
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,575
What would
keep you here?

709
00:45:17,613 --> 00:45:19,881
You wanna fuck
this man?

710
00:45:21,517 --> 00:45:24,899
Fuck him, then think
about the child...

711
00:45:24,941 --> 00:45:27,558
Don't use that language with me,
Trixie, or that tone...

712
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:30,312
Don't you wanna say
to remember my place?

713
00:45:31,372 --> 00:45:34,153
I do, you rich cunt.

714
00:45:34,188 --> 00:45:35,845
And I'm going
back to it.

715
00:45:45,771 --> 00:45:47,778
She's about to say
her name, you know.

716
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,864
She named her sisters
and her folks.

717
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,912
Think of selling.

718
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:58,244
If you took her away,
you could hear her say it.

719
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:18,300
? Old friend ?

720
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:23,227
? All the stories
to tell ?

721
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,342
? Old friend ?

722
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,237
? Could you
bid me farewell? ?

723
00:46:30,278 --> 00:46:33,441
? Ooh, old friend ?

724
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:38,910
? It might be easy
for another man to see ?

725
00:46:41,124 --> 00:46:43,011
? Old fool ?

726
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,154
? All the pain
and the scars ?

727
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:50,583
? Old fool ?

728
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:55,158
? Could you lay down
your arms? ?

729
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:58,201
? Old fool ?

730
00:46:58,242 --> 00:47:04,154
? It might be easy
for another man to see ?

731
00:47:05,537 --> 00:47:12,181
? But I think you still
look a lot like me. ?
