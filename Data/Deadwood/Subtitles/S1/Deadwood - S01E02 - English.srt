1
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:38,133
Hold it, now keep
the tension on it, boys!

2
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:41,879
Got to pull
it to the left.

3
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:43,821
That's it!

4
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:09,655
Wash-ee.

5
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,794
Wash-ee.

6
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:18,932
Eat-ee.

7
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,776
His dog
them eat-ee too.

8
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,863
Or, eat-ee him yourself,
you leering heathen.

9
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:03,312
Is this for me?

10
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,624
Brought it for you.

11
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:11,989
Get out.

12
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:20,086
Pointed the gun
at him!

13
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:22,130
Boom, shot him
right there!

14
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:24,114
That's the guy
over there.

15
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:27,057
Him and Wild Bill
got the guy right in the eye.

16
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,472
You touch that
hotel's kitchen, Seth?

17
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,785
I'll meet you.

18
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:54,234
Men like Mr. Seth Bullock
there raise their camp up.

19
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,242
Yeah, fella to be
put in that box

20
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,810
might argue with you,
Reverend.

21
00:03:57,852 --> 00:04:00,088
Mr. Bullock
did not draw first.

22
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:02,098
And I point to his
commissioning me

23
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,570
to build the departed
a coffin

24
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:05,302
and see to his
Christian burial.

25
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,959
Well, any idea
of the departed's name?

26
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,641
In his effects I found
a letter addressed to Tom Mason.

27
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:13,815
Well, I know
a Tom Mason.

28
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,886
But that feller keeping cool
in the creek, that ain't him.

29
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,615
Which, having prayed,
I decided to open.

30
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:21,336
The sender, Mrs. Walter
Mason writes,

31
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:24,187
"I've asked your brother Ned
to bear this to you."

32
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,248
From which I conclude
the departed's name is Ned.

33
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,943
Ned Mason, huh?

34
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:32,981
Perhaps the Tom Mason
you know is the dead man's brother?

35
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:35,923
If he is in camp
he should be notified.

36
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,683
No, I ain't
seen Tom around.

37
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:42,868
Coffee!

38
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:46,522
Morning, Al.

39
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:48,346
I'd like someone
to tell me what in fuck

40
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,421
is going forward
in this camp?

41
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:51,956
Tim Driscoll's
checked out.

42
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,241
I can tell you
that much.

43
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,027
- Left your hotel, has he?
- Moved to Wu's pigsty.

44
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,477
- What was that shootout about?
- At sun-up?

45
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,236
- Yeah, fucking sun-up!
- Far as I heard, Al,

46
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,140
Hickok and one of them hardware guys
you're renting to,

47
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:06,939
threw down on the fella
brought word in

48
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,762
of that squarehead
family's massacre.

49
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,205
Suspected he was
in on the kill.

50
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,694
What's it to Hickok
or that hardware guy either

51
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:14,141
how them squareheads
come to die?

52
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,800
I couldn't agree
with you more.

53
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,626
If you don't stop dragging
that fucking leg...

54
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,573
Coffee?

55
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,403
I might have
one cup.

56
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,534
Did you know one
squarehead lived?

57
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,698
Little squarehead girl.
They took her to the doc's.

58
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,775
- What condition?
- I don't know, Al.

59
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,953
If she was to live,

60
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,649
wouldn't she have
a story to tell?

61
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:17,504
Wake up.

62
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:20,504
- How's that little one?
- She's still among us.

63
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:23,098
I'm asking you what
her prospects are?

64
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,657
If her wounds
don't fester,

65
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,243
she might can have
a fighting chance.

66
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:31,168
Good.

67
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,590
None of that
to him.

68
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,520
Oh, he's all right.

69
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,440
Not a word.

70
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,512
- Morning.
- Morning, Bullock.

71
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:41,823
I was wondering
how that child fared.

72
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:43,865
Iffy. Touch and go.

73
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,978
I'm not optimistic.

74
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,578
Has she spoken?

75
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,407
She's not conscious.

76
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,159
Be surprised
if she ever is.

77
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,594
I'd like to hear
whichever way it goes.

78
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,944
If you see Bill Hickok,

79
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,415
or that sore asshole,
Charlie Utter,

80
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,313
could you tell him
I looked to the stock?

81
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:07,452
Sure, I'll let him know.

82
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,393
You're wrong
not to trust him.

83
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:13,434
He formed a party that
found that little one

84
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,133
among all the dead
of her family.

85
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,626
Didn't he?

86
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:21,311
And didn't he also shoot a man
he suspected in the murders?

87
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:24,030
And if I were
to confide in him

88
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,401
would he circulate my optimism?
I mean, wouldn't he say,

89
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:29,053
"When the little one speaks,
you'll see I was right.

90
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,677
Not the Sioux killed her family,
but road agents"?

91
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:35,425
And supposing
it was road agents,

92
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,663
and they hear his talk,

93
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,114
where's the little one
stand then?

94
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:44,155
You got a dark
turn of mind.

95
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:48,538
I see as much misery outta them
moving to justify theirselves

96
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,427
as them that set out
to do harm.

97
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:02,083
Same dead roach
in the same damn biscuit.

98
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,018
He stuck to
his position.

99
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,908
- Morning.
- Morning, Montana.

100
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,870
Yeah.

101
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,553
- Joe?
- Much obliged.

102
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,760
Your friend asked me to say
she's looked to your stock.

103
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,008
Thanks.

104
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,346
She's back now watching
over that child we found.

105
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:28,611
Far as her chances,
the doc's not optimistic.

106
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,532
From the look of him,

107
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,931
think that doc's been wrong
once or twice in his life?

108
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:36,261
Maybe once
or twice.

109
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,333
We'll likely be by
your tent later.

110
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:41,123
Get Bill here outfitted
with some prospecting gear.

111
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:42,434
Yes, sir.

112
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,114
Don't do that,
Charlie.

113
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,867
- Do what?
- Trumpet my intentions.

114
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,462
Herd me like
a damn steer.

115
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:00,095
Ain't you here
to prospect gold?

116
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:03,004
If you're just gonna gamble,
Bill, let's get it set.

117
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,802
I'll arrange appearance
money for you.

118
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,326
That ain't gambling.
It's shilling for the house.

119
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,214
It's getting you a regular
damn source of income.

120
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:13,313
So's this don't
wind up like Cheyenne.

121
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,000
What offer should we make
at the purchase of that lot?

122
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,813
Barber next to us
paid 600 for his lot 10 days ago.

123
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,597
- Seller's market.
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,828
I'd say we're well bought at 750,
we don't go past 1,000.

125
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:33,857
Uh, may I, um,
join you?

126
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,699
Well, Mr. Bullock,

127
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,645
after the events
of last night,

128
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:46,502
for an ink-stained
wretch like myself

129
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,957
finding you
and Mr. Hickok here

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,902
in the same dining room
is luck indeed.

131
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:54,563
I don't want to talk about
last night's events.

132
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,447
All right,
fair enough.

133
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,741
I now pocket
my notebook, sir.

134
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,413
The same wretched
biscuits.

135
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:08,573
Mrs. Garret.

136
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:14,273
I hoped you
slept well.

137
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,687
As it happens,
I did not.

138
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,793
I'm very sorry.
Do you require the doctor?

139
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,491
Yes. Please.

140
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,595
Certainly, ma'am,
of course.

141
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,934
Sorry you're
poorly again.

142
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,681
That is Mrs. Alma Garret.

143
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,609
Whose husband,
I'm told,

144
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:48,937
standing at the bar
at Swearengen's saloon

145
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,574
purchased a gold claim
last night for $20,000.

146
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,976
We rent our lot
from Al Swearengen.

147
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,182
I'm not surprised
to hear it.

148
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:03,786
Tim Driscoll,
the claim's seller,

149
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,542
lives here
in this hotel.

150
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,487
He, uh...

151
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,418
must be sleeping in.

152
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,769
Do you mind?

153
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,018
Morning, boys!

154
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,774
- Good morning!
- Ellsworth.

155
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:34,665
Name's Ellsworth.

156
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,739
I hear you bought
these digs.

157
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,568
Brom Garret,
how do you do?

158
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:40,327
My claim's
next one over.

159
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,673
I see.

160
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,715
You cleaning up
any yellow?

161
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,243
Day's young!

162
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,447
How are things
running at your claim?

163
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:52,517
Made my quota for whiskey,
pussy and food.

164
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,009
Then you best get on down
to The Gem, Ellsworth.

165
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:59,689
Further efforts'll only
benefit the faro dealers.

166
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:03,816
This exact spot showed a fistful
of nuggets two nights ago.

167
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,122
Well, don't weaken,
pilgrim.

168
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:07,562
Nuggets are nothing.

169
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:09,539
She's usually gonna
show you some flake.

170
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,082
Thanks for
the encouraging words.

171
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:22,567
She hasn't even
showed me any flake.

172
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,577
Oh, hell.

173
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:34,116
"Well, I doubt that,
Reverend," I say,

174
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:37,223
"the Tom Mason I know
is nowhere near here."

175
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:38,887
But what I was thinking

176
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,893
is damned if Al didn't
center shoot the bull's-eye.

177
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:46,090
It wasn't Sioux
killed them squareheads.

178
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:48,297
But it was
Persimmon Phil,

179
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:52,262
Tom Mason and that croaker
headed for his coffin.

180
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,723
Who's probably some fuck-up younger
brother of Tom's named Ned.

181
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,969
Listen to me,
go get Doc Cochran.

182
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:59,340
And I never tipped
the thumper to none of it, Al.

183
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:00,748
Played it dumb
as a pile of rocks.

184
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:04,262
Go get the doc.
Say I want him to see to the whores.

185
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,596
All right, Al.

186
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:10,892
'Scuse me, fella.

187
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,356
Mr. Swearengen.

188
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,773
Yeah, that's right.

189
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,629
- Sol Star.
- Seth Bullock.

190
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,069
Rent on lot four.

191
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:19,045
Lot four?

192
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,290
The hardware boys,
hmm?

193
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,748
Here, I wanna buy you
fellas a drink.

194
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,678
How's business
on that lot?

195
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,304
Hell of a spot,
isn't it?

196
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:30,410
Any more foot traffic
you'd have to call it a riot.

197
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,414
Now, I'm turning
back slow.

198
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,609
Nothing in hand
but this whiskey bottle.

199
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:42,955
I heard you're not a man
I want mistaking my intentions.

200
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:45,861
Who says that?
I'd like to ask 'em what they mean.

201
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,391
- A fella drew on Seth this morning.
- Never heard different.

202
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,122
No one mistook
his intentions.

203
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,298
Let's leave it
all alone.

204
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,856
I am stupidest
when I try to be funny.

205
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,196
There you go, fellas.

206
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,333
And these are
still free.

207
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,256
Sorry for hitting
a nerve, huh?

208
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,492
We'd like to make an offer
on that lot we're renting.

209
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,055
Sell my back teeth
for the right money.

210
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,590
Would 600
get the job done?

211
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,535
I guess before I made
a price I'd want to know if you boys

212
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,780
- have unnamed partners?
- Why?

213
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:18,889
I think specifically
Wild Bill Hickok.

214
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,717
Didn't you act together
this morning?

215
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,444
We just met Wild Bill.

216
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,586
What business
of that is his?

217
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,031
You mean what business
of mine is that?

218
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,454
Don't tell me
what the fuck I mean.

219
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:30,831
Not a tone
to get a deal done.

220
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,621
Can we sort it out
another time?

221
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,567
Thirsty people coming.

222
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,317
Sure.

223
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:41,223
You and me will find
our proper stride.

224
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,753
- All right.
- Good luck on the day's trade.

225
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:46,477
Won't wish you luck. I can tell you
ain't the type that needs it,

226
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,270
Sol Star, right?
That's a Jewish name.

227
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:51,567
- Mine isn't, but nice to meet you, son.
- Pleasure.

228
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,023
Marked you for an earner the minute
you come in my sight.

229
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,756
Jew bastard.

230
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:01,511
Ah, two wayfarers
when I'd heard you were three.

231
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:02,895
How you doing, Al?

232
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:06,088
Shall we all?
Let's drink upstairs.

233
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:07,560
I can be persuaded.

234
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:10,416
Will you have a whore, Tom, or you still
staying true to that heifer?

235
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,207
It's over
'tween me and her.

236
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:15,439
Old Tommy went sweet
on a buffalo down by Yankton.

237
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:17,580
Where's brother Neddy,
anyway?

238
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,277
Fuck if I know,
that fucker.

239
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,388
I'll take her.

240
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,041
Pick another.

241
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,442
I don't like
that son of a bitch.

242
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,068
Thank God you didn't
let him see it.

243
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,497
Calls me loose with a gun.
Was he there?

244
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,190
We'll just get the lot bought and have
nothing to do with him.

245
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:36,398
Buy the lot and then
we'll give him wide berth.

246
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,825
I've acted on your commission,
Mr. Bullock.

247
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:41,682
- Built a coffin and dug a grave.
- Thank you.

248
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:44,563
Will you join me,
now for the burial service?

249
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:50,091
All I was saying, Bill,

250
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,139
is till you start
your prospecting,

251
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,798
if you're gonna gamble,
let's get you protected a little.

252
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,397
I know what
you were saying.

253
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,574
The extra business
you bring a joint,

254
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:02,191
interruptions you stand for
or folks wanting to glad-hand,

255
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,594
that all deserves
compensation.

256
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,443
Don't shop me
to those places, Charlie.

257
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,054
E.B. Farnum,
gentlemen.

258
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:13,067
Mr. Utter's room
is ready.

259
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,035
Clean
and thoroughly aired.

260
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,299
The previous guest
was Irish.

261
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,716
No tip necessary, sir.

262
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:40,269
I operate the hotel.

263
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,548
I've replenished
your supply of medicine.

264
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:56,908
Thank you, Doctor.

265
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,088
I'm very grateful
for your attention.

266
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:02,541
I only wish my symptoms
would subside.

267
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,681
If I were to tell you that I would see
to your requirements,

268
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,988
whether you had
symptoms or not,

269
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:10,805
do you suppose

270
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,528
that would help
you to heal?

271
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,127
I don't know
what you mean.

272
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,825
I believe you do,
madam.

273
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,750
I believe we
understand each other.

274
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,441
There are people
in this camp

275
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:22,478
in genuine need
of my attention.

276
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,901
Make this adequate
to your purposes

277
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:27,503
for the next
several days.

278
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:29,070
Well, thank you,
Doctor.

279
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,669
Listen to Tom
carrying on in there.

280
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:38,158
Bad luck he wasn't
here yesterday.

281
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,825
Yeah, what'd we miss?

282
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,631
Squarehead family
I could've tipped you to

283
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,973
- heading back to Minnesota.
- Well off?

284
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:48,397
Worth still trying
to catch, are they?

285
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,901
Sioux already
caught up with them.

286
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,147
Did them last night
on the road to Spearfish.

287
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:54,256
Heathen cocksuckers.

288
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:57,013
So we missed a good
score there, did we?

289
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,641
Keep lying

290
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,102
and I'll murder you
in that chair.

291
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:09,975
I'm gonna tell you
what happened, Al.

292
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:12,309
And this is the God's
honest truth.

293
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,766
We come on that family
by accident.

294
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,191
Nobody was trying to hold out your end
or anything of the sort.

295
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,786
Or to conceal
a goddamned thing.

296
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:22,712
That's your end,
right there.

297
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,654
Weighed to the ounce.

298
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,919
My problem was we didn't
clear this with you.

299
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:32,182
And you know
how you get, Al.

300
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:34,006
I mean, you know
that yourself.

301
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:37,838
But my problem
was bringing up the subject.

302
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,540
But, uh...

303
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:42,447
that's all weighed
out there.

304
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,686
You know why I get
how I get?

305
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,853
You wanna see over the job,
you don't like loose ends.

306
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,483
- I appreciate that.
- Don't like messes,

307
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,410
things done half-ass,

308
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,133
bags of shit
left to hold.

309
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,504
There's no loose ends,
I'll guarantee you.

310
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,742
'Cause I got a whole
operation here to consider.

311
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:03,129
Listen to Tom.

312
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,300
One of the squareheads
lived.

313
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,456
- No.
- No?

314
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:11,670
I'm saying that's
pretty hard to believe.

315
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:14,903
I believe you, but we seen to 'em
pretty good.

316
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,175
They brought it to camp.
It's at the sawbone's.

317
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:20,277
Is it talking?
Can it speak English?

318
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:23,348
When we was seeing to 'em,
they was all screaming in squarehead.

319
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,688
Where's Ned Mason?

320
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,867
That's a fucking story
right there, Al.

321
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,078
If you knew
the fucking problem.

322
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:36,083
When it comes
the squarehead's time,

323
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,530
he spooks
and runs off.

324
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:39,451
Tom's and my hands
as full as they was,

325
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:40,858
doing what we
had to do,

326
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:42,964
so God knows where
he got off to.

327
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:45,971
That's your cut there.
That reflects he's out.

328
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,735
- There's no cut there-
- He came here.

329
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,963
No.

330
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:53,371
Say no again,
I'll murder you where you sit.

331
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:55,313
He swore he'd head
to Cheyenne.

332
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:56,916
Yeah, but here's closer,
isn't it?

333
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,291
All you cocksuckers
go for the easiest chance.

334
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:04,667
So, where is he now?

335
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,700
Where he is now is he
stirs the whole camp up

336
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,430
last night with
his massacre story

337
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:11,835
till I'm giving liquor
away and cunt at half price

338
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,429
just to keep
my crowd controlled.

339
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:16,119
Party makes up from Nuttall's to ride
back out to Spearfish.

340
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:19,004
Wild Bill Hickok and those two guys
walked past you downstairs

341
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,557
save the squarehead kid,
tell Ned to stick around

342
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,636
till they see what the kid
has to say about him.

343
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,138
Wild Bill Hickok?

344
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:28,115
And Ned throws down.

345
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,782
Against Wild Bill Hickok?

346
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:32,919
Against Hickok and this other cocksucker
who draws almost as fast.

347
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:35,193
So it's a tossup
who blew Ned's head off.

348
00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:39,636
Christ, Al...

349
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:43,190
I'm really
sorry for the bother.

350
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,044
So you let Ned run,
you leave a squarehead alive

351
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,795
and me to clean up the mess
and those are the only loose ends?

352
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,436
I want you
to have my share.

353
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,357
I swear to fucking
Christ, Al.

354
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,950
I don't want
your fucking share.

355
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:59,063
I don't want that kid
telling people in English,

356
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:01,950
or squarehead or drawing pictures
in the shit with twigs

357
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:05,016
about how it wasn't Indians
that killed her people but whites!

358
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,046
This camp could
be up for grabs.

359
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,151
God knows what these
cocksuckers are up to

360
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:14,133
or what I'm gonna have
to do about it.

361
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:15,997
Just when I need to keep
my head clear

362
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,038
you give me these bags
of shit to hold!

363
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,282
I should cut
your fucking throat, Phil!

364
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,693
Please don't
cut my throat.

365
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,028
Let me help you
straighten this out.

366
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:26,452
That snatch
is branded!

367
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,761
What happened?

368
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,229
Tipped over.

369
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,141
I'm helping him up.
Put your iron away now, Tom.

370
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:38,644
Not yet!

371
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,370
Branding at the flag!

372
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,501
Doc?

373
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,280
You'll get me
in Dutch with Al!

374
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,846
Just another
damn moment!

375
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:55,351
Don't put any pressure on it,
just lay it on light.

376
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,595
It looks like
I'm pressing, I'm not.

377
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,339
I'm not putting
any goddamned pressure!

378
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:04,310
That's very good.
That's very good.

379
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,970
Doc!

380
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,634
I gotta go.

381
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:14,395
I expect care for them
whore's business areas

382
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,472
is a big damn part
of your income.

383
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,270
This is what
you want me to do?

384
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,418
Ah, yes.

385
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:25,693
And don't
let anyone in.

386
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,551
Believe me, anyone tries
getting in here

387
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,593
who's not you is gonna be
damn fucking sorry.

388
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,672
All right.

389
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,786
I may not
let you back.

390
00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:45,212
Our Christ,
as He was crucified

391
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,632
addressed the thief
who was hanging by His side.

392
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,583
"Verily I say
unto thee, this day

393
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:54,237
shalt thou be
with Me in paradise."

394
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:57,405
Your ways are not
our ways, O Lord.

395
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,639
We abide the just
and the unjust alike

396
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,049
under Your tearless eye.

397
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,832
Tearless not because
You do not see us,

398
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,248
but...

399
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,657
because You see
what we are so well.

400
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:17,089
Lamb of God, Who takest
away the sin of the world,

401
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:20,352
send Your angels to welcome
this body into paradise.

402
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:23,682
Lamb of God, Who takest away
the sin of the world,

403
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:26,081
grant this soul
eternal rest.

404
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,489
Amen.

405
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:31,036
That's a real generous
perspective, Reverend.

406
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:34,937
And don't we need all
the generosity we can get?

407
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,530
They butt into
other people's business

408
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:51,611
and make the business
of others their own,

409
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:54,270
these bought-out
no-good cocksuckers.

410
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,642
What, Hickok
you're talking about?

411
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,202
Fucking bigshot
that he is.

412
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,513
Big fucking shot
when he's standing in front of you.

413
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,523
One in his ear
from behind, I'd like to see

414
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:05,282
- how fucking tough he was.
- That's right. Cocksucker.

415
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:07,487
Anyway, rest his soul.

416
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,019
That's all.

417
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,515
Condolences, Tom.

418
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:13,531
He's gone, Johnny.

419
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:15,776
I don't think
you ever did meet him.

420
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:18,366
Ah, no.
Doc's here.

421
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,636
Fuck Hickok!

422
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,386
And what he did
to your poor brother, huh?

423
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,992
This is festered

424
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,298
because you won't take
a flame to your needle.

425
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,789
I do, Doc, every time
before I use it.

426
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:36,479
- Stop lying.
- Anyways, I'm quitting.

427
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,907
They say you're looking
to a little one, Doc.

428
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,146
- How's that unguent working?
- It's nice and cool on me, Doc.

429
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:46,020
I'm trying just a little
bit more lanolin in it.

430
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:47,941
Hey, give me
a dollop of that!

431
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:51,493
How's that pussy
lotion feel?

432
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,500
Should I try
some on my ass?

433
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,298
Al.

434
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:56,741
Will she live?

435
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:59,108
Let me look
at your belly.

436
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:01,051
I didn't know
you cared, Doc.

437
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,883
Will who live, Al?

438
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,307
Norwegian kid.
How many children you caring for?

439
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,073
I'm not optimistic.

440
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:09,053
I see.

441
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:10,620
Where are you
in your moons?

442
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:12,670
- 'Bout two weeks along.
- She speak English?

443
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,598
What's she gotta say
for herself anyway?

444
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:17,413
She hasn't said a word
or been conscious for a second.

445
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:19,356
Oh, too bad.

446
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,814
She could settle who killed her people,
road agents or Sioux.

447
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,189
I don't know nothing about that.
Does that hurt?

448
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,419
- Little bit.
- If she does see, that's the point.

449
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,211
She could settle it.

450
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:32,451
I doubt she'll
settle anything.

451
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,974
I doubt we'll even know
what language she spoke.

452
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,182
Give these girls
a good going over, Doc.

453
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,110
Look to 'em like
they're your own.

454
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,925
Don't tell me my job
or how long to do it in.

455
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,894
I can see to them
and I can see to the way

456
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:52,449
I'm goddamned able,
and that is all I can goddamned do!

457
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:55,073
Oh, what's your time
of the month, huh?

458
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:05,894
Are you poorly, Doc?

459
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:08,645
Don't worry about me,
I know what I am.

460
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,753
What I'm not.

461
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,254
What do you want?

462
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:33,062
Doc asked me
to see your patient.

463
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,487
What for?
What do you know about it?

464
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,056
Who the fuck
are you?

465
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:43,172
Hey, don't you
fucking ignore me!

466
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,849
You don't want
to interfere with me.

467
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,508
- Think I'm scared of you?
- Sure you are.

468
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,585
If I take
a knife to you,

469
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,015
you'll be scared worse
and a long time dying.

470
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:55,814
I ain't scared
to die.

471
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,279
I ain't scared
of nobody.

472
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:03,554
Get away from her!

473
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:07,463
Le... leave...

474
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,604
Leave that little
one alone!

475
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:11,976
- Leave her alone!
- Hello.

476
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:14,978
Leave her!
Leave...

477
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:17,320
Leave her alone,
you cocksucker!

478
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,895
Do it to me
if you have to!

479
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,873
Why would
I do it to you?

480
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,417
Did you hurt her?

481
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:55,623
No.

482
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,667
No, Doc.

483
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,617
But she's better
than you thought.

484
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,962
Her eyes are open.

485
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:23,495
I fell apart.

486
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:26,118
I couldn't look out
for the little one.

487
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:28,874
Fucker looked at me

488
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,535
and I fell apart
in front of him.

489
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:33,479
All right.

490
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:38,216
You're not the first.

491
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:40,261
No, I'm not the first.

492
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,188
Who said I was
the first?

493
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,229
You think he's
the fucking first?

494
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,960
I've been fucked
plenty!

495
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:47,656
And tougher fucks
than he was

496
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:49,733
and littler
than her by plenty!

497
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:52,970
They fucked me plenty!
So you can go fuck yourself!

498
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,917
Go on, head out.

499
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,868
I'll look after her.

500
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,452
Was he a road agent?

501
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:12,137
Was he among them
that did for her family?

502
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:14,475
He owns The Gem Saloon.

503
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:16,780
Then what's it to him
if she can open her eyes?

504
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,189
You go on ahead.

505
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,077
Does road agents
work for him?

506
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:22,183
I'll take care
of her.

507
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:39,717
I'm sorry.

508
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,702
I apologize.

509
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:43,653
You got nothing
to apologize for.

510
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,354
You gotta gift
for this.

511
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:47,366
You cared
for her real good.

512
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:50,604
- Don't be mean.
- No.

513
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,549
You got a gift.

514
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,392
Mr. Garret?

515
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,799
How was your day
at the digs?

516
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,036
It was a mixed experience,
Mr. Farnum.

517
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:23,626
My claim retains every
bit of its promise,

518
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,705
but I'm afraid
I've injured my back.

519
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:27,501
All that twisting
and turning.

520
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:29,740
It's wrenched at least
and I feel worse.

521
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:32,777
I may not be cut out
for this sort of activity.

522
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:35,337
Oh, many aren't.

523
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:38,727
Under the circumstances,
perhaps I should reconsider.

524
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,657
What, sir?

525
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,177
I refer to your offer
on my gold claim.

526
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,006
My offer?

527
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,463
Last night, Mr. Farnum,
before witnesses

528
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:49,993
at The Gem Saloon
you offered 16,000.

529
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,495
I see.

530
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:54,058
I'm prepared
to reconsider.

531
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:57,775
I have a confession
to make, Mr. Garret.

532
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,239
I have a weakness
for spirits.

533
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,257
You saying you were
drunk last night?

534
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,435
I must've been, sir.

535
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,995
I black out and no memory
at all of my actions.

536
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:09,166
Please ignore any offers
made while in my condition.

537
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,591
And yet you didn't
seem drunk.

538
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:15,890
I suppose that's why
I'm such a danger to myself.

539
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,571
Jesus Christ Almighty, Al.

540
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:37,513
Far as that sewer-mouth
friend of Hickok's playing nurse,

541
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:39,758
you can tip her over
with a feather.

542
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:41,901
But a little girl?

543
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:44,492
It's hard
on my conscious.

544
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:47,499
We could let her spread word
that folks got road agents

545
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,354
to fear more than Indians.
Breed mistrust, one white for another

546
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:53,202
throughout the camp.
That'd be another option. Is he ready?

547
00:31:53,236 --> 00:31:55,243
Tom's ready,
but he's awful drunk.

548
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:58,098
I don't trust him
to pull it off.

549
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,619
Not a bank job. He walks up
to the cocksucker, puts one in his ear.

550
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,514
He keeps running
that mouth like he is,

551
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,915
Hickok ain't gonna
let him get close enough.

552
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:07,217
Who in fuck is it?

553
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:09,324
Them hardware guys is asking
for you downstairs.

554
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:13,834
Tell 'em I'll be
fucking down.

555
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:17,967
Pour coffee down Tom,
'cause he is going out

556
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,728
tonight to murder that
son of a bitch.

557
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:22,285
Where do you
and me stand?

558
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,742
We're all right.

559
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,199
What are you
supposed to do?

560
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:37,069
Nothing.

561
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,787
Don't ever say
nothing to no one.

562
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:45,140
I don't know if you
can understand me,

563
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,083
but if you can,
don't show it.

564
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,179
If you gotta talk,
talk like that.

565
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:27,086
See if this makes
sense to you, Seth.

566
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,188
I do the talking.

567
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,954
Fine with me.

568
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:33,616
Some people
don't get along.

569
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:36,208
They have business to do,
they find a way around it.

570
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,134
Don't talk to me
like I'm five.

571
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,239
- Boys.
- Evening.

572
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,685
Sol's got my proxy.

573
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,792
Me and him,
we should talk without you?

574
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:45,686
That's what it means.

575
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,378
What's your partner
so mad about all the time?

576
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:54,765
- He's not mad.
- He's got a mean way of being happy.

577
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:57,972
Far as offering
on your lot,

578
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:59,732
we'd probably
go 750.

579
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:01,711
You'd probably go
1,000.

580
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:04,501
Say we would.
Does 1,000 get it done?

581
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:07,405
My concern, Sol.

582
00:34:07,449 --> 00:34:10,002
- You don't mind if I call you Sol?
- Please do.

583
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,429
My concern, anything can happen
under a tent.

584
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:15,342
A hardware operation can turn
into a gambling joint,

585
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,457
- ain't that right?
- That's not gonna happen.

586
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,733
Sell to you boys outright,
I could be installing

587
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:21,940
my own eventul competition
in a prime location,

588
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,886
with the A number one
man killer in the West

589
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,555
holding an unnamed
piece of the action.

590
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:28,441
We met Hickok by coincidence.
He's not an unnamed partner.

591
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:31,540
So you say.
But a camp like this,

592
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:34,610
no law
or enforceable contract.

593
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,591
You gotta watch
a man a while

594
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:38,520
till you see what
his word counts for.

595
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,441
Would you like
some company?

596
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:42,164
No.

597
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,736
Say we value the lot
at 1,000,

598
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:49,909
you boys give me 500 and whatever
you should put that tent to

599
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:52,466
between now and the first snow.
I'm in for half the net.

600
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:55,353
Come October, we finish the deal
knowing each other better.

601
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:58,833
Seth won't accept it,
Mr. Swearengen.

602
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:00,499
I thought you had
his proxy.

603
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:01,912
Just up to a point.

604
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:04,084
See, that ain't
my sense of proxy.

605
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,031
That's what I'd want
these few months for

606
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,634
till we agreed
what things meant.

607
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:10,544
I'm telling you,
we're a hardware operation.

608
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:12,277
You heard my offer.

609
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,386
He didn't wanna drink
and he didn't wanna fuck.

610
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,053
Anyone or just you?

611
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:32,721
We pay 500 now. He gets 50%
of our net till the first snow.

612
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,032
- Then buy out the rest of his interest.
- No.

613
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:37,239
It's a great location.
He wants to be sure

614
00:35:37,276 --> 00:35:39,315
we don't turn to gambling
or that Hickok's with us.

615
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,843
- I won't be partners.
- We wouldn't be after October.

616
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:44,753
I won't be partners.

617
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:46,999
Trixie.

618
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,305
See, you got Trixie
all distressed.

619
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,194
- She wanted to give you a ride.
- 1,000, now!

620
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:54,010
If anyone in that tent
or the building we put up

621
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:55,767
turns a playing card,
or pours a drink,

622
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:59,251
or offers a woman's services, you get
title back and keep our money.

623
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,707
What makes you talk to me
in that tone of voice?

624
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:04,985
I'm making
a counter-offer.

625
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,322
You come into camp,
rent my lot,

626
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:09,528
within six hours,
you blow in a guy's eye

627
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,474
with Wild Bill Hickok
backing your play.

628
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,555
Next day I'm supposed
to sell you the lot,

629
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:16,793
put you in business
without asking who you are

630
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,447
or what you're doing here?

631
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:21,372
Far as what happened
in the street

632
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,193
with Bill Hickok
being involved,

633
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:25,203
that was a turn
of events.

634
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:26,740
A what?

635
00:36:26,781 --> 00:36:29,301
It was a turn
of events.

636
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,228
Oh, a turn of events.

637
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,650
Your partner calls
it a coincidence.

638
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:36,311
So what with this coincidence
and turn of events

639
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,870
staring me in the face
and five other things

640
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,179
I'm supposed to be paying
attention to,

641
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:43,101
I still make you
a sensible proposal

642
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,272
and you answer
by insulting me in my own joint.

643
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,618
Seth didn't mean
to insult you.

644
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,377
You don't know
nothing about this.

645
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,453
You weren't here,
you don't have his proxy.

646
00:36:50,494 --> 00:36:53,363
So do whatever you people do when
you're not running your mouths off

647
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:55,795
or cheating people out
of what they earn by Christian work.

648
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,707
- You don't wanna be talking that way.
- Don't tell me how to talk

649
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,757
in my own fucking
place!

650
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,245
And here's my counter-offer
to your counter-offer.

651
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:07,189
Go fuck yourself!

652
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:10,522
Come here, Seth.

653
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,737
Seth.

654
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,978
Get him away
from me.

655
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:20,153
Mister.

656
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:23,387
The best bath
and blowjob you ever had's

657
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:25,332
not 12 steps
up them stairs.

658
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:29,885
Mister!

659
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:39,231
I may as well
confide in you, Alma.

660
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,790
Of course.

661
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:42,839
I'm beginning to feel
we've been duped.

662
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,702
Our gold claim
may be worthless.

663
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:47,069
I'm beginning
to think that even

664
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,558
Swearengen's name should be added
to the conspirators' list.

665
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,145
- How disappointed you must be.
- I know.

666
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,605
I told you I'd believed
I'd found a friend in Al.

667
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,436
As I now look back,

668
00:37:57,472 --> 00:38:00,025
Al not only presided
the sale,

669
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:02,584
he facilitated my involvement
at every turn.

670
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:05,144
Well, I suppose
a community such as this

671
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:08,665
attracts a certain
kind of man.

672
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:13,439
I've mentioned to you
exchanging hellos

673
00:38:13,473 --> 00:38:15,807
with Wild Bill Hickok
in the hotel hallway?

674
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:18,743
Yes, you said he seemed
very friendly.

675
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:22,013
Very friendly.
In the hallway and on the stairs.

676
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,791
Do you suppose
we might enlist him to our cause?

677
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:29,469
Do you think that that's
the sort of thing he does?

678
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:33,083
For a fee, a percentage
of the monies recovered,

679
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:35,609
I'd say that's
exactly his line.

680
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,537
Hmm.

681
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,366
I may well include
the name of Al Swearengen

682
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,003
when Wild Bill
and I confer.

683
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:46,107
This camp is
a going concern.

684
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:48,000
We could secure
our futures here.

685
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,423
- Hardware could just be a start.
- Camp needs a bank.

686
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:53,248
Camp also needs a bank
is exactly right.

687
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,802
Seth.

688
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:57,881
If you see all
these possibilities

689
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:59,896
why get sidetracked
by that saloon-keeper?

690
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,621
We just wanna
buy his lot.

691
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:04,414
What about what
he called you?

692
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:06,360
I been called
worse by better.

693
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,067
Get it in writing
from that son of a bitch.

694
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:13,016
We buy the other half
in October.

695
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:15,872
Just leave it to me.

696
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:24,892
- Evening.
- Evening.

697
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:29,472
Bill and me didn't
make it to your tent today.

698
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:31,546
Tomorrow's another day.

699
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:33,759
Prospect.

700
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:37,373
His express purpose
coming to this camp.

701
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:40,477
Make a stake
for his new wife.

702
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:42,971
His idea.

703
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,590
Don't suggest
buying a shovel or a sifting cradle.

704
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:47,740
Huh-uh.

705
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:52,670
Ah, uh-oh.
Ah.

706
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,457
Anyways,
have a good evening.

707
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:59,097
What's your secret,
Bullock?

708
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,798
What do you mean?

709
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:03,586
You got some
of Bill's qualities

710
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:05,955
but then you got
something he's missing.

711
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,502
Get along with people,
turn a dollar,

712
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,607
look out for yourself.

713
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:14,532
He don't know
how to do that.

714
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:16,387
You see what I'm saying?

715
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:19,355
I like to know your secret

716
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:21,022
so's then I can tell it
to Bill.

717
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:23,362
I don't know
any secrets.

718
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:24,923
Don't tell me
if you don't want.

719
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,420
Find occasion
and tell him yourself.

720
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,054
He likes you.

721
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,478
Just don't
wait too long.

722
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,058
- How you feel?
- One more shot,

723
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:50,949
and I'll be ready
to take that cocksucker.

724
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,829
Maybe one more cup
of coffee.

725
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:03,487
I'm out for a couple.

726
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,981
Go get you some
more ammo Wild Bill.

727
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:07,549
That kinda looks
down to turn.

728
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,957
- Your name's Jack?
- Yeah, that's correct.

729
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,964
What are you in the game
for, Jack?

730
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:14,144
What am I
in it for?

731
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:17,150
If irritating me's the jackpot,
you've got the job done.

732
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:26,146
Montana.

733
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,386
- Evening.
- Evening.

734
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:33,244
What'd be your opinion
far as me getting another 50?

735
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:35,326
You want another 50
in credit?

736
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,604
If that's all right
with you?

737
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,095
Yeah, I suppose so.

738
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,309
- Play poker?
- I'm no good at it.

739
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,514
You let that
slow you down?

740
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:51,650
Fella in the far corner to your right
intends me harm.

741
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:54,241
When he makes his move,

742
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,094
would you keep an eye
on the man with him?

743
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:01,475
You bet.

744
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:03,105
See the fella's I mean?

745
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:04,704
Yes, I do.

746
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:07,200
Thanks, Montana.

747
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,574
Wouldn't want
the water

748
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:11,517
getting no deeper
than this, Mr. Hickok.

749
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:13,470
Fair enough.

750
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:16,871
Stand away
from me, Sol.

751
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:25,507
Don't be too stupid,
Jack.

752
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:29,510
I restored
our bosoms!

753
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:35,807
- They throw you out?
- No, they did not!

754
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,752
I left on my own stand.

755
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:40,801
I choose
to be out here.

756
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,875
Well I was drinking down
by the goddamned creek

757
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:45,985
outta my own
fucking free will.

758
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:51,427
Where's Bill?

759
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:53,124
Inside,

760
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:55,431
losing at cards.

761
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:58,248
I'd go get him
but he'd accuse me

762
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:00,671
of herding him
like a damn steer.

763
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:09,952
Someone I need
to go kill.

764
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:12,513
What, who?

765
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:16,099
You are not my target,
but keep bothering me

766
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,026
and I'll add you
to the list.

767
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:20,480
Who we talking
about, damn it!?

768
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:22,792
Greasy-haired
limey cocksucker

769
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:25,193
that runs
The Gem Saloon.

770
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,838
What the hell
you wanna kill him for?

771
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,460
For showing me
two different things

772
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,354
between the coward

773
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:35,972
and the lapse
of momentary fear.

774
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:37,669
Listen, Jane!
You listen to me!

775
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:39,977
I don't know what
you're talking about.

776
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:42,346
I guaran-fucking-tee

777
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:43,939
you have at that man

778
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,314
and you won't come out
of that joint alive.

779
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:48,486
No!
The sun ain't rose

780
00:43:48,524 --> 00:43:50,979
on the day I pay heed
to what you say!

781
00:43:56,908 --> 00:43:58,282
Oh.

782
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:00,421
Oh, what is this?

783
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:04,834
Oh, oh.

784
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:12,613
He scared me,
Charlie.

785
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:16,102
I ain't been scared
like that

786
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:18,507
since I was
a little girl.

787
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,199
Oh.

788
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:22,146
Oh, Jesus.

789
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:35,970
Jane, where you going?

790
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:43,561
All right.

791
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,987
Now, down there

792
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,517
is Doc Cochran's office.

793
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:52,713
If that limey cocksucker
comes for that little girl,

794
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,579
I got him triangulated.

795
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:58,988
If he comes from
that way I got him,

796
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,575
and if he comes
from that way...

797
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:03,523
I got him.

798
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:44,390
Here I go.

799
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:47,017
No words, and no gun
till you're on him.

800
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:50,317
Here I go.
Revenge for my fucking brother.

801
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:21,483
The man's gun never left
his holster, Mr. Hickok.

802
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,927
He meant me harm.

803
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:25,808
You killed my brother,
you son of a bitch!

804
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,335
And now I killed you.

805
00:46:27,377 --> 00:46:29,515
He was going
for his gun.

806
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:32,041
- I saw it.
- A revenge seeker.

807
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:34,318
I guess he did
mean you harm.

808
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:49,032
You're half fucking
blind, ain't you?

809
00:46:49,074 --> 00:46:51,561
Sometimes it's
a fucking blessing.

810
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,272
What the fuck
you looking at?

811
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:05,353
Like he's
a fucking Adonis.

812
00:47:34,515 --> 00:47:36,970
You go on away from here
for a little while, Doc.

813
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:41,200
- I won't.
- Go on.

814
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:43,123
You go see
about the whores.

815
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:45,643
No.

816
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:48,204
You know I'll come
through you if I have to.

817
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:51,789
Let me remind you
of something, Dan.

818
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,900
If you kill me...

819
00:47:56,244 --> 00:47:59,593
then you are up to your
elbows in snatches,

820
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:02,799
just like you were before
I came to this damn camp.

821
00:48:02,837 --> 00:48:04,876
Taking care of 'em.

822
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,566
Nursing 'em,
day in, day out.

823
00:48:07,604 --> 00:48:10,767
Taking heat from Al
every time one of 'em's poorly.

824
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,358
Up to your elbows.

825
00:48:13,397 --> 00:48:15,219
Between that
and a slit throat

826
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:17,838
that Al will give me
if I leave that child alive,

827
00:48:17,877 --> 00:48:20,113
I think you know which one
I'm gonna choose.

828
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:25,039
You just go ahead and do what
you're gonna do 'cause I'm not moving.

829
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:30,698
Jesus Christ.

830
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:35,700
You're pitting me
against Al.

831
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:38,188
So the fuck be it.

832
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,685
Well, I ain't
going it alone.

833
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:47,375
You're coming with me
to make the case.

834
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:57,872
Jesus Christ.

835
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:00,114
Jesus Christ. Have we been asleep
at the switch?

836
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,216
- What's wrong?
- Why's he got his arm on the doc?

837
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:06,222
You with that ugly fucker
of your own free will?

838
00:49:06,262 --> 00:49:07,952
Yes. Yes, I am.

839
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:13,909
I'd rather be lucky
than smart.

840
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:19,055
Word for word
what the hardware guy said.

841
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:21,582
- The hardware guy?
- The hardware guy.

842
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:24,557
Didn't you just tell me the hardware guy
was standing next to Hickok?

843
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,159
The hardware guy said
something like,

844
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:27,955
"Hickok's right.
He was going for his gun.

845
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,998
- I saw him going for it."
- Something like.

846
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,047
My tooth was paining me
something awful,

847
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:34,159
but I am certain that
was the gist of it.

848
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,533
Get some dope
from Johnny.

849
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:38,868
Thanks an awful lot,
Mr. Swearengen.

850
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:40,757
My tooth's about
brought me to my knees.

851
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,040
Tell me one thing.

852
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,462
When that idiot made
his move, did he tip it?

853
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:50,675
Tom didn't
say boo, Al.

854
00:49:50,712 --> 00:49:52,915
Hickok must've
just smelled him.

855
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:56,530
Al, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

856
00:49:56,568 --> 00:49:58,607
What?

857
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,290
Lunatic that
runs with Hickok

858
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:05,111
just absconded
with that child.

859
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:07,216
Must be under
his protection.

860
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:16,754
Come here.

861
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:29,652
You're sure that girl doesn't
know what you look like?

862
00:50:29,689 --> 00:50:34,293
Al, I'm confident that girl
don't know what I look like.

863
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,532
But no, I can't guarantee
that to a more certainty.

864
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:40,016
I know you got your whole operation
here you gotta consider.

865
00:50:40,058 --> 00:50:42,163
And you don't need
to be worried

866
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:43,762
or troubled about the...

867
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:45,656
well, as far as that girl
recognizing me,

868
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:49,136
no matter if it's the slimmest
of the slim possibilities.

869
00:50:49,177 --> 00:50:52,046
So what you want me to do?

870
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,024
You want me to just stay outta camp
until you deal with all this?

871
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:56,756
Why don't I do that, Al?

872
00:50:56,794 --> 00:50:59,827
How 'bout you have Johnny
check under the rock

873
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:01,654
and I'll put messages
under the rock.

874
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,762
And then I'm gonna
check under the rock

875
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:07,446
every day and see if you
wanna send messages to me.

876
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:11,153
Err on the side
of caution?

877
00:51:11,195 --> 00:51:13,300
That's, uh...
is that a plan?

878
00:51:20,507 --> 00:51:22,001
All right.

879
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,954
Hey Al, think I got time
to put my brand

880
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:29,653
on a little snatch
before I go?

881
00:51:36,316 --> 00:51:37,941
No loose ends now.

882
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:41,202
Get up here!

883
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:44,026
Bring the sled.

884
00:51:55,932 --> 00:51:58,233
? Row, row,
row your boat ?

885
00:51:58,268 --> 00:51:59,958
? Gently down
the stream ?

886
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:01,719
? Merrily, merrily... ?

887
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,217
God damnit!

888
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,780
? Row, row,
row your boat ?

889
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:07,609
? Gently down
the stream ?

890
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:09,587
- ? Merrily, merrily ?
- ? Row, row, row your boat ?

891
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:11,482
- ? Life is but a dream ?
- ? Gently down the stream... ?
