1
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:59,750
Her Majesty
awakes, huh?

2
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,098
Cocksucker's
gonna grace me

3
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:11,519
with his fucking
presence this morning.

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,664
Fucking
Magistrate Clagett

5
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:16,485
will impart to me the attitude towards
the settlement

6
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,414
of him and his fellow
lying fucking thieves

7
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,494
at the territorial
legislature of Yankton.

8
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,298
How fucking much
it's gonna cost us to get annexed

9
00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:30,946
when they sign a treaty
with the fucking dirt worshipers, huh?

10
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:35,585
How hard is the legislature
gonna squeeze our balls

11
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:40,225
with regard to our title
and properties, huh?

12
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:46,274
I don't want to talk
to these cocksuckers, but you have to.

13
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,316
In life,

14
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,290
you have to do a lot
of things you don't fucking want to do.

15
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:55,073
Many times, that's
what the fuck life is...

16
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:58,455
one vile fucking task
after another.

17
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,264
But don't
get aggravated.

18
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,568
Then the enemy has you
by the short hair.

19
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:13,241
It'll be different
after the annexation.

20
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:15,583
That's all.

21
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:17,952
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

22
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,757
Everything changes.

23
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,312
Don't be afraid.

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,268
I can hope...

25
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:34,264
those'll be appearing
on a regular basis.

26
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,213
No.

27
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:38,294
No?

28
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,335
How's your arm?

29
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:47,861
It's all right.

30
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,508
Don't fucking try doing away
with yourself again, huh?

31
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,560
Good morning,
gentlemen.

32
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:20,442
This is Ellsworth,
who found the gold on your claim.

33
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:23,026
- How do you do, Mr. Ellsworth?
- Pleasure.

34
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:26,577
- And this is Sophia.
- Pleasure, Sophia.

35
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:30,577
I'm grateful for your expertise
and keen eyesight.

36
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,583
Luck's what you want
to congratulate me on, Mrs. Garret.

37
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,412
Till you decide how
you want develop it,

38
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,302
Ellsworth can spend time
enough at wages

39
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,928
on your claim to sustain
your ownership.

40
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:42,191
I nod as if I understand
what you just said.

41
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,915
He'll explain it
all to you.

42
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,667
Might we have a word,
Mr. Bullock?

43
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,683
I'm certain Mr. Ellsworth's
are very capable hands,

44
00:04:56,726 --> 00:05:00,522
but I hope you're not
disassociating yourself from my affairs.

45
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:03,346
I already got my impression
of this fellow, Mrs. Garret.

46
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,941
This meeting's
how you form yours.

47
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,387
I see.

48
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,362
Then we compare notes
and decide how you proceed.

49
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,193
Fine.

50
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,489
Toward a future point when you tell me
my thinkin's so consistently wrongheaded

51
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:16,305
it's a waste of your valuable time
having to deal with me.

52
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,688
In any case, I know you have many claims
on your attention.

53
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:22,382
A couple.

54
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,491
Thank you very much.

55
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:28,076
I'd lean more on what I felt
about this fellow than what I saw.

56
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,464
Late as usual.

57
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:38,156
I just comes from the creek, Mr. Farnum.
Washin' my pants.

58
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:40,047
A habit to cultivate.

59
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:44,837
And under a rock down there, I found
other pants of mine I thought I'd lost.

60
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,457
But seein' as I gets
drunk and on occasion shits myself,

61
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,634
I figured that must be how I lost 'em
in the first place.

62
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,387
I imagine you making
your way from the creek,

63
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:56,107
rolling into the lobby
when all others are abed,

64
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:59,176
bare-ass naked with shit streaming down
the backs of your legs.

65
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:02,891
Sir, no. It must have been the night
that Mr. Hickok was killed.

66
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,487
Now I recall
that Mr. Hickok...

67
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,664
he gives unto me a letter for me
to put in post,

68
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:09,123
but what with all the hullabalo
and me gettin' drunk,

69
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:10,691
I forgot about
the whole thing.

70
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,772
Until I found
my pants.

71
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:14,820
Do you think
I'm gonna touch that?

72
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:16,965
No, uh, I didn't get
my pants wet,

73
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,176
nor did I soil the letter
when I soiled myself.

74
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,673
That's the miracle
of it, sir.

75
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:23,815
So I'm to believe that's a letter
written by Wild Bill Hickok

76
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:28,324
just before his murder
by the coward McCall?

77
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:31,297
- Just minutes before, sir.
- Addressed to whom?

78
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,186
His wife, sir.

79
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,835
Well, I only hope
you haven't opened it.

80
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,401
No, sir.

81
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:41,791
At least that eliminates
tampering from the list.

82
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,721
Of what, sir?

83
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:47,615
Crimes in which your
inebriation and sloth

84
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,885
as my employee
has implicated my hotel,

85
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,862
which I will attempt
to shield you from

86
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,759
in the course of trying
to extricate myself.

87
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:58,369
I didn't mean to extricate you, sir.
L... I didn't...

88
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,336
Just give me
the confounded letter!

89
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:04,383
- And none of this hangdog look.
- Sir.

90
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,293
- Not a word of this to anyone.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:14,557
Mr. Utter. Hearty congratulations
on your new venture.

92
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:17,859
Take a while to find out if those
are what's in order.

93
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:25,631
Being this is the first
day of my enterprise,

94
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,424
I wore this frock-coat.

95
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,282
Very flattering.

96
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:32,415
You don't think
it looks stupid?

97
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,078
Not to me, no.

98
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,239
Mr. Dority all
of a sudden stumbled,

99
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:41,820
and in... in grabbin'
at scrub to steady him,

100
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,088
I saw a color beneath.

101
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:49,244
Ain't you a little doll.

102
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:50,973
She's formed
an instant attachment.

103
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,159
Well, anyways, I'm glad to keep
your title good workin' the surface,

104
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:59,990
but the quartz
outcrop we found...

105
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,269
you're not gonna know
how rich your strike is

106
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:04,028
until you sink
some shafts.

107
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:06,137
Now, I ain't expert
prospectin' that way.

108
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,477
I'm a man who
works in creeks.

109
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:09,788
Thank you for
telling me so.

110
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,435
Not bein' impertinent,

111
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,195
your people gonna
help you with this?

112
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,045
My brother and my father
are aware of my situation

113
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,151
and my husband's
parents.

114
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:23,605
I have no idea as to the prospect
of their involvement.

115
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:27,736
Well, blood don't
always prove loyalty.

116
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,970
But you're gonna need
some people on your side, Mrs. Garret,

117
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:34,715
'cause I believe you got a big one
on your hands.

118
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,270
I believe Mr. Bullock's
on my side.

119
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,348
No question about that.

120
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,657
And I believe
you are, too.

121
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,928
Excuse me.

122
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:46,003
I was among them
found that little girl.

123
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,832
I'm glad to see
her doing well.

124
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:50,169
I'm Alma Garret.

125
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:51,316
How do you do?

126
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:54,289
Ellsworth.

127
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,607
Charlie Utter.

128
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,931
Come in.

129
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,719
- Yes, sir.
- You see this?

130
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:05,746
"Utter Freight and Postal
Delivery Service."

131
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:08,086
That's what happens when
you drop a fucking stitch.

132
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,870
What stitch
did I drop?

133
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,693
I did.

134
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:16,044
This freight and delivery service
should've been opened by Persimmon Phil

135
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,640
- as a cover for his other activities.
- He's dead.

136
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,014
I know he's dead now.

137
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:23,436
Well, if you don't know,
nobody does.

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,057
I should have brought in a replacement,
is my fucking point.

139
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,753
Well, you'll know
better next time.

140
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,085
The direction
of my thoughts...

141
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,933
with the sustained fucking stupidity
that you're exhibiting,

142
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,876
I hesitate to voice them...

143
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:40,910
is that you might want
to train for Phil's former position.

144
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,021
Al.

145
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,842
I have hoped
for this conversation

146
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,259
ever since you give me
that Indian head to hide.

147
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,081
How'd it go with Johnny?

148
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:12,075
I have just fled
my own office in horror

149
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,528
at his fucking
dimwittedness.

150
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,155
Well, Persimmon Phil
was no genius.

151
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,883
I know.

152
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,862
And Johnny, so eager.

153
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,719
I know. Was it not my fucking
idea to ask him?

154
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:28,494
There's a minimal standard,
he'll be in the wilderness.

155
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,383
You gotta be able
to sustain a thought.

156
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,317
You gotta be able
to remember fucking instructions.

157
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,613
- His Honor.
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,468
Hold fast
your valuables.

159
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,731
Hey, Al. Any reason I can't
share with Dan

160
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,548
the proceedings of the talk me
and you just had about me

161
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,491
taking over
for Persimmon Phil?

162
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,443
Yeah, keep Dan
in the dark.

163
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,322
Have a seat,
Your Honor.

164
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:56,675
- Hey, Johnny.
- Dan.

165
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:59,303
What's new?

166
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:02,090
I want to know how the camp stands
with the legislature.

167
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,782
And don't give me
this, um,

168
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,234
- "On the one hand, on the other hand."
- All right.

169
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:09,479
Just say, "This is the way
I think it's gonna be,"

170
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:12,067
'cause this several- hands
fucking shit don't help me.

171
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:15,270
- I'll boil things down.
- Go ahead.

172
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,852
Let's assume for the sake
of conversation

173
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,127
that there's a new treaty
with the Sioux peoples.

174
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,584
"People," that's what we're calling
those cocksuckers now?

175
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,120
That's the way
things are headed?

176
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:29,122
Assuming the new treaty,
the hills will be annexed.

177
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:32,902
The territory respects the statutes
of the Northwest Ordinance,

178
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:37,573
which state that a citizen
can have title to any land

179
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:41,219
unclaimed or unincorporated
by simple usage.

180
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,459
Essentially,
if you're on it

181
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,724
and you improve it,
you own it.

182
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:50,880
But, what complicates
the situation

183
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,828
is that the hills
were deeded to the Sioux

184
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,975
by the 1868
Fort Laramie Treaty.

185
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:58,811
This could mean
that the land occupied by the camp

186
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:02,333
doesn't fall under any
statutory definition

187
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:04,162
of unclaimed
or unincorporated.

188
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:06,085
So who needs
to get paid?

189
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:10,273
Signs of conciliation and willingness
would weigh in the camp's favor.

190
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,545
But just as important
is the presence

191
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,809
of a ad hoc
municipal organization

192
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,527
that would enable
the legislature to say

193
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,897
Deadwood exists,
we don't have to create it.

194
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,103
It would be disruptive
if we did.

195
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,699
The community's
already organized,

196
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,804
not legally maybe,
but certainly informally.

197
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:31,225
Why not let's give this
informal organization

198
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:34,015
the blessing
of legal standing?

199
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,951
What's the right fucking
number for the legislature?

200
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:39,611
There's a lot of gold
out here, Al.

201
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:42,136
To define "right"
in this environment

202
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:45,591
is very liable to be
an ongoing process.

203
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,672
What I'm prepared to do
is make a list of names

204
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:50,614
and a preliminary guess
at some numbers.

205
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,756
I should tell you as well
that a warrant's reached Yankton

206
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,319
charging you with murder
in Chicago, Illinois.

207
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,806
As the settlement's status changes,
you want to address that.

208
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,734
I could help
with that too.

209
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,449
How much is that
gonna cost me?

210
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,616
$5,000.

211
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:19,794
If you don't mind,
I'll continue writing.

212
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,479
Good morning,
Miss Jane.

213
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:42,362
Yeah, hello.

214
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,281
No one croaked today.

215
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:48,110
Tommy's still fucking
sick and the doc will be back

216
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:51,863
I guess whenever
he fucking feels like it.

217
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,831
See your fucking eyes
are still playin' tug o' war.

218
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:58,418
Well, this is the one
to look at.

219
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:03,190
Left arm still useful
as an old man's dick?

220
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,997
Do I smell strangely
to you, Miss Jane?

221
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,038
What?

222
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,445
Do I have a strange
odor about me?

223
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:14,794
What is that, your clever way of saying
you smell whiskey on my breath?

224
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,748
No.

225
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,993
If either of your fucking
eyes takes me for hiding

226
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,615
I'm drinking again occasionally,
it's sadly mistaken,

227
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:25,996
so desist from any clever
odor references.

228
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,207
I thought the smell might
be coming off the creek

229
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:35,091
so I went into the hills last night
but it followed me there too,

230
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,760
as if my, uh, as if my flesh
were rotting.

231
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,210
I, uh... do I look like a man
taken from his own grave?

232
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:47,146
God damn you, don't start talking crazy
to go with everything else.

233
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,488
Also, when I read the...
the scriptures,

234
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,888
I do not feel Christ's
love as I used to.

235
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,257
Oh, is that so?

236
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,111
That is too bad.

237
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,796
Join the fucking club
of most of us.

238
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:01,005
Let me tell you
something, Preacher.

239
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,888
I see you skulking around
when the doc comes in.

240
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,808
You're trying to hide
your fucking eyes,

241
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,466
trying to hide
your fucking arm.

242
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,325
You're a fucking mess.

243
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:13,288
And I am in the process of wearing out
my own fucking welcome in this camp.

244
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,880
And I wouldn't expect to be
around here much longer

245
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,286
for people to be
disgusted by

246
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:21,352
so they don't notice
what the fuck is going on with you!

247
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,977
And you need to think
about some of these things

248
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:27,560
and raise your nerve
to consult with the doc!

249
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:45,128
God damn you! Spilling my cleaning
water too, Minister!

250
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:49,762
Up.

251
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,530
Thank you,
I'm fine.

252
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,537
You're fine.

253
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,775
I am off duty.
You're on duty.

254
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,130
You can go
fuck yourself!

255
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:28,803
Al, what are you
doing out?

256
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,108
Clearing my head.
And if I blink when I speak,

257
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,997
that's because I just
got fucking fleeced.

258
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,780
- What's going on?
- Be at my joint in two hours.

259
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:39,425
- We're forming a fucking government.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,041
Merrick!

261
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,110
Jesus Christ.

262
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,036
Hey, Merrick!

263
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,978
Cocksucker.

264
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,502
Shoot.

265
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,943
Thank you, sir.

266
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,822
Good luck out there.

267
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:22,335
I believe it's time
to send for my wife and boy.

268
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,041
Treaty coming
with the Sioux.

269
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:29,375
Where the fuck
is Merrick, huh?!

270
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:30,837
We don't know.

271
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,287
Well anyways,
this is it.

272
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,392
What we spoke about before,
this puts it to the test.

273
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:36,057
All right.

274
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,062
Informal municipal organization.
Not government.

275
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,794
No, that would
mark us rebellious.

276
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:44,409
But structure enough to persuade those
territorial cocksuckers in Yankton

277
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,741
that we're worthy enough to pay them
their fucking bribes.

278
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:50,555
We're to meet to discuss
putting this organization together.

279
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,891
Is that what
you're saying?

280
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:54,813
Centuries of fucking
inbreeding

281
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:58,620
attune him to the necessities
of the times.

282
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,271
Two hours, my place!

283
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:09,238
Did a fucking
good job here.

284
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,810
Your room's
put back together.

285
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,752
That ain't
my room anymore.

286
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:30,009
Cy needn't have done
for them kids that way.

287
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,928
Not in your room,

288
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,487
not in the way
he did for them.

289
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,383
I'm getting
outta here, Eddie.

290
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,326
Are ya?

291
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:41,138
I'm going to open
my own place.

292
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:44,045
Good for you, honey.
Have you saved money?

293
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:46,291
I got a way
to work it.

294
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:49,142
I know you'll get
a long way away from here first.

295
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,117
You think I have to?

296
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,169
Cy told me he'd help me
open a place here.

297
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:59,628
He promised he'd
keep his distance.

298
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,076
Good.

299
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:04,110
- Is he around?
- Asleep.

300
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,458
There's a meeting
in my place

301
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,381
in a couple of hours
he'll want to be awake for.

302
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,999
All the pillars of the fucking camp.
You mind?

303
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,175
You could use
some rest.

304
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:14,929
I could use
a clean conscience.

305
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:17,003
So could we all.

306
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,046
Blah!

307
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,222
Where the fuck
have you been?!

308
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,707
- As you see.
- As I see, what?

309
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:33,062
At my storage cabinet,
replentishing needed supplies.

310
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:36,717
Be over in a couple of hours. We gotta
form a government for the settlement.

311
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:37,833
Who does?

312
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,881
Us! You and me.

313
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,856
Come to me in a vision!
You stupid bastard.

314
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:54,989
Anyways, I'm going
to look for a place.

315
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,691
Eddie.

316
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:11,272
Swearengen's called a meeting.
Two hours.

317
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,855
Where's Joanie?

318
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:17,741
Out looking for a place.

319
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,068
Good.

320
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,686
'Cause I told Joanie I'd back her
in having her own joint.

321
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:25,033
That's what she said.

322
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,108
Something on
your mind, Eddie?

323
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,384
You fucked me up, Cy.

324
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:31,460
The shit you did
to those kids,

325
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,060
there's no angle to it.

326
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,230
That shit wasn't just
about those kids, Eddie.

327
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:39,561
You need to sit there and tough
your way through your problem.

328
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,220
Just keep
shuffling your cards

329
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:43,647
and let your tie hang down
till you feel better.

330
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,717
I want to come
to that meeting.

331
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:51,591
Do ya?

332
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,764
Come ahead, Eddie.

333
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,689
Put the cards down,
tighten your cravat

334
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,142
and come on if it'll cheer
you the fuck up.

335
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:09,535
Mornin'.

336
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,673
Good morning.

337
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,817
I'm opening
this business.

338
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,854
Well, good luck.

339
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,775
Thank you.

340
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:21,498
I'm Charlie Utter.

341
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:23,901
I'm Joanie Stubbs.

342
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:27,578
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Charlie?

343
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:31,989
Ooh, I was out of breath,
but now I'm better.

344
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,169
Are you off someplace?

345
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:35,832
Uh, you need an escort
or the like?

346
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,092
No, I'm more or less
just walking around.

347
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,603
What do you think
of this frock-coat?

348
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,761
Very well fitted.

349
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,705
I had it made
up in Cheyenne.

350
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,049
I'm one for a good
appearance and all,

351
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,466
but it's a little
out of my path.

352
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,448
If you would have
made me guess,

353
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:04,629
I would have said
it's not your usual garb.

354
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,732
And I'm a considerable hand
at the freight business,

355
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,828
but far as leasing
this building

356
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,767
before knowing what
the traffic's gonna bear,

357
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,257
I don't know
what possessed me.

358
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,395
See, l...
I do well in a camp

359
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,182
or a settlement
or a township,

360
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:27,347
but that don't
make me a camp

361
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:30,067
or a settlement
or a township type.

362
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:36,783
This is the attire
for that type of type.

363
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:39,921
Anyway, you're
wearing it today.

364
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,846
You're right.

365
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,568
I'm sorry for running
on about it.

366
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:46,322
I'm looking for a piece
of property

367
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,245
to start a business on.

368
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:49,520
That's what
I'm doing out.

369
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,859
I see.

370
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:54,414
And what sort of business
you looking to operate?

371
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:57,322
- Brothel.
- Uh-huh.

372
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,145
Well, uh, I'll tell you what,
this camp here,

373
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:02,090
it seems like
it's got some legs under it.

374
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:04,171
I'm just a whore, though.

375
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,968
I mean, I run the whores
for this man,

376
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:11,825
but far as being
ready to run a place

377
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,924
and stand up to all
you have to stand up to,

378
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:16,457
l... I don't know
what got into me.

379
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:19,346
I'll tell you what,

380
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:23,152
something's ready
for you to do something,

381
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:26,632
don't seem to matter
if you're ready or not.

382
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,487
Better lift
your skirts and...

383
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:32,171
jump, huh?

384
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:36,463
That's what's coming
to me to be true.

385
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:39,081
I'm surprised you're not
at that big town meeting.

386
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,861
Uh, yeah, well,
I'm, uh...

387
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:45,447
I'm heading
over there shortly.

388
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:50,756
Uh, I prefer to appear
late to that type of thing.

389
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,864
Bella Union,
where I work, is bigger

390
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:56,105
but I guess being that
it's Mr. Swearengen's meeting,

391
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:58,792
that's why they're
having it at The Gem.

392
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,172
Yeah, that's... that's
why it's located there.

393
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,798
Yeah.

394
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,803
It's awful nice
to meet you, Charlie.

395
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:12,706
Well it's good
to meet you, too, Joanie.

396
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:17,442
Take care.

397
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:37,092
I'm going to The Gem.

398
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:50,180
I'm heading on.

399
00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:08,549
I'm heading
for The Gem.

400
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,785
Hooray for you.

401
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:14,847
Reverend is laid down
trying to hide another seizure.

402
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:18,299
Ain't you clever to see
through the subterfuge.

403
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:22,977
I been letting it go,

404
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:26,787
but if the idea is for you to drink more
and more till I say something,

405
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,154
I am hereby
officially saying

406
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,601
I wish you would
stop fucking drinking.

407
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:36,766
I have no fucking idea

408
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,323
as far as you saying
one fucking thing

409
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:42,045
about anything
I do or don't,

410
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:44,383
far as drinking

411
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:46,806
or where I stand
or nap

412
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,784
- or any other thing concerning me.
- I see.

413
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:53,534
Or go or leave
or don't or when.

414
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,324
All right, Jane.

415
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,083
So you can go
fuck yourself.

416
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,414
And don't try
and hasten anyone anywhere,

417
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:02,869
'cause everyone follows
their own fucking pace,

418
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,813
and don't try
and fucking hasten them.

419
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,565
And you happen to be
fucking overlooking

420
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:13,394
that you think it's just
one day after another

421
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:15,892
with the same
fucking seizure

422
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,235
as if it happened
the week before.

423
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,400
And that just shows
how much you fucking know

424
00:27:21,437 --> 00:27:24,600
and what you
pay attention to.

425
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:28,632
God damn you!

426
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:48,160
What do they pay you
to hold that building up?

427
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:50,235
Charlie Utter

428
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:53,985
of "Utter Charlie
and Freight."

429
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,501
It's enough to get you
off with a position.

430
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,364
I'm in a position,

431
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:02,627
you eternally meddling
cocksucker.

432
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:06,974
Yeah, leaning forward,
shit-faced drunk.

433
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:11,752
I am talking about
nursing the plague.

434
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:14,656
Fucking tent operation.

435
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:17,666
Caring of the sick
in the fucking tent!

436
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:20,741
How about bullwhacker
of the fucking freight

437
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,373
between Deadwood
and Cheyenne?

438
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:24,006
No.

439
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:27,558
How about supervisor,
mail delivery?

440
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:29,420
Go away, Charlie.

441
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,341
Or any fucking thing
else you want to do.

442
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,317
Go away!

443
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:39,343
Congratulations on being
a big fucking deal.

444
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,743
No one's any big
fucking deal, Jane.

445
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,096
And all them
offers stand.

446
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,378
I've seen you in some stupid
fucking outfits in my time,

447
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:58,000
but that one
takes the prize.

448
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:14,228
I think that this month

449
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:17,202
we're gonna try
raspberry leaf.

450
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:19,765
Thanks, Doc.

451
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:24,658
Young lady,

452
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:27,483
anything to report
with your privates?

453
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:30,420
Nah.

454
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,398
All right.

455
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,785
Meeting outside
when you're done, Doc.

456
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:45,885
All right.

457
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,166
Thanks, Doc.

458
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:03,582
In a case like yours
I wouldn't know what else to prescribe.

459
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,697
All right.

460
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:46,189
Whose idea was them pears
and fucking peaches?

461
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:48,650
I figured since we had 'em
for the plague meeting...

462
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,114
Shows good thinking
and initiative.

463
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,939
Ladle 'em out at various intervals
on the fucking table, Johnny.

464
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:57,171
Yes, sir.

465
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,503
I'm declaring myself
conductor of this meeting

466
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:03,438
as I have the bribe sheet.

467
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,399
If I'm excluded,
say so, Al.

468
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:10,743
Don't leave me to die
the death of thousand cuts.

469
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:12,054
Sit down, Tom.

470
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,879
Don't subject me
to death by water torture.

471
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,890
Take a seat, Tom,
and toss whatever book

472
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:18,550
you've been reading on
the fucking yellow peril, huh?

473
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:26,044
I just opened
across the way.

474
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,250
Was I supposed to attend?

475
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,109
Well before I can
answer that question,

476
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:31,737
I better know
who the fuck you are.

477
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,532
Charlie Utter.

478
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:37,081
Of "Utter's Freight
and Postal Delivery Service."

479
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,904
Nice sign blocking my fucking view.
Take a seat.

480
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:42,873
Had a lovely advert
in today's "Pioneer."

481
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:47,865
So, US government's
negotiating peace

482
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,178
with Spotted Elk,
Red Cloud

483
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,701
and other leaders of the heathens.
Thank you, Johnny.

484
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:55,590
The heathens will get money
to give up the hills,

485
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,471
and the hills'll be annexed
to the territory.

486
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:01,503
First notice of our cost

487
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,649
to avoid getting
fucked in the ass

488
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,925
by those legislative
cocksuckers

489
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:08,896
was just handed to me
by Yankton's toll collector,

490
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:13,379
who suggests also our best case
in keeping title to the claims,

491
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,071
property and businesses
is to start up now

492
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:19,273
a kind of an informal
governing organization

493
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:21,546
that'll be recognized
by the territorial cocksuckers

494
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:25,094
and given legal status
when the territory is annexed.

495
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:27,885
Since we'll all
have proved ourselves

496
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,806
civilized sorts

497
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,834
that don't only wear
our pants to cover our tails,

498
00:32:33,873 --> 00:32:36,295
hence the fucking
meeting.

499
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:38,224
Do the bribes come
out of our pockets?

500
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:39,534
Hmm?

501
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,992
The hell you must have gone
through talking to that leech.

502
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:44,305
Hereafter, you let me
take my fair share

503
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,340
- of the weight in those conversations.
- Yeah, thanks, Cy.

504
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:50,829
Well, couldn't our informal
organization levy taxes

505
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,259
on the settlement
to pay the bribes?

506
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,896
Say to license
businesses?

507
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,625
Wouldn't that spread
the burden?

508
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:58,572
Will women who pay
the license fees

509
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:01,845
have the same right
to operate brothels as men?

510
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:09,206
What's that got to do
with the price of fish?

511
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:11,795
Our proper order
of fucking business

512
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:15,152
is to make titles
and departments

513
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:17,138
before the territorial
cocksuckers

514
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,970
send in their cousins
to rob and steal from us.

515
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:21,274
Well who fills
the various positions?

516
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,798
Pick the names from a fucking hat
as far as I'm concerned.

517
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,267
I'd like to be mayor.

518
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:27,766
Objections?

519
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:33,913
Mayor.

520
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:40,224
Wouldn't a good use
for an informal organization

521
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,820
with temporary appointees

522
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,747
be providing a few
services to the camp?

523
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,602
Mayor?

524
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:47,294
Well, provide
a few services

525
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,367
and use the lion's share
of revenues to pay the bribes.

526
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:55,195
More than providing
services to 'em,

527
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:58,468
taking people's money is what makes
organizations real,

528
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:00,545
be they formal,
informal or temporary.

529
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:02,689
There's a piano outside.

530
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,249
Piano?

531
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,679
When Tolliver opened
up across the way,

532
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:11,367
you said we needed a fancier piano.
You ordered one.

533
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:14,632
You want me to abandon the fucking
meeting to bring in a new piano?

534
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:17,353
Well, I'm just telling you
it come in from Montgomery Ward.

535
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,276
Yeah.

536
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,085
"Any big arrival, notify me
immediately." You said that.

537
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,901
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, um...

538
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:28,238
Floor's open
for levy suggestions

539
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:30,313
and nominations
for department heads.

540
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:33,069
Self-nominations
are permitted.

541
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:36,593
Sorry.
We lack a gavel.

542
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,055
Doc?

543
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,652
Who's gonna
be comptroller?

544
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:42,547
Well, um, elections?

545
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,206
Will we have
some elections

546
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,579
somewhere down the road?
This is temporary, right?

547
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:48,272
- Yeah, ad hoc.
- Ad hoc.

548
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,125
Ad fucking hoc.
Free fucking gratis.

549
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,199
Can we just get on
with the fucking meeting?

550
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:06,960
Timid, ha.
Hardly, sir.

551
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,778
My own strong personal impulse
was to offer my name for office,

552
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,081
but a fourth estate,

553
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:15,767
independent
in name and fact

554
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,561
from the operations
of government

555
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:21,461
is of the essence
of a free society.

556
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:34,463
I've got to find
early occasion

557
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,800
to put the mayor
off his pedestal.

558
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,169
Don't do it
with no mud.

559
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:43,844
Did you wait a day before you ordered
that fucking thing?

560
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:47,423
Boss, you specifically
countermanded my waiting

561
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:49,917
and asking again when you gave me
the order to get it.

562
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:53,374
What fucking revenue is being generated
by those hoople-heads

563
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,205
gathering around
that cocksucker

564
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,695
and yodeling about
their fucking points of origin?

565
00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:59,875
The shine'll wear off.

566
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:01,920
My fucking head.

567
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,489
All that organizing
businesses?

568
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,011
Aw, 25 cups of coffee and too much
circulating in the fresh air.

569
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:09,604
You chaired piss out of that meeting
this afternoon.

570
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:12,841
That still don't get you off the hook
about that piano.

571
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:20,138
Before I'd told a story on myself
like the doc did,

572
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:22,563
I'd have just said,
"Thank you for the nomination,

573
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:25,291
but I decline being
health supervisor."

574
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:27,783
They buy bodies
to do their research.

575
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:30,640
Doctors, they cut 'em open
and study 'em.

576
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:34,253
All the less reason for saying
you've been arrested for grave robbing.

577
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,232
Seven times.

578
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:39,915
Anyways,

579
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:41,996
good for you
volunteering for the post.

580
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,059
If I had known then
they wasn't gonna have a sheriff,

581
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,003
- I'd have never raised my hand.
- I don't follow.

582
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:53,007
I only raised my hand
'cause I didn't want to be sheriff.

583
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:55,153
It's all temporary,
anyhow.

584
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:56,273
That's right.

585
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:58,417
And ad hoc.

586
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:06,002
Did you happen
to notice at The Gem

587
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:08,825
that one girl we rode back with
from Mr. Garret's funeral?

588
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,933
Trixie, isn't that what
she said her name was?

589
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,787
- Who'd been helping with the child.
- Yeah, I noticed her.

590
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:17,815
Much as she'd taken
to helping with that little one.

591
00:37:17,854 --> 00:37:20,953
Big pull to that,
going back to what you know.

592
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:26,138
You think she's pretty?

593
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,414
Very.

594
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,839
- Take some air.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,683
- Evenin'.
- Evening.

596
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:39,771
Some meeting, huh?

597
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:42,563
Congratulations
on your new post.

598
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:43,645
Oh.

599
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:45,474
And for your
freight business.

600
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,576
- Thank you.
- Okay.

601
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:50,720
Evening, Charlie.

602
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:53,028
Evening.

603
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,753
How much time
you think that

604
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:03,398
Fire marshal obligation's
gonna take?

605
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:08,197
More or less as much as your health
commissioner, huh?

606
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:12,236
How about that doc?

607
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,993
Grave robber.

608
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,651
Anybody else felled
from them canned peaches?

609
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:22,793
Not to my knowledge.
Why, you feeling poorly?

610
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:26,281
Well, um, it's...
it's easing up some.

611
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,303
- Evening.
- Evening.

612
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:46,764
I've wondered how
things were with you...

613
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,709
and Mrs. Garret
and the child.

614
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:54,069
I expect they're well.

615
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:56,439
I know she struck
lucky at her claim.

616
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:57,750
And how are you, Trixie?

617
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:59,826
As you see.

618
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:03,216
Earning the greasy eye
from my boss for idle chatter.

619
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,886
Can I buy
you a drink?

620
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:07,063
I'd rather
you didn't.

621
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:11,351
This isn't
the place for you.

622
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,016
So you say.

623
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:15,672
If you insist on
my embarrassing myself,

624
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,783
have it not where
I'd want you to see me.

625
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,732
Come see me then.

626
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:21,980
He don't permit
our making calls out.

627
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:24,667
Come to our store.
Come buy a broom.

628
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:28,664
I don't want what
I can't have, Mr. Star.

629
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:31,095
All right.

630
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,396
If I did come,

631
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:36,607
I'd buy an axe,
a hammer and a saw.

632
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,514
All fully stocked.

633
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:43,202
And we never ask the purpose
of a customer's purchase.

634
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:59,816
Our mayor.

635
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,722
Oh, Mayor!

636
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,135
Doctor.

637
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,087
I'm gonna have
a look at you.

638
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:34,090
All right.

639
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,606
Don't turn your head
away, Reverend.

640
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,962
Being sick ain't nothing
to be ashamed of.

641
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,395
Look at my finger.

642
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,399
I apologize
for the smell.

643
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:55,223
What is it
that you smell?

644
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:58,040
As if I've died.

645
00:40:58,075 --> 00:41:01,556
You emit no such odor.

646
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:04,410
I smell my flesh rotting.

647
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,332
It isn't rotting, Reverend.

648
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:08,983
Your flesh does not smell.

649
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:11,388
You've not died.

650
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:14,936
You're having organic
changes in your mind

651
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,790
that's making you
believe these things.

652
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,923
Do you understand me?

653
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,272
Formerly, Doctor,

654
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:28,697
when the word took me
as I read scripture,

655
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,489
people felt God's
presence through me

656
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:36,031
and that was a great gift
that I could give to them.

657
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:40,226
Now the word does not
take me when I read.

658
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:43,710
Nor do I feel
Christ's love.

659
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,785
Nor do those who listen
hear it through me.

660
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:49,213
All right.

661
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,355
This is God's purpose.

662
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:55,742
The not knowing
the purpose is...

663
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:59,812
my portion
of suffering.

664
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:03,431
And is there any pain

665
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:06,371
competing with
the not knowing?

666
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,377
I'm not in pain.

667
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:13,764
There are new smells
I smell.

668
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:16,841
And there parts of my body
I can't feel,

669
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,441
and His...

670
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:20,270
and His love.

671
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:24,812
And you want
to continue like this?

672
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,687
As long as He wills,
this must be my part.

673
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:36,554
To be afraid, as well.

674
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,467
Well if this is His
will, Reverend,

675
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,340
He is a son of a bitch.

676
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:51,091
Good night.

677
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:00,310
Good night, Doctor.

678
00:43:13,376 --> 00:43:15,318
Hey, Eddie.

679
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,110
Hey, kid.
How'd it go?

680
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:22,073
All right.
And I got me a four-bit room.

681
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:25,082
Play your cards right,
I'll tell you where.

682
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:38,628
Hi, Cy.

683
00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:41,346
I was afraid I'd lost
you to the heathens.

684
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:42,726
How was that meeting?

685
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:45,825
All right.
We were organizing for annexation

686
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:48,963
until Eddie cracked
his fucking mouth.

687
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,140
What'd it turn to then?

688
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:03,113
A joint like ours, Joanie,
what are we selling?

689
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:05,320
Walk through this door,

690
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:07,016
it's a new start.

691
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:09,128
Come on in,
try your luck here.

692
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,694
Of course, we know

693
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:14,412
the percentages being the percentages,
you play long enough,

694
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:17,350
your luck ain't gonna get
no better here than anywheres else.

695
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:21,103
Maybe it's 'cause
we're in a brand new camp.

696
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:22,993
Since we arrived,

697
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,394
certain people
that are near and dear to me

698
00:44:25,427 --> 00:44:27,598
seem to have bought
into our own fucking line

699
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:29,969
and now they're trying
to get me to go along.

700
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:32,274
But I can't.

701
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:36,238
See, Joanie,
'cause I'm a big boy.

702
00:44:36,278 --> 00:44:39,213
Now I'm ready for...

703
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:41,644
Eddie and me
to have a little chat.

704
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:44,502
I did look around
for places, Cy.

705
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:46,773
Good, I wanted you to.

706
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,126
I want to go ahead
and do what we talked about.

707
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,275
Good, honey.

708
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,249
With your eyes
wide open.

709
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,249
Eddie Sawyer.

710
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:13,914
Can we keep
this short?

711
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:16,254
Sure, Eddie.

712
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:19,999
If he finds you a 12-year-old farmboy
to have some fun with,

713
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:22,009
is that short enough
for you?

714
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:24,768
I never did that
and you know it.

715
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:26,658
All this crap about
what is and isn't natural,

716
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:29,147
whatever does it for a fella
is what does it, ain't that right?

717
00:45:29,189 --> 00:45:30,749
I never did that.

718
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:34,499
But did you ever want to unbutton
some farmboy's Dentons

719
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:37,534
and get yourself some relaxation?
That's what I'm asking.

720
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:41,470
Take that boy you spoke up
for up in Joanie's room the other day.

721
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:45,285
I spoke up for not
torturing that boy.

722
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:47,972
Well, what you spoke for and what
you would have wanted to do

723
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,912
if it was just you
and that corn-fed in that room alone

724
00:45:50,955 --> 00:45:53,705
is what I'm inquiring
about the difference between.

725
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,089
- A dry hole, Cy.
- Aw, you could work that out.

726
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:59,588
You just use some
spit on that or lard.

727
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:05,710
17 fucking years
and I never saw a look on your face

728
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:07,717
like I saw up there
in that room the other day.

729
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:09,864
Including when I had
to smack some girl around.

730
00:46:09,904 --> 00:46:11,627
I was never in a room
with you before

731
00:46:11,664 --> 00:46:13,606
where you was
gonna kill somebody.

732
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:17,326
I do not make judgments.
I gave that up a long time ago.

733
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,401
All I want is for us
to get along better, Eddie.

734
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,482
So every time you open
your mouth in public,

735
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,825
I don't have to worry
about what the fuck's gonna come out!

736
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,769
So let me get you
some fucking kid

737
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:28,267
to fuck in the ass or mouth or suck
his prick or let him fuck you!

738
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:30,611
Fuck you, Cy.
Fuck you.

739
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:33,167
Now, now.
That's where I draw the line.

740
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:35,661
Friend or no friend, and us wanting
to get along better or not,

741
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:38,604
I want you to go up
into Joanie's room, which l...

742
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:41,298
I gather she don't
want to go into no more.

743
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:43,857
I want you to go up there and think
this thing through.

744
00:46:43,897 --> 00:46:46,101
Imagine yourself
up there with that boy

745
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:49,586
like the other day,
only this time it's just him and you.

746
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:52,976
And I want you to figure out
what it is that you want.

747
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,125
'Cause next time
we see each other,

748
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:57,914
I want you clearheaded,
and understanding yourself.

749
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,989
The old Eddie that knows the percentages
and how to play 'em,

750
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:03,029
and whatever a man does away
from the table is his own business.

751
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,070
I want you cheerful
and ready to help me with my work

752
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:07,704
or I don't want you
coming the fuck out!

753
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:09,980
Hmm?
You finish your shift

754
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:11,511
and you go up there
to Joanie's room

755
00:47:11,552 --> 00:47:13,178
and you think
things through.

756
00:47:13,217 --> 00:47:16,633
All right,
Eddie Sawyer?!

757
00:47:16,674 --> 00:47:19,970
Do we understand
each other?

758
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,207
Why didn't you volunteer for something
at that meeting?

759
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:23,902
Why didn't you
put your hand up?

760
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,006
Might've kept you
from being such an evil cocksucker.

761
00:47:49,355 --> 00:47:51,908
Say hello to the new
fire marshal.

762
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,122
I'm getting out.

763
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:01,092
Goodbye
and good luck.

764
00:48:01,134 --> 00:48:03,523
Wait on it until
you ain't exhausted, Jane.

765
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,193
Maybe you'll
change your mind.

766
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:08,843
Direction of this
entire camp

767
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,603
makes me sick,

768
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:14,089
and it bores
the living shit out of me.

769
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,552
Well working hours
like you've been working

770
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,733
would get anyone
out of sorts.

771
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,000
And you helped
a lot of people.

772
00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:25,200
Sent a dozen men
out with their plague sores healed

773
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,691
to go back to getting
'em on their Johnsons.

774
00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:31,826
I will not be a drunk
where he's buried.

775
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:38,773
And I cannot
stay fucking sober.

776
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:41,624
So you...

777
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:45,400
and every human
being on earth...

778
00:48:45,435 --> 00:48:47,377
past, present
and future

779
00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:49,425
can drink
mare's piss.

780
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,289
Believe I'll just have
well water.

781
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:53,626
- Shut up, Charlie.
- All right.

782
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:14,074
If the subject comes up,

783
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:17,431
explain to Bill.

784
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:21,625
All right, Jane.

785
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:25,540
All right.

786
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,778
Tell them over at livery
l... I'm good for the mount.

787
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:35,809
Do not fucking
worry about me.

788
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:39,165
And inform Hostetler
at the fucking livery

789
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,177
you saved his
fucking life.

790
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:44,105
All right.

791
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:47,270
And do not worry about
getting paid back.

792
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:49,576
Check the mail,
Charlie,

793
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:52,514
and you will find
soon proper payment.

794
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,563
All right, Jane.

795
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:57,954
Check with Utter Mail
and Charlie Freight!

796
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,616
All right.

797
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:12,429
Since last our eyes
were upon each other, lo,

798
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:16,525
I hope you've earned
me $5.

799
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,003
No.

800
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:35,634
L... I gave the lady
your note, sir.

801
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:38,706
She says to come ahead, but to knock
low as the little one's asleep.

802
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,720
Thank you.

803
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:44,374
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

804
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:58,326
Evening.

805
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:01,116
Good evening, Mr. Bullock.
Sophia's asleep.

806
00:51:01,151 --> 00:51:03,573
So I was told.
Sorry for calling so late.

807
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:17,026
I'm to see Ellsworth in the morning
and wondered what I should say.

808
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:19,677
Ellsworth seemed
very competent and trustworthy.

809
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,018
He suggested
that until the extent

810
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:24,257
of the quartz deposits
could be proved,

811
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:26,879
he could prospect the creek
on my claim each week

812
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,162
to keep my title active.

813
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:30,370
How'd that plan
sound to you?

814
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:32,196
I feel it's exactly
the way to proceed.

815
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:34,752
All right then.

816
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:38,468
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

817
00:51:56,142 --> 00:51:57,964
Would it improve
your opinion of me

818
00:51:57,998 --> 00:52:00,584
if I told you I was Commissioner
of the Board of Health?

819
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:04,584
How wonderful.
I suppose.

820
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:06,697
It's to put the camp's
best foot forward

821
00:52:06,738 --> 00:52:08,625
as far as being taken
into the territory.

822
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,567
A number of men
took positions.

823
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,683
- I see.
- Farnum's mayor.

824
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:15,341
How horrifying.

825
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:20,975
I wrote
to my wife today.

826
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,922
Did you?

827
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:25,518
About her and my boy
coming to the camp.

828
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:27,445
You have a son as well?

829
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:29,846
They're in Michigan
with her people.

830
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:34,645
My thinking was

831
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:37,048
with the treaty coming,
annexation,

832
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:39,383
the camp would
be settling down, a safer place.

833
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:41,971
Yes.

834
00:52:47,132 --> 00:52:50,777
- Any other sons or daughters?
- No, that's it.

835
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:58,518
My brother
was in the cavalry.

836
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,374
He was killed
two years ago.

837
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:03,612
I'm sorry.

838
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,315
Anyways.

839
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:16,058
I'm glad you got along
with Ellsworth.

840
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,646
Well, thank you for all
your help, Mr. Bullock.

841
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:21,278
Sure.

842
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:24,002
And congratulations
on your new post

843
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:26,209
and the prospect
of your family rejoining you.

844
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:28,930
Thank you.

845
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:32,033
Good night,
Mrs. Garret.

846
00:53:32,072 --> 00:53:35,138
Good night.

847
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:43,754
May I ask why you spoke
of your brother?

848
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,438
My wife
was his widow.

849
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:49,989
My boy
is their child.

850
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,292
I see.

851
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,419
- Good night.
- Good night.

852
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:17,244
? Boy, Buddy Bone,
you can blow a mean horn there. ?
