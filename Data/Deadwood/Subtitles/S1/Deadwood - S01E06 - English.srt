1
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:13,581
Whoa!

2
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,348
Ah!

3
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,812
May I say, Dan,

4
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,891
ever since I resumed
drinking alcohol,

5
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,754
I cannot for
the life of me

6
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:29,380
figure out why
I ever gave it up.

7
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,656
- Takes the edge off the tough ones.
- Ooh.

8
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,212
Takes the edge off.
Well put.

9
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,777
And may I say, Dan,

10
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,990
that I often find you
the source of many

11
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,579
well put and witty things
that you say.

12
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:42,179
Thanks.

13
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,648
The Hickok murder,

14
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,243
exoneration
of the coward McCall,

15
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,282
stain on the escutcheon
of the camp.

16
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:53,609
Doc, libation!

17
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,050
I wonder if he thought
I said "live patient?"

18
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,977
Couldn't get it up.

19
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,733
Give her
a dollar to wait.

20
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,875
But he just keeps
getting sicker.

21
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:09,922
Shut up!

22
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:12,165
Come talk to me
after, Doc.

23
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,626
My back hurts so bad.

24
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,228
Will you keep
a girl company?

25
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,015
I will,
but I'm expensive.

26
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,249
Oh, I knew that
looking at you.

27
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,453
I'm Joanie.

28
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:46,561
Ellsworth.

29
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,022
First visit to the Bella Union,
Ellsworth?

30
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,526
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,121
My leisure time's usually
spent at The Gem.

32
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,135
What fills the rest
of your time?

33
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,438
Well, ma'am, I've got myself
a working gold claim.

34
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,774
Well, sir,
is that a damn fact?

35
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,848
Yes, ma'am, a hell of
a working gold claim.

36
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,711
And if we knew
each other better,

37
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,631
I would throw fucking
in there somewhere.

38
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,703
If you did,
I would try to catch it.

39
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,256
A working, fucking
gold claim, Joanie.

40
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:15,525
And thank you for allowing me
my full range of expression.

41
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:19,238
- Ellsworth.
- What?

42
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,930
Do you shoot craps?

43
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:22,396
No, I don't.

44
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,927
But I'm a lethally
quick study.

45
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,626
Come on.

46
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,279
Joey?

47
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,845
I'm sick, boss.

48
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,293
I ain't right.

49
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,334
Keep your voice down.
Walk this way.

50
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,836
I would never've
made Nebraska.

51
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,766
I got fever.

52
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,686
My back's hurt
something awful.

53
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,955
All right, son, lay up
till you get better.

54
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,404
Here's that
list you give me.

55
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:58,788
You hold it for awhile.

56
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,954
Fella who could read
said one of the items was for smallpox.

57
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:03,845
What are you doing showing
that list around?

58
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,788
Well, when I got
poorly by Buffalo Gap

59
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,739
I wanted to see
if I could fill the list there.

60
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:09,691
That's a breach
of goddamned trust!

61
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,897
Have I got smallpox,
Mr. Tolliver?

62
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:15,171
How do I know?
Maybe you got yourself a dose.

63
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,541
No, I-I wouldn't.
I'm virgin.

64
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:20,094
That's how come I jumped when you
told about Nebraska pussy.

65
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:22,043
Anyway, go lay up.

66
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:30,148
Joey didn't
make Nebraska?

67
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,760
Come down with whatever
ailed Andy Cramed.

68
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:36,481
I wonder if Joey was
after a remedy for Andy?

69
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,372
Maybe without even knowing.

70
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:40,030
Ain't you clever,
Eddie?

71
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,818
Was I being clever? I thought I was
worrying about the plague.

72
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:46,529
Why don't you concentrate on running
in the bones on Joanie's mark?

73
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,474
A welcome diversion.

74
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,239
Woman lives
in your fucking hotel,

75
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,513
but you can't find
pretext for pressing

76
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:01,759
the offer on her claim?

77
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:03,803
I can't out flank
Trixie, Al.

78
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,463
The whore guards that
widow like a mother hen.

79
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,565
She's dosed her with opium
priming her for your approach.

80
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:12,124
- Be that as it may...
- E.B., put that offer in your pocket.

81
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:14,335
- You knock on the widow's door.
- But Trixie'll answer.

82
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:16,511
Trixie answers,
you tell her I want to talk to her.

83
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,882
Trixie leaves, you gain entry,
broach the sale.

84
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,304
Can you circumnavigate
the child

85
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,768
or must I map
that for you, too?

86
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,218
What?

87
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:27,139
Nothing.

88
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,059
Come on in, Doc,
him and me are finished.

89
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,287
Don't play that shit where you make
me drag your words outta you.

90
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:33,883
Declare,
or shut the fuck up!

91
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:37,240
I said something strange
is going on in that hotel room.

92
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:42,561
It's bad with that
fella downstairs, Al.

93
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:44,798
Plague, is it?

94
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,264
Smallpox.

95
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,965
Would land
in my joint.

96
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,304
Yours wasn't
the first.

97
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,686
No deceit
too prolonged.

98
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,762
No errand too demeaning.
Get outta here!

99
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:00,151
No rebuke too vile.

100
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:03,991
Al Swearengen's a cue
and Farnum merely is...

101
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:05,660
a billiard ball.

102
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,357
Howdy.

103
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,908
Shit!

104
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:13,880
Quagmire of piss
and bullshit!

105
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,759
What?

106
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,997
Al wants
to see you, Trixie.

107
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,113
All right.

108
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:27,292
He wants you
over there now.

109
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,118
I'll be there when
I get there, E.B.

110
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,640
How is Mrs. Garret
anyway?

111
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,568
Hunky-dory.

112
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:55,232
My boss wants me.

113
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:57,174
I'll be back
quick as I can.

114
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,453
This passes.

115
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,219
All right.

116
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,935
Place your bets,
gentlemen.

117
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,536
Place your bets.

118
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:14,550
New shooter
coming out!

119
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,749
The winner's seven.

120
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,123
What you hear
on that vaccine?

121
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:28,282
He's had a case
break out at his place.

122
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,725
Let's go to the cage,

123
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,865
or shall the three of us
leap up on tables

124
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,429
and shout questions
across the room?

125
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,892
What about the vaccine?

126
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,943
The boy never
made Nebraska.

127
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,509
- He took sick.
- Where is he now?

128
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,972
- In the back here.
- How long has that been?

129
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,054
You don't want
to pursue that tone.

130
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,720
You sat on news,

131
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,246
no one went after the meds,
now I'm asking the duration.

132
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,905
And I'm saying questions
in that tone and pointing

133
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,331
your finger at me will get
you told to fuck yourself.

134
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,861
Show me the room
where the boy is.

135
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:01,273
Please, join us.

136
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:06,194
How long they been
playing this without me?

137
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:22,556
- What do you want?
- It's laundry day, madam.

138
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,884
- I've come to replace the linen.
- Leave it and go.

139
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,856
Are you ill?

140
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,485
Leave the room.

141
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:36,882
Of course.

142
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,494
Breathe.

143
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,044
We should chat
this all out.

144
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,084
Sure.

145
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:11,992
Why don't we do
something together?

146
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:13,816
Us and several others?

147
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:15,761
Yeah, all right.

148
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:21,847
Lift up.

149
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:23,574
There we go.

150
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:29,009
All right, lie down.

151
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:45,811
If I had
that mug on me,

152
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,673
I believe I'd cut down
getting told

153
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,561
how butt fucking
ugly I was

154
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:51,896
by not staring at
fucking strangers.

155
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:59,343
Sorry-looking cabin
even in this shithole camp!

156
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:02,866
Passers-through has
a right to make inquiries?

157
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,906
A leave-taker has it.

158
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:15,471
I carried that
fucking child!

159
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:21,138
No, not in my belly, but

160
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,828
none of that
fucking blood in me.

161
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:25,621
Fucking cocksucker!

162
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:35,218
It's Jane Canary calling
for Doc fucking Cochran!

163
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,376
You fucking
in there?

164
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:46,675
I believe
I'll fucking wait!

165
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,132
Trixie's upstairs.

166
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,207
E.B.'s waiting for you
in the kitchen.

167
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:58,451
Quit drinking a few hours.
We're having a get-together.

168
00:13:58,489 --> 00:13:59,863
Whom do you mean?

169
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,100
Buy some fucking fruit
or the like, huh?

170
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,788
I told you something
strange was going on.

171
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:11,507
Are you prepared now
to tell me what it is?

172
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:14,991
If that widow was high
I am a monkey's uncle.

173
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:19,056
How much fruit?

174
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:22,324
How many's a fucking
get-together?

175
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,141
Now one thing I can
tell you, Johnny...

176
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,268
right now ain't
a good time to ask.

177
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:39,115
Hi, Al.

178
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,751
You toss the place?

179
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,700
I know what's
in this room.

180
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,652
How's the widow?

181
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,931
You giving her
that dope?

182
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,039
I give it
to her regular.

183
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:50,900
And she takes it?

184
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,553
She goes behind where she dresses
to spare the child seeing.

185
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,273
When she goes behind
where she dresses to spare the child,

186
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,415
do you see billows
of dope smoke rising?

187
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,178
She says
she eats it.

188
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:03,410
- Does she act high to you?
- I can't be sure.

189
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:05,387
I never seen a rich person
high before.

190
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:14,031
Next piece of dope,
Trixie...

191
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:19,092
you go behind the screen
with the widow.

192
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,914
You watch her
put it in her mouth,

193
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,193
you watch her swallow.

194
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:24,051
Afterwards, you look
down her fucking yap

195
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:25,579
and you verify
she's got nothing

196
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,628
above or below
her fucking tongue.

197
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,644
I'll find
a good reason.

198
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,474
You being fucking
clever with me?

199
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,916
How am I supposed
to do that

200
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,323
and not arouse
her suspicion?

201
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,942
Only suspicion you
gotta worry about is mine

202
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,882
of if you're giving it
to her at all.

203
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,831
Why wouldn't I?

204
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,480
I'd rather try touching the moon
than take on a whore's thinking.

205
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:50,573
Only know this, Trixie,

206
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,172
that widow better
be muddleheaded

207
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:53,968
next time Farnum
sees her or you pay.

208
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:56,459
- Can I go back?
- Please.

209
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,921
Trixie and me chatted
on the subject

210
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,963
- of the widow taking dope.
- I see.

211
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:29,166
- Trixie's gonna make sure she does.
- Good.

212
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,691
You find pretext
to determine Trixie ain't lying.

213
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,968
Oh.

214
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,594
Damsel in distress.

215
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:49,578
Will you want me back
for the get-together?

216
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:52,139
How the fuck could we
do it without you, E. B?

217
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,934
Truth isn't
in you.

218
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,879
Makes two of us.

219
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,569
Dolly was with
that drummer.

220
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,357
'Fraid he give
her plague.

221
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:10,630
Fucking plague!

222
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:16,554
? Row, row, row
your boat ?

223
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:19,244
? Gently down the steam ?

224
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,964
? Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ?

225
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:24,620
? Life is but a dream ?

226
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,973
? Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ?

227
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:31,978
? Life is but a dream. ?

228
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,543
It's lovely.

229
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,494
Very lovely.

230
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:38,155
I need you to do
something for me.

231
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:39,654
And I know you can.

232
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,695
When Farnum's here,
so we can buy you time to get well

233
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,590
you have to fake
being high.

234
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,439
? Row, row,
row your boat ?

235
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:51,367
- ? Gently down the steam... ?
- You can do it, Alma.

236
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:53,263
Look at all
the practice you've had.

237
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:55,881
? Merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream ?

238
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,199
You better have a paying
dwarf underneath you!

239
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,727
Am I dying?

240
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:11,589
Turn off the fucking water
and tell me what you did.

241
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,859
- I know you didn't fuck him.
- No.

242
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,357
You suck his prick?

243
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,018
He didn't want to show it to me
till he had a hard on.

244
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:21,421
That's what you call
a mistake of youth.

245
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,288
You mug it up
with him?

246
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,010
- A little.
- French lock or normal?

247
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:29,705
Normal.

248
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,225
So any hoople-head
who drank

249
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,757
from the same glass
this guy did

250
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,254
would have as much right
to sit there weeping as you,

251
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:39,749
except I can't kick his ass
and send him out to work.

252
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,369
My mom died of it
when we was coming out.

253
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,740
And that's when
Daddy gave us up.

254
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,767
Well, that sad story
makes me believe

255
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:53,287
maybe you was exposed
and ain't a candidate for it no more.

256
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,121
Stick to hand jobs
a day or two if you like.

257
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,057
These sheets
need cleaning.

258
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,067
I just provided
new linens.

259
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,537
And now they got
sick on 'em.

260
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:15,686
Take those
to the Chinaman.

261
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,220
Show you want
a clean exchange.

262
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:19,235
Say, "For Mr. Farnum, Wu.

263
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:21,513
Sheet for Farnum."

264
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,554
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Star.

265
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,476
- May I help with those sheets?
- I got 'em.

266
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,396
How is Mrs. Garret?

267
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,178
- Still not receiving.
- You do tell her I've asked to call?

268
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,187
On commission
for Mr. Bullock.

269
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,563
How's business
at your store?

270
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,603
Brisk.

271
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:51,018
Oh.

272
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,305
Jesus Christ!

273
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,347
You just shit
yourself!

274
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:17,249
I take it you've been
out on a hoot.

275
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,145
I've been drunk
awhile, correct.

276
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,585
What the fuck
is that to you?

277
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,263
Question was well meant,
like if you was

278
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,431
a farmer I would ask you
how the farming was going.

279
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,434
I did lose my fucking
best friend, you know?

280
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,165
I know.

281
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:35,814
Anyways, I ain't here
to teach you any manners.

282
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:41,058
I was wondering
about the child.

283
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,368
She's fine.

284
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,239
And what else?

285
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:49,129
And she's staying
with that widow,

286
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:52,260
and the whore from The Gem
is with her, too.

287
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,850
What the fuck is a whore
doing with her?

288
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,442
The widow has health
problems of her own.

289
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:59,685
And Trixie's
taking care of her.

290
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:01,477
Trixie being
the fucking whore?

291
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:04,612
You have high standards
as applied to other people.

292
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,998
I ain't judging anyone.
I was seeking information!

293
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,692
Well, are you
adequately informed?

294
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,315
Yes, I am,
you cocksucker!

295
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,688
'Cause I am
in the midst of a situation.

296
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:17,477
Oh, smallpox?

297
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:26,914
What the fuck
is that to you?

298
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,629
Fella in the woods I see
to say hello to has it.

299
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,606
Unless he caught it
from a trout.

300
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:36,031
I figured some in the camp
could be down with it, too.

301
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:37,895
What was he doing
in the woods?

302
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,171
Someone threw him there.

303
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:41,096
Anyways, he's better now.

304
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,655
And how do
you feel?

305
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:44,704
What's that
supposed to mean?

306
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:47,231
- How do you feel?
- Why?

307
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,824
I take it that you're
feeling well.

308
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:51,805
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not fucking wrong!

309
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,757
That's all I wanted
to fucking know!

310
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,352
I will lay you out
as soon as look at you!

311
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:58,497
This is my point.

312
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:00,837
You been caring
for a sick man

313
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:03,108
who doesn't seem
to have gotten you sick.

314
00:22:03,144 --> 00:22:05,413
Aren't you a wise
fucking owl?

315
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:09,059
Being as you have
a gift for it,

316
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,869
and I'm gonna have
sick people up to my hips,

317
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:16,579
I was wondering if you might
wanna come back to camp.

318
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:20,101
My best friend died.

319
00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:25,924
And he ain't
coming back!

320
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:32,769
Now will you
help me?

321
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:36,930
You can do your drinking
off work, like I do.

322
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,531
Madam?

323
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,454
Yes?

324
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:13,278
How are you?

325
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:16,612
Better, Mr. Farnum.
Thank you.

326
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,255
I'm glad.

327
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,627
How are you?

328
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,832
Very well,
thank you.

329
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:28,163
Excuse me.

330
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,269
- I brought more linens.
- Hmm.

331
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,675
I'd heard
someone threw up.

332
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:55,129
Well, appears
luck pinches out

333
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,310
at this game even
quicker than prospecting.

334
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,940
It can come back
that quick, too.

335
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,176
Never weaken,
same as at the creek.

336
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:05,790
You want to stop for a while, Ellsworth?
We can stop.

337
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,453
Oh, what if
my luck comes back?

338
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:09,695
Won't be here
to reap the benefits.

339
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:11,837
Well, maybe it'll
a wait for ya.

340
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:12,857
Of course, too,

341
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:15,200
maybe it won't,
right, Joanie?

342
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,522
Maybe you should stop
for awhile, honey.

343
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,180
You need to piss?

344
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,226
Excuse me.

345
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:25,633
Did I say that
too polite, Cy?

346
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,936
Go head off now.

347
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,965
Eddie, take over
the game.

348
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,424
Push them bones
my way, will ya?

349
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:37,116
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Place your bets.

350
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:40,220
All right, let's warm
the world back up now.

351
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,081
New shooter coming out.

352
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:46,143
Seven, the winner.
The winner is seven.

353
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:48,698
You sure you don't want
to get on me, young man?

354
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,421
Well, I might
hazard a 20.

355
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,984
All right, now!

356
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:56,604
Do not detain me.

357
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,439
Seven, the winner
is seven.

358
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:02,304
Hot shooter!

359
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:04,279
You can't keep
an old man down!

360
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,255
Wagons,
westward bound!

361
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,980
- It's a seven.
- You better get on me now.

362
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:13,214
I got a meeting to go to
and I got a hot hand here!

363
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,656
Hah!

364
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,307
Money's out front,
honey.

365
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:18,937
Okay.

366
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:24,058
Spots are coming out
all over his body.

367
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:26,202
That don't decide
how it ends.

368
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,345
Joey was cherry.

369
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:29,911
I know.

370
00:25:29,953 --> 00:25:32,189
He didn't want us
to do it till he knew how.

371
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,843
You'd do better
if the tricks

372
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,985
didn't think looking
at 'em made you cry.

373
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,568
Whoa, now.

374
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:56,540
It's Johnny Burns,
Reverend.

375
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:04,219
Mr. Burns.

376
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:07,253
- How are you?
- There's a meeting at The Gem.

377
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,332
Mr. Swearengen thought
you'd wanna come, too.

378
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:11,096
At his saloon?

379
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,507
Yes, sir.

380
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:16,213
May I ask
the meeting's purpose?

381
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,641
Well, he don't get
into that with me.

382
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:20,507
All right, thank you.

383
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:22,907
Tell Mr. Swearengen
I will be there.

384
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,210
He's having me
get fruit.

385
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:27,546
I know that much.

386
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:29,522
Fine.

387
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,231
The three red hands
on the pony's flank

388
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:40,373
was three men killed
hand to hand.

389
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:44,121
The red circle was
one killed on horseback.

390
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:46,938
The white lines
on the pony's legs

391
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:48,979
was times that he's
a'counted coup.

392
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,889
With them, whether
you mean to kill your man

393
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:53,655
after or you're just
showing off,

394
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:57,074
you hit 'em with a gun butt
or a stick or a club.

395
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:59,253
That's counting coup.

396
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,113
That's why he come
for you instead of

397
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,350
picking you off with an arrow,
like he did your horse.

398
00:28:03,387 --> 00:28:05,328
Charlie.

399
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:07,510
Ah, there you are.

400
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:13,714
That was one bad hombre
you got by Bullock.

401
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:16,056
Bill's dead,
Charlie.

402
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,448
Of your own seeing?

403
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,743
Yeah.

404
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,173
I heard it spoke of
two days ago,

405
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:32,953
but as often
as he wasn't before,

406
00:28:32,986 --> 00:28:35,124
I hoped he wasn't
this time, too.

407
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:38,963
I was after
the bastard who did it.

408
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,474
Anything broke?

409
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,423
No.

410
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:48,116
Can you ride?

411
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:51,343
Yeah.

412
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:53,458
Let's get
that cocksucker.

413
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,647
We should
dig a grave.

414
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:00,984
I'd as soon not waste
the fucking time.

415
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,984
It won't take long.

416
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,467
You ain't doing
him no favor.

417
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:12,050
I mean his way to heaven's
above ground and looking west!

418
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,772
Well, let's
do that, then.

419
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,467
Don't you want to take
him over the ridge?

420
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:23,057
This hole in the ground and put him
up there with his headless buddy?

421
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,845
I mean, that's what you
nearly got killed for.

422
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,246
Interfering with his
big fucking medicine,

423
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:32,655
burying his fucking buddy
over the fucking ridge!

424
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:52,495
Trixie did her work
and then some, Al.

425
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:55,023
Must've put a double
handful of that dope

426
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:56,143
down the widow's mouth.

427
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:58,802
Did you happen to offer
on her gold claim?

428
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,180
The moment was wrong.

429
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,874
The dope had made
the widow randy.

430
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,522
Lustful looks,
heavy breathing.

431
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,900
Outthrust chest.

432
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,757
The full catalog.

433
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,179
Only hope you comported
yourself as a gentlemen.

434
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,011
There was a child
in the room.

435
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:16,429
Peaches and pears
on the fucking bar.

436
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:18,740
Spoon it out amongst
yourselves.

437
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:30,893
First thing to say is...

438
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,055
plague's in
the fucking camp.

439
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,330
Smallpox.

440
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,603
Plague is spread
by rats.

441
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:41,461
I was raised
calling it plague

442
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,282
but Doc wants
that in reserve

443
00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:45,619
in case our luck holds
and the rats decide

444
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:47,311
to descend on us,
too, hmm?

445
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,349
But whatever you
fucking call it,

446
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,495
the point is for
no one to raise

447
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,769
their fucking dresses
over their heads.

448
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:57,619
You... you wait
it out.

449
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,508
You outlast
the cocksucker.

450
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:01,876
I've outlasted several
fucking outbreaks.

451
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,917
Is it pretty?
No, but it passes.

452
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:07,696
So, we need a place
for them to get it.

453
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,798
To care for 'em
and to keep 'em outta sight

454
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:12,527
so people don't get
frightened and disgusted.

455
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,157
Mr. Bullock and me
have lumber left

456
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:16,019
from putting
our building up.

457
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:17,459
Tent's a better
impression.

458
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:20,526
Emphasizes it's
a passing phase.

459
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,572
As far as a vaccine,

460
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:25,646
one place we know has it
is Fort Carney.

461
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:26,927
How do we know that?

462
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:28,274
Off the fucking issue,
Tom.

463
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:29,714
Bismarck

464
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:32,563
and Cheyenne
probably got it, too.

465
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:36,076
So we should send to all three places.
And as time's a factor,

466
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,003
stagecoaches ain't
the right conveyance,

467
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:40,523
so I suggest three groups
of horsemen, huh?

468
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:42,985
Five riders to a group,
fend off the dirt worshipers.

469
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,842
60 bucks a rider,
$10 in advance, 50 on return.

470
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:48,843
Would be three times
five times 60.

471
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:50,476
$900 at the worst.

472
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:52,588
Assuming they
all survive.

473
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:55,148
Add in, for the vaccine
and paying the Doc,

474
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:57,553
I would say $1,500
is the target.

475
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:00,173
I'm in for five.

476
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:03,473
- 500.
- Two.

477
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,646
- Two.
- You fucking kidding me, E. B?

478
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,145
150.

479
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:09,041
50 from
Bullock and Star.

480
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:10,536
You're all right.

481
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,127
150 hits the target.

482
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:16,977
I assume they'll be
a public announcement in "The Pioneer."

483
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:20,174
Yeah, get a jump on
them panic-mongers.

484
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:23,058
Can you give me
five minutes, Doc,

485
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:24,846
after the meeting
adjourns?

486
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:27,566
Give some positive angle to it.
Vaccine's on it's way

487
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:29,991
or looks like it's
the mild type.

488
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:33,711
It would also be useful
to avoid apocalyptic predictions.

489
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,266
Nip that Sodom and Gomorrah shit
in the bud, huh?

490
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,345
And stigmatizing
the afflicted.

491
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:42,062
Where will we locate
the pest tent?

492
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:48,687
I bought a lot at the end
of Chink's Alley you can use.

493
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:51,209
Gonna build a joint
in future, catering

494
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,933
to the celestials, ain't you?
You clever cocksucker.

495
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,318
They are the fucking degenerate
gamblers among all the races.

496
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:59,467
I'll see to recruiting
the riders.

497
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:01,871
$10 a rider advanced money.

498
00:33:01,906 --> 00:33:04,207
If I can get
your John Hancock

499
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,543
for the receipt
of the 150...

500
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:12,394
Fruit's up here,
anybody didn't get any.

501
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,996
Oh, for Chrissake.

502
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,631
All right, Reverend.

503
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:25,160
Somebody get me something
to hold his jaw open.

504
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:28,015
Here you go, Doc.
Fruit spoon, Doc.

505
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,771
Not a fucking
metal spoon, Johnny!

506
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,815
He'll break every
tooth in his mouth.

507
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:33,743
Here you go, Doc.

508
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:40,777
Doc, I won't say
it's pristine.

509
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:43,204
All right, Reverend.

510
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,567
You're doing better,
Reverend.

511
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:52,965
You ever see him
do that?

512
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,709
He's all right.

513
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,326
Used to have a fucking
brother given to that.

514
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,595
We'd make
pennies off it

515
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,321
when it'd come
over him in the street.

516
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,082
Hey, Reverend,

517
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,948
you could've
just said "Amen."

518
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,277
Quite the civic figure,
Cy.

519
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,921
That's me, that's
what I live for.

520
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,812
How healthy we leave
that prospector?

521
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:34,089
He'll be back.

522
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,067
Fucking Joanie.

523
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,793
Got a crack
out of turn.

524
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,644
You still got an awful
smooth hand, young man.

525
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:42,790
Yeah.

526
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,837
Practice makes
perfect, huh?

527
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,489
Yeah, Cy. And you give a good
hand job yourself.

528
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:55,788
Find out from Joanie how exposed
that redhead got to the kid.

529
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:58,722
Anything else you want me
to ask you her for you?

530
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,259
Eddie, if I talk
to her right now,

531
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:01,827
I'll break her
fucking jaw.

532
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,611
And if we keep talking,
I'll break yours, too.

533
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:23,714
I take it I suffered some sort
of convulsion or seizure.

534
00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:26,505
Perhaps brought on
by irregular hours.

535
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,841
Oh, I see. I suspect you will
soon be hanging up

536
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,079
your shingle in
competition with me?

537
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:34,499
- No, oh no, no, sir.
- Mm.

538
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,401
How did you feel before
the spell come on you?

539
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:41,410
I noticed a peculiar
smell in the air,

540
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:43,753
as if something
were burning.

541
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,959
Is this first time?

542
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:48,548
No, the first episode
occurred several days ago.

543
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:50,759
After the service
for Mr. Hickok.

544
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:53,664
And any others between
that one and this?

545
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:55,812
No.

546
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,825
Follow my finger.

547
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:06,721
Hmm, perhaps
I just need glasses.

548
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:09,697
Merrick needs to see
you about the article.

549
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:12,640
Prescribe this malingerer
a can of peaches

550
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:14,755
and show him
the fucking door.

551
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:23,111
Am I clear to assist you
to tend to the sick?

552
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,016
You are cleared,
Reverend.

553
00:36:33,962 --> 00:36:36,417
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

554
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,759
I don't know.

555
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:41,063
You better figure it
the fuck out.

556
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:44,195
'Cause this free-ride
shit's coming to a quick fucking halt.

557
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,586
Free ride?

558
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,512
What would
you call it?

559
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:52,228
I earn my way.

560
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:54,653
How?

561
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:57,631
Posing in expensive dresses
and breaking up catfights?

562
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,640
Taking trouble
to steer the trade?

563
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:02,273
That don't pay
the freight, honey.

564
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:05,412
You're here to create
a fucking atmosphere.

565
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:08,547
Fucking atmosphere you
create lately, "I'm sad."

566
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:12,228
Then on your bad days,
"Oh, I'm so sad."

567
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:15,521
Oh.

568
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:21,031
What is it,
sweetheart?

569
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,639
I guess
it's coming here.

570
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,614
What's wrong
with coming here?

571
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,379
You never liked
the river that much.

572
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,750
What's wrong with
a fresh start?

573
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:34,205
How it feels when
there isn't one.

574
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:36,189
Well, shit.

575
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:38,981
Stay here, I'll bring
you back a fucking lollipop.

576
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:45,055
Sorry I cracked
on your play with the prospector.

577
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,412
Me and Eddie turned it
into a longer campaign.

578
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:51,105
If he don't get plague,
it'll all have a happy end.

579
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:54,812
My worry's you.

580
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,311
And my concern's

581
00:37:57,351 --> 00:38:00,285
feelings of fucking
affection.

582
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:03,708
Shut up, Cy.

583
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,987
Work on believing it,
Joanie.

584
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:14,724
That's the way I always want
to touch you, just like that.

585
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,000
Don't make me
do it different.

586
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:34,976
"Two cases of the smallpox

587
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:38,145
have been diagnosed in our camp
by Doctor Amos Cochran."

588
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,123
Hey, Doc!

589
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:48,259
Get the Amos
outta there!

590
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:49,854
Scratch Amos.

591
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:53,056
"At Dr. Cochran's suggestion,
a pest tent,

592
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:57,762
endowed by the generous
retailers of our fine community,

593
00:38:57,797 --> 00:39:00,764
is being erected
for the afflicted on the south end,

594
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,936
and riders dispatched
to secure a vaccine."

595
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:05,565
Maybe you
should add there,

596
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:08,157
"They're already probably
on their way back."

597
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:11,548
Excuse me.

598
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:16,826
"'The Pioneer' has been assured
of their imminent return."

599
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,493
That's catchier.

600
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,987
"Thanks also to
the aforementioned merchants,

601
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,969
the vaccine will be
distributed gratis."

602
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,834
Free gratis.

603
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:28,064
Free gratis
is a redundancy.

604
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,099
Does that mean
repeats itself?

605
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,441
Then leave gratis out.

606
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:36,377
What luck for me, Al,
that you have

607
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:38,524
such a keen
editorial sense.

608
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:41,280
Free.
Distributed free.

609
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,776
Period.

610
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:47,583
It will take me some
time to reset the type.

611
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,114
Yeah, hurry up.

612
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:51,227
Excuse me.

613
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:52,860
Al.

614
00:39:57,507 --> 00:40:00,954
Thanks for not putting
the stink on me before with the others

615
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:03,329
over that Fort Carney
business.

616
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:05,118
Sure.

617
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:10,009
I'm back.

618
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:12,058
Your room has
been re-rented!

619
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:14,334
Fuck you and fuck
the rooms you rent.

620
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,857
I'm calling on the widow and the little
one in her care.

621
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:19,832
And if I was you,
or any cocksucker with you,

622
00:40:19,874 --> 00:40:21,150
I wouldn't
try to stop me.

623
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,552
- Be brief.
- Be fucked!

624
00:40:25,602 --> 00:40:27,357
Her gutter mouth

625
00:40:27,394 --> 00:40:29,303
and the widow in
an opium stupor.

626
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:32,826
A conversation
for the ages.

627
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,198
Hey, fuck-nut!

628
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:53,470
What you got
in that suitcase?

629
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:55,130
Millinery samples.

630
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,274
If it concerns
you at all.

631
00:40:57,313 --> 00:41:00,182
Millinery samples,
ain't that just perfect!

632
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,680
Some women...

633
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,142
take the trouble to make
a decent appearance.

634
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:07,672
Well, for your
information, Mr. Millinery-

635
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:09,784
Sample-Suitcase cocksucker,

636
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:11,799
you're staying in
the former room of someone

637
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:13,335
you ain't fit
to lick the boots of!

638
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:15,415
Wild Bill Hickok.

639
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,692
I paid $2
a day extra.

640
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,589
Had you any connection
to Wild Bill?

641
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:28,055
Good luck with your
fucking day selling hats.

642
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,245
It's Jane!

643
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:38,427
Oh my God.

644
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:40,667
Hello, Jane.

645
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:42,743
Look at you.

646
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,888
Listen to you.
Oh my God in heaven.

647
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:49,979
I'm Trixie.

648
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:52,153
I think I've seen you.

649
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:53,881
At The Gem.

650
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,828
Yeah.

651
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,659
Maybe that's where.

652
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,780
You look like shit.

653
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:09,469
Oh, owe you a penny.

654
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:11,542
I'm better.

655
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:15,356
I was so sorry to hear
about Mr. Hickok.

656
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,244
Yeah.

657
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:22,779
You oughtta get
your husband outta that creek.

658
00:42:22,814 --> 00:42:26,708
As soon as I feel
just a little better.

659
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:32,377
Anyways, I'm glad
to see this little one

660
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:35,959
in good condition
and talking, to boot.

661
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:37,939
Come see her
all the time.

662
00:42:37,982 --> 00:42:41,145
Nah, I'm
fucking drunk.

663
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:47,124
I might be seeing
to sick people.

664
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,531
But I'm gonna keep

665
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:53,427
this exact recollection
of your lovely mug.

666
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:56,884
And put a penny aside
every time I curse.

667
00:42:56,925 --> 00:42:59,543
And that is
my promise to you,

668
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:02,428
and me too. We'll see each other
again down the road.

669
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:19,185
- Gentlemen...
- Well, let's see it.

670
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:22,010
Or should I say,
my fellow authors?

671
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:24,946
I'm done in there!

672
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:26,810
Where would the Doc
have got to?

673
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:28,785
South end
of Chinaman's Alley.

674
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,427
They'll get me there.

675
00:43:40,475 --> 00:43:42,930
I think maybe it should
have a question mark.

676
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:45,338
"The Plague
in Deadwood?"

677
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:46,647
The type is set.

678
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:48,537
You're reading
the definitive edition.

679
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,691
Let's run it.

680
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:57,712
Nice working with you.

681
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:13,945
Take him
right over here.

682
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,226
It's all right
to breathe,

683
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,153
just turn your head
away from him.

684
00:44:24,186 --> 00:44:26,706
Okay, Doc.

685
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:28,306
All right.

686
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:30,068
Roll him over
on his side.

687
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:34,708
Turn him back this way.
That's it.

688
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:38,961
All right,
thank you, fellas.

689
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:40,790
Bye, Doc.

690
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,774
It's all right, son.

691
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:47,344
It's going
to be all right.

692
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,657
Hey!

693
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:55,031
Hey, somebody!

694
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:01,934
Are you sure
you're up to this?

695
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,261
Oh yes.

696
00:45:05,305 --> 00:45:07,410
I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

697
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:22,639
Here's another one
for you.

698
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,206
So I see.

699
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:28,398
You already been exposed,
you wanna follow him in?

700
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,349
I might.

701
00:46:55,701 --> 00:46:59,978
"'The Pioneer' was assured
of their imminent return."

702
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,827
I'll believe it
when I see it.

703
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:08,018
"Lmminent return" is one
of my contributions

704
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:10,769
to the fucking article.
The idea for that phrase.

705
00:47:14,517 --> 00:47:16,851
"Pest tent being
erected at the south..."

706
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:19,153
What about that
fucking Tolliver

707
00:47:19,188 --> 00:47:21,359
buying up property
on the Q.T., huh?

708
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:23,336
We're lucky he was
struggling with the shit

709
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,965
when he made the offer
to loan out the lot.

710
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:28,873
Nonetheless, it says the man
sees the possibilities of the things.

711
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,704
I mean, to come up
at this fucking juncture

712
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:33,870
with the idea of creating an emporium
for the fucking Chinks

713
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:35,151
takes brass fucking balls,

714
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:37,074
and a long-term vision
for the future.

715
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:42,064
Merrick.

716
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,750
Merrick wanted
to put here "gratis."

717
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:46,477
Now is the idea

718
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:49,930
to inform your reader
or make him feel like a fucking dunce?

719
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:51,563
I had him put "free."

720
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,766
Don't see why he doesn't
have news of the baseball.

721
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:57,191
That new league started
a team in Chicago.

722
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:01,356
Different path taken

723
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:03,369
at certain forks
in the road,

724
00:48:03,411 --> 00:48:05,712
who knows what kind
of a joint we'd be in now?

725
00:48:05,747 --> 00:48:09,042
Of course, truth is,
as a base of operations,

726
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:12,391
you cannot beat
a fucking saloon.

727
00:48:14,674 --> 00:48:16,746
Ah!

728
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:29,870
? I'm taken down
with the fever ?

729
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:32,392
? And it won't
let me sleep ?

730
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:37,641
? I'm taken down
with the fever ?

731
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,464
? And it won't
let me sleep ?

732
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:44,816
? It was about 3:00 ?

733
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:47,783
? Before he would
let me be ?

734
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:52,776
? I wish somebody ?

735
00:48:52,817 --> 00:48:55,816
? Would come and drive
my fever away ?

736
00:48:57,617 --> 00:49:00,584
? I wish somebody ?

737
00:49:00,624 --> 00:49:03,176
? Come drive
my fever away ?

738
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:08,172
? This fever I'm havin' ?

739
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,207
? Sho' is in my way. ?
