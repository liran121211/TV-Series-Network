1
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,563
I raise 100.

2
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,471
Back 100.

3
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:49,082
That man's overplaying
his hand.

4
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:52,509
All right.

5
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,369
Whatever the fuck
I got left.

6
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:56,312
420 back to you.

7
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:15,773
As advertised,

8
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:18,462
you got more nerve
than sense, huh, Bill?

9
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,409
What have you got?

10
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,511
The man stays
on fours.

11
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,849
And they call this
a game of skill?

12
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:28,444
Well, you got me,
didn't you, Bill?

13
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,076
You son of a bitch!

14
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,453
You were told
about that talk.

15
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,347
Go eat, Jack.

16
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,319
All right.

17
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:54,722
I thank you
for that kindness.

18
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:58,334
You just bought yourself
something with that.

19
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,718
Some boys can't go near a cliff
without jumping off.

20
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,781
20 to the dealer.

21
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,341
Much appreciated.

22
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,249
Any ideas for the rest?

23
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:21,243
I believe
I'll stay with cash.

24
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,673
Montana.

25
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,236
No rest for the wicked.

26
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,415
Well, what are you
doing up?

27
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,787
Well, it's cooler working now.
Quieter.

28
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,210
Sorry you had to listen

29
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,260
to them drunken fools before,
Mr. Hickok.

30
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,571
When you and Mr. Utter
was helping us?

31
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:03,683
I come through unharmed.

32
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:06,651
And Bill would be easier
on my nerves.

33
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,556
Mr. Hickok makes me look
for the warrant in your hand.

34
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:13,825
All right.

35
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,674
Montana okay with you?

36
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:25,886
The only other nickname
I ever had was "Sloth."

37
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:28,260
Don't seem to fit.

38
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,432
Choice was among
the seven sins.

39
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,055
I guess I got out
before the others surfaced.

40
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:43,523
Camp looks like
a good bet.

41
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,980
My wife and boy
are with their people in Michigan.

42
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:49,666
I hope I can
bring 'em out soon.

43
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,405
They'll get the Sioux
making peace.

44
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,228
Pretty quick
you'll have laws here

45
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,979
and every other
damn thing.

46
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,186
I'll just settle
for property rights.

47
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,327
Will ya?

48
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,259
I'm recently married
myself.

49
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:12,321
Is that so?

50
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,398
The missus
operates a circus.

51
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,981
She's in Cincinnati

52
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:21,219
waiting for word
of my success.

53
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,702
Sol and I put our last sifting cradle
aside for you.

54
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:28,671
Why don't you go ahead
and use it, Bill?

55
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:31,613
What slows me down
is thinking

56
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:33,891
about freezing my balls off
in a creek.

57
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,577
Or the cocksuckers
I'd would lose the gold to at poker.

58
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,854
I'm flat out tired.

59
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:46,527
Turn in.

60
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,064
I got her covered.

61
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,142
I believe I will.

62
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:01,349
Good night, Montana.

63
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:04,862
Good night, Bill.

64
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:15,037
My pop
called me "Kite."

65
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,323
I was supposed to leave for Cheyenne
two damn hours ago!

66
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,195
What kept you,
Charlie?

67
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,062
You don't fuckin' sleep!

68
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:43,519
I don't know what in the fuck
is happening to you, Bill.

69
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,298
So you stayed in camp
to tuck me in?

70
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:51,391
If you don't
want to prospect,

71
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,880
I could put you in charge
of that mail route I'm gettin'.

72
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,164
I'm doing
what I wanna do.

73
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,988
Bullshit!

74
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:00,325
Some goddamned time,

75
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,393
a man's due to stop
arguing with hisself,

76
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:07,109
feeling he's twice
the goddamned fool he knows he is

77
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:10,887
because he can't
be something he tries to be

78
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,830
every goddamned day without once
getting to dinnertime

79
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:14,781
and not fucking it up.

80
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,244
I don't wanna fight it
no more.

81
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,849
Understand me,
Charlie?

82
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,369
And I don't want you
pissing in my ear about it.

83
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:32,259
Can you let me go to hell
the way I want to?

84
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,527
Yeah.

85
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,806
I can do that.

86
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,393
Good luck in Cheyenne.

87
00:07:56,362 --> 00:08:00,039
Good luck
to you, too, Bill.

88
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,445
You know me, Al.

89
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,937
I don't scrutinize
or second guess.

90
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,872
If you wanted
to explain

91
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:18,150
why I'm to buy the dude
out of a worthless claim,

92
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:21,568
- I'd surely listen.
- Jesus Christ.

93
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,617
What is it?

94
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,237
The dude must've had
some kind of accident.

95
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,757
My word.

96
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,444
- Looks dead, don't he?
- Yes.

97
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:41,573
See, my reasoning was,
get the dude his money back,

98
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,846
keep him from asking in
the Pinkertons.

99
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,161
Well, appears now
that's unnecessary.

100
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,269
Make the offer
to the wife.

101
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:24,069
Al, once that dope fiend

102
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:27,140
throws her skirts over her head
and hightails back to New York,

103
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,048
you think she'll give one wet fart
about what happened at this camp,

104
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:32,361
let alone send
the Pinkertons out?

105
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:35,242
And 20,000's
a lot of money.

106
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,235
Let me tell you,
several things, E.B.

107
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:42,570
First, $20,000
is a lot of money.

108
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:45,919
Second,
it's my fucking money.

109
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:48,811
Third, the widow,
being a dope fiend,

110
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:50,272
might let matters rest.

111
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,649
But fourth,

112
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:56,229
well, this camp has a lot more
to offer me than $20,000

113
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,886
as long as I don't get killed
by the fucking Pinkertons.

114
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:01,641
Why take the chance?

115
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:04,458
Go see to the grieving
fucking widow.

116
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,117
All right, sir.

117
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,444
Mrs. Garret?

118
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:50,187
What a tragic turn.

119
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,996
Do you require
Dr. Cochran?

120
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,232
To treat
your terrible grief?

121
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,667
Yes. I would like
to see the doctor.

122
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:04,610
Of course,
who wouldn't?

123
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:06,540
I'll get him
right away.

124
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,769
Ask him, before
he sees me please,

125
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,397
to examine
my husband's injuries.

126
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,015
I'd like his opinion
on how they were sustained.

127
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,841
I assume your husband
died in a fall.

128
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,786
All I asked you to do was get
the goddamned doctor.

129
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,422
Of course, madam.

130
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:36,229
Is that what happened,
Mr. Dority?

131
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,725
A tragic turn?

132
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,994
Terrible,
accidental fall?

133
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,331
I'm sorry, ma'am.

134
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,404
Oh yes.

135
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:54,476
Come on, stupid.

136
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,787
She wouldn't have
nothing to do with me, Al.

137
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,684
She told E.B.

138
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,889
To have Doc
go over the body.

139
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,430
You think he smells
the gold?

140
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:25,989
Nah.

141
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,038
E.B.'s too busy
sniffin'

142
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,412
what he can steal
being go-between.

143
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,117
Whereas you, Dan,

144
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,192
you show me foresight,
and loyalty,

145
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:39,118
the way you handled
making the find.

146
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:41,868
Just know
when I'm outta my depth.

147
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,987
Amateur.
Comes on a lark to dabble,

148
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:49,673
and falls to his death
from the ridge.

149
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,758
Yet the widow
suspects foul play.

150
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,733
I know Al wants
her leaving here

151
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:18,280
with as least of a sour taste
in her mouth as possible.

152
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,319
Wouldn't you expect
her husband's death

153
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,043
to be sour on her tongue
no matter how it happened?

154
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,381
Question's whether
it's fate she blames,

155
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,652
or people in the camp.

156
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,557
What are you looking for?

157
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,628
Morning, Seth.

158
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,125
When did you get up?

159
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:39,273
I didn't go to sleep.

160
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,656
The woman that newspaperman
pointed out to us yesterday

161
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,222
just lost her husband.

162
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:47,653
Fella bought the gold claim
at Swearengen's?

163
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,964
Innkeep just took the body
down to the doc's.

164
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:59,146
You weren't twiddlin'
your thumbs overnight, were you?

165
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
I've brought the doctor.

166
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,928
Please, come in,
Doctor.

167
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,981
I'm very sorry
about your husband.

168
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:38,351
Was he murdered?

169
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,604
I was told that he fell
from a ridge.

170
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:46,023
He had skull fractures
consistent with that.

171
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,748
Not been wounded
by bullets nor strangled.

172
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:50,923
No other sign
of foul play.

173
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,416
Leaving
how he came to fall?

174
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:55,660
As to that
I have no opinion.

175
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,227
And yet...

176
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:02,923
in treating me,

177
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:05,960
you were so full
of opinion.

178
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:08,587
You took the most
comprehensive view.

179
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:12,272
I said you needn't
make up symptoms

180
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,865
to get the laudanum
you want...

181
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:15,530
Perhaps,
you don't feel

182
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,423
at such perfect liberty

183
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,563
to opine
on my husband's case

184
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,488
as you did on mine.

185
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,750
Do other considerations
constrain you?

186
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,623
Do other men?

187
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:36,689
I do not know

188
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,788
how your husband's skull
got caved in.

189
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,480
You're a bright woman,
aren't you?

190
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:52,107
Must've gone
through hell here.

191
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:08,077
Go on home,
Mrs. Garret.

192
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,641
What's her mood?

193
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,293
Who is it?

194
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,600
Mr. Farnum,
Mrs. Garret.

195
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:58,537
May I be
of further service?

196
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,579
Once I've determined
my plans.

197
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,258
I'll certainly need
a coffin.

198
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,529
- I'll see to it.
- Thank you.

199
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,195
What is it?

200
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:14,992
Would you open
the door, ma'am?

201
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:17,581
I would like to say
something to your face.

202
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,734
I'm overcome with remorse,
Mrs. Garret,

203
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,192
that I failed to change
the course of events.

204
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:36,367
It was me your husband
outbid for the claim.

205
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:41,009
If it will simplify
your situation in any way,

206
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,913
I renew my offer
at $12,000.

207
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:48,240
I know it won't
bring him back.

208
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,374
No.
We both know that.

209
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:53,615
You'll have
your answer shortly.

210
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:55,725
All right, madam.

211
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:24,494
Is this
Mr. Hickok's room?

212
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:25,993
Who's asking?

213
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:29,298
My husband's just died
under suspicious circumstances.

214
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:30,892
Suspect someone else.

215
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:33,900
When Bill's killed a man,
he says so and states his reasons.

216
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:36,461
I don't
suspect him.

217
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:39,315
My husband had tried
to engage Mr. Hickok,

218
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,039
just before his death
and I thought,

219
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,571
though they hadn't
come to terms,

220
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,620
perhaps Mr. Hickok
would be willing

221
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:47,595
to advise me on my
current situation.

222
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:50,833
I'd pay whatever fee
he thought appropriate.

223
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,834
To talk to you?

224
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,296
I have no one else
in the camp.

225
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:01,519
I'll get him.

226
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,859
He's sleepin' one off.

227
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,780
Thank you.

228
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:09,108
I'm sorry about
your husband.

229
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:11,247
May I ask your name?

230
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,838
- Jane.
- Thank you, Jane.

231
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:19,989
Wait in your room.

232
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,477
It'll take him a while
to get the phlegm situated.

233
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,643
All right.

234
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:29,167
I'm sure you don't need me
explaining a place like ours.

235
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,244
A doc in frequent
attendance

236
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,620
can sow the seeds
of doubt.

237
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:37,298
All depends on your standards
of hygiene.

238
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:40,017
We want 'em shiny.
Make no mistake.

239
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,580
There's a wide range
of "normal."

240
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,077
Friday and Saturday mornings
and the mid-week day

241
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,484
of your choice
will be right for us.

242
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,819
I can... I can
work that out.

243
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,221
So what does Swearengen
pay for a visit?

244
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:55,377
$20 for routine call,
all girls in.

245
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:58,284
Ah. And what's his idea
of routine,

246
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,424
once every three
or four months?

247
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:05,073
Anyway, how's uh...
$50 a visit sound,

248
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:07,020
three times a week?

249
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:09,451
Done.

250
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:11,283
Lubricants.

251
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:16,820
Well, armed and ready,
madam.

252
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:31,794
Thanks very much.

253
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,685
Howdy.

254
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:36,686
Howdy yourself.
You the operator?

255
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:37,970
Cy Tolliver.

256
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,014
Name's Crane.
And I'd like a room,

257
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,549
I'd like exclusive
use of the safe

258
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:43,379
and I'd like
to shoot some dice.

259
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:45,171
I'd like to think
this is the first day

260
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:47,378
of a long friendship,
Mr. Crane.

261
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,390
We'll get you a room.
If you'll step into my office

262
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,057
we'll meet
your needs for a safe.

263
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:52,884
Help you
with your luggage.

264
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,381
Suitcases
go to the room.

265
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:55,885
Expect you'll
keep the valise.

266
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,715
Keep what you
"expect" to yourself

267
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:00,052
and you'll improve our chances
at that friendship.

268
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:04,047
- Young man.
- How are you, Cy?

269
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,291
Done some good work
on this place.

270
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,334
Eddie's work.

271
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:10,230
Hey, Andy.

272
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:11,789
Hello, sweetheart.

273
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:15,348
So let's go,
let's get something working.

274
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:18,133
We could rob Cy.

275
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:20,077
How 'bout a bath first
and a nap...

276
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,389
- and sex with an unfamiliar woman?
- Sure.

277
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,114
Signal when ready,
commander.

278
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,534
If I didn't make my point, I'd like
to get something fucking working.

279
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:29,364
Sure, Andy.

280
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,175
How's Andy look?

281
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:39,379
Like he spent three weeks
on a wagon.

282
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,197
I'm optimistic, Al.

283
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,272
And she's promised
a prompt reply.

284
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:46,679
I'd have thought
she'd say yes on the spot.

285
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,845
You did offer her
the whole 20?

286
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,814
How can you even
ask me that?

287
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,961
- E. B?
- I offered 12.

288
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:04,182
Did I ask you
to play her?

289
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:07,216
Can't you follow one
simple fucking instruction?

290
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,394
She will take the 12, Al,
and be happy to get it.

291
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:11,471
And all you'll
have to decide

292
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:14,000
is how much of the eight
you saved should go to me.

293
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,561
- You're incorrigible.
- I do my best.

294
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,015
I'll go with the 12.

295
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:22,610
She says yes, there should be
something in this for you.

296
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,688
Hint at the amount.

297
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:27,790
Don't get ahead
of yourself, E.B.

298
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,971
When she signs
the bill of sale,

299
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,212
and you come back here
and sign it over to me...

300
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,321
It is your 12 after all.

301
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:36,183
Once all that's done,

302
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:38,159
you should walk
outta here with 2,000.

303
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:40,273
Fair recompense.

304
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:42,963
For saving me money
in spite of myself.

305
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,825
I suggested to my husband
just last night

306
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:55,029
that we should try
to view our time here

307
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,683
as one experience
bought at a single price.

308
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:00,340
Even now he's murdered,
I feel that.

309
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,279
That to stake
the boundaries

310
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:10,353
at... at just that fact
is impossible.

311
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:12,499
For one, this camp

312
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:15,122
hasn't any laws or courts.

313
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,463
If it did, I've no evidence.
I'd have tried to take

314
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:19,985
the thing all whole if they
hadn't offered on the claim.

315
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:23,408
To receive their money,
would be a separate matter,

316
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,424
make me an accomplice
of another sort.

317
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,922
How have you been
an accomplice till now?

318
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,831
A wife inevitably feels

319
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:38,616
she's had some part
in what befalls her husband.

320
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:45,876
I'm answerable hereafter,
on different terms.

321
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:49,460
I need to know
what I'd be selling them.

322
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:52,084
You don't believe the money's
to keep the Pinkertons away?

323
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:54,489
Why pay me?

324
00:23:54,523 --> 00:23:57,141
If it were a ransom
to keep the Pinkertons off,

325
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,545
why not pay Brom
instead of killing him?

326
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:03,091
It's this saloon operator
you think is pulling the strings?

327
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:07,386
Al Swearengen, it was certainly he
manipulating Brom.

328
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:09,142
The slimy
limey cocksucker.

329
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,288
All right, ma'am.

330
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:16,403
True sounding's
not guaranteed

331
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:19,377
but I'll try
for a feel of the bottom.

332
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:24,818
What shall I pay you,
Mr. Hickok?

333
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,768
I prefer you pick
the figure.

334
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:30,291
- Is $100 enough?
- Perfect.

335
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:06,010
Whiskey.

336
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:24,850
And how'd they take
to the craps game?

337
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:28,187
Like chimps
at their first fire.

338
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,375
Downstairs.

339
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,904
Thank you, Dan.

340
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,783
I'm Al Swearengen,
Mr. Hickok.

341
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:11,959
In the last few days,

342
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:14,931
I've been locked
in my room weeping,

343
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,242
searching my memories

344
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:20,506
as to where my path
might have crossed yours previous.

345
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:22,484
And as to how
I might have given offense

346
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:25,492
that you stay in this camp
not 50 feet from my joint

347
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:27,672
and never once walk in.

348
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:32,029
No poker.

349
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:33,720
Is it that simple?

350
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:37,368
Dan, dismantle the titty corner
and set up a poker table.

351
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,129
Not necessary,
Mr. Swearengen.

352
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:42,013
I always felt poker
slows a joint's action.

353
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:43,933
Bit of liquor, pussy,

354
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,788
and faro made my
entire fuckin' career,

355
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,479
but certain people
I do respect.

356
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,288
This man Garret,
who fell off the rocks...

357
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:53,212
The Eastern dude.

358
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:55,318
His widow's had an offer
on his claim

359
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,300
from that innkeeper
sitting in the corner.

360
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:59,098
But she's reluctant
to sell

361
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,745
till she understands
what's behind it.

362
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:05,203
Why have you
asked me?

363
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,179
She believes
you'd know.

364
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,785
Her husband came here
with childish ideas.

365
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:20,342
Bought himself a gold claim
with me an honest broker.

366
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:22,269
Claim pinches out,
which will happen.

367
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:26,011
But he can't take that like a man,
has to blame somebody.

368
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,151
Seller's left camp
so he picks on me.

369
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:30,045
Says he'll bring in
the Pinkertons

370
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,932
if I don't offer
restitution.

371
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,617
I got a healthy operation here,
and I didn't build it

372
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:38,549
brooding on the right
and wrong of things.

373
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:42,006
I do not need the Pinkertons
descending like locusts.

374
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,205
So I bend over for
the tenderfoot cocksucker.

375
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,450
"Reconnoiter
your claim fully," I say,

376
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:49,788
"and then,
if you're still unhappy,

377
00:27:49,823 --> 00:27:51,677
I will give you
your fucking money back."

378
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,205
And the tenderfoot agrees.

379
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:55,069
Just as he's finishing
his reconnoiter,

380
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:58,419
cocksucker falls to his death.
Pure fucking accident.

381
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:00,699
But up jumps the widow
in righteous indignation.

382
00:28:00,735 --> 00:28:04,509
Wants the doctor to examine him
for murder wounds.

383
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:07,260
My visions
of locusts return.

384
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:10,644
I see Pinkertons
coming in swarms.

385
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,851
Commissioned
by the widow.

386
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:16,570
Who I recognize is grieving,
and has better intentions probably

387
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,517
than to hold
on the truth.

388
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,854
How's the innkeep
come to make the offer?

389
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:25,980
Underbidder
on the sale I brokered

390
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:27,771
still believes
in the claim.

391
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:30,229
Even though the gold
is pinched out?

392
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:32,093
Well, this camp's
expanding.

393
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,330
We've already had
one hotel close.

394
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:36,026
He sees the property
as real estate.

395
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,481
I'll take this back
to the widow.

396
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,354
I only hope you
show it to her

397
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,042
in a favorable
fucking light.

398
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:53,467
What's that worth?

399
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:56,411
What?

400
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,165
The light
I show it in?

401
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:01,688
What's it
worth to you?

402
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,963
Why, Wild Bill.

403
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:14,422
They certainly don't
appear to be at odds.

404
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:26,687
What happened
to this little one

405
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,087
was the same
exact cocksucker.

406
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:34,038
Same as he was
pulling the strings

407
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,382
in your husband's fleecing
and gettin' him killed,

408
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:39,799
this Swearengen
operated the road agents

409
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:42,207
that done for this
little one's people.

410
00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:46,106
Oh, poor child.

411
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:49,755
To lose her family,
to see them slaughtered.

412
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,378
Very same cocksucker.

413
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,588
It's Bill.

414
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:02,876
You stole off on me.

415
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:05,913
I had to come in here
to look after the little one.

416
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:09,182
I thought she might
want me present.

417
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:13,469
Yes, l... I'm
very grateful.

418
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,392
Didn't happen to put one

419
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,334
right between the shithead's eyes,
now did ya, Bill?

420
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,617
Unless you need the money
right away,

421
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:25,625
I'd defer a decision
until someone honest

422
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,664
and competent
did a second reconnoiter.

423
00:30:28,706 --> 00:30:31,575
May I commission you?

424
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:34,999
Some question my fitness
on either count,

425
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,271
but I'll guarantee you
I'm not competent.

426
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,392
I do know
someone I trust to ask.

427
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,157
Please do.

428
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:45,852
Name's Bullock.

429
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,824
I'll go talk to him now.

430
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:54,143
How'd you leave it
with the cocksucker, Bill?

431
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:57,406
On terms
he'd understand.

432
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:05,535
Al, watchin' you
even at a distance

433
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,578
was a pleasure
and privilege.

434
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:12,513
If she don't come back to you
with an answer inside an hour,

435
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:13,974
you pay a call on her.

436
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:15,610
But Hickok's an ally,
am I right?

437
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:17,560
I mean if that wasn't
a damn ally leavin'

438
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:19,325
my eyes completely
deceived me.

439
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:21,272
- An hour, E.B.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,189
Pour me a drink.

441
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:32,023
And ask me the key
to a long life.

442
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:33,408
What is it?

443
00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:37,566
Most important human quality
for a person to reach old age?

444
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:39,610
I'll buy the drink
if you tell me.

445
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:44,153
Same as a dog
who keeps his nose.

446
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:49,598
Don't poke it
where it don't belong.

447
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:52,318
Wise words.

448
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:56,666
A lesson hard to come by,
but thoroughly learned.

449
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:01,149
Something else I know.

450
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,970
My knowing what I know

451
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:06,042
and somebody else
knowing it,

452
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:09,280
is two entirely
different things.

453
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:12,185
I'm near losing your trail,
Ellsworth.

454
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:19,228
Say somebody thought I saw
something I shouldn't have.

455
00:32:19,268 --> 00:32:22,301
- Whereabouts?
- On a ridge.

456
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,530
A man, pushed off
or whatever the hell else.

457
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:28,865
If it meant
my leaving camp

458
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,809
to prove I could
mind my own business,

459
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:34,048
it'd be a friend
who told me that...

460
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:37,693
instead of throwing me
to the pigs.

461
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:46,718
It's my whole philosophy
and outlook.

462
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,218
Make use of it
as you will.

463
00:32:57,285 --> 00:33:00,154
Well, well, if he...
if he was here

464
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:02,083
sealing an appearance
arrangement,

465
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:04,025
then I'm glad it was you
that tied him up, Al,

466
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:05,977
not that new
fucking operation,

467
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:08,671
what with them fancy signs
and cleaned-up women

468
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,074
where I heard he was
gambling all night.

469
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:13,530
We made no appearance
agreement.

470
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:15,644
Well, uh...

471
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:18,334
- you and... you and Hickok...
- No.

472
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,544
Oh, I see.

473
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,297
Well, I mean, because
his game at my place yesterday

474
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,307
was this far
from coming to lead.

475
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:27,683
Him and this droop-eyed
hoople-head.

476
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:29,026
And I had
to shut it down.

477
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:31,482
I mean, if that gives him
offense or umbrage,

478
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,564
well, I can't worry
about his plans

479
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,834
as far as where he decides
to gamble elsewhere,

480
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:39,552
or this new joint
overwhelms the camp.

481
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,628
We made no agreement.

482
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,254
What do you think
of the new joint?

483
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:45,885
Nice sign.

484
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:50,907
This far from
fucking gunplay.

485
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,758
Jack fuckin' high!

486
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:55,455
That's what I have.

487
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:58,657
I bet every
fuckin' cent.

488
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:02,140
Miracle to me is you sit here
bragging about it.

489
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:04,035
I ain't braggin',

490
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,491
or a braggart,
or a blowhard.

491
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,900
I state a fact,
I live by a fact...

492
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:11,203
Anyways, it's over.

493
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:14,434
Yeah, you believe that because
you're a walkin' fuckin' cunt!

494
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,496
With your cunt...
your eye movin'.

495
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:20,541
No matter how
your day's going, Jack,

496
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:22,272
you're always fun
to talk to.

497
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,935
Give me a buck
then, Lou.

498
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:27,290
Send me off
for a meal.

499
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,373
Give me a buck, see
what part of you gets shot

500
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,803
because l...

501
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,235
I possess a fuckin' gun
that I didn't bet.

502
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:39,037
I'll pay you $5 for that gun,
sight unseen.

503
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,787
'Cause what you need
is a stake to make your comeback.

504
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:46,171
That'll get you out of this
brown study you're in.

505
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:48,670
What'd you
take off of me?

506
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,295
The tag from
your new suit.

507
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,221
All right then.

508
00:34:53,254 --> 00:34:55,141
Name a price.

509
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:57,181
If it's close to fair,
I'll pay it.

510
00:34:57,223 --> 00:34:59,045
For the suit?

511
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:01,631
For your gun.

512
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:03,776
No, I believe not.

513
00:35:03,814 --> 00:35:06,115
I believe no.

514
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:11,717
He too is God's
handiwork.

515
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:21,340
Oh, double fucking
solitaire.

516
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:23,804
Where's your
fucking ballgowns?

517
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,886
Bring a bunch a chips
over here

518
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:28,032
and let's get
a poker game going!

519
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:32,798
I don't know
this camp.

520
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,693
I'd have to bring
someone from Montana.

521
00:35:34,728 --> 00:35:37,215
Would the widow
give it that much time?

522
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:38,565
Yeah, she would.

523
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,573
She don't wanna be
stupid or fooled.

524
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,524
Wants to stand up
for her husband

525
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,192
better than he stood up
for himself.

526
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:47,165
Not that she ought
to stick around.

527
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,793
Far as that goes,
she could sign a proxy.

528
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:51,719
There's her $100 in it.

529
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:55,047
And what that saloonkeeper
gave me if you'd wanna take it on.

530
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,535
All right.

531
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:02,462
I guess she's all right

532
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,318
till that saloonkeep decides
I can't be trusted

533
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:07,587
to betray her interests.

534
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,565
Trust ain't
his long suit.

535
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,779
She oughta be
lookin' for a wagon.

536
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:20,672
Thanks for the favor,
Montana.

537
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,857
Sure.

538
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:28,703
I like Ellsworth, too.

539
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:31,045
There's a difference
between talking a lot,

540
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,508
which Ellsworth
does enjoy,

541
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:34,406
and oversteppin'.

542
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,861
He don't get into
other people's business.

543
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,750
Then what are we
talkin' about, Dan?

544
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:43,139
Well, my own standards
as to who's reliable

545
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:45,063
ain't the same
as Al's.

546
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:48,774
So Ellsworth has to leave camp
over the difference?

547
00:36:48,808 --> 00:36:50,630
Yeah, he does if it's that
or kill him.

548
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:53,185
He said tell him
if those was the choices.

549
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:56,039
Don't you do it.

550
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,479
Which?

551
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,396
Either.

552
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,324
Asks a bribe for something
he never intends to do.

553
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,336
Takes my 150
then tells her not to sell.

554
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:16,798
Why are you so sure
he told her not to?

555
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:18,597
You went back there,
you knocked on her door.

556
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:23,422
She said Hickok reported
his conversation with you.

557
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:26,148
But she wasn't prepared yet
to give me an answer.

558
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:28,072
Does this make sense
to you, huh?

559
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:31,301
She pays Hickok
to come talk to me.

560
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:33,509
He goes back,
tells her to sell.

561
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:37,058
And then she says she needs more time
to make up her mind.

562
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:43,103
That idiot couldn't
put one in his ear.

563
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:44,803
If you're talking
about Tom Mason,

564
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:46,663
I'd say that's water
under the bridge.

565
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,153
I'd say Hickok has to die
if I have to kill him myself.

566
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:52,673
Jesus, Al.
With all that's going on?

567
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:55,267
How would it sit
with the widow, for one thing?

568
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:58,022
How would that
dispose her toward us?

569
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,708
Let me pose you a question,
E.B., you fuckin' cunt!

570
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,364
Someone comes at you,
what are you supposed to do about it?

571
00:38:03,402 --> 00:38:07,493
And I pose you a question back,
Al Swearengen!

572
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:10,976
If a friend, or at least
a professional colleague,

573
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:13,920
has a mistaken impression
of who's coming at him

574
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:16,995
and who isn't, what are you
supposed to do then, huh?!

575
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,705
You don't think
he's coming at me?

576
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:26,655
I don't think Hickok's
coming at ya, Al.

577
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:28,454
No, I don't.

578
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:31,393
I think you're a man
with so many different responsibilities

579
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,321
you sometimes
get feeling beset.

580
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,841
And in that frame of mind,
take things personal.

581
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:41,257
I'd sooner the cocksucker was dead.
Simplify working the widow.

582
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,810
We don't get to choose
the world we live in.

583
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,557
Bella Union cocksuckers
to worry about

584
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:49,317
and every other
damn thing.

585
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:51,242
Well, you got
a full plate.

586
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,413
I need to fuck
something.

587
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:56,197
Trixie!

588
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:01,925
Hey, hey, hey!

589
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:03,337
Get the bottle.

590
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,640
That's using
your old noggin, Al.

591
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:09,992
Get yourself
some relief.

592
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:12,296
Let the world
do its own spinnin'.

593
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:19,748
Don't be pointing
your fucking thumb for me.

594
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:21,761
Me and you done
talked that subject out.

595
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:30,914
What's new, Dan?

596
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:33,158
Nothing.

597
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:34,820
No news at all?

598
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:39,234
If I had somethin' to tell you,
one way or another,

599
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,381
I'd tell it to you.

600
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:45,063
Well then I reckon
I'll have another drink.

601
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,617
Who is it?

602
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,034
It's Joanie.

603
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,791
Wait a second, honey.

604
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:04,550
Give me just
a second.

605
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:19,303
I fell asleep.

606
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,461
I broke up
three catfights, Andy.

607
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,288
Girls wanting
to give you a bath.

608
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:29,218
I fell right the hell
to sleep.

609
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,194
You ready to meet
some strange?

610
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:34,341
Tell you the truth,
Joanie, I'm...

611
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,746
feelin' outta sorts.

612
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:40,228
Well, you had
a long trip.

613
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:43,584
And I've heard
worse confessions.

614
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:45,451
That's the gospel truth.

615
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,939
Which I hope
you'll keep to yourself.

616
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:49,988
Yeah, sure I will, Andy.

617
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:54,761
I feel fucking
unwell to myself.

618
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:57,218
Won't you lie back
and let me get your boots off?

619
00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:59,203
I don't think you should
touch me, honey.

620
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:02,725
That's the gospel
on that score.

621
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,870
No girl in the world
ever got sick

622
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,883
pulling off a pair of boots,
Andy.

623
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,194
But if you want,

624
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,400
I won't take more liberties.

625
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:15,878
$50 an issue.

626
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,567
Well, uh, frankly, sir,

627
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:21,255
that-that would purchase
your advertisement an amount

628
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:24,163
of space wildly incommensurate
with the accompanying articles.

629
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:27,521
See? I never heard
that word in my life.

630
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:30,150
That's his trade, Cy,
he's a wordsmith.

631
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:34,147
Do you shoot craps,
Mr. Merrick?

632
00:41:34,189 --> 00:41:36,076
Excuse me?

633
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:38,629
Oh, oh, oh no!

634
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,801
Ah, no, I haven't shot
the craps in sometime.

635
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:43,463
Perhaps never?

636
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,219
If you'll keep
my secret, sir.

637
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,293
No, I've never
shot them.

638
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:52,547
Maybe that would
make an article:

639
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,589
A man learns
to shoot the craps.

640
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,280
Well, we're agreed
on $50 an issue.

641
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:00,390
Have we
actually agreed?

642
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,277
I feel almost duty-bound
to remonstrate you, sir.

643
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,349
Three months
in advance, Eddie.

644
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,851
$50 an issue.

645
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:08,519
Let's see the man
with the cash.

646
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,046
Seriously?

647
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:13,224
Don't let him take your money,
Mr. Merrick,

648
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:15,847
while he's teaching you
this game.

649
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,504
Who did you give
to Andy?

650
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,356
Nobody.
He's poorly.

651
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,107
Does he need
a doctor?

652
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:29,997
Maybe he does.

653
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,193
God damn it!

654
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:36,264
I told you I didn't like
the way he looked!

655
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,056
Stand outside room eight,
no one in or out.

656
00:42:42,094 --> 00:42:45,574
Get the doc.
Tell him... someone fell.

657
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:50,317
I told you.

658
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,835
Thank you
for your help.

659
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,718
I'll look forward
to Mr. Bullock contacting me.

660
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,387
May I ask, ma'am,

661
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:02,732
when you'd expect
to leave the camp?

662
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,966
I'm not certain.

663
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,388
Bullock is honorable.

664
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:10,569
You can trust him
to see to your interests.

665
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:13,160
He couldn't come more
highly recommended.

666
00:43:14,703 --> 00:43:18,980
You know the sound
of thunder, don't you?

667
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:22,567
Of course.

668
00:43:22,608 --> 00:43:26,088
Can you imagine that sound
if I ask you to?

669
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,549
I can, Mr. Hickok.

670
00:43:29,968 --> 00:43:32,269
Your husband and me
had this talk.

671
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:37,006
And I told him to head home
to avoid a dark result.

672
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:41,034
But I didn't say it
in thunder.

673
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,814
Ma'am...

674
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:48,262
listen to the thunder.

675
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,956
Very good luck to you.

676
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:09,839
Thank you for all your help,
Mr. Hickok.

677
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:35,436
- Thanks for coming, Doc.
- The boy said someone fell?

678
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,064
Room eight.

679
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,616
It's Jane, Bill.

680
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,503
Come ahead.

681
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,094
This little one's
cool as a cucumber.

682
00:44:57,137 --> 00:44:59,046
Is that so?

683
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,171
Feel this little one's
forehead.

684
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:13,129
Fever and you parted ways,
young lady.

685
00:45:16,786 --> 00:45:18,924
Did she just asked
to borrow money?

686
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:26,319
Anyways, how'd it go
with Bullock?

687
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:28,011
He'll help the widow.

688
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,530
Good for him.
Good for you.

689
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:35,847
- Did you tell her so?
- Hmm.

690
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,956
You think
she'd want company?

691
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:41,001
I'll bet
she'd enjoy yours.

692
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,912
Maybe she'd enjoy...

693
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,677
feelin' the little one's
forehead.

694
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:51,311
You're probably enjoying
your damn privacy

695
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:54,029
with Charlie headed
for Cheyenne.

696
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:56,204
I'm writing my wife.

697
00:45:58,066 --> 00:46:00,302
Why didn't you say
something, damn you!

698
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:02,280
I owe you a penny.

699
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,122
So long, Jane.

700
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,072
So long, Bill.

701
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:05,672
All right,
breathe big breaths.

702
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:08,907
Oh, my back!

703
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:11,216
Oh, my aching back.

704
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:13,869
I'm gonna get you
something to ease that.

705
00:47:13,908 --> 00:47:16,177
What's he got, Doc?

706
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,953
I guess it's his back

707
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:22,573
is what he landed on
when he fell.

708
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:24,335
My back is sweating
and broken.

709
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,062
I don't know
what he landed on.

710
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,205
Wait, who said
he fell?

711
00:47:29,491 --> 00:47:31,530
Course, if little
pussy sores

712
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:34,867
rise up on his trunk
and his face,

713
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,787
more likely
he's got other trouble.

714
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,235
- Oh, give me a game. How I ache.
- Okay, Andy.

715
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:41,934
I'm gonna give you
somethin' to ease that.

716
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:44,306
You lost your friend
in the fire.

717
00:48:00,884 --> 00:48:03,087
Hey!
Hey, Winkie!

718
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,335
Hey, wait a minute.

719
00:48:04,372 --> 00:48:07,186
Does that look
American to you?

720
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,911
No, this ain't.

721
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:12,300
People don't eat
this shit!

722
00:48:14,612 --> 00:48:16,783
It touched...

723
00:48:29,877 --> 00:48:32,146
Meow, meow.

724
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:41,805
Aw hell.

725
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:00,816
Boys.

726
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,892
Howdy, Bill.

727
00:49:24,854 --> 00:49:27,025
My father was
the best company.

728
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:29,712
From the time
I was ever so little.

729
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,692
Problems or...

730
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:35,050
difficulties or even
sadness, no such thing.

731
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:38,029
Not permitted.

732
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:41,168
The evening I was
presented to society

733
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:43,694
I found out later
he'd been able to attend

734
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:48,852
only by physically fleeing
some dismal legal difficulty.

735
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:51,669
In that sense,
my marriage to Mr. Garret

736
00:49:51,703 --> 00:49:55,663
was a tremendous solution.
Tremendous.

737
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,061
At the ceremony I remember
father whispered to me,

738
00:50:02,103 --> 00:50:04,469
"Darling...

739
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:08,365
I can never repay you
for what you are about to do

740
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:11,439
but I can repay
everyone else."

741
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:16,496
And he said,
"To think of you, with him,

742
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:19,403
in that godforsaken place

743
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:22,513
is almost unbearable."

744
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,885
Meaning your husband?

745
00:50:26,295 --> 00:50:30,670
And I said,
"Maybe he'll die."

746
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,290
Take that,
God damn you!

747
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:05,807
Hang the bastard!

748
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:23,695
What happened?

749
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,705
He shot
Wild Bill Hickok.

750
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,454
Hey yah!

751
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,407
Do you see that?

752
00:55:04,028 --> 00:55:05,816
? Life feels so empty ?

753
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:08,754
? You feel all alone ?

754
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:15,704
? How did I wander ?

755
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,806
? So far from my home? ?

756
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,173
? These thoughts
run through me ?

757
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:27,765
? Stolen my faith ?

758
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,579
? Please help me,
my Father ?

759
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,002
? For I've fallen
from grace. ?
