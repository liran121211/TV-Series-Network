1
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,570
You might, Dan,

2
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,264
want to learn
how to indicate interest in a girl

3
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,268
other than murdering
another person.

4
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,053
I apologize
for the disruption

5
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:58,804
and the free drinks
you had to give out restoring order.

6
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:01,839
Jesus Christ,
it's false dawn, Al.

7
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,439
False dawn already.

8
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,057
If we're gonna act,
we should do it in darkness.

9
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:08,438
Where's the fucking whore?

10
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:11,320
Wherever Trixie is,
we know what we need to.

11
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:13,656
Bullock's four square
behind the New York woman.

12
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,576
The question's
do we act?

13
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,977
And to me,
the course is clear.

14
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:19,472
Well, what's the course?

15
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,457
Murder them
where they sleep!

16
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:24,346
The New York woman
and Bullock both.

17
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,275
Dan, loan E.B. Your knife.

18
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,777
Nah, I won't
brandish the knife,

19
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,689
but I'll wield a passkey
at the widow's door.

20
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,602
As for Bullock, he sleeps
on his store's second floor,

21
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:37,817
and I'll steady a ladder,
Dan, at that wall,

22
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:39,676
while you climb up
and bushwhack him.

23
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,210
Then, with them dead
and disposed of,

24
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:47,572
we forge a predated bill of sale,
take possession of the claim

25
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:50,136
with the allocated
percentages of ownership

26
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:52,762
previously agreed to in
our internal discussions,

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,029
and don't spend a fucking
dollar in the process.

28
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,174
Bold?

29
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,610
I suppose.

30
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,650
But when boldness
is called for,

31
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,317
bold men
do not shrink.

32
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,778
That's what the B in E.B. Farnum
stands for.

33
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,537
- Bold.
- You're goddamn right.

34
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:14,946
Say it, Al.

35
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,698
Say the fucking words
my bones already know.

36
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,122
You're gonna back off
on that fucking claim.

37
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:31,365
We brung it, sir. Vaccine
for the smallpox, secured in Cheyenne.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,230
Well done, fellas, and congratulations
on the entire fucking settlement.

39
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:38,119
E.B., get downstairs
and give these heroes what they're owed.

40
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:40,836
- Yes, sir. $50 a man.
- If you don't spend it in my joint,

41
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:43,044
I'll turn the mourning
over to weeping.

42
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,732
You won't shed nary a tear
on our account, Mr. Swearengen.

43
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,842
Vaccine to Doc Cochran
in the pest tent.

44
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:51,198
We'll be toasting the treaty, too,
with the fucking heathens.

45
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,348
- Explain yourself.
- They've all been

46
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:55,810
called back to the agency.
We heard that in Cheyenne.

47
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:59,016
- Are they going's the fucking question.
- Fuck yeah, they are.

48
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,027
That's the word
in Cheyenne.

49
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,720
Red Cloud and Spotted Tail
are leading their people in.

50
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:07,303
Dan, $10 in bonus credits
across the board for these heroes.

51
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:10,124
10 in pussy, 10 in faro,
10 in booze.

52
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,842
God bless you,
Mr. Swearengen!

53
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,667
Well, not likely,

54
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,973
but my short-term prospects
just improved.

55
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,172
Say the words, so I can
let the dream die.

56
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,216
E.B., did you not hear
the fucking news?

57
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,264
Did you not listen
to the fucking news?

58
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,444
That plague's end's
in prospect.

59
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:29,515
And so's peace with the fucking
dirt worshippers.

60
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,808
Come here,
come here.

61
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,088
Sit down.

62
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,127
The dam...

63
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:39,919
has broken,
young man,

64
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:43,055
and only ourselves
can fuck up,

65
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,329
for we are about to be
swimming in money.

66
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,437
And how could
we fuck up?

67
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:50,739
By engaging in open
fucking bloodletting.

68
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,879
And right here at hand
in our very hour of need

69
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,570
is the priggish fucking
douche bag, Bullock,

70
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:57,330
who only wants
to sell pots and pans,

71
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,538
fan his pretty face
and hold his nose

72
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:02,129
from the stench of our sordid
carryings on over here,

73
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,234
all the time thinking he can protect
the meek and innocent.

74
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:08,088
The perfect
fucking front man.

75
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,193
And you want
to kill him?

76
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,656
Much as we might want
the widow's claim,

77
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,349
it's a luxury
now to forego.

78
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:19,097
E.B., find yourself
somewhere to lie down

79
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:20,822
till the feeling
passes, huh?

80
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,856
First, I'll go give
the hoople heads their money.

81
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,201
Thank you.

82
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:35,446
You go find
that fucking whore.

83
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,746
What the fuck
is this, huh?

84
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,976
I lost my voice.

85
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:50,166
- What happened?
- I seen something bad.

86
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,900
Come in.

87
00:05:58,466 --> 00:05:59,873
Here, sit down.

88
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,582
I seen something at the place
my brother works.

89
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:07,231
A man was stabbed and killed
right in front of me.

90
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,537
One man said he didn't like
the way the other man

91
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,875
was looking at me, and he
stabbed and killed him.

92
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,188
Drink this.

93
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,533
Where's your brother now?

94
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:31,485
We got a room.

95
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,621
I'll go in a minute.

96
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,607
It's all right, Flora.

97
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:41,761
I've just come to say
I don't know if I can do this.

98
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,689
It's horrible.

99
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:45,510
It's one thing
leads to another

100
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,969
and you never know
when it's gonna happen.

101
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,083
Mostly you can steer it,
sweetheart,

102
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,545
and when it's gonna get
to where you can't,

103
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:55,370
you get just a little notice,
just a couple of seconds

104
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,794
before the one thing
turns into the other.

105
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:01,220
It's like a funny smell
comes into the air,

106
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,848
then you know there's
no more steering

107
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:05,795
and get the hell
out of the way.

108
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,677
I smelled it in the saloon.

109
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,239
And did you get out
of the way in time?

110
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,591
It's all right.
It's all right.

111
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:22,379
Miles doesn't know nothing.

112
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,272
He didn't smell nothing
and he...

113
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:26,094
didn't know nothing
about what to do.

114
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,781
All right, I know.

115
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:32,497
Can I stay?

116
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:36,459
Can I sleep here with you just this last
little while before we have to get up?

117
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,988
Yeah, you can sleep
here with me.

118
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,462
Can you help?

119
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,493
- Name?
- Boland.

120
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,735
Make your mark.

121
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,527
Saint Andy Cramed.

122
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,874
All that's missing are
the scourges and flays.

123
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,969
Maybe they're
under his shirt.

124
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:27,109
Kind of you to let us work out
of the horseshit and flies.

125
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,605
Sure.

126
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,663
Jesus Christ!

127
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,416
Have you seen Trixie, Doc?

128
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:51,427
What?

129
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,202
Trixie.

130
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,501
No, tea and honey.

131
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:04,677
- For this?
- You are a stupid son of a bitch.

132
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,501
Yeah, the traffic's
a boon, Seth.

133
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:11,081
We're up $27 already
from yesterday's entire proceeds.

134
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,581
Good.

135
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:15,631
Pitiful specimen you are.

136
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:19,567
It wasn't a pinprick.
I ain't ate.

137
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,634
Really? Strange you
never keeled over

138
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,616
when we was hungry
on the fucking trail.

139
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:30,346
Your boss speak to you about sending
me an assayer this morning?

140
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:32,690
No, sir, he didn't.

141
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:35,723
I will remind him

142
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,804
once I finish his errands.

143
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,049
I only got one place
left to look:

144
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,354
Bella Union...
that's our competition.

145
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,804
Well, I'll tell him
what you said.

146
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,179
Good morning.

147
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,492
Good morning, Mr. Bullock.

148
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,862
Come to have
the child inoculated?

149
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,751
Yes, and to tell you,

150
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:00,567
for reasons we needn't explore,
that my plans have changed.

151
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,219
As soon as I can
arrange transportation

152
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,745
I'll return with the child
to New York City.

153
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,885
Why needn't we
explore your reasons?

154
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,744
Because, Mr. Bullock,
I've already

155
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:13,331
quite sufficiently
imposed upon you

156
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,159
my private reasons
and facts.

157
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:21,370
As regards to the claim my husband
purchased before his murder,

158
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,575
I'm inclined to accept
the last bid

159
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,304
from Mr. Swearengen's
hand-puppet

160
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:28,472
and I would be very grateful if you
would tell Mr. Farnum so,

161
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,615
as speaking to him
directly makes me ill.

162
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,978
I'm gonna assay your claim,
Mrs. Garret.

163
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,568
I promised Mr. Hickok,
and I promised you.

164
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:39,095
I released you from your promise
to me yesterday.

165
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,470
And today I instruct you
not to keep it.

166
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:42,933
You do tend
to change your mind,

167
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:46,205
and the first promise,
you weren't a party to.

168
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,033
Why don't you get the child inoculated?
I'll go about my business,

169
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:54,107
and we'll revisit
the whole mess subsequently.

170
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:01,760
Don't fucking lead
Ellsworth right to it

171
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:04,251
so he can hoot and holler
and hail fucking Bullock.

172
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,234
You walk around.

173
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:08,830
You're discouraged.

174
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,802
It's not even worth it
to make the steep ascent.

175
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:14,332
I start from below?

176
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,119
You start
at the fucking creek.

177
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,882
What, do you want
to start at the cliff?

178
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,788
The three of you
leap the fuck off holding hands?

179
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,212
Top o' the mornin'.

180
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm to lead you
to the Widow Garret's claim.

181
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:33,572
- You're the assayer?
- Nope.

182
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:37,439
- I'm to take you to him.
- He's one claim over.

183
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:39,108
Nice fucking guy

184
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:41,318
and a dead eye
for the fucking color.

185
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:43,111
- Ellsworth.
- Ellsworth...

186
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:45,319
is absolutely right.

187
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:46,883
Well, come on.

188
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,698
I was inoculated
some time ago,

189
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,636
but I thought she should
be treated before our trip.

190
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,646
I am delighted
you're taking her with you.

191
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,596
It was Trixie
who made me realize

192
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,680
that my reasons
for staying weren't sound.

193
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,989
Glad she succeeded
where I failed.

194
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,544
I intend to write her
a note of profound thanks.

195
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,243
I hope that you'll
deliver it to her

196
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,710
at Mr. Swearengen's
saloon.

197
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,437
Is that where she went
when she left you?

198
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:22,092
Yes, I certainly
assume so.

199
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:30,543
Sorry, I'm sorry, honey.
It's all over.

200
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,160
When will you
be leavin'?

201
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:36,465
As quickly
as is practical.

202
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,705
Mr Utter can see to your
travel arrangements.

203
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,523
Soon as he gets his wits back,
I'll send him to you.

204
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,314
Thank you, Doctor.

205
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,093
Thank you
for everything.

206
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,616
What did she say
about Trixie?

207
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,480
Nothin'.

208
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,855
How'd you do
with that bloodstain?

209
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,608
I scrubbed it real hard.

210
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,353
Did I ask you how hard
you fuckin' scrubbed?

211
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,795
- No.
- No.

212
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:20,123
I asked
if you got it out.

213
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:27,004
Get me the fuckin'
scrub brush.

214
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:30,038
Every fuckin' thing
I gotta do myself, huh?

215
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,665
- Where is she?!
- Trixie?

216
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,191
No, Queen fuckin' Victoria.

217
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:38,494
Last I saw her was yesterday
when she came to see you.

218
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,503
Just get me
the fuckin' scrub brush.

219
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,781
Gives her word
she'll return.

220
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,126
Where the fuck
is she, huh?

221
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:49,271
What'd she say to you
when you saw her?

222
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,648
She said her pussy hurt
where you grabbed it.

223
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,821
That has a ring
of fuckin' truth.

224
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,866
She said you
nearly killed her.

225
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:57,915
She said to me
she'd be right back.

226
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,375
A fool's
fucking errand, anyway.

227
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,355
I found out what
I needed to know

228
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:05,818
when I looked in that cocksucker
Bullock's eyes

229
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,618
while Dority
was spilling blood

230
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,653
that you have failed
to adequately clean up.

231
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:12,287
You want me
to do some more?

232
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,115
No, shut the fuck up.

233
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,635
Now, what's she doin'?

234
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,493
She makin' a point?

235
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,764
No grabbing at the cunt?

236
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,655
- Is that what she said to you?
- No.

237
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,209
I mean, y-you... she told you, right,
that I grabbed her?

238
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:27,809
Did she have
an attitude about it?

239
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:30,566
She didn't have an attitude.
She just said her pussy hurt.

240
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,424
Agh.

241
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,367
Point's made with
the snatch grabs, okay.

242
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:39,426
50 other fucking things
I should be paying attention to,

243
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,737
rosiest prospects
of my career,

244
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:44,936
and here I am on
my fucking hands and knees

245
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:47,340
discussing snippets
of information with a gimp.

246
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,682
There!

247
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,914
Now that's how you scrub
a fucking bloodstain!

248
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,631
I couldn't find Trixie.

249
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,251
You see her,

250
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:58,920
you send her
the fuck back to me,

251
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,366
'cause if I
see her outside,

252
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,254
she'll wish I had
killed her before.

253
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,807
That shot didn't hurt
too bad, Al,

254
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,506
but it fuckin' itches.

255
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,486
Yeah? Good.

256
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:11,016
You had your
shot yet, kid?

257
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,517
Not yet.
The line was too long,

258
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,449
and I did not want
to be late for work.

259
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:17,264
Open for business
and talk like him

260
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:20,145
- until further instructed.
- Yes, sir.

261
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,317
Aw, Jesus.

262
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,931
Trixie?

263
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,965
God damn it, Trixie,
wake up.

264
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,243
Wake up, Trixie.

265
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,669
- Trixie, wake up...
- Doc! Doc!

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,301
- What?!
- Doc!

267
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,377
- Stay the fuck over there!
- It's A.W., Doc.

268
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:58,800
Stay the fuck
over there, anyway.

269
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,973
Aw, I don't take your
bad temper personally, Doc.

270
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,312
The hours you're working
would try a saint.

271
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:05,808
What do you want?

272
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:08,982
I'm in pain, Doc,
in the small of my back,

273
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:12,248
which I'm aware is
a precursor symptom.

274
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:14,139
- When did the pain start?
- Am I warm?

275
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,082
Answer the question.

276
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,737
Well, it's become more
concentrated and severe.

277
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:24,277
- Why did you strike me?
- To secure your attention.

278
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,293
When did the pain start?

279
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:29,182
The original pain
I've lived with for quite some time,

280
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,589
but in this last period,

281
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,169
it's become much more
concentrated and severe.

282
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,990
In viewing the context
of this outbreak,

283
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:39,031
I knew I should
consult you.

284
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,861
- Ow.
- Well, you don't have a fever.

285
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:42,271
- I don't?
- No.

286
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:43,833
You put on weight?

287
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,453
May I ask
that query's relevance?

288
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,752
It's harder on your back
as you get fatter.

289
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:55,515
So, in concert
with the symptoms

290
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,411
I'm already exhibiting,

291
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,641
you'd say be alert
for fever?

292
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:02,781
And work hard
on your paper.

293
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,992
- And get yourself inoculated.
- Uh-huh.

294
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,752
And try to eat less.

295
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:20,192
You botched
this job pretty good,

296
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,857
didn't you, young lady?

297
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,808
Now you listen to me,
if you want,

298
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:36,421
I will do the job
for you right.

299
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,663
But first, I want you
to know that

300
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,522
that rich woman
is leaving town,

301
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,622
and she told me that she would
take you with her.

302
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,508
I know that you thought
enough of that woman

303
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,777
to help her
get off this... stuff

304
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:51,531
you tried to use
to kill yourself with.

305
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,949
But what I don't know is,
is if you wanted to die, period,

306
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,511
or 'cause you thought
you didn't have a way out of here,

307
00:18:57,551 --> 00:19:01,064
'cause you do
have a way out.

308
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:08,107
Is that a vote
for New York City?

309
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:12,523
All right, then.

310
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,707
Morning, Mr. Tolliver.

311
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,398
Good morning, Flora.

312
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,497
I swear I saw you leave
last night after your shift.

313
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,908
I come back.

314
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:26,073
A man was murdered where my brother
works, at The Gem Saloon,

315
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,533
- and I got scared.
- You saw it, honey?

316
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,445
Yes, sir.
I was there picking my brother up.

317
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:34,423
You're brave to even be
in a joint like that.

318
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:40,480
And after,

319
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,618
you sought refuge
with Joanie, did you?

320
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,855
- Yes, sir.
- No better port in a storm.

321
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:50,077
- Anyways, I'll go change.
- Good girl. Good for you.

322
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:55,195
- You settle in real good, Flora.
- Thank you, sir.

323
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:02,239
Mm-mmm,
Joanie Stubbs.

324
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:04,831
Is that a fresh scalp
I see hangin' from your belt?

325
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,331
She saw a gutting
last night.

326
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,310
She was upset.
I held her.

327
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,198
I was watching for you
at the door, Flora,

328
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:14,720
but here you are
already inside.

329
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,287
Not working yet,
Terrance.

330
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:18,116
Poor thing.

331
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,120
Adjusting so smooth
to losing her cherry

332
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,779
and yet that upset
by blood.

333
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:26,600
She lost her cherry back home.
I told you that.

334
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,292
Gonna put your garters
on now?

335
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:46,374
I'll give you $2 for that apple
and a piece of cheese.

336
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,910
It's my knife.
You want to buy that?

337
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:53,195
I've got a fucking knife.

338
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:04,391
I'll just be a second
and take my brother his lunch.

339
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:05,894
Sure, honey.

340
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,540
Unless she ain't
upset at all.

341
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,762
What happened now,
Flora?

342
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:31,212
I thought you was changin'
into your garters.

343
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:33,010
You geek-looking fuck.

344
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,948
Get away from me before
I cut your fucking heart out.

345
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:51,698
It's Dr. Cochran.

346
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,408
Doctor.

347
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:02,613
Trixie tried to commit suicide
with laudanum.

348
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:06,100
- My God.
- She punctured her vein.

349
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,922
That's the only reason
why she's still alive.

350
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,733
Who's with her?

351
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,596
No one at the goddamn moment
is with her, Mrs. Garret.

352
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,088
Her situation in this camp isn't such
that that would be safe.

353
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:31,063
Which is why, while
trying to dissuade her

354
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,374
from future efforts
at murdering herself,

355
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:36,508
I told a fib,

356
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:39,512
invoking your name
and willingness

357
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:41,529
to take her with you
on your trip.

358
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,415
Last night, Doctor,

359
00:23:44,451 --> 00:23:46,360
I made that very offer
to Trixie.

360
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,897
She refused.

361
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,671
More precisely,

362
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,905
I offered to send
Trixie to New York

363
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,494
with the child
to make the appropriate

364
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,126
introductions
to my family,

365
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,654
and to pay
to see them established.

366
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:05,029
Is it possible,
Mrs. Garret,

367
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:08,609
that leaving this camp
and heading to New York City

368
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,778
in service to you
and the child might,

369
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:16,257
to a girl like Trixie,
appear a more realistic proposition

370
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:20,574
than being dispatched
on some cruel masquerade?

371
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,970
Please tell her
she's welcome.

372
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:30,887
Tell her she's necessary.

373
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,402
If her indisposition
doesn't preclude it,

374
00:24:34,444 --> 00:24:36,451
I'd be happy
to tell her myself.

375
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:38,694
Thank you, madam.

376
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,963
If I'm to get
my throat cut, Dan,

377
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:21,036
I'd rather not
exert myself further.

378
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,243
If I have any choice
in the matter,

379
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:25,738
I'd prefer one
behind the ear.

380
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:28,171
Keep climbing, Ellsworth.

381
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:31,213
You're off the hook for seeing
that New York dude's accident.

382
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:37,105
When Swearengen
was moved to trust,

383
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,184
I know you spoke
for me hard.

384
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:41,428
Well, I didn't...
didn't speak against you.

385
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:46,127
You might try takin'
a gander over to your right.

386
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,951
You don't have to tell me
where to fucking look.

387
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:51,668
If you're
the goddamn assayer,

388
00:25:51,706 --> 00:25:53,910
shouldn't I be
following you?

389
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,161
Head on back down,
Mr. Bullock.

390
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:00,985
We think we found
a formation worth looking at.

391
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:11,793
Young lady,
thank Christ.

392
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,259
I'd feared after the murder
you'd shun us.

393
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:15,578
I come for lunch
with Miles.

394
00:26:15,614 --> 00:26:17,818
Well, bless you then
for being a caring sister.

395
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,927
- Miles!
- Sir?

396
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,033
Miles, you lucky son of a bitch,
your sister's here with your lunch.

397
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:24,632
She brought you
a fresh apple

398
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,974
and some kind of delicacy
wrapped in swaddling.

399
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:32,762
I've been scrubbing that bloodstain
all mornin', and the cripple has too.

400
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:36,314
Situate your sister to spare her
to stand at that fucking stain, huh?

401
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,882
- Let's do it.
- Now?

402
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:48,412
- Now, and get the fuck outta here.
- What if...

403
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:50,361
Flora, if we do
it slow and right,

404
00:26:50,404 --> 00:26:51,997
we're 50 miles gone
before anyone knows we blew.

405
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:53,564
My boss is onto me.

406
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:56,420
Savvy operator from Chicago
and you could tell he's on to you?

407
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,046
Savvy enough
that he didn't crack,

408
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,711
and I still
could fuckin' tell.

409
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:06,691
You're full of shit.
You want to do it fast and dirty

410
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,483
so you have to cut
somebody's throat.

411
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:20,321
- This joint you want to take?
- Where I work.

412
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:23,428
- Where your boss is onto you?
- I can move the dyke.

413
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:28,902
Held me in her arms all night
like I was a little fucking kid.

414
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,329
Can I assume
there's a fucking plan?

415
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:46,472
Mr. Bullock, what ho?

416
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:47,940
Mrs. Garret's room.

417
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,771
Number two.

418
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,792
Don't sell,
Mrs. Garret.

419
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,649
Darling...

420
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:29,232
um, I'm going
to be unspeakably rude

421
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:31,213
and leave you here alone
for just a moment,

422
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:33,141
while I go downstairs
with Mr. Bullock,

423
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:35,509
who's just arrived
with the most interesting news,

424
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,747
and whom l... I can't
receive here in my room,

425
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,693
particularly
with you present,

426
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:42,225
for reasons too boring
and complex to explain.

427
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:46,705
So I'm going to go downstairs
to speak with Mr. Bullock

428
00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:48,633
in Mr. Farnum's
absurd restaurant,

429
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,193
then I'll come back up

430
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:53,103
and we will continue to ready
our leaving. All right, darling?

431
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:58,329
I'll be in the restaurant
for just one moment.

432
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:00,786
Can I bring you
a glass of milk?

433
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:04,025
All right.

434
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,165
I'll... I'll be right back.

435
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:19,448
May I inquire
as to the assay's outcome?

436
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,041
- Ask the owner.
- Mrs. Garret?

437
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,698
Is the technical term
"bonanza"?

438
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:26,197
That's the look of it.

439
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,833
It's a bonanza,
Mr. Farnum.

440
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:33,782
I see.
Congratulations.

441
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:41,756
Does the find change your mind
at all about New York City?

442
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:47,074
I can't see
why it would.

443
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:49,694
I can't, either,
but I don't count.

444
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:52,318
Of course you count.
Why wouldn't you?

445
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,706
'Cause your changes of mind
come so quick and often,

446
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,059
I can't keep up.

447
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:59,844
I can't understand what changed
your mind from yesterday

448
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,635
when it was made up
to stay.

449
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:05,440
I was made to understand
last night that my reasons

450
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,262
for wanting to stay
have been completely selfish.

451
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,532
- By who?
- Trixie.

452
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:14,214
I'd offered to send her
to New York City with the child,

453
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,420
where Trixie,
I've since come to realize,

454
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,913
would be completely unsuited.

455
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:23,144
And because I wished
to stay here unencumbered

456
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,336
when I should be caring
for the child.

457
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,281
Why can't you
care for her here?

458
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:33,953
Where the fuck is he?

459
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,932
Said he was gonna go tell
the widow of her find.

460
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:39,178
How the fuck long
does it take to tell her?

461
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,286
I don't know, Al,
I'm here with you.

462
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,715
- Are you getting smart with me now?
- No.

463
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,442
Cocksucker Bullock.

464
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,367
When you can't stand
the sight of him,

465
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,636
he's nowhere
but underfoot.

466
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:53,094
Sir, my sister
was told of a man

467
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:55,625
who resembles our father's photograph
down by Lead,

468
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:57,487
and I'd be grateful
if this afternoon

469
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,336
I could go look and maybe I could take
a night shift to make up.

470
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,831
If I said no,

471
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:05,103
I'd hope you'd walk out
and go looking anyway,

472
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:07,953
then seek a new job
elsewhere after.

473
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:09,296
That is what I'd do, sir.

474
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:12,779
All right, kid.
Go look for him.

475
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,795
Tell Arnette
at the livery stable

476
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:16,908
I'll stand metal
for the horse.

477
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:20,146
If your sister looks with you,
tell Arnette I'm good for her mount.

478
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:23,344
So you think
it's a good idea to go?

479
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,389
It's why the fuck
you're here, isn't it?

480
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,186
Right.

481
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:29,808
I'm gonna go get
the horses then.

482
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:32,659
Permission to leave
the bar, trooper.

483
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,414
Thanks, to both of you.

484
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:45,271
Ah, struck rich
for the widow, huh, Bullock?

485
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,712
Free drink!

486
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:54,003
Big, huh?

487
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:57,620
Rich and fucking thick,
that vein is?

488
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,799
Not being expert,
I can't guess at the extent.

489
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,112
Dan's a fucking expert.

490
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,385
When he's not shit-faced drunk,
so is Ellsworth.

491
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,657
The immediate result
is she won't be sellin'.

492
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,602
Of course,
she fucking won't.

493
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:09,849
I should fucking
think not, huh?

494
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,090
Not for any $20,000
at least.

495
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:17,117
Come here. Come drink
with your vanquished foe.

496
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,462
Very good of you
and Mr. Star, incidentally,

497
00:32:22,497 --> 00:32:25,759
to make your venue available
so the hoople heads can get vaccinated.

498
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:28,281
I was the second
hoople head stuck.

499
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,557
Them riders
that brought the vaccine,

500
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:33,016
say the heathens
have been called back to the agency.

501
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,847
In a spasm of good sense,
they're fuckin' going.

502
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:36,311
I heard.

503
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:41,273
Before you know it, we'll have laws here
and every other thing.

504
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:44,185
Yeah, which brings me, Bullock,
to the matter of the widow.

505
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:48,385
I wanted to show you
my bona fides for cooperation.

506
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:52,099
If a treaty is signed,
be wise for you and me

507
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:53,727
to paddle
in the same direction.

508
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:57,028
Tics or habits of behavior
either finds dislikable in the other

509
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:59,430
gotta be overlooked
or taken with a grain of salt.

510
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:02,911
Would your bona fides extend
to Mrs. Garret's future safety?

511
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,972
My oath on this:

512
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,457
Every day that the widow sits
on her ass in New York City,

513
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:13,668
looks west at sunset
and thinks to herself,

514
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:16,324
"God bless you ignorant
cocksuckers in Deadwood,

515
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,468
who strive mightily
and at little money

516
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,961
to add to my
ever-increasing fortune,"

517
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:23,174
she'll be safe
from the wiles of Al Swearengen.

518
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,640
She's stayin'.

519
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,987
The oath stands
as a gesture to you.

520
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:34,792
- Can I take a shave over here?
- Please.

521
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:43,111
Barney, be careful in the area
of the throat, huh?

522
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:48,907
If you authorized an offer
of 20 on the widow's claim...

523
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,201
your agent was looking
to skim a little cream.

524
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:55,721
- How high did E.B. Go?
- $19,500.

525
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,490
I wouldn't trust a man
that wouldn't try to steal a little.

526
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,995
Where's that fucking whore?

527
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:29,582
You stay here, sweetheart.

528
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:51,186
I'm so very sorry...

529
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:53,747
for any part that I may
have played in this.

530
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:58,198
I don't remember
you being the one

531
00:34:58,237 --> 00:35:00,059
that made me a whore,
Mrs. Garret.

532
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:06,617
I'm going to stay in the camp
with the child, Trixie.

533
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,999
Dr. Cochran explained
to me the difficulties

534
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,079
your extraordinary
kindness toward me

535
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,323
has put you in, in relationship
to Mr. Swearengen.

536
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,953
If you wish to stay,

537
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:20,440
I'd be so grateful
if you'd stay with us.

538
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:27,067
But perhaps you
want to go, Trixie.

539
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,210
If you do...

540
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,510
take this.

541
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:37,624
As your earnest claim
on the future.

542
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:41,017
I'll send you more.

543
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:44,255
I appear to have
struck it rich.

544
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:46,748
I'll send you
all that you need.

545
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,676
Trixie?

546
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,356
Trixie?

547
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:58,879
Hello, sweetheart.

548
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,342
Don't I look tired?

549
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:03,456
Sophia.

550
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,577
Sophia.

551
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:12,416
Sophia.

552
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,231
You're so beautiful.

553
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,559
I should've guessed it.

554
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:25,091
Take her home,
Mrs. Garret.

555
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:34,306
How do you take
my suggestion?

556
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,645
Are you sure
that gold's real?

557
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,719
Absolutely.

558
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,923
Uh, let me think
things through.

559
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:46,703
All right.

560
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:07,534
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth.

561
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:13,513
- I'm quittin'.
- All right, Flora.

562
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:16,590
I left a pin up in your room.
I wanna go look for it.

563
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:20,943
Go ahead and look.

564
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,798
When does the part come
when that little piece of trim

565
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:29,490
finally gets into
her workin' clothes

566
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:31,470
and starts makin' us
some fuckin' money?

567
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:33,553
She's quitting, Cy.

568
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,408
She's quitting?

569
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:40,086
And that seems to be your room
she's walkin' into yet again.

570
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:42,129
She lost a pin...
up there.

571
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,372
A pin?

572
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,543
Can you tell the stones
from the paste?

573
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,995
Show me
which is which.

574
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,389
I don't think so.

575
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,888
- Let me take it.
- Get outta here, Flora.

576
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:25,336
Put down my things and I'll let you
get out without raising hell.

577
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:27,614
Why don't let me go
with your things

578
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,658
and shut your
fucking mouth?

579
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:32,765
Because I remind you of whoever
the fuck I remind you of.

580
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,165
No.

581
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:38,623
Now what are you gonna do,
Flora, kill me?

582
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:44,096
- Maybe.
- Think you're gonna get out alive?

583
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:45,727
I'll give it
a goddamn whirl.

584
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:47,837
You're not gonna
get out alive.

585
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,099
You're gonna die here.

586
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,595
Who am I?

587
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:57,987
Your little baby?

588
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:59,333
Your little sister?

589
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:02,559
You?

590
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,336
I wouldn't move this.

591
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:32,076
- Did you find your pin?
- I did, sir.

592
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,833
Joanie tells me
you're leaving us.

593
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,074
Can't take it
anymore, sir.

594
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:37,933
Decided I wasn't
cut out for it.

595
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,428
My brother too.

596
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:41,414
Decided he wasn't
cut out for what?

597
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:43,146
Sweeping up
at The Gem Saloon.

598
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,570
I see.

599
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:49,575
My first take on your meaning
was they were fucking your brother

600
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:52,137
for money over there
like you was gettin' done to here.

601
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,170
Step aside and let me
do my business.

602
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,300
And what is your
fuckin' business?!

603
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,282
You with your beady
little ferret eyes.

604
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:05,040
She came to say goodbye, Cy.
She's movin' on.

605
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,505
It don't feel
right to me, babe.

606
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:11,727
But if I'm mistaken
in my judgment,

607
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:14,035
may I regret what I just did
for the rest of my life.

608
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,525
Now let her go!

609
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,218
You little cunt!

610
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,421
You're gonna die here!

611
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:25,584
Come on!

612
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,814
Get outta here.
Get out. Get out front.

613
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:31,671
Get around!
They're goin' over the top!

614
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:36,247
Come on.

615
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:38,386
Don't impede her
progress, Joanie.

616
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,297
Don't do nothin' rash.

617
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,877
- What are you doing?
- That's none of your business!

618
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:10,227
Them two robbed my joint. That's where
they're gonna be dealt with.

619
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:13,436
I guess they needn't
get beat anymore out here.

620
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,726
Take 'em the fuck
inside, boys.

621
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:23,932
And you can help
your delicate sensibilities

622
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:25,432
by turning the fuck away.

623
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,482
Cy wants you
up there, honey.

624
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:11,201
I tell you, your face come out
of that in pretty good shape.

625
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:14,658
Matters took a happy turn,
you could still probably work.

626
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,377
Come on in, honey,

627
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,387
over here on what the dagos
call my sinister side,

628
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,524
although your beady
little rat eyes

629
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:25,453
don't seem like
they're takin' in the view.

630
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:27,177
You bust somethin' up
there, sweetheart?!

631
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,587
Does that fuckin' hurt you?!

632
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:30,051
You fuckin' understand me?!

633
00:42:31,247 --> 00:42:34,094
See, that upsets Joanie now.

634
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:35,753
"Oh, Cy, do up the boy.

635
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:38,061
My God, I can't stand
to see the other."

636
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,787
You want me to see
to the boy, Joanie?

637
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,831
'Cause you know
I'm clay in your hands.

638
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:43,333
- Cy.
- What is it, Eddie?

639
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:44,870
We could all
be elsewhere?

640
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:46,735
Nothing but true.

641
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:48,296
Are you awake, Miles?

642
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:51,054
Don't be fuckin'
passin' out, youngster.

643
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,261
Next breath you draw,
the smell of sulfur's

644
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:55,437
liable to be strong
in your nose.

645
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:58,028
Where is your
fuckin' nose, anyway?

646
00:42:58,068 --> 00:42:59,726
Fuck it, Miles!

647
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:02,032
You're found fuckin'
guilty of bein' a cunt.

648
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:03,856
I'm hereby
passin' judgment

649
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:07,024
for your lettin' this bitch push you
around and tellin' you what to do

650
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:09,581
when you were supposed to be a man
and showing her rules!

651
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,529
You hear me, Miles?

652
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,093
And for bein' the cunt
you are now,

653
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,956
before you could
have been a man,

654
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,608
done your fuckin' part,
you little piece of shit.

655
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,256
I know you don't want
out of here, Joanie.

656
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:25,197
- Don't hurt her, Cy.
- Don't hurt her?

657
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,379
You mean
before I kill her?

658
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,304
Yes.

659
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:32,403
Listen to that, Flora.
That's the person you robbed,

660
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:36,020
who had those kind
of feelings for you.

661
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,565
But I'm the one
you stabbed.

662
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:42,294
See?

663
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,698
I think your fuckin'
skull's broken, Flora.

664
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:47,830
You're trying for the knife.
It's maybe a foot to your left.

665
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,469
This is fuckin' pitiful.

666
00:43:55,678 --> 00:43:59,061
Why don't you put that
out of its misery?

667
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:19,518
Don't do nothin'.

668
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:22,685
Whatever you want to do
will be a mistake.

669
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:26,236
You keep drawin' breath
right here.

670
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:47,679
You did everything
you could, E.B.,

671
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,086
to preserve our
fuckin' interests.

672
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:52,421
I mean, you know,
sometimes the cards go cold.

673
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,522
Far as the events
at the Bella Union,

674
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,950
by all accounts,
it was two young thieves,

675
00:44:57,993 --> 00:44:59,618
a boy and a girl.

676
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,251
We all know
who they are.

677
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:04,605
Who they are now
is late night vittles for Wu's pigs.

678
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,690
That young girl
had me fooled.

679
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:08,454
Your dick
had you fooled.

680
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:10,466
And in that state
of addlement,

681
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,841
you mistook her purpose,
her so-called brother's

682
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,593
and their entire
fucking cockeyed story.

683
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:19,175
You did do everything
you could, didn't you, E. B?

684
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:20,838
You went to the limit
on our offer.

685
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:22,982
- Everything humanly possible.
- You did go to the limit?

686
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,476
Well, I went
to the limit's precipice.

687
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:27,907
Sounds like you didn't go
to the limit.

688
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:30,701
Al, I held back
a few dollars,

689
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:32,742
against some final
unforeseen turn.

690
00:45:32,783 --> 00:45:34,605
So we'll never know
if them few dollars

691
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,382
you held back wouldn't have
made us both fucking rich.

692
00:45:44,082 --> 00:45:45,259
I'm goin' up.

693
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:49,453
Find out how much
Tolliver paid Wu.

694
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:54,221
Don't want to be suckin'
hind tit on disposal fees.

695
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:16,334
Don't think I enjoyed
that bullshit, Joanie.

696
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:19,564
Certain things you...

697
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:21,396
have to do to impress
upon people

698
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:23,473
what you're willing to do.
Do you like it? No.

699
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:25,552
Do you enjoy it? No.

700
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:29,335
Do you have to look
like you do? Yes.

701
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,105
I got Eddie in there.

702
00:46:33,146 --> 00:46:34,673
Gotta let him know.

703
00:46:34,715 --> 00:46:37,715
Capra's downstairs,
gonna hear about it.

704
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:41,621
When people come to rob you, Joanie,
you gotta get rough.

705
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,666
If it looks like an act,
it's not gonna work.

706
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:51,127
And then
I grab your hand...

707
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,684
and I think, "My God,
this poor fuckin' girl."

708
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,614
But I did what I had
to do in that room.

709
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:03,190
And now I'm out here.

710
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:05,884
I'm telling you,

711
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,287
your happiness
is important to me,

712
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,176
and whatever
the fuck I gotta do,

713
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:11,638
if you're too much
in my shadow,

714
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:14,136
if I make things too tough on you,
then we'll stop it.

715
00:47:14,178 --> 00:47:17,561
- We're gonna do somethin' else.
- Cy.

716
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:21,017
You bring warmth
into my life.

717
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:26,332
I can't bear to see you
unhappy like this.

718
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:30,461
I want...

719
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:33,530
to set you up
in your own business here.

720
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:38,012
Independent fuckin' operator.
I'll put up the money.

721
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:40,126
Any kind of interest
in return, that's fine,

722
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,396
but that ain't what this is about.
It'll be your place.

723
00:47:43,431 --> 00:47:45,503
I want you to feel
when I walk in there

724
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:47,877
that you can say, "I'm busy, Cy.
Come back later."

725
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:50,245
I want you to watch me
turn around when you say that

726
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,866
like I'm some rube trick
with my chin down on the floor,

727
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:54,814
"When should I try
you again, Joanie?"

728
00:47:54,857 --> 00:47:56,384
"I'll let you know, Cy."

729
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:58,629
That's how I want
you to feel.

730
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:01,383
I used to make you warm,
didn't I, Cy?

731
00:48:01,418 --> 00:48:04,767
And I could make you feel
like something's funny.

732
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,698
You still do, honey.

733
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:09,698
When you're happy,
you still do.

734
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:13,863
Kill me too, Cy,

735
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,787
or let me go.

736
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:20,866
I understood myself
to be sayin', Joanie,

737
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:22,916
I want to find a way to give you
a looser rein.

738
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,675
You've gotta figure out
a way to mean it.

739
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,433
If you don't kill me
or let me go,

740
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,194
I'm gonna kill you.

741
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:47,510
Has he got you at your hands and knees
at 2:00 in the fucking morning?

742
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:50,135
I got myself
at my hands and knees,

743
00:49:50,174 --> 00:49:52,476
wondering what
became of you.

744
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:06,652
Wake up, David.

745
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:09,880
I'm up.

746
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,553
? Row, row, row,
row your boat ?

747
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:34,972
? Gently down
the stream ?

748
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:38,211
? Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ?

749
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,035
? Life is
but a dream. ?

750
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:08,978
? I was a-standin' ?

751
00:52:09,015 --> 00:52:12,845
? By my window ?

752
00:52:12,888 --> 00:52:15,888
? Oh one cold ?

753
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,797
? And cloudy day ?

754
00:52:20,185 --> 00:52:23,414
? When I saw that ?

755
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,225
? Hearse come rollin' ?

756
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:29,845
? For to carry ?

757
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:33,331
? My mother away ?

758
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:37,458
? Will a circle ?

759
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,526
? Be unbroken? ?

760
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:44,433
? By and by, Lord ?

761
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:48,252
? By and by ?

762
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:51,483
? There's better ?

763
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,775
? Home away ?

764
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:59,453
? In the sky, Lord ?

765
00:52:59,488 --> 00:53:04,223
? In the sky. ?
