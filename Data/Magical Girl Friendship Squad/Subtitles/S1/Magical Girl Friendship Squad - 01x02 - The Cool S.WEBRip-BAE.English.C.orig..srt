2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,399
It's too early for panda claws.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,409
Could you trim those, Nut?

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,539
Hygiene.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,499
I've been up for several hours
doing reconnaissance.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,629
I was able to pull security
footage from the incident,

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,549
and this customer
stood out to me.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,469
Hair that slick
can only be achieved

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,609
through nefarious means.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,609
We're super excited

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,439
about our new powers
and everything,

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,649
but we're not, like,
"wake up at 7:00 in the morning

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,499
for a covert mission" excited.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,609
We've got stuff to do.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,489
What could possibly be
more important

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,770
than hunting down
the only person

17
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:49,499
that could lead us
to the greatest force of evil

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,820
- in the...
- Um, it's called

19
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:53,549
the grind, Nut. Ever heard of it?

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,609
I can't even start applying
to programming jobs

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,399
until I make my vision board.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,840
And I really should make
a mood board

23
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,669
to set the tone
for my vision board.

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,459
♪ It was you ♪

25
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,599
♪ You... ♪

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,689
No. Alex.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,519
You know I need
Carla St. Beverly's

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,569
easy listening smooth jazz jams
to focus.

29
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,399
Then take it
into your own room, Mom.

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,489
I have foot pics

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,399
and forged
celebrity paraphernalia

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,569
- to sell.
- "Forged"?

33
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,429
Who's to say these aren't
Ariana's Band-Aids?

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,609
Who among us can claim

35
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,609
Kylie did not get
a stress-induced nosebleed

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,629
on these tissues
after hearing the new Kanye?

37
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,569

38
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,579

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,399
Uh, a little privacy, Nut?

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,499
I can't sell pictures
of my five-star wikiFeet

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,459
- with you in the background.
- Very well.

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,519
I will begin the mission myself.

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,800
Sounds good. Have fun, Nut.

44
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:48,619
Can you bring me back a bagel?

45
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,609
Timothée, give me strength.

46
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,469
My usual. And I want horse milk,

47
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,619
not goat milk.

48
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,679
Hmm.

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,629
H-Here, Corvin.

50
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,489
Corvin.

51
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,459
You call that horse milk?!

52
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,449
: I tell you every day
that's not a thing, but...

53
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,639
Whoa, Pokémon Go
has gotten really fucking good.

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,590
Huh!

55
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,400
Aggregon.

56
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,529
One sale away.

57
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,579
And that's rent!

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,490
Thank you, female odor.

59
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,679
What? Really?

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,419
You made rent
in the last three hours?

61
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,419
Oh. Um, no. Misunderstanding.

62
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,580
You spent it on something
already, didn't you?

63
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,529
What did we say
about perverted purchases

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,469
over $100?

65
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,679
But I need it
to get into the right headspace

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,519
to write my fan fiction
about Scully

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,549
hooking up
with a girl alien named Daisy.

68
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,489
Besides, I'll make it back.

69
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,930
You can sell stuff on Star Junk
for ten times what it's worth.

70
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:01,669
And if you help,

71
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,580
we could work twice as fast.

72
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,620
- Move over.
- Hell, yeah!

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,579
These sites are so sinister.

74
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,429
Why do people want this shit?

75
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,619
I wish we lived near
some quality celebrity trash.

76
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,460
Like, where do all the celebrity
baby teeth go? Where?

77
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,569
Celebrity baby teeth!

78
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,429
Dude, we have magic.

79
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,679
Tom Selleck bong.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,580
Saliva swap
with Kristen Stewart.

81
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,549
Birth control.

82
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,649
Something for the boomers.

83
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,399
Tessa Thompson used flossers.

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,569
Idris Elba grocery list.

85
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,649
Chalamet thong.

86
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,509
Rihanna's bidet!

87
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,609
Damn, Star Junk.
That's rent, utilities,

88
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,549
and I can finally pay you back

89
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,910
for the money
you lent me last year

90
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,589
that I didn't tell you about
till now.

91
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,449
Man, I wish we could keep
the Rihanna bidet.

92
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,549
Aggregon!

93
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,579
What about it?

94
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,559
That's where
the man I saw works.

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,479
There's something
going on there.

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,399
I'm not surprised.
Aggregon owns everything.

97
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,429
I think
they even own Star Junk now.

98
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,589
What? You know about them?

99
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,589
Tell me everything.

100
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,459
Tell you what.
Your cute little panda face

101
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,540
in the background of one photo
got more profile views

102
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,861
than that time
Cardi B followed me

103
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,519
and I posted a screencap of it

104
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,600
and then I realized it was
just a Cardi B fan account

105
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:24,399
and had to apologize to everyone
for the false alarm.

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,569
I fail to see
how this is relevant.

107
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,970
You let me take
more pictures of you

108
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,459
for my Star Junk's
Instagram page,

109
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,740
and I'll tell you
about Aggregon.

110
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,649
Deal.
But I feel objectified.

111
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,639
Welcome to womanhood on Earth.

112
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,399
I'll catch up with you guys

113
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,439
once all this inventory
gets picked up.

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,549
Tom Selleck bong.

115
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,639
Tiny panda cowboy hat.

any singing out there, right?

120
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,439
Uh, no. We're here
for a Star Junk pickup.

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,459
One baggie of Miley Cyrus
toenail clippings,

122
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,620
as promised.

123
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,449
Uh, was there... something else?

124
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,579
So, you know Nut?

125
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,519
You know Nut?

126
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,529
She's the panda from
your Star Junk account, right?

127
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,479
- We're big fans.
- That's so cool.

128
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,669
Yeah, I am cool.

129
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,659
Me and Carla St. Beverly.

130
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,519
I'm Alex.

131
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,519
- That's Pussluvr.
- Sup.

132
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,629
- Neptunia99.
- Sup.

133
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,519
And I'm Nightscreamr.

134
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,469
Cool.

135
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,589
What is this for?

136
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,449
Well, I'm post them on Insta
and maybe TikTok,

137
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,090
but only to drive traffic
to my Star Junk.

138
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:38,399
Ten of these a week, and we'll
never worry about rent again.

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,399
Tell me about Aggregon.

140
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,649
Ugh, sheesh, okay.

141
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,579
Well, I mean,
they own everything,

142
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,539
so, obviously,
bad labor practices.

143
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,599
Ooh, give me egirl.

144
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,459
They stream stuff.

145
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,940
I hear that they're doing this
thing called gamifying feelings.

146
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:53,649
Give me Insta baddie.

147
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,649
So, world domination.

148
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,539
I mean, don't be dramatic.

149
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,649
Capitalism world domination.

150
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,689
So world domination.

151
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,669
Whatever.
Put on the baseball cap.

152
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,639
You know, you guys
should talk to my roommate.

153
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,499
She says the stuff I like
is "mom stuff."

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,619
Can you even believe...
Hey.

155
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,649
Nut uses that same "S"
on her bed.

156
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,559
- Weird.
- Ah. You don't say.

157
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,619
Do you, uh, want to go meet her?

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,439
Yes!

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,599
Nut, some of your Insta stans
have the goofiest names.

160
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,539
"Pussluvr," "Nutmunchr,"
"Nutsworldchica"?

161
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,399
- This is...
- Did you say "Nut's World"?

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
Yeah. Does that mean something?

163
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,459
- Uh, hello, guys.
- Sup?

164
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,579
Oh, my God.

165
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,419
Nut, is it really you?

166
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,659
Oh, my God.

167
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,519
- What the fuck is this?
- Wait it out.

168
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,399
They'll hit a frequency adults cannot hear.

169
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,599
How do these cool teenagers
know who you are, Nut?

170
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,649
- You're not cool.
- And that's really cold,

171
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,669
coming from Carla St. Beverly's
number one fan.

172
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,399
- Promise not to laugh?
- No.

173
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,539
Your universe is not
the only one I have created.

174
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,539
My very first was
long, long ago.

175
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,409
I was young.
Perhaps a bit insecure.

176
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,579
It is called Nut's World.

177
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,659
And the S is the cool S.

178
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,569
That was very important to me
at the time.

179
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,499
That's what that
stupid tattoo is.

180
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,519
If this was so long ago,
why do they all look like

181
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,659
- they're from the '90s?
- Fashion is cyclical, Alex.

182
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,689
No, yeah. I knew that. I'm cool.

183
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,690
Like their young creator,
the people of Nut's World

184
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:20,669
were emotional.

185
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,539
They were deeply attached to me

186
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,419
and perceived my leaving
their world as abandonment.

187
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,649
My greatest mistake
was in giving them the power

188
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,599
to travel through universes.

189
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,639
They warned me
that they'd plant scouts

190
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,529
in every world they could
until they found me.

191
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,440
But they might also legitimately
think I'm cool, right?

192
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,689
It's wonderful to see you again,
my creations.

193
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,619
Perhaps we can take
a few pictures.

194
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,509
50 bucks apiece.

195
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,619
No, Mommy.
You're coming home with us

196
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,419
to step on our necks
forever and ever.

197
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,419
Is Nut their mom, or are they,
like, into her sexually?

198
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,529
Both. I get it.

199
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,659
It's exactly how I feel
about Gillian Anderson.

200
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,579
Silence.

201
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,459
We shall decide your fate

202
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,580
as all decisions
on Nut's World are made...

203
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,539
- ...truth or dare.
- Ooh! Pick dare.

204
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,589
Nut, pick truth.

205
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,649
Truth.

206
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,649
What makes these two
better than us?

207
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,629
I love all my creations.

208
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,469
Alex and Daisy's universe

209
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,439
simply needs
my presence more right now.

210
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,649
If you don't come
to Nut's World, Queen,

211
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,599
Nut's World comes to you.

212
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,569
Nut! Nut! Nut!

213
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,599
I can't reach my bong.

214
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,589
Denizens of Nut's World,

215
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,609
our queen must be convinced
to return to us.

216
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,589
Let us show her our devotion
with the Infinite Grind Line.

217
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,639
Grind, my beauties.

218
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,639
Grind for our queen.

219
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,469
This is not necessary.

220
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,659
Please, we can discuss
a future visit.

221
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,609
This is super fucked up, Alex.

222
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,519
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

223
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,419
I can't think
with this garbage music playing.

224
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,489
I need my Carla St. Beverly.

229
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,539
light a seasonal Yankee Candle.

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,559
Ew. Pumpkin Spice? Gag.

231
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,440
I miss my vision board!

232
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,620
Oh, no, no, no.

233
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,649
- New outfits this time?
- Oh, yeah.

234
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,399

- How do we finish them off?
- I don't know.

241
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,570
We've only had magical powers
for, like, three days.

242
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,559
Wait. Don't hurt them.

243
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,479
It's not their fault
for being chaotic horny.

244
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,629
I made them this way.

245
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,429
Well, how are we supposed
to keep them

246
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,710
from trying to godnap you again?

247
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,399
I have an idea.

249
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,529
- What is this?
- It's called fan fiction.

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,519
Read it, write it, live it.

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,559
Ooh, and look up my series.

254
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,479
It's called The XXX-Files.
You'll dig it.

255
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,469
I still love you all.

256
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,469
I will return to Nut's World.

Someday.

of fan fiction responsibly.

259
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,499
Oh, my God,
Nut touched Nightscreamr.

260
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,669
Nut touched Nutscreamr!

261
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,670
Stay away.

262
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:07,489
I'm never washing again.

263
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,409
So perfect Nut had
a weird, horny teen phase

264
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,639
just like the rest of us.

265
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,539

that she doesn't bathe!

00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,569
Maybe I'll get out
of the celebrity worship game
