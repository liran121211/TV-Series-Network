1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,240
♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,449
Cassandra... when
your mother calls you a dumb slut,

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,449
she is reclaiming
the term, okay?

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,289
Alex! Your interview is
in one hour.

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,399
- Why are you not prepared?
- I'm going, I'm going.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,289
It was the reunion finale.

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,399
Planting you at Aggregon
as a mole

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,489
is our best chance
to stop their plot

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,339
to destroy the universe.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,309
My only plot for
destroying the universe

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,509
is this ass.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,239
What could have distracted you
from such an important mission?

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,369
- Reality television?
- Hell yes.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,269
Other people being
messy disasters

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,449
makes me feel okay that this is
the only blazer I own.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,459
Give me that,
give me all of this.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,519
It all has to be gone
before my parents come

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,339
for the Agony Solstice.

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,379
What is the Agony Solstice?

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,279
Only the biggest holiday
in their cult, or...

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,409
highly specific religion:

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,389
The Church of the Savior's
Unthinkable Torment.

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,529
It is a shame that you are
a grown woman

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,449
who has to hide who she is.

25
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,419
Oh, so you're really a talking red panda...

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,439
...not a god who needs
the help of two idiots

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,359
- ...to keep your own universe from being destroyed?
- Touché.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,439
I'm out of here, too.

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,309
Hey, feel free to keep watching.
You might dig it.

30
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,249
Thank you, but I doubt that.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,519
They're housewives,
but they're real?

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
You're saying
th-that I have a drinking problem?

33
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,449
Oh, this is horrible!

34
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,359
Little help.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,259
I love it.

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,299
And our latest experiment
down on floor -44

37
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,299
is going perfectly.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,489
Please do let me know
when you've decided to finish

39
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,479
wasting my time.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,519
Hear you loud and clear.
Status report complete.

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,359
So, do you have any feedback,
or should we be bad

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,269
and go out for martinis?

43
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,439
Get out.

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,360
Uh-uh, absolutely.
Of course.

45
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,830
Hmm, you're here
for the job interview.

46
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:59,239
Well, it's an entry-level
content creator position.

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,299
Do you have any experience
creating content?

48
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,620
I have a Twitter,
and on good days

49
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:05,269
I get maybe 12 to 17 likes.

50
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,359
Hmm. You're hired.

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,419
- That's it?
- There's openings in the department,

52
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,419
thanks to an exciting new
initiative of mine.

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,239
- Now sign this.
- Oh, my God. Awesome.

54
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,389
Oh, shoot, I forgot.

55
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,299
There's room for salary
negotiations, right?

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,269
Oh, too late.
You already signed.

57
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,269
But let's circle back
in a year. Okay?

58
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,630
This is the Data Mining
department.

59
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:26,449
There's the Sweatshop
Liaison office.

60
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,419
And that's
the Panic/Breast Feeding room.

61
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,309
Oh, um, hey, what does
this company do, exactly?

62
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,359
A little bit of streaming,
a little bit of shipping,

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,449
a little bit of resource
exploitation; the usual.

64
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,329
Right now, though,
we're really focused

65
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,419
on "alternative energy sources."

66
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,389
Like light bulbs?

67
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,239
Like humans.

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,459
Yeah.

69
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,299
Welcome to Outrage.

70
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,409
You'll start by
brainstorming chum.

71
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,349
You know, the nonsense links
at the bottom of our websites

72
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,359
that lead to our other,
shittier websites.

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,509
Like realcontent.crap?

74
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,419
It's fun to see what
Patrick Swayze's son

75
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,289
- looks like now.
- Right.

76
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,419
But these days we lead
solely with outrage.

77
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,489
More rage, more clicks.

78
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,269
Have you ever written
outrage content before?

79
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,269
No, but I'm a black
millennial woman

80
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,470
with 85K in student loan debt,

81
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:13,239
- so I'm sure I can figure it out.
- Inspiring.

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,489
I'm late for a fish egg facial,

83
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,239
so watch and learn to start.

84
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,299
Ronald Reagan said what?

85
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,449
Has the ♪MeToo movement
gone too far?

86
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,259
I'll say it.
Mitch McConnell turns me on.

87
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,479
Oh, that's good.
What else you got?

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,389
Climate change isn't real,

89
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,509
but it does cause autism.

90
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,299
- Wow.   - Genius.
- Really good.

91
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,700
How are you so good at this?

92
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,420
Aah!

93
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,239
Ah, a miserable Agony Solstice
to you.

94
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,409
Yes, yes, and a, uh...

95
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,349
a miserable Agony Solstice
to you, too.

96
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,449
I expect you've been complying
with the traditional

97
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,349
three days of sleep deprivation,
lack of water

98
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,369
and wearing shoes
two sizes too small.

99
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,389
Oh, yeah.
My feet are throbbing.

100
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,239
It is very festive.

101
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,479
You look well, daughter.

102
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,419
- Not nearly dehydrated enough.
- Oh, parent,

103
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,329
stop worrying about me.

104
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,419
We just want you to be unhappy.
Now, let's have

105
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,519
a quick meal of salty foods
before heading out

106
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,449
for recruitment,
shriek caroling,

107
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,489
- and your favorite, shame circles.
- I'll find something.

108
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,439
You sit on your
discomfort pillows,

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,509
and tell me again
what the sacred scrolls say

110
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,299
about the Rapture.

111
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,419
The Lord of Unspeakable Torment
will reward

112
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,349
the most faithfully miserable

113
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,439
by bringing us
to a dark place.

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,459
A pleasant feeling
of meaninglessness will follow,

115
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,409
then the bugs.

116
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,419
I found a granola bar
we can all split.

117
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,529
Dad? Uh, uh, parent?

118
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,499
Daisy, did you
know 90-Day Fiancée

119
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
has six spinoffs?

120
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,239
Who was that?!

121
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,409
That was my human roommate.

122
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,429
Very sinful,
but for sure human,

123
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,529
and not at all magical.

124
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,259
Excuse me.

125
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,289
Nut, what are you doing?

126
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,439
Watching trash TV.
I understand now.

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,459
It makes me feel bad
about humanity,

128
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,489
which makes me feel... good.

129
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,459
Oh, my God, it is incredible.
Are you on season two

130
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,469
of Vanderpump Rules yet?
Wait. No.

131
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,299
I don't have time for this.
Just keep it down, please.

132
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,240
What is this cold rectangle?

133
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,479
The McConnell article is getting
massive engagement,

134
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,489
but we need more outrage.

135
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,439
Tammy, give me an article
on how reverse racism

136
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,489
is the real racism.

137
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,469
Brad, make a list of actors

138
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,349
who've publicly supported
Woody Allen,

139
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,419
and fantasy-cast them
in a Harry Potter reboot.

140
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,239
And, Patty, what can we blame
millennials for killing?

141
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,369
- Uh, Pier 1 Imports?
- Perfect.

142
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,289
We'll never own homes
to furnish.

143
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,479
After R.I.Pier 1,

144
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,289
take this data
on people's porn habits,

145
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,530
and let's see if
we can match it

146
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,289
to what topics will
make them angriest.

147
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,329
Go team!

148
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,369
Drinks later, Alex?

149
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,499
Uh, you know it.

150
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,239
Do you guys ever feel bad
about devoting your life

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,369
to making people angry?

152
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,299
Sure, but I have a family
of three large sons to support.

153
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,940
You think I could
go back to freelancing?!

154
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:54,239
Plus, free Wi-Fi.

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,489
And we have so many perks here.

156
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,339
Like triple-ply toilet paper?

157
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,239
You haven't seen
the perks yet?!

158
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,430
I love it here!

159
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,469
Hey, that's my department.

160
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,240
Ooh, maybe there's a pool down there.

161
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,499
Is this some kind of spa?

162
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,459
Sorry to bother,
but can I sign up

163
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,409
for one of these tube facials?

164
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,409
McConnell, hot, damn it.
Looks like a turtle.

165
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,239
What the hell?

166
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,459
How could you use this sinful
instrument of pleasure?

167
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,540
I know you're disappointed,

168
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,489
but I only have the computer
for worship.

169
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,309
This thing called the Internet

170
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,489
makes it way easier
to suffer. Look.

171
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,479
"Legalize Emotional
Support Heroine"?

172
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,499
That's ridiculous.

173
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,359
See? You're miserable already.

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,299
I don't know who
this Mitch McConnell is,

175
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,259
but he is not hot.

176
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,459
- Parent? Where'd she...
- Certainly not.

177
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,479
He looks like a-a wrinkly old turtle.

178
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,509
Oh...

179
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,499
Aah!

180
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,439
- Daisy?
- Ow.

181
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,319
I think my computer sucked
my parents and me

182
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,489
into a bank tube?

183
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,239
What were you doing the second
before you got dropped here?

184
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,359
Well, they were both clicking on
some stupid article

185
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,249
about Mitch McConnell being hot.

186
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,439
I just grabbed on.
God, who writes that shit?

187
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,379
Okay, sometimes jobs like this
are a stepping stone to... Uh!

188
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,289
Ah, Nuts.
Are you here to help us?

189
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,359
No. I just clicked an article
about how Ronnie and Sammi

190
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,309
from Jersey Shore
are not still together.

191
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,299
Well, I hope you enjoyed it
because I think

192
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,469
Aggregon is using click bait
to kidnap people.

193
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,259
The alternative energy source
Corvin mentioned

194
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,249
must be human outrage.

195
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,329
We should go before anyone
from Aggregon sees us.

196
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,339
I can't just leave
my parents.

197
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,409
What happens if
their outrage runs out?

198
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,359
I don't know.

199
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
But our best chance
of stopping it

200
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,419
is through those tubes.
Come on.

Full penetration!

207
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,339
- That'll buy us some time.
- Remember,

208
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,460
if the tubes are scanning
and capturing human outrage,

209
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,419
you cannot get upset in there.

210
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,319

211
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,249
I wish I could go, too.

helpless panda.

- The fuck you say?
- Daisy, cut it out.

227
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,459
Hot dogs are bread and meat!

228
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,900

to tell me that

229
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,239
that's not a fucking sandwich,

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,389

Oh, God, that's what happens

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,560
when someone's outrage
runs out.

239
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:22,449

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,249

a firewall.

Wow, that's the first time
my period has ever helped me.

251
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,289
My God, they're been drained
of outrage.

252
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,309
How did this happen do fast?

253
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,990
It was their first time
using the Internet.

254
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,359
Of course they blew their loads.
What do we do?

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,239
I need to find a way to stop
the outrage flow temporarily

256
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,259
- so I can activate my new code.
- On it.

I put in a patch that will stop
any new people

261
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,479
from getting body snatched.

262
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,370
Now let's unplug your parents
before they become bots.

263
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,359
You're all free.

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,720
Just pull the cables
from your eyes

265
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:28,519
before you get turned
into bots forever.

266
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,309
I could be a bot... forever?

267
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,429
Steady employment?

268
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,439
Wait, you want to be
turned into bots?

269
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
I have a family to support.

270
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,269
I can't go back
to free living.

271
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,489
Plus, free Wi-Fi.

272
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,490
Well, not you guys. Sorry.

273
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,399
Daughter, what happened?

274
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,509
Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry
I showed you the Internet

275
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,249
and it brought you into...
Well, it doesn't matter.

276
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,369
But I saved you.

277
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,509
We were about to get Raptured,
and you stopped it?!

278
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,519
It was all as the scrolls
foretold.

279
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,489
We were one plague of bugs away
from finally meeting

280
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,389
the Lord of Unspeakable Torment.

281
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,469
You don't deserve
to shriek carol.

282
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,359
We're going back to Michigan!

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,359
Let 'em go.

284
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,499
Let's just find Nut.

285
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,469
Trixie Mattel,
sashay away.

286
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,290
- At least we're all miserable.
- Hmm?

287
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,379
Stop, intruder!

288
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,519
I will get
to the bottom of this.

289
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,439
I'm just gonna have to
breathe for a while first.

290
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,389
I'm glad they're okay,

291
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,369
but it kind of sucks that
my parents would rather be bots

292
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,349
than get to know the real me.

293
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,479
Daisy, we each have the power
to choose our own families.

294
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,489
I know that because of you.

295
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,269
- You do?
- Vanderpump Rules, season two.

296
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,509
Who wants some free snacks?

297
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,340

bless us, every one.
