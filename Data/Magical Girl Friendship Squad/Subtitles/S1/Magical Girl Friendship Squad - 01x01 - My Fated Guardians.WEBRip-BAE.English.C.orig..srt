♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪

3
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,268
Dude, you're blocking
the stairs.

4
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:28,328
- Welcome to Brooklyn, buddy.
- Tourists.

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,529
Man, it's bullshit
that they laid you off.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,438
Your food craze ideas...

7
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,538
Culinary experience
creation innovations.

8
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,349
...were incredible.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,398
Unicorn hot dogs absolutely
should have been

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,519
- the next mermaid bagel.
- Thanks, but it's fine.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,258
Working in that office
all day, every day

12
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,309
was draining the life out of me.

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,389
Well, now you can finally reject
the outdated notion

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,529
of job monogamy.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,269
Like for me, before that
off-brand snack company fired me

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,030
for tweeting
that the green M&M could get it,

17
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,298
they wouldn't let me do more

18
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,468
than 20 hours a week
on their social.

19
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,750
'Cause that's when they legally
have to give you benefits?

20
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:04,268
Yeah,
so I just picked up extra work

21
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,669
doing audio editing
for that podcast

22
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,339
where three white dudes
review airport bathrooms...

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,780
until they also fired me
for tweeting

24
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,348
that Amelia Earhart
could get it.

25
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,529
I'd be fine
with one job to start.

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,488
Lulu is gonna kill us
if we're late on rent again.

27
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,419
Oh, we'll get jobs.

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,469
The next big thing is
just around the corner.

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,348
And, Alex, can I just say,
Lulu can try me.

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:31,369
I watched John Wick 2
last night, and I'm fired up.

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,309
Ha! Kick, kick, kick, kick,
kick, kick. Chun-Li.

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,508
Ooh, I love that movie!

33
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,358
Daisy, Daisy, look. I once
killed three men in a bar.

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,249
With a pencil.

35
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,358
You come after my dog,
I'll kill you.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,399
Anyway, I don't even need
a job in programming.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,499
Just something simple that
doesn't have an awful commute.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,419
Something that's...

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,489
in the neighborhood.

40
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,279
Come on.

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,538
Alex and Daisy.

42
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,529
I found my guardians.

43
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,529
That energy spike could only
mean one thing...

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,369
the Creator has taken form
in this world.

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,418
Ah. I wish my passion
for spying on strangers

46
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,318
from behind trash cans
could pay the bills.

47
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,258
Oh, well. Back to being
a corporate attorney, I guess.

48
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,429
♪ Zab-a-dee-da, I'm gonna go
rip people off. ♪

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,269
Alex, this is amazing.

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,390
If you work here, you can
give me so much free coffee.

51
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:26,438
Plus, I'd finally have a reason
to talk to coffee dude.

52
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,448
What do you think
he's always studying?

53
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,448
Probably, like, how
to be an artisanal beekeeper.

54
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:36,499
Snore. You literally only like
him because he's a blank slate

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,438
you can project
your fantasies on.

56
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,399
I know.

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,519
But remember the time
he smiled at me?

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,378
Aw...

59
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,258
- Hmm.
- Hey, Michaela.

60
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:51,139
Isn't it weird for you
to come here all the time

61
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:52,279
when you've, you know,

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,448
ground beans
with all the baristas?

63
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,388
You're such a mom.
It's whatever.

64
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,378
Oh, yeah. No-tattoo barista
is working today.

65
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,249
That's why she couldn't
sleep over last night.

66
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,279
- Do you even know her name?
- You don't know his name.

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,348
Daisy.

68
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,309
Hey... you.

69
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,329
We peeped that "help wanted"
sign in the window.

70
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,519
I'm very qualified.

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,288
I just left a job at a culinary
experience formation start-up,

72
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:18,378
so I've worked with stuff
just like... CBD lattes.

73
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,508
- Ew. No offense.
- Ha, ha.

74
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,339
Do you have barista experience?

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,348
- Not specifically, but...
- Sorry.

76
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,348
Baristas have to be certified,
and to get certification,

77
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,388
you need at least three years
of barista experience.

78
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,388
But then, how does anyone become
a barista to begin with?

79
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:40,318
No, no.
One must be born a barista.

80
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,489
The Creator is here on Earth
in the form of some kind

81
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,288
of small mammal.

82
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,468
The energy levels around her
are astronomical.

83
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,309
Do I have your permission

84
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,378
to collect
after she leaves the scene?

85
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,269
I have an idea that should reap
very powerful results.

86
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,279
Ooh, vegan muffins.

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,408
Sorry. Not you.

88
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,468
Well, well, well.

89
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,408
The millennial freeloaders
of 2B.

90
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,329
Might I ask where the rent is,

91
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,478
or did you eat it
with your avocado toast?

92
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,468
Uh, the first isn't
till tomorrow, right?

93
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,438
Yeah, so you better hop off
our dicks, Lulu!

94
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,448
Whoa, there. I think
what Daisy means is,

95
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,419
we will definitely have
the rent on time.

96
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,278
- We respect you.
- Good.

97
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,448
Because if it's late again,

98
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,489
I'm slapping an eviction notice
on your door

99
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,359
as soon as I get my son
over here to fix my printer!

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,448
Daisy?

101
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,518
Why is there a raccoon
on our couch?

102
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,318
I am not a raccoon.

103
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,408
I have taken the form
of a red panda.

104
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:37,369
My species is endangered,
much like your world.

105
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,289
- Alex?
- Yup, yup, I hear it.

106
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,528
Talking raccoon on our couch.

107
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:44,408
Alex, Daisy, I've come to you
with an important mission.

108
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,429
Did you microdose me
without telling me again?

109
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,328
What's the phone number
for animal control?

110
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,318
Put your fingers inside me,
and all shall be revealed.

111
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,289
Aah! What's happening?

112
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,290
The butt is sucking us in!

113
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,309
I created this universe
and everything in it.

114
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,378
It is one of many universes
created by myself

115
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,448
and other beings like me.

116
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,328
But some beings are driven
by destruction,

117
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,429
rather than creation.

118
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,469
They seek
to destroy this universe

119
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,278
by using its own power
against it.

120
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,328
Aah! Hold on.
The Internet's out.

121
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,689
Oh, are you on the
"Alex and Daisy,

122
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,930
please stop stealing our Wi-Fi
or we'll lock it" network?

123
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,249
You'll never believe this.

124
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,299
They locked it!

125
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,268
These evil forces have been
amassing your universe's energy

126
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:29,278
for some time,
particularly from this planet,

127
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,419
its largest source of life.

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,528
Try 3C's Wi-Fi.

129
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,438
So I suppose
you don't want to hear

130
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,479
about the special powers
I can grant you?

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,438
Powers? Fuck yeah.

132
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,328
Ooh, what kind of powers? Can
we wish for a million dollars?

133
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,458
- No.
- Oh. What's your name, creepy panda?

134
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,489
I have chosen
the Earth name "Isis"

135
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,508
after the ancient Earth goddess.

136
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,369
- Ooh, do not love that.
- Name's no good anymore.

137
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,289
Fine. You may call me
by my native name,

138
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,349
- Nut, mother of Isis.
- Nope.

139
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,299
No Isis. Forget about Isis.

140
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,338
Now, each of you must choose
the object

141
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,268
that will activate your powers.

142
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,398
You must carry this object
with you at all times.

143
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,479
Fine. I'll pick
my birth control.

144
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,560
It'll remind me to take it.

145
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,299
Obviously choosing Bong Selleck.

146
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,299
- Not practical.
- You, Alex and Daisy,

147
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,289
are my fated guardians.

148
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,378
It is now your duty
to protect the entire universe.

149
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't say
anything about duty.

150
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,289
Duty.

151
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,249
We can't protect the universe.

152
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,690
We can barely take care
of ourselves.

153
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,318
I used a W-2 as a pad last week.

154
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,489
But you are warriors.

155
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,349
You said you killed three men
with a pencil.

156
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,419
What? Can't you get
someone else to do it,

157
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,258
or, like, do it yourself?

158
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,419
You're a god who can give
PowerPoints out of your butt,

159
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,458
so, should be pretty easy
for you.

160
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:44,278
In your world, I am merely
a helpless red panda,

161
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,469
with limited access
to my own powers.

162
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,328
This is your destiny
and yours alone.

163
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:52,359
And if you don't fulfill that
destiny, then your universe,

164
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,328
and everything in it,
everyone you have ever loved,

165
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,528
will die.

166
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:59,299
- That it?
- Did you think that was news?

167
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,318
That shit's, like,
definitely happening anyway.

168
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,268
Does she not know
about climate change?

169
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,409
You know what?

170
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,258
Let's just call animal control
from the coffee shop.

171
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,430
I guess I cleaned
my butthole for nothing.

172
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,448
The vibe in here

173
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,528
feels... different.

174
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:20,328
Hey, did you mix up the decaf
and regular or something?

175
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:23,249
Why is everyone so... so...

176
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,458
Chill?

177
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,328
- Oh, shit.
- Wait, you got possessed

178
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:34,258
by a disgusting monster after we
were doing it yesterday, right?

179
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,339
They're just relaxed.

180
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,258
I slipped them a little extra
CBD in their lattes.

181
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,388
Or maybe a lot extra.

182
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,438
Who needs all that pesky energy?

183
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,328
Once I finish collecting
their energy

184
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:52,469
in this crystal, my boss
will be one step further along

185
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,378
in his sinister plan.

186
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,059
- Why is she telling us this?
- I don't know.

187
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,419
Seems really unnecessary.

188
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,499
Say night-night
to your fellow freelancers,

189
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,289
because when this crystal
leaves your universe...

190
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,328
They'll die.

191
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,268
I tried to tell you.

192
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,549
When you said everyone
would die,

193
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,310
we didn't think you meant,
like, real people.

194
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,299
- Like, now.
- Can't you do something?

195
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,518
To reiterate, I am a panda.

196
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,388
- Oh, boy.
- We're really doing this.

197
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,489
Nope. No way. Definitely not.

198
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,570
We look like we're playing
figure skaters in a porno.

199
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:38,489
- Who designed these?
- I thought they were quite stylish.

200
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,398
I'm-a just put on a jacket
real quick.

201
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,508
I'm kind of chilly, too.

202
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,258
Let's do this.

203
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,359
♪ Go, go... ♪

204
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,278
Hey, buddy. Why so steamed?

205
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,388
Cold milk?

206
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:56,339
How's that for
certified barista experience?

207
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,388
Hey, would you watch
my laptop for a second?

208
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,470
Oh, yeah, I got you.

209
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,329
You know, CBD has been shown

210
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,308
to do wonders
for cellular regeneration.

211
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:16,249
Your pathetic attempts
won't stop me.

212
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,298
Girls, use your magical objects.

213
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,398
We have to say what?

214
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,538
Ugh, fine.

215
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,249
Bong Selleck Blood Force!

216
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,459
- Whoa.
- Shit. What was my thing again?

217
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,268
Birth Control Humor Time!

218
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,398
Oh, God. I think
I just got my period.

219
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,258
No!

00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,359
♪ Give me whatever you got... ♪

221
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,278
Hey, whoa. What a hero.

222
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,538
- Nice lats, dude.
- Take my bra.

223
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,308
What the hell?

224
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,288
How did he just get
the credit for that?

225
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:15,278
Is this thing gonna disappear?

226
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,268
Corpse disposal is not included.

227
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,279
- Seriously?
- Uh...

228
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,249
We just chopped up a dead body.

229
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,428
Don't think about it.
Bury it deep inside.

230
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:28,268
- Hey, millennials!
- Oh, fuck. The rent!

231
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,379
Uh, follow my lead.

232
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,268
Do you have my rent yet
or did you TikTok a picture

233
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,288
of your rent
and then Instagram it on Skype

234
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:37,369
and then put it on Facebook

235
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,469
- in between Twitter and, uh...
- About that.

236
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,349
We were just sitting here,
normally, on the couch,

237
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,369
not doing anything
and being totally normal,

238
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,538
and our garbage disposal
got all backed up.

239
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,369
Yeah. Obviously,
we can't pay rent

240
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,770
until the plumbing issues
are fixed.

241
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:53,339
- You understand.
- We'd hate to have to call 311

242
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,538
and report negligence.

243
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,469
: I swear to God,
if I was your mother...

244
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,418
Boom, baby. John Wick 3?

245
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,298
Ugh. It smells in here.

246
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,278
Like, those weird
microwave vegan patties.

247
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,428
If you would just try them once,

248
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,369
you would know that
they're actually delicious.

249
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,418
That reminds me.

250
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,308
I have a very specific
bamboo-based diet

251
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,398
I'll need you to procure.

252
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,428
I will provide you
with a list of ingredients

253
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:16,589
that can be purchased at your local nursery.

254
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:19,528
- Definitely not doing that.
- With what money?

255
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:21,649
Are you gonna be chipping in
on utilities, by the way?

256
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:24,288
Yeah, that kitty litter
you made us buy for you

257
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,528
- was mad expensive.
- Sacrifices must be made

258
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,538
to protect the universe.

259
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,459
Bullshit.
 You want to talk about sacrifice?

260
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,428
What happens if Bong Selleck
gets a crack in it?

261
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,249
What are we gonna do then?

262
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,890
Are you gonna get me
another Bong Selleck?

263
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,211
And by the way, can I even
still smoke out of Bong Selleck?

264
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:42,913
Have you ruined 
Bong Selleck for me?
