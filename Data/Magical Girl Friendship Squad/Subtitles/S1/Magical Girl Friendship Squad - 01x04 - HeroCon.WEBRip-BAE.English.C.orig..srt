00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,239
considering how many succulents
I've killed by accident.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,149

extra hard.

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,279
Okay, class.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,219
Let's, uh, come out
of the deep meditation

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,169
that I definitely
led you into on purpose.

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,319
I see you did not
make it out unscathed.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,349
Yeah. I guess the thing
broke skin.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,209
A laceration like that
from an otherworldly monster

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,109
is vulnerable
to otherworldly infections.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,430
Eh, don't sweat it.
I'll just take

19
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:02,169
one of my patented
hotbox showers.

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,189
They heal all wounds.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,299
I have seen your shower, and
it is a not a place of healing.

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,269
Oh, someone's fancy.

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,279
Let me guess,
you also think it's gross

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,219
that I stick my finger
in my belly button

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,189
- because I secretly love the smell.
- Ugh.

26
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,210
- You do that?
- No.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,079
Sup, slut?

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,189
What? Hello?

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,279
Nut was right.

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,160
This shower might as well
be caked in pure shit.

31
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,219
You filthy little piglet slut.

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,070
Oink.

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,279
Oh, crap.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,520
Quick, create a diversion
by throwing me down the stairs.

35
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,319
Hey, Lou-Lou.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,089
How's my favorite tenant?

37
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,099
Oh, I'm at a ten
out of ten... ant.

38
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,169
Good one, Alex.
See you at Mahjong later?

39
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,249
You know it, Lou-Lou girl.

40
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,189
I have never once seen
Lou-Lou laugh.

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,249
Is she about to evict us?

42
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,290
Or kill us?

43
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:58,319
- Or evict us and then kill us?
- No.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,169
She's just not pissed for once.

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,169
I've been making so much money
at Aggregon,

46
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,269
I paid our rent and Internet
through next month.

47
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,159
You what?

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,199
I am going after life
so hard right now.

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,099
I might even talk
to Coffee Dude today.

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,249
You what?

51
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,219
- Coffee Dude.
- Coffee... Lady.

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,249
What's up?
Working hard or hardly working?

53
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,119
Working pretty hard.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,319
- I just started a gig at Aggregon, actually.
- Wow.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,259
You got an Aggregig? Congrats.

56
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,199
Alex is riding this numbskull's
limp dick so hard

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,349
it's coming out of her nose.

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,319
She can't wait to wife him up

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,119
and move out of your crusty
skid mark of an apartment.

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,139
Did anybody hear that?

61
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,309
- Did someone just say something?
- I said,

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,339
- "What have you been up to?"
- I, uh, you know.

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,199
- Same old same.
- Wow, you're a fucking loser.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,099
Hey, screw you, man.
You're a loser.

65
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,780
- Whoa... Sorry, I-I d...
- Whoa, girl. Chill.

66
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:49,219
What the hell, dude?

67
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,219
It's these magical mushroom
things.

68
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,139
They're talking to me.

69
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,199
Dais, I know you're not
working right now,

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,069
but don't you think
it's a little early

71
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,279
in the day for shrooming?

72
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,259
Not those kinds
of magic mushrooms.

73
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,199
I'm not on drugs, Alex.
I'm sick.

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,069
Okay, geez.
Then go to the doctor.

75
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,590
You know I don't have
health insurance.

76
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,089
I mean, I would be
included on yours

77
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,159
if you hadn't selfishly
refused to marry me.

78
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,339
Uh, she's joking.
I am extremely unmarried.

79
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,189
Never been married.
Which is wild,

80
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,099
because I'd make
an amazing wife.

81
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,159
Just go to the urgent care
where your ex works.

82
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,189
Do you want
to hang out later sometime?

83
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,319
Not "sometime." Later?

84
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,129
Sure. That'd be cool.

85
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,129
I was so happy to hear from you.

86
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,339
Anything you need, anytime.

87
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,119
Even if it's 3:00
in the morning. Uh, really.

88
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,159
Look at this cut.

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,179
- Isn't it freaky?
- Your student loans

90
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,349
are getting bigger every second
you sit here, dipshit.

91
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,199
It's a pretty small cut. You
definitely don't need stitches.

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,139
See, piss-pube?
You're such a boring tote bag full of boogers

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,119
you can't even bleed
in a cool way.

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,199
You don't see this?

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,199
Can you really not hear
those tiny screams?

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,129
Do you want to go for a walk?

97
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,450
It-it might help to talk about it.

98
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,239
Uh, sunlight
is a great disinfectant.

99
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,279
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not!

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,069
I mean, I'm fine.

101
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,279
I'm fine. Thanks.

102
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,350
Well, she'd have
health insurance

103
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:08,129
if she hadn't
refused to marry me.

104
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,289
Okay, little mushrooms.

105
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,129
You're not real,
and you don't know me.

106
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,099
We know you're too cowardly
to tell your parents

107
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,089
you don't believe
in their turd-brained cult,

108
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,319
'cause then Mommy and Daddy
won't love you anymore.

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,239
Alex is gonna buy a condo

110
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,119
with her yuppie cloud-fucker
friends at Aggregon,

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,400
and you're going
to be all alone,

112
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:29,319
struggling to open a cold can
of beans for dinner.

113
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,269
Even your superpowers
aren't yours.

114
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,189
You have to get them
from a magical bong

115
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,069
because you're a pathetic stoner

116
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,950
with weirdly skinny ankles.

117
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:39,129
Daisy, is everything okay?

118
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,170
The duration of your shower
is approaching three hours.

119
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,129
I told you your cut could get
infected, and it appears it did.

120
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,129
You can see them. And hear them?

121
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,189
I can see them,
but only an infected host

122
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,289
can hear her parasites.

123
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,359
What are they?

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,249
They're so mean.

125
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,339
They are called Mushruminations.

126
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,329
As an immortal being,
I'm immune.

127
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,109
Cool flex. So what do I do?

128
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,119
Mushruminations are difficult
to eradicate.

129
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,109
The best tactic is confidence.

130
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,190
How can I be confident
when there's a voice in my ear

131
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,119
telling me that if David Bowie
were alive,

132
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,209
he'd think I was
a narc and a poser?

133
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,189
You cannot let
their attacks upset you.

134
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,109
They thrive on stress.

135
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,150
Okay, so I'll do what I usually
do when I'm stressed

136
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,431
and throw myself into a project.

137
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,169
Not exactly what I meant.

138
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,189
We also need to be sure
to contain the infection.

139
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,129
Who else have you had
physical contact with today?

140
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,299
Hi, can I try these on?

141
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,119
Thanks. Got to find
the perfect first date outfit.

142
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,129
Well, it might not be a date.
First hang.

143
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,490
But I don't want it to look
like I bought an outfit for him.

144
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,319
It's for me, so that I feel
confident. For him.

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,139
- You know?
- Yeah.

146
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,319
I don't think a new outfit

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,249
will help whatever's
going on with you.

148
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,069
She hates you.

149
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,119
She knows you're a spoiled
little mucus licker

150
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,109
who doesn't deserve to shop
in the regular price section.

151
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,069
Go back to the clearance rack
where you belong,

152
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,139
you stubby-fingered grub worm.

153
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,159
He probably only said
he'd go out with you

154
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,089
as part of a bet that he could
get the fugliest dork at school

155
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,130
voted prom queen
and he's gonna lose.

156
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,199
Daisy, what the hell?

157
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,259
Our apartment looks
like your DeviantArt page.

158
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,319
Why are you even home?

159
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,199
Shouldn't you be buying
fancy clothes

160
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,319
to impress
your precious coffee dude?

161
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,199
Why? Do you think he made a bet
about making me ugly prom queen?

162
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,159
Right. Because a prom queen like
you would never want to live

163
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,269
- with a pothead loser like me.
- Silence.

164
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,169
Can you not see
what is happening?

165
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,159
You are both being bled dry
by mushruminations.

166
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,269
Mushruminations?

167
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,209
A parasite from another
universe got into my cut.

168
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,069
- Keep up.
- What?

169
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,299
Oh, God, they're so loud
I can't even think!

170
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,249
I know where we can go to focus.

171
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,239
Third time's the charm, baby.

172
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,069
They keep saying I'm gonna screw
things up with Coffee Dude.

173
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,329
Him? I bet he's at home
right now jerking off,

174
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,069
just thinking about how lucky
he is to get to go out with you.

175
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,269
Aw, you think?

176
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,129
Whoa, cool.
What are yours saying?

177
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,069
That I'm dead weight around here
since you're paying the rent.

178
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,299
Too bad my girl Daisy knows
our value as human beings

179
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,339
isn't defined by our income.

180
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,149
- Am I right?
- Yeah!

181
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,169
Screw you, capitalist dicks!

182
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,179
The infection is eradicated

183
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
and just in time.

184
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,359
I did not want to worry you,

185
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,269
but mushruminations have
a tendency to spread quickly.

186
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,109
This could have been
quite disruptive.

187
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,179
I can't make this left.
I'm a terrible driver.

188
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,140
I-I shouldn't have dropped
out of culinary school.

189
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:40,374
- A-Are you mad at me?
- Are you mad at me?

190
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,249
Oh, shit.

191
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,259
Oh, there's no way we can
make this many people

192
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,069
suddenly feel confident,
outside of a Lizzo concert.

193
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,249
The colony must have a leader

194
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,329
who can call off
the mushruminations.

195
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,189
Most likely in an environment

196
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,239
reminiscent of their dank
and fetid home universe.

197
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,329
The subway.

198
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,239
You two go on ahead.
I-I trust you.

199
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,129
You just don't want
to get your fur dirty.

200
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,209
You're wasting valuable time.
Go, go, go, go.

201
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,069
♪ I'm deaf, I'm blind,
but I'm all right ♪

202
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,269
♪ I'm poor, I'm broke,
but I'm just fine ♪

203
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,319

in the gutter ♪

204
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,359

205
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,139

206
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,249

207
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,189
- Ew, sick. The smell.
- Oh, gross. The smell.

208
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,069
Oh, geez.
They really do spread fast.

209
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,470
What if this tunnel caves in
and we're squished into toe jam?

210
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:33,480
I'm never gonna be
as elegant as a chanterelle.

211
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,209
Why can we hear them down here?

212
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,339
Nut said only a host
can hear her own parasites.

213
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,269
I guess it's 'cause these guys
don't have a host.

214
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,189
- Where's your leader?
- We can't tell you,

215
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,390
you pimple-popping dump truck.

216
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:45,149
You'll try to forage her.

217
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,119
Don't flatter yourselves.

218
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,069
We just want to talk to her.

219
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,189
We'd never let anti-fungal
spit skanks like you

220
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,159
talk to Mama Mushroom.

221
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,349
In that case, sunlight can
be a great disinfectant.

222
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,279
- Goddamn it.
- Our spores.

223
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay. We'll take you to her.

224
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,309
This is as far
as we can take you.

225
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,069
Hey, Mama Mushroom!

226
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,349
You better call off
your mushroom goons or else.

227
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,279
Yeah. Or else...
we'll kick your ass.

228
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,199
Guess she wants to do this
the hard way.

229
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,290
Wait.

230
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,189
You're Mama Mushroom?

231
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,279
That's right,
you bitch-assed piss guzzlers.

232
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,299
We mushruminations
are from Hubris,

233
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,139
a universe where all life-forms

234
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,089
- are overconfident and foolhardly.
- Hmm.

235
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,169
In Hubris, mushrooms like me
protect and serve the ego.

236
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,349
We keep it in check.

237
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,189
You'd know that
if you weren't such

238
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,219
self-involved navel-slurpers.

239
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,229
Now we've formed a new home

240
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,079
in your universe,
to protect you.

241
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,069
Rewind. Protect us?

242
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,119
How is telling me
I'm the human equivalent

243
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,179
of a rotten egg fart
protecting me?

244
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,119
Well, what if you are the human
equivalent of a rotten egg fart?

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,299
Isn't it better to know?

246
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,069
- Not really.
- And why would you want to make us feel

247
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,590
like we're gonna
grow apart as friends?

248
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:07,299
Just so you can be ready
if it does happen.

249
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,189
Mama Mushy, you little dumbass.

250
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,089
You were trying to help us.
Badly.

251
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,370
Why don't we try
to get you home?

252
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:18,199
You would do that for me?

253
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,309
And for us. Mostly for us.

254
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,179
You don't know
how to do this, right?

255
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,189
Oh, no.
I'm totally bullshitting.

256
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,219
- Birth Control...
- Bong Selleck...

257
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,229
Friendship Portal?

258
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,269
Holy... shit.

259
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,329
It's... working!

260
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,279
Jesus, I'm actually grateful

261
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,319
to you two dingleberry fuck-nuggets.

262
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,319
And simultaneously prepared
for all the potential downsides

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,069
to this happy moment.

264
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,390
- Want to hear some of them?
- Nope.

265
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:52,384
Come on, my babies.

266
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,169
No, no, no. Come back!

267
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,309
Self-loathing
is my greatest motivator.

268
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,240
We're coming home, Mama!

269
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,349
Incredible.

270
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,069
How did you know
how to open a portal

271
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,159
to the precise universe
the mushruminations came from?

272
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,339
Uh...

273
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,199
They'll be fine, right?

274
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,159
Are you hungry?

275
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,119
Oh, my God.

276
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,209
I am so sorry. I totally forgot
about our date.

277
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,239
Not date. Hang. Whatever.

278
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,319
No, no, no. I'm relieved
you showed up at all.

279
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,289
I had this voice in my head
all day saying

280
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,189
- you were gonna stand me up.
- Really?

281
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,229
I get really insecure sometimes.

282
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,109
No one wants to date a guy with
these dumb, well-defined lats.

283
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,080
Come on in.

284
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,070
On second thought, let's go out.

285
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:52,894
