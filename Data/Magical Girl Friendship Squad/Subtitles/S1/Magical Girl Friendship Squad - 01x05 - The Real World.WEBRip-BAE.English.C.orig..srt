1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,540
♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,249
I have called this meeting

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,199
to discuss a pressing issue.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,249
This apartment is disgusting.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,389
- Looks fine to me.
- Actually, kind of neat today.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,319
I propose we adopt a solution

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,179
I saw employed on the program
The Real World:

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,319
a chore wheel.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,219
No fucking way.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,129
Wait... Yeah.
Why should we have to vacuum?

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,450
It's your fur
all over everything.

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,691
How many times must I remind you
about my lack of thumbs?

13
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,409
And yet, you can make
a chore wheel.

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,339
This is bullshit.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,269
I don't have to follow
your made-up rules,

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,219
- and I'm not gonna.
- Whoa, Dais. Chill.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,229
Daisy, growing up,
you were angry

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,269
that your parents
demanded your participation

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,409
in the Church of the Savior's
Unthinkable Torment.

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,219
Now you instinctively rebel
against authority.

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,379
And whose fault is that?

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,219
If I'm angry at anyone,
it should be you,

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,299
for making such
a fucked-up world!

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,409
Stupid mess, getting in the way
of my moody door slam.

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,229
Yikes.

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,309
Maybe I should stay home

27
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,830
from the women's empowerment
conference

28
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,279
- and make sure she's okay.
- Certainly not.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,480
This is an important opportunity
for you to gather intel

30
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,269
about Aggregon's
energy hoarding.

31
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,199
Why do you always have
to tell me the plan

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,389
I helped come up with?

33
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,409
Think she knows everything just
because she's a talking panda.

34
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,139
"For Nut only.

35
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,189
"Absolutely do not drink this,
Alex and Daisy,

36
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,129
even if we have an argument
and you want to get back at me."

37
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,129
Hmm. Weirdly specific.
This will show her.

38
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,450
"Ooh, I'm Nut, and I
know everything about Daisy.

39
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:39,279
"She's so predictable
just because her parents

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,129
"made her go to bed at 5:00 p.m.

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,129
"to shield her from
the gaudiness of street lamps.

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,490
"If I just
made the world a little better,

43
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:49,129
"Daisy could've been...

44
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,530
...totally different."

45
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,219
Hi, Corvin. I thought this
was only for female employees.

46
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,389
It's called being an ally.

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,269
You'll need to sign up now
for your afternoon elective.

48
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,390
Do you want the workshop
on pitching your voice deeper

49
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,159
to be taken more seriously,

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,249
the seminar
on the most slimming power poses

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,189
- or speed mentoring?
- Speed mentoring?

52
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,189
Two minutes each
with higher-level female execs

53
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,510
and,
since there aren't that many,

54
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,299
a few male execs' wives.

55
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,189
I'll do that one. I guess.

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,309
Where's all my stuff
that I keep on the floor?

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,339
It's on the shelves? Gross.

58
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,219
- Alex? Nut?
- Hey, sleepyhead.

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,299
Hey, random hookup.

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,309
Very funny.

61
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,379
It's me, Pansy.

62
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,399
Your monogamous,
live-in girlfriend?

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,299
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,159
Nut's magic tea made me basic?

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,320
Ready to go to your parents'?

66
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:50,299
My parents?
They're at their church bunker

67
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,500
preparing for the end of times
like every other weekend.

68
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:54,319
Um, no, they're next door.

69
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,219
We have lunch with them
every day.

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,159
Their stable marriage
is the model

71
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,319
that taught you
about relationships.

72
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,249
There's our favorite girls.

73
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,310
Who wants Arnold Palmers?

74
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,379
So, we eat lunch
and then do a flogging circle

75
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,399
as punishment
for nourishing ourselves?

76
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,339
No, silly. We play Scrabble.

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,189
You're a riot,

78
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,249
daughter whose kooky sense
of humor we fully appreciate.

79
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,320
Wow.
You're really, really normal.

80
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Daisy!

81
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,239
If it isn't my long-lost sister.

82
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,379
Gloriana.
Just calling to catch up.

83
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,339
Tell me what you need.

84
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,349
My human guardian drank the last
of my teleportation tea,

85
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,149
and now she's stuck
in your copycat world.

86
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,630
Can you please find her and give
her your tea to send her home?

87
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:47,259
Ooh, I'm kind of slammed today.

88
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,279
Fine, I'll offer the tea.

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,179
But I won't force her to take it

90
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,460
if she prefers my world
to yours.

91
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,279
Must everything
be a competition?

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,249
"Must everything
be a competition?"

93
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,179
We are not doing
the copycat game.

94
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,219
"We are not doing
the copycat game."

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,339
Okay. Love you.

96
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,179
Okay. Buh-bye.

97
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,339
So, what are your goals?

98
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,129
I just want to keep making
that cash money, right?

99
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,189
Speaking of goals,

100
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,430
what do you know about Aggregon

101
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,339
that may or may not be
public information?

102
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,209
I meant your personal goals.

103
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,259
If you want a family,
you better start planning now.

104
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,259
You know, employees
can freeze their eggs for free

105
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,389
in the Sandberg Ballroom.

106
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,319
- Uh...
- Ladies, switch mentors.

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,239
Hi, there. What do you know

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,640
about the company's
energy research?

109
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,129
Have you frozen your eggs yet?

110
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,199
Not that this company
isn't great for working moms.

111
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,179
They gave me two weeks
of maternity leave

112
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,129
and then replaced me
with another woman

113
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,259
and brought me back
as her assistant, so...

114
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,400
More jobs for women?

115
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,230
Hi. Uh, sorry to interrupt.

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,360
Oh. Uh, cool. Thanks.

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,399
I guess.

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,309
The free egg freezing
sounds cool.

119
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,309
Or like the company's
trying to get us all

120
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,249
to put off having babies
so we can keep working here.

121
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,399
Right?

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,359
Alex, is it?

123
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,179
Let me give you some advice.

124
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,329
Being a woman in a man's world
means making sacrifices.

125
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,199
Oh, totally.
I-I was just joking about...

126
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,480
You're in
the outrage department,

127
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,139
isn't that right?

128
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,309
Yeah. My background's
in programming, but...

129
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,379
Sounds like
you're being underutilized.

130
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,329
You know, the most important
aspect of leadership

131
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,369
is squeezing all you can
out of your employees.

132
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,309
They're the best resource
in the world.

133
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,200
Thanks. Um, I-I mean...

134
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,170
Move along.

135
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,379
Oops! Sorry.

136
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,139
BRB.

137
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,130
Bathroom break.

138
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,530
Hmm.

139
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,359
Nut.

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,249
Man, that was awesome.

141
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,610
I'm on such a high. Do you want
to go get a drink somewhere?

142
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:50,309
But now is when we sit
on the couch

143
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,249
and watch
our favorite network TV drama,

144
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,199
- NCIS: Minneapolis.
- Oh. O-Okay.

145
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,309
Ooh, Mission: Impossible's on.

146
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,129
Alex and I made up
this action movie drinking game

147
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,299
where you drink
anytime anyone does anything

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,460
that would hurt in real life.

149
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:07,349
Fair warning, you get fucked-up.

150
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,179
No! We have to follow
the schedule.

151
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,259
Okay, okay. Geez.

152
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,239
Who's Alex, anyway?

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,249
Nobody, I guess.

154
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,420
Oh, thank God. I'll get it.

155
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,289
- Nut?
- As if. I'm her sister.

156
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,259
What? Nut has a sister?

157
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,359
Who do you think created
this superior universe?

158
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,399
Fun fact: in my world,
red pandas aren't endangered.

159
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,309
So, Nut's "special tea"

160
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,369
brought me
into a universe you made?

161
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,359
And my "special tea"

162
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,219
is the only way
to send you back.

163
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,169
I may not have been to
the gynecologist in four years,

164
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,410
but I'm pretty sure this is not

165
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,454
how freezing your eggs works.

166
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,419
And there it is.

167
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,359
Nut thinks she's so great,

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,129
but her universe
is hideously flawed.

169
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,249
Look at your loony-tune parents.

170
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,129
- Or those fish that look like Ted Cruz's face.
- Fair.

171
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,269
Here,
there's no pesky free will,

172
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,359
and everything's perfect.

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,199
No offense, but I'd rather have
parents who don't get me

174
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,129
than ones
who are basically robots.

175
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,269
At least in Nut's universe,

176
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,349
I get to decide if I want
to obey the chore wheel.

177
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,179
Uh-oh.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

178
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,149
Daisy,
you have to get to EWWcon.

179
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,249
Aggregon is taking
workers' genetic material

180
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,129
and using it for...

181
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,129
Well, well, well. Our new hire

182
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,129
is some kind
of social justice warrior mole.

183
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,129
I knew there was something fishy
about you

184
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,349
when you failed to participate
in Tie-Dye Fri-Dyes.

185
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,129
Technically,
I didn't participate

186
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,450
because Tie-Dye Fri-Dye
is stupid.

187
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:54,139
How dare you!

188
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,860
So, you knew the company
was making these...

189
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:58,139
things out of employees' eggs?

190
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,299
Did I know?

191
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,169
Honey, whose initiative
do you think it was?

192
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,239
And you go-getter gals
have been donating eggs

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,289
all day!

194
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,399
Have fun!

195
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,359
Normcore Daisy sucks.

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,169
She doesn't even have
a nonmagic bong.

197
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,389
Classic Nut to give
random humans magical powers

198
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,249
- to protect her.
- I'm not a random human.

199
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,169
Being Nut's guardian
is my destiny.

200
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,389
Oh, I'm sorry!

201
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,299
I hit an adorable, fuzzy panda.

202
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,420
That's, like, the first sign
of being a serial killer.

203
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,319
"Destiny"?
Did Nut tell you that?

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,139
Free will
means destiny is bullshit.

205
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,409
Nut lied to you
to get what she wanted.

206
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,399
You know what?
For an adorable, fuzzy panda,

207
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,219
you're kind of a bitch.

208
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,350
Girl, bye.

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,239
Damn.

210
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,560
I go to another world
for one day,

211
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,249
and you start a fight
with a bunch of...

212
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,399
- What are these things?
- Where the hell were you?

213
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,139
Bong Selleck Laser Light Show!

214
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,249
"Oh, thanks for saving my butt,
Daisy.

215
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,410
I know you probably had
your own stuff going on today."

216
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,129
I called you, like, nine times.

217
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,770
I've been battling these freaks
all alone.

218
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,289
Birth Control, Abort Operation!

219
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,149
Cover me.

220
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,249
Bong Selleck Cloud Cover!

221
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
♪ Must be nice ♪

222
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,139

224
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,280
Hasta la vista, ladies.

225
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,279
Sorry, everyone.

226
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,199
The egg freezer's out of order.

227
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,320
Do whatever you want with
your eggs. It's your choice.

228
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,354
Come on. I called Nut before
when I couldn't reach you.

229
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,329
Status report.

230
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,259
There was a minor security blip

231
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,380
courtesy of a nosy new hire,

232
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,379
but I took care of it.

233
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,179
It doesn't appear you did.

234
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,129
I'll handle her right now.

235
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,199
Don't bother.
I will handle it myself.

236
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,169
Your incompetence
is too great a risk

237
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,269
as we near the final stage
of my plan.

238
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,129
Effective immediately,

239
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,279
your contract here

240
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,339
is terminated.

241
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,259
But, Verus,
I made an army for you.

242
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,250
- I can do better. I...
- Terminated.

243
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,259
Shit got wild in there, Nut.

244
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,379
Corvin texted Verus

245
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,399
- about some kind of mutant army, and...
- Verus?

246
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,149
Alex, listen to me.
Verus is extremely dangerous.

247
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,199
Hey, Nut.

248
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,399
Gloriana told me you lied.

249
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,219
We were never fated
to protect you.

250
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,380
You could have chosen anyone.

251
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:00,389
Nut, is that true?

252
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,279
Yes, I did choose you
more or less at random,

253
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,219
but you have proven yourselves
worthy guardians.

254
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,380
Not the point. You guilted us

255
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:10,259
into thinking
we were the world's only hope.

256
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,359
You put us in danger
over and over.

257
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,169
And I still don't want
a chore wheel!

258
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,359
- It is not safe for you at Aggregon.
- Just...

259
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,370
leave us alone, Nut.

260
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,249
Alex.

261
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,129
Oh. Hi, Ver...

262
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,239
The position
of my executive assistant

263
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,199
has suddenly become available,

264
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
and I'd like to offer it to you.

265
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:34,379
I'm flattered, but I...

266
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,239
Before you answer,
you should know

267
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,169
that Corvin has been let go

268
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,409
for his unconscionable
egg freezing program.

269
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,169
This company hasn't always been
squeaky clean.

270
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,249
I'm offering you the chance to
change that from the inside.

271
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,399
Your destiny
is still unwritten.

272
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,209
If I take this promotion,

273
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,359
you and I can change Aggregon
for the better.

274
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,380
Of course.
Don't you want me as a mentor?

275
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,580
Deal.

276
