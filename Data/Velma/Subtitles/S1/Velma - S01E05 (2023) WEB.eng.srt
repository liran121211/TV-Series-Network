00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,839
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,400
I like you.

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:09,719
That's hilarious.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,559
Wait. Norville.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,080
Your joke worked, you genius!

6
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,200
Keep making me laugh.

7
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:17,840
No, Velma, wait!

8
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,119
I'm here because I want you.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,319
That book you gave me

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,239
opened my eyes
to your inner beauty.

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,439
Hey, watch where you're going.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,600
Gigi?

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,080
Hi.

14
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,799
Norville,
I've definitely
been here before.

15
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,359
I feel like
all the answers to my questions

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,279
about my parents are in there.

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,239
The bathrooms?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,599
Wait. I mean in there.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,759
<i> Okay,</i>
<i>so you know that thing</i>
<i>when you text your friends</i>

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,119
<i>and they don't text you back,</i>

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,639
<i>so it feels like</i>
<i>you're gonna die?</i>

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,159
<i>Well, if my friend</i>
<i>didn't text me back,</i>

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,599
<i>I actually was going to die.</i>

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,119
<i>Because Norville</i>
<i>was ghosting me,</i>

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,159
<i>and my hallucinations</i>
<i>had gotten so bad,</i>

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,880
<i>I couldn't even look</i>
<i>at my murder board</i>
<i>without having one.</i>

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,320
<i>Sure, Daphne could have</i>
<i>helped me find my mom.</i>

28
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:09,840
<i>But when I was with her...</i>

29
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,839
<i>...the only mystery</i>
<i>I wanted to solve</i>

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,159
<i>was the case</i>
<i>of the missing inhibitions.</i>

31
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,559
Dad, I need a ride to school.

32
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,399
Norville's MIA,
and my walking pace
attracts vultures.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,599
Sorry, no time.
Baby's coming home tomorrow

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,800
so I need to clean...

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,599
...before heading
to the hospital

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,399
for Sophie's
postpartum photoshoot
with the nursing staff.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm gonna be there all night.

38
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,999
Hold up.
You're leaving me home alone

39
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,919
with a murderer on the loose?

40
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,079
Even though I was voted
most likely to be murdered
before any of this?

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,799
You won't be alone, Velma.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,200
You have
the marching band sleepover
in the school gym tonight.

43
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,359
The marching band sleepover?

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,199
Ugh, Norville really has
abandoned me
at my lowest moment.

45
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,599
This sleepover's
gonna be so tight.

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,479
Wait until you see
how much pizza I eat.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
I can eat three slices.

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,519
Hey, sorry to interrupt,
but have you seen Norville?

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,639
Tall, um...

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,240
Blue eyes, maybe?

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>Good morning, students.</i>

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,279
<i>This is Principal Rogers.</i>

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,159
<i>I'm here with Mayor Dave</i>
<i>and the Sheriff.</i>

54
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
<i> Everybody, listen up!</i>

55
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,239
<i>We just learned someone</i>
<i>somewhere is being intolerant.</i>

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
Jesus, Ed.

57
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,520
Just say your thing
before they stop listening.

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,159
Hello, students.
This is your cool mayor,
Mayor Dave.

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,320
So, uh, since assigning
personal police details
to the hottest of you,

60
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,279
we've been getting
a little push back

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
on the police presence
in school.

62
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,280
<i>But fun twist!</i>
<i>It's from the police.</i>

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,959
I just rear ended a cop.

64
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,400
In fact, the officers on detail
have all resigned,

65
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,159
citing unrelenting
sexual harassment.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,720
Now, in place of
the police details,

67
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:55,400
we'll now be instituting
a citywide curfew

68
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,359
at 9:00 p.m. tonight,
for everyone.

69
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,080
<i>You're caught outside,</i>
<i>you'll spend the night in jail.</i>

70
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,439
<i>Be warned. Our deputy</i>
<i>is working on his stand up set.</i>

71
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,039
<i>This also means</i>

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,839
<i>several school events</i>
<i>will be canceled,</i>

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,319
<i>-including...</i>
-Band sleep over!

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,399
<i>...the track meet...</i>

75
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,400
<i>...the Parent's Association's</i>
<i>Find the Asbestos</i>
<i>Service night</i>

76
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,399
<i>and the marching band</i>
<i>sleepover.</i>

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,599
Yes!

78
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,440
Okay, baby Daphne.

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm going to the Crystal Mines,
and I'm not coming back

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,039
until I figure out who I am
and where I come from.

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,479
Or six. Our moms are home
by six, so I'll be back
before then.

82
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,159
Sorry, sign, but hot people
are cut too much slack
to heed warnings.

83
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,079
Ah, that's fine.
Bats are just flying rats.

84
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,079
Ground bats, yuck!

85
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,559
Oh, hey, Fred,
have you seen Norville?

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,039
I need him
to help me investigate.

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,959
No, but I have found a way
to make you like me.

88
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,400
Check it out.

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,079
And as if this isn't enough,

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,640
I will also win your heart

91
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,039
by proving
I am a helpful ally, sister.

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,560
Look, I'm glad reading
<i>The Feminine Mystique</i>
caused a little growth.

93
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,480
Shush, a feminist is speaking,

94
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,079
and he listened to your theory

95
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,920
about your mom
going missing at his house

96
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,280
and actually found something.

97
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,879
Wait, you did?
And this isn't just

98
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,000
you thinking I'm related
to your nanny again, is it?

99
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,399
No.

100
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,160
There were some papers
in Father's special drawer,

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,480
where he keeps his men's
work out magazines.

102
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,400
Turns out,
our house used to be owned

103
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,799
by a woman
named Dr. Edna Perdue,

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
Dr. Edna Perdue
was a female neurologist.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,119
You don't need
to say female, Velma.

106
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,999
You can just say neurologist.

107
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
Ah! She died in
the Crystal Cove insane asylum,

108
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,159
after conducting ethically
dubious experiments?

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,639
Fred, your house
was owned by a mad scientist.

110
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:01,239
Now I have to find Norville.

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,599
Oh, he's probably
tangling retainers
with his girlfriend.

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
Girlfriend?

113
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,719
Norville!
You have a girlfriend?

114
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,359
No.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,879
And your girlfriend is Gigi?

116
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,640
Damn, this makes me think
I could bag Don Lemon.

117
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,519
How did this happen?
I thought you were missing.

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,199
It's all thanks to you, Velma.

119
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,280
I always thought
I was just regular hot,

120
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,640
but you gave me the confidence
to be artsy hot.

121
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:23,400
So you're not mad, Velma?

122
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,639
Sometimes it's unclear
until I'm sitting
on a thumb tack.

123
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,279
Mad? No, I'm so excited.
Now you have Gigi

124
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,840
to talk about boring stuff
like your swords and feelings.

125
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,119
So, when we're together,

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,439
we can focus solely
on finding my mom.

127
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,919
-Speaking of, Fred's house--
-Stop, Velma.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,679
Look, Gigi and I have decided

129
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,279
that maybe I should
spend less time with you.

130
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,519
Less time?

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,959
But I only see you
when I need you as is.

132
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
Sorry, Velma.

133
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,440
But until Norville learns
to stand up for himself,

134
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,120
he's gonna do exactly as I say.

135
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,040
I see.

136
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,479
Fine, great.

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,519
No sweat off my under boob.
It's not like I need him.

138
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,839
Fred can help me
not hallucinate
by making me laugh.

139
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,719
Velma, give me the chance
and I can help you
with anything.

140
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,440
Uh, well, except
filling in your ethnicity
on a form.

141
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm guessing Samoan?

142
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,239
Who... Who are you?

143
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,479
We're your parents, Daphne.

144
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,799
My parents?

145
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,680
Why are you so hairy?

146
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,959
Wait, are you Brooklyn guys?

147
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,159
Oh, oh! Sorry.

148
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,599
We should have explained
that these are costumes.

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,239
We need to hide our identity
until we can trust you.

150
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,159
Until you can trust me?

151
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,559
I'm not the one
dressed like something
pulled out of the shower drain.

152
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,560
Also, if you even
are my parents,

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,800
you abandoned me.

154
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,639
You weren't abandoned, Daphne.

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,439
Your moms stole you from us.

156
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,199
What? No, they didn't.

157
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,840
They found me
wrapped in a blanket
in the middle of a cornfield.

158
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,319
Uh, okay.

159
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
But if you don't believe
we're your parents,

160
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,880
look up the Crystal Mines gang
on Netscape Navigator.

161
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,199
Netscape Navigator? Good Lord!

162
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,839
How long have you been in here?

163
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,439
Hello?

164
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,160
Hello.

165
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,679
Did you really
just do an Irish exit?

166
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,000
Huh, maybe we are related.

167
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,200
<i>Remember, tonight's curfew</i>
<i>is at 9 p.m.,</i>

168
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,839
<i>and</i> The Bachelor's
<i>brilliant finale is at 10:00.</i>

169
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,440
<i>So, no messing around!</i>

170
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,959
So, we're going to
the Hysterical Society?

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,279
Then why would you need my help
making you laugh?

172
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,199
It's Historical Society.

173

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,199
learn which white actors are
descended from slave owners.

175
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,919
If there's any record
of Dr. Perdue, it'll be here.

176
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:28,439
So, you're friends
with our favorite docent,
Norville.

177
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,719
We're so happy he's found Gigi,

178
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,479
especially after wasting years
pining for that bossy one.

179
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,160
What was her name? Meatball?

180
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,079
I actually heard
Meatball was really cool
and beautiful.

181
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,919
Well, all we have
are Dr. Perdue's old journals.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is the one place she felt
no one would ever find them.

183
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,360
99.9% of our visitors are
people looking for a bathroom.

184
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,840
The journals are missing.

185
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,360
Well, the last person
to look at them was, uh...

186
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,799
Diya Dinkley.

187
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,919
What?

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,760
My mom was researching
a mad scientist?

189
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,279
And then disappeared
at her house? Why?

190
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,799
Oh, God!
Fred, I'm hallucinating!

191
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,840
Quick, make me laugh
like Norville would have.

192
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,680
I would. But all I can
think of right now
is the gender pay gap.

193
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,119
Is it funny?

194
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,280
Women make 20% less than men.

195
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,960
And women of color even less.

196
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,680
I can't stop laughing.

197
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,919
Ah, does anyone
have a defibrillator?

198
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,120
Stop, you could lose a finger.

199
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,640
And you helping me
isn't working.

200
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,880
I need Norville back.

201
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,839
I literally
just died without him.

202
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
Well, almost died.

203
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,199
Still, if I can separate
reality dating shows'
exploitation of women

204
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,159
from my obsessive need
to watch them,

205
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,079
I can separate
Gigi from Norville.

206
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,839
I have no choice
but to lure him

207
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,159
to the one place
no girlfriend would ever go.

208
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
Oh, ooh! Let me guess.

209
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,479
Cigar lounge.
His dad's woodshop.

210
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,959
World War II museum?

211
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,039
No. My dad and stepmom
are out of the house tonight,

212
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,840
so I'm gonna host
a little get together.

213
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,119
Looks like the marching band
sleepover just got uncanceled.

214
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,360
May God have mercy on my soul.

215
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,279
Okay, remember
to take your pill with food,

216
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,280
and absolutely
no getting murdered
after curfew, young lady.

217
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,960
Band members only. You got ID?

218
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
Okay, listen up, nerds.

219
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,719
We gotta keep it tidy.

220
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,719
My dad's girlfriend
is a total OCD SOB.

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,679
And she's bringing
a baby home tomorrow.

222
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,320
So, if any of youse
need to empty your spit valves,
do it in this.

223
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,839
Was there
anything else, Sophie?

224
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,880
Uh, yeah, a lot, actually.

225
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,480
Oh, right.
Don't break anything.

226
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,280
Sophie will have a heart attack
and die.

227
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,959
And then I'd have
to help with the baby
until we find a nanny.

228
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,720
Velma!

229
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,839
<i> What was that?</i>

230
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,440
Nothing, bye.

231
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,960
Fred, you're not
allowed in here.

232
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,519
I know, I know.
I'm not in band.

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Thank God.
I'd rather kiss a toilet.

234
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,239
But speaking
of kissing toilets,

235
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,719
I still wanna win your heart
by helping you.

236
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,359
Fred, I gave you a chance.

237
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,999
I died-- Hey, don't eat that!

238
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,960
That's baking soda,
you filthy animal!

239
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
But you don't have any food.

240
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,879
And a marching band sleepover
without food

241
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,199
is like a theater sleepover
without horny undertones.

242
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,119
Crap! I forgot to order pizzas.

243
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,960
On it.

244
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,120
Your friends will remember this
as the best marching band
sleepover ever.

245
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,480
Move it, loser.

246
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,639
The Crystal Mines gang
was comprised

247
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,039
of former employees
of the Crystal Mines
Mining Experience,

248
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,319
<i>who banded together</i>
<i>when the mines shuttered</i>
<i>in the early '90s.</i>

249
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,879
Mine's closed.
Everyone's fired.

250
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,160
<i> The gang of newly</i>
<i>unemployed workers</i>
<i>stayed behind,</i>

251
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,800
<i>using the mine's old tour boats</i>

252
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,519
<i>to travel beneath</i>
<i>the streets of Crystal Cove,</i>

253
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,799
<i>conducting robberies</i>
<i>for years, undetected.</i>

254
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,400
<i>By the time Detectives Linda</i>
<i>and Donna Blake</i>

255
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,799
<i>brought the gang to justice,</i>

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,439
it had grown to 20 members,

257
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,400
including one infant.

258
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,759
Oh, my God!

259
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,920
Genetically, I'm a villain.

260
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:19,560
No wonder I'm attracted
to a girl who looks
like a little henchman.

261
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,159
Why are you
dropping me off here?

262
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,759
Velma's house is a block away.

263
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,119
Oh, no, I don't want to be seen
near your band friends.

264
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,559
As principal,
I have a reputation to uphold.

265
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,079
You understand, right?

266
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,159
Totally. I could stay home
for curfew if that's easier.

267
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,159
Night to ourselves!

268
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,120
Time to get freaky!

269
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,720
Band members only, Red.

270
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,599
But I need to talk to Velma.

271
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,880
Hey, have you guys
never seen a girl before?

272
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,239
You're pitching tents like
I'm launching a sneaker line.

273
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,359
Daphne?

274
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,040
Velma, I may have
found my real--

275
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,560
You haven't seen Norville,
have you?

276
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,039
He's like
the only dork in town,

277
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
-not inside my house.
-No, but---

278
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,560
Trumpet!

279
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,239
Do not use that plunger
as a mute.

280
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,560
That's how Ebola happened.

281
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,879
Velma, wait.

282
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,480
Norville!

283
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,439
You're not gonna believe this,
but I may have found
my birth parents.

284
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,600
No way. Tell me every detail.

285
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,400
Sorry, I just need
to borrow this guy

286
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
for one second.

287
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,480
Okay, Norville. I understand
that for some reason,

288
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,200
you've chosen Gigi,
a beautiful girl who puts out,
over your angry friend.

289
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,520
But I have a clue about my mom,
and I can't research it
without you.

290
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Please.

291
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Oh, I... I guess I can help
with one clue.

292
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,040
Thank you.

293
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,240
But make it fast.
It sounds like
Gigi just got here.

294
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,119
Gigi?

295
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,960
Stop.

296
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,280
What the hell
are you doing here, Gigi?

297
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,439
Hot girls aren't in band.
They're in choir.

298
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,159
I know, but Norville made
band sound so fun,

299
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
I didn't wanna miss out.

300
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,400
So, one call to
the registrar and voila!

301
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,799
It's pronounced viola,
you idiot,

302
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,400
and that's an orchestra thing.

303
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,000
I know that. And let me guess.

304
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,159
You play bassoon.

305
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,039
How dare you?

306
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm a flutatist.

307
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,359
Interesting.

308
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,800
So am I.

309
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,919
So how about
we have a little flute-off?

310
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,759
If I win, I stay.

311
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,920
And if I win,

312
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,880
Norville does
whatever I say, forever.

313
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,080
And do I get to weigh in?

314
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,239
No!

315
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,519
Flute, flute, flute!

316
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,319
Ah, so good, babe,
I support you.

317
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,679
Everybody duck.

318
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,800
There's about to be
a drive-by fluting.

319
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,879
Should we stop them?
Devon just unplugged
his cochlear implants.

320
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,159
We survived!

321
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,759
-Was that jazz?
-Totally flute battle ever!

322
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,239
Gigi wins!

323
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,759
Hey.

324
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,480
Just checking in on the pizza.

325
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,280
Do we have an ETA
on when we can E-A-T?

326
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,720
I do. In two seconds,
you're gonna eat my fist.

327
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,079
But I need to take a pill
with food.

328
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,520
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

329
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,600
Me, too.

330
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm sorry. I hate to do this,
but I'm trying to impress

331
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,999
a very smart,
very stout young woman.

332
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,719
So, when I say
quadruple meat,
I mean quadruple meat.

333
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
Make them again!
And untie those garlic knots.

334
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,200
She likes breadsticks.

335
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,440
Can I help you?

336
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,639
Look, let's cut the crap.

337
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,679
Norville was mine
way before he was yours.

338
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,319
So I'm only gonna
say this once.

339
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,239
Please, please,
please let Norville help me.
I need him.

340
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,960
Please.

341
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,080
Hey, Daph. Since curfew
has us stuck inside all night,

342
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,000
you wanna set up
the old silk screener, huh?

343
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,959
Maybe throw
some vacation photos
on the tote bag?

344
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,320
Actually, I was hoping
we could talk about
the story of my adoption.

345
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,439
What's to talk about?

346
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,440
It's like we've always said.

347
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,480
We found you wrapped
in a blanket

348
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,919
in the middle of a cornfield.

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,159
Right. So I was just
lying on the ground or...

350
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,039
No...

351
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,359
You were in a crater.

352
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,080
You know, the way
you're talking in unison

353
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,760
makes this feel
kind of rehearsed.

354
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,760
It's not rehearsed, sweetie.

355
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,319
This is the true story
of your adoption.

356
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,920
So my origin
is the exact same as Superman?

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
We don't know who that is.

358
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,039
Look, I'm simply
proposing we share Norville.

359
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,360
I get him Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, and whenever
I have a casual whim.

360
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,360
Velma, Norville isn't something
you share like a sandwich.

361
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,040
Who shares a sandwich?

362
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,159
Do you even know
what's going on with
his family right now?

363
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,840
What? Are their matching
Christmas pajamas
on back order?

364
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,119
Yes! But also... Sorry.

365
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,559
I promised Norville
that I wouldn't talk about it
with you.

366
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,680
With me?

367
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,320
But Norville
tells me everything.

368
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,600
I have to go.

369
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,999
Norville would be mad
if you even knew I knew.

370
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:03,959
Bye!

371
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,560
Oh, wait. That!

372
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,759
-No, I know about that.
-Wait.

373
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
You do? He told you?

374
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,999
He did.
And honestly, I'm shocked
he told you, given...

375
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,079
Given what?

376
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,679
You know. Your... you know.

377
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,359
Are you sure
we're talking about
the same thing?

378
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,280
I haven't been this positive
since my scoliosis test,

379
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,960
but the only way
to know for sure

380
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,479
is if we say it
at exactly the same time.

381
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,119
Well, that seems smart.

382
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,520
Dr. Edna Perdue
is your grandmother?

383
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,520
You know my mom
went missing when she was
researching her house.

384
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,360
Gigi, I swore you to secrecy.

385
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,479
You placed your hand
on your verified checkmark
and everything.

386
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,399
How could you tell Gigi
and not me?

387
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,560
You tell me everything.

388
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,160
I don't always listen,
but still.

389
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,479
I can't talk about this.

390
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,760
I never should have trusted
either of you.

391
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,720
Norville.

392
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,679
Oh, my God, Velma, I did it.

393
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,039
For the first time in my life,

394
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,880
I didn't bungle a task
so badly that

395
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,040
it needs to be covered up
by an Israeli security firm.

396
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,800
It's okay, it's okay.

397
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,040
This is just what they call
Detroit style pizza.

398
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,680
<i> Curfew time!</i>

399
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,919
<i>Last one inside</i>
<i>is a person of interest.</i>

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,839
And now
it's basically Dominoes.

401
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,120
Well, I tried,
but only got halfway there.

402
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,280
That's just me living up
to my label as a male feminist.

403
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,920
Well, curfew started,

404
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,560
and you're stuck here
all night, Norville.
So spill it.

405
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:28,880
How is my mom's disappearance
related to your grandma?

406
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,359
I can't talk about it.

407
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,200
I just learned about it
a few days ago,

408
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,120
and the truth
could ruin my mom's life.

409
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,720
Your mom's
a high school principal

410
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,400
married to
a guidance counselor.

411
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,760
It can't get
more ruined than that.

412
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:40,919
What the hell!

413
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,480
Hey, I told you
not to mess up my house.

414
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,719
I'll be disowned.

415
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,399
And I'm too old
and mouthy to be adopted.

416
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,439
This is what happens
when we don't take our pills.

417
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,640
We gotta feed these nerds now
or my house will be destroyed.

418
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
Wait, I found a bag of salad.

419
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,120
Velma, don't.

420
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,480
These are band nerds.

421
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,760
They subsist on energy drinks
and chips.

422
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,799
You give them something green,
they could die.

423
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,240
Well, if it has
to be unhealthy,

424
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,519
then what about Spooners?

425
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,839
The health inspector
called it "I quit"

426
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,879
Well, that could work,
but no one's allowed outside
right now.

427
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,280
I am the mayor.

428
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,640
Except for cops.

429
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,239
Fred, you're a genius.

430
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,079
Yes, I've finally helped you.

431
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,999
So, are you into me now
or what?

432
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,040
We could take Daphne's moms'
cop car to Spooners
to get food there.

433
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,639
Unfortunately, I don't drive.

434
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,799
And Fred doesn't drive,
and Gigi doesn't drive.

435
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,080
And Norville, in light of
the recent revelation that
I take advantage of you,

436
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,520
I couldn't expect you
to do this for me.

437
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,160
So... Oh, well,
it was almost a good idea.

438
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,720
Guess my house
will just get destroyed.

439
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,120
No.

440
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,920
- I'll do it.
- No!

441
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,279
Norville, I told you
if you do any more
simping for her,

442
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,879
we're through.

443
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,400
Gigi, I am not doing this
because I'm simping for Velma.

444
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,959
I'm doing this
because it's the right thing
to do.

445
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm simping for myself.

446
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh, yuck!

447
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,079
I just need someone
to get the keys to the car
from Daphne.

448
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,399
Me? But I do
everything around here.

449
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,520
Join us.

450
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,720
Velma, finally!

451
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,680
You're literally
the only person
I can talk to right now,

452
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,840
- and I'm freaking out.
<i>- Okay, it's okay.</i>

453
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,919
Calm down. I'm here,
and all I wanna do is help you.

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,759
- Really?
<i>- Yes.</i>

455
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,359
<i>Immediately after you do me</i>
<i>a huge favor.</i>

456
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,760
Thank you so much, Daphne,

457
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,680
and whatever's going on
with you, just put it in a text

458
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,160
and I promise I'll give it
a thumbs up by Monday
at the earliest.

459
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,199
All right,
let's get out of here.

460
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,079
Those roaches are not happy
we're stealing their homes.

461
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,960
Wait, hold on.
We need to go back.

462
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,639
I wanna write an IOU
for the food.

463
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,159
There's no time!
You'll get caught.

464
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,480
Sorry, I have no choice.

465
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,159
I mean, if we don't support
a small business

466
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,440
owned by a woman of color,
who will?

467
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,920
Wow, Norville.

468
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,879
You're not just
a better friend than I am,

469
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,439
you're a better person.

470
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,520
And I give homeless people
hella nickels.

471
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,360
<i>So, I hear they're giving out</i>
<i>free Katy Perry tickets</i>

472
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:26,200
<i>to serial killers</i>
<i>over at the police station.</i>

473
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,039
<i>Sounds like a good deal.</i>
<i>You might wanna check it out.</i>

474
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,720
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
I can't go back to jail.

475
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,359
I still owe my cell mate
notes on his screenplay.

476
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,920
Don't worry,
you guys head home.

477
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,120
I'll distract Sheriff Cogburn.

478
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,800
But, Velma,
you could go to jail.

479
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,839
You'd hate it.
They spend an hour outdoors
every day.

480
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,119
It's only for one night.

481
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,119
And you'd do it for me.

482
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,760
Wow. Thanks.

483
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,759
Just get out of here
before I change my mind.

484
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:58,440
Wait! I changed my mind.

485
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,279
Now I changed it back.
Go, quick.

486
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,120
Hey! Hey, you there!

487
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,159
Hey, Cogburn.

488
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,000
What the...

489
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,439
I'm out past curfew,

490
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,600
and I think
the movie<i> Serpico</i> is boring.

491
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:09,879
What are you gonna do
about that?

492
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,479
Gotcha!

493
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,880
Principal Rogers?

494
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,759
Oh, my God,
I have to post this.

495
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,639
What will it take for you
to not do that?

496
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,679
<i> Hello.</i>

497
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,040
<i>Welcome to the Crystal Mines</i>
<i>Mining Experience.</i>

498
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,840
<i>I'm Casey Kasem,</i>

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,160

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,879
Oh, man.

501
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
Oh, no. We're too late.

502
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,560
Rise and shine!
You're all free to go.

503
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:02,080
Since you didn't
post that picture,

504
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,840
be in my office Monday morning.

505
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,479
I'll tell you everything I know
about my mom, Dr. Edna Perdue.

506
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,520
Great.

507
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,040
Welcome home, Amanda.

508
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,360
If you think
the outside is clean and tidy,

509
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,039
you ain't seen nothing.

510
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,119
Isn't that right, Velma?

511
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,000
What?

512
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,559
Oh, that's so cute.

513
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
And don't worry,
Velma will clean it up.

514
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,239
<i> Dear Velma,</i>
<i>sorry the band made</i>
<i>such a mess.</i>

515
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,760
<i>Gigi wants you to know</i>
<i>that Norville did not clean</i>
<i>your house for you.</i>

516
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,880
<i>Norville did, however, threaten</i>
<i>to shove our instruments</i>
<i>up our butts</i>

517
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,159
<i>if we didn't clean it.</i>
<i>Musically, yours.</i>

518
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,799
<i>The marching band.</i>

519
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Velma, what the hell
happened to your teeth?

520
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:01,399
<i> This first factoid</i>

521
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,879
<i>goes out to Jenny L. in--</i>

522
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,319
Welcome home, Daphne.

523
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,039
I'm your mother, Caroll.

524
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,359
And I'm your father, Darren.

525
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:16,560
And this is
the Crystal Mines Gang.

526
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,079
Yeah, sorry.

527
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,999
I'd be lying if I said
you'll get used to that.
