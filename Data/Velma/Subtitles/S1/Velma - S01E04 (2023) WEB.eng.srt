1
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:07,639
<i> Previously on</i> Velma.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,520
Guilty.

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,759
Based on what?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,080
I'm saving money
to hire a private investigator

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,159
to find my biological family.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,000
Norville, guess what
Daphne gave me?

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,639
Uh, is it mononucleosis?

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,679
Because I saw you two
kiss last night.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,799
Honestly, I think
what I really need is a friend.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,120
Me too.

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,200
But also maybe
a friend who found who--

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,599
No.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,360
Let's just keep it simple
and try and be friends again.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Yeah, you're right.

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,400
<i> Now, this may be hard</i>
<i>to believe,</i>

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,440
<i>but I was never that popular.</i>

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>I just never seemed</i>
<i>to really fit in</i>

18
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,680
<i>with the other girls.</i>

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,799
Ugh, weirdo.

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>Which was fine.</i>

21
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,320
<i>I always took pride</i>
<i>in not fitting the mold.</i>

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,959
Oh God!

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,479
<i>And while you'd think a brush</i>
<i>with a serial killer</i>

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
<i>might have brought us</i>
<i>all together...</i>

25
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,199
Well, it's official.

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,519
Two weeks
without a murder, y'all.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
<i>...you'd have thought wrong.</i>

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,319
Ugh. I hate hot girls.

29
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,359
Except Daphne.

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,800
Help! Help!

31
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,600
I just found another
dead girl killed

32
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,080
in exactly the same way
as the others.

33
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,280
Well, great.

34
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,839
A $10,000 banner
down the drain.

35
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,400
Another dead girl?

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
So I got good news

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,119
and I got bad news.

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,279
The good news,
as this new girl was murdered

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,760
while Fred Jones
was in jail,

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,039
Fred is exonerated

41
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,480
and going free.

42
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,240
But we just turned his room
into an ice skating rink.

43
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,880
Now for the bad news.

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,640
The real murderer
is still on the loose.

45
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,559
Now, are there
any more questions?

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah, I have one.

47
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,519
How come no one
ever cared this much
about my missing mom?

48
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,840
All right! Quiet!

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Now, there's a good reason

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,839
we're taking this case
more seriously

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,399
than the "missing mother"

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,960
of a mouthy girl.

53
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,279
We've had a breakthrough.

54
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,559
Now, after careful review

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
of all the evidence,

56
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,759
we have found a pattern.

57
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,839
Interesting.

58
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,239
Each of the victims is hot.

59
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,759
Oh my God! We're hot.

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Hold on!

61
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,040
Are you telling us

62
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,120
life is now even harder
for beautiful girls?

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
Gigi and her friends
already spent half their days

64
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:22,839
responding to compliments.

65
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,359
Thank you, Dad.
That's so nice.

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,360
Tragically, yes.

67
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Our hot little baby.

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,039
Now, we don't have the money
to protect every student.

69
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,279
So instead we've decided
to rank the five hottest girls

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,160
at Crystal Cove High School,

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,959
and give them each
a personal police detail.

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
Fun, right?

73
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
Yeah. We're calling it

74
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,239
the Crystal Cove
Hope Initiative.

75
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,519
Yeah, acronyms.

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,719
Wait. So a couple of
middle aged white dudes

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,720
are gonna decide
which of us are hottest?

78
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,920
Okay. Well,
if you have
a better idea

79
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,000
of how to make the list
maybe you should do it, Velma.

80
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,559
You want me to make the list?

81
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,679
I'd rather die.

82
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,360
Velma, please.

83
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,599
That's a very insensitive
thing to say.

84
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,999
I mean, especially
from a student

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,680
who is in no danger
from a hot girl murderer.

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,559
Also, if you don't do it,
a bunch of other girls

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
will be murdered,
of course,

88
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,199
and with them,

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,799
Crystal Cove's
tourism based economy.

90
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,480
Not the economy!

91
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,040
Fine. Though don't forget
that ranking hot girls

92
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,119
is exactly how the Trojan War
and Facebook started.

93
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,999
Velma, wait up.

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,880
On behalf
of hot girls everywhere,

95
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,200
thank you for agreeing
to make that list.

96
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,359
Friends, Velma.

97
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,200
We both just need
to be friends right now.

98
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,480
Especially
because I finally
have enough money

99
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,079
to hire a detective
to find my birth parents.

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,839
Uh, hello. I'm a detective.

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Velma, you already have
too much on your plate.

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,120
And our relationship
is complicated enough as it is.

103
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,199
Is it though?

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
Maybe we should
hug again to see.

105
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,199
No, you're right.

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,559
But if you want to help,
take something off my plate,

107
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,400
make this hot girl list for me.

108
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,760
Uh, you mean the list
of which of my friends
might get to live?

109
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,879
No thanks. One,
I hate making lists,

110
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,519
and two...
Oh, no, this is a list.

111
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,360
But I can't do it.

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,039
Next to you,
every other girl looks like
a potato in a dress to me.

113
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,799
You guys talking
about the hot girl list?

114
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,399
Be careful, 'cause us bitches
will do anything
to get on it.

115
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,640
Anything.

116
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,439
Have fun with this. Bye.

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
Pick me, Velma.

118
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
Hey, Velma.
You need to finish that list.

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,679
It's bad enough
girls might die,

120
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,240
but now
my trumpet is dented.

121
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,359
I'm trying. This is the first
chance I've had to focus.

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
Thank God, hot girls
would rather be murdered

123
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,639
than enter the band room.

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,240
And the hot girls
are distracting

125
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,760
because you recently came out

126
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,960
and get too turned on to focus.

127
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,079
-Got it, copy.
-Norville,

128
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,800
I didn't come out, I told you.

129
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,519
I like Daphne
but also find Fred attractive.

130
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,399
He has this deep,
inexplicable magnetism.

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,759
That's called being rich,
but go on.

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,680
But Daphne,
our personalities just click.

133
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,599
I can't explain it.

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
Mmm, I see.

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,959
But if you had to explain it,
so I... I mean, someone

136
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,520
could possibly study
Daphne's personality
and emulate it,

137
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,199
so you liked him
instead of her.

138
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,439
Ugh. This is exactly
the problem with this list.

139
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,080
Men make everything about them
and what they want.

140
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,440
Not me. I'm an ally.

141
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,720
Now get back to my question.

142
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,959
Our whole lives,
girls are told by guys

143
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,119
there's a right way to be hot,
and I'm not it.

144
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,759
Guys even teach us
to be ashamed
of our own bodies.

145
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,880
Every little kid knows
how to draw a penis,

146
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,599
but make a little kid
draw a vagina,

147
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,200
and what happens?

148
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,039
-You go to jail?
-Exactly.

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
But now, because of this list,

150
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,080
I have to validate
everything I hate

151
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,959
about men's ideas of
beauty norms

152
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,199
or girls will die.

153
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,800
And one of them
might be Daphne.

154
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,800
Imagine all the things
you'd miss about
her personality.

155
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,119
In this form,
out loud, and go.

156
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,880
Okay, look, I know
my hottest list won't help you.

157
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
But if you can manage

158
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,160
to not get too horned up
from his magnetism,

159
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,999
we do know a guy
who might be able to help.

160
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,520
Mom, stop.

161
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,120
Not in front of my gang.

162
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,639
Hey, Fred.

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
Wow! You look good after jail.

164
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,319
And you're way less
stabbed to death
than I expected.

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,719
Uh, thanks.
You look--

166
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,840
Why am I here?

167
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,640
I need your help
ranking the five hottest girls

168
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:34,720
at Crystal Cove High.

169
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,999
Yeah, I don't know.

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,559
I did that for
the science fair last year

171
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,599
and got suspended.

172
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,880
Your entry was called,
<i>"From Freud to Jung:</i>
<i>An exploration in horniness."</i>

173
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,959
But it's fine.
The police need the list
to keep hot girls safe.

174
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh, so like charity work? Okay.

175
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,520
But if this doesn't help
restore my public image

176
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,440
as a good guy,
I'mma be pissed.

177
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,439
All right.

178
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,320
Yes...

179
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,199
Yes...

180
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,760
Yeah!

181
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,999
Daphne, Olive,

182
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,959
Gigi, Becca and... Kimmy?

183
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,199
But Kimmy's so sweet.

184
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,839
Wait. Is it an
inner beauty thing?

185
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
No, it's a huge-cans thing.

186
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,560
Now, anything else
I can do for you?

187
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,719
Yeah, maybe read this.

188
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,199
<i>The Feminine Mystique.</i>

189
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
No way, I love Mystique.

190
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:24,159
Is this about
whether Jennifer Lawrence
is hotter than Rebecca Romijn?

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,480
Well, I'm excited to see

192
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:28,119
how they settled that
in under 400 pages.

193
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,640
<i> Look, kid, I know</i>
<i>you wanna find</i>
<i>your biological parents,</i>

194
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,520
<i>but as my name makes clear,</i>
<i>I'm too short</i>

195
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,399
<i>and too high to be useful.</i>

196
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,000
Moms, my door's locked.

197
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,159
Sorry, sweetie,
we had no choice.

198
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,599
The serial killer
is targeting hot girls,

199
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,639
and you're almost
as hot as Donna.

200
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,080
Oh, you.

201
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,000
But you can't just imprison
a totally innocent person.

202
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,759
What don't you get about cops?

203
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,199
Visitor!

204
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,959
Norville? What
are you doing here?

205
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,719
Well, with all the talk
about hotness,

206
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,639
I'm writing an article
for the student
newspaper titled,

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,080
"Reasons someone might like
someone else's personality."

208
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,160
So what do Velmas--

209
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,920
Uh, I mean, people see in you?

210
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,320
We have a student newspaper?

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,080
Hey! Who just threw a rock
through my window?

212
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,520
Do you have any idea
what a pain it is
to get out the vacuum?

213
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,319
There's no one there.

214
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,559
And this isn't a rock.

215
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,600
It's a geode
from the crystal mines,

216
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,439
The crystal mines?

217
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,919
That old tourist attraction
that's now a seagull toilet
full of condoms?

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,440
Here's your dumb list
of hot girls.

219
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,920
Of course,
if society exerted
half this effort

220
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,319
teaching girls
not to be slaves
to the patriarchy,

221
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,320
we wouldn't have this problem
in the first place.

222
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,080
Boys don't like
a know it all, Velma.

223
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,319
Wait. Oh my God,
that's it.

224
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,479
Boys don't like a know it all.

225
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,200
If the serial killer

226
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,959
only wants hotties,
instead of spending
half our town budget

227
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,200
on police protection
for five smoke-shows,

228
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,639
why don't you just teach them

229
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,760
to be not hot
like you, Velma?

230
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait. So you're saying

231
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,040
I get to actually
release these girls

232
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,799
from the shackles
of the male gaze?

233
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,399
Exactly.

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,759
Uggo lessons!

235
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,720
Hi, girls.

236
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Velma, your new
way-cooler friends are here.

237
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,760
Oh, we're not friends.

238
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,280
Because of Velma

239
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,640
our personal police details,
which we earned by being hot,

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
got downgraded
to uggo lessons.

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
You know, maybe
a good place to start

242
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,199
would be not referring
to what we're doing
as "uggo lessons".

243
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,320
I was thinking,
maybe goddess renewals.

244
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,759
I don't care what you call it.

245
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,440
We're not starting
until Daphne gets here.

246
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,720
Oh, Daphne isn't coming.

247
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,320
Her moms have her
in a full on Rapunzel sitch,

248
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,879
so she gets a pass.

249
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,239
Okay. But the thing is,

250
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,599
we kind of rely on Daphne
to tell us what to do.

251
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,760
She's like our queen bee,

252
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,920
and you're like a...
a King Kong.

253
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,240
Well, interestingly enough,

254
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,360
a key component
to being not hot

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
is not fitting in.

256
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,040
And the best way to not fit in

257
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,359
is to never just do
what other people
tell you to do.

258
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,200
Like how King Kong
didn't listen to people,

259
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,440
so airplanes killed him?

260
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,839
No. You know what?

261
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,000
We need to start these
uggo lessons right now.

262
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,800
Daphne, your moms are gone,

263
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,679
but how
are you gonna get out?

264
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,439
Damn!

265
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,959
Thank you for helping me find
who threw that geode

266
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,880
and for explaining geodes
in terms I can understand,

267
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,120
the hot-girls of rocks.

268
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,399
Daphne, look,

269
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm always up for anything
geode related,

270
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,999
know that,

271
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,480
but have you wondered

272
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,400
if this is the serial killer
trying to lure you out?

273
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,239
I have.
And have you wondered

274
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,879
how grateful
everyone would be

275
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,639
if we caught him,
including Velma?

276
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,719
What? Velma?

277
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,199
Why would I care
what Velma thinks?

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,800
<i>The Feminine Mystique</i>
is a total rip-off.

279
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,079
Not one mention
of a sexy shape-shifter.

280
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,880
This was more disappointing
than George Bernard Shaw's
<i>Man and Superman.</i>

281
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,959
Ugh, I feel weird.

282
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,400
Nice.

283
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,320
Banging bod, unhooked bikini.

284
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,759
Oh, hello.

285
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,319
What do we have here?

286
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,480
Sensible shoes,

287
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,240
forging her own identity,

288
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,680
regardless of
what society expects.

289
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,519
She's just got this
kind of mystique.

290
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,080
Wait.

291
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
What have you done to me?

292
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,119
So we have one day
to unlearn

293
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,159
a lifetime
of internalized misogyny.

294
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,760
I'm getting waxed at 4:00.

295
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,999
Then we have until 4:00.

296
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,960
No, terrible, too flattering.

297
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,560
Oh, these might work.

298
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,800
Damn it! Now you look
hot and relatable,

299
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,519
like an athlete
who wears glasses.

300
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,760
Ugh, just put on
the sleeping bag.

301
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,679
How do we do our hair?

302
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,199
Wet bun
or cut it, baby.

303
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,799
So welcome
to the Crystal Cove
Historical Society.

304
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,679
You can learn anything
about geodes

305
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,880
and the crystal mines here.

306
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,080
And time permitting,

307
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,799
walk through
the hall of controllers.

308
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,599
So Crystal Cove's
famous crystal mines

309
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,359
were discovered
in the 19th century

310
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,920
<i>by a prospector who thought</i>
<i>he'd found a gold mine</i>

311
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,359
<i>and was looking for a rock</i>

312
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,839
<i>with which to bash</i>
<i>his partner's brains in.</i>

313
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,360
I'm rich!

314
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,160
<i>But the crystal were worthless.</i>

315
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,239
<i>Then came the 1970s,</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>

316
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:31,519
<i>A nation</i>
<i>betrayed by Vietnam</i>
<i>and endless guitar solos,</i>

317
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
<i>people abandoned</i>
<i>their old belief systems</i>

318
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,120
<i>in favor</i>
<i>of literally anything else.</i>

319
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,880
<i>Enter the healing power</i>
<i>of crystals.</i>

320
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,279
<i>And Crystal Cove</i>
<i>became a boom town.</i>

321
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,120
<i>The mines themselves</i>
<i>became a tourist destination.</i>

322
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,359
<i>But by the 1980s,</i>
<i>the crystal fad ended,</i>

323
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,720
<i>replaced by the aerobics fad</i>
<i>and the cocaine fad.</i>

324
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,520
<i>Crystal Cove never recovered.</i>

325
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,880
<i>The mines closed</i>
<i>and the guy running the display</i>

326
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,199
<i>got into sexual pottery.</i>

327
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,519
Which is why I'm ending
the tour early.

328
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
Norville.

329
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,799
I feel like
I've been here before

330
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,919
as a baby.

331
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,040
Is that crazy?

332
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,840
No, I vividly remember
breast feeding.

333
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Though I did stop at five.

334
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,960
Ugh. What if that geode

335
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,440
was thrown by my birth parents?

336
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,080
Maybe they're also trying
to find me

337
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,480
without my mom's finding out.

338
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,199
We have to go there.

339
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,159
Mayor Dave,
Sheriff Cogburn,

340
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,840
I want you to remember
this moment.

341
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,479
For far too long,
we have told girls
that pain is beauty.

342
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,759
Well, today

343
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
you will see these
painfully beautiful girls

344
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,200
transform from "Damn"
to "Eh..."

345
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,720
Ooh, they are so hot,
Daddy likey.

346
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,160
Wait. You were supposed
to do the opposite.

347
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,120
What the hell, Velma?

348
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,439
Yeah. What the hell, girls?

349
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,320
Where's the hair
I wove onto your arms?

350
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,560
It's gone, Velma.

351
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,319
This wasn't an exercise
in deprogramming,

352
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,279
it's an exercise
in slut-shaming.

353
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,879
No woman should
ever have to change
who she is

354
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,879
or how she dresses
to not be murdered.

355
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,639
But you're more
than your looks, Olive.

356
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
You can reverse your car
without even looking
at the camera.

357
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,600
I know, Velma,

358
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,359
just like I know
I love looking hot.

359
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,159
You think every girl
deep down is like you,

360
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,440
but you're wrong.

361
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
In fact, your definition
of womanhood

362
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,080
is even more restrictive
than ours.

363
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,039
We'll take
our police details now,

364
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,159
and no uggos,

365
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,079
just beefcake.

366
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,639
Me-ow!

367
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,559
Cat-fight.

368
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,320
<i> Your definition</i>
<i>of womanhood</i>

369
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,879
<i>is even more</i>
<i>restrictive than ours.</i>

370
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,960
Something's different
about you today.

371
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,039
Wait. You didn't try
an energy drink again,
did you?

372
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,119
No. It's just that
after yesterday,

373
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,919
I have no clue
how to be a woman

374
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,720
in a way that doesn't judge
other women.

375
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,920
So you picked Monster.

376
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,280
How dare you
call any woman a monster,

377
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,520
you monster?

378
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,040
I'm dressed like this
to show support

379
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,480
for all the beautiful ways
women express themselves.

380
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,240
Even the ones
I think are stupid.

381
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,800
I know it's very upsetting
that I have to re-evaluate
all my beliefs.

382
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,839
Thank you for understanding.

383
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,840
It's not that.

384
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,999
I'm having a baby.

385
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
Right. But are you having
a baby?

386
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,519
Or did society tell you
to have a baby?

387
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,079
Wait, you're really having
a baby.

388
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,480
Call 911!

389
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,639
Wait, No. Call a cab.
Taxi births make the news.

390
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,800
I am calling,

391
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,680
but we're trapped
in the carpool lane.

392
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,240
You have to get
these cars to move

393
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
so an ambulance can get in.

394
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,080
Okay, I'll, uh...

395
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,840
- Hey! Move, buddy!
- Hey! Come on!

396
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,959
It's the hot-girls
police details! Yes!

397
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
Help, Sheriff Cogburn! Help!

398
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,720
Look out!
It's the serial killer!

399
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,279
And he's even crazier
than we thought!

400
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,759
What? No!

401
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,480
It's Velma! My dad's goomar
is having a baby.

402
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,999
Aw, a wittle guy?

403
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,119
No, you need to get these cars
out of here

404
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,280
so an ambulance can get in.

405
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,679
10-4.

406
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,120
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

407
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,360
<i>We got ourselves</i>
<i>an official tender moment.</i>

408
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,920
<i>A woman is experiencing</i>

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,880
<i>the sacred miracle</i>
<i>of childbirth!</i>

410
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:56,959
Oh! Look at that!

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
Oh! She's crowning.

412
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,920
Actually, I should
probably see this too,

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,280
always wondered
how it worked.

414
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,360
Come on, fellas!

415
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,959
It's show-and-tell time.

416
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,599
Wait, no! Where are you going?

417
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,960
Olive, please help me.

418
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,519
If we can get these students
out of the way,

419
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
the ambulance
could drive up on the grass.

420
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,519
Sure, but no one's
moving, Velma.

421
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,799
A lady is giving birth
in front of school.

422
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,120
This is literally why

423
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,800
social media exists.

424
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,360
Stop! Or at least get
my ring light.
It's in the trunk.

425
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,880
Then you'll just have
to give them something
better to look at.

426
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,319
Wait! You're not thinking--

427
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,199
Yes, I need you to muster
all of your sexiness

428
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,159
and lure everyone away
with a sexy dance.

429
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,520
Like a shimmy into
a bouncy thing?

430
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,999
I'm not a dancer.

431
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,639
Just show me ass cheeks
going in different directions.

432
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,799
And what? You'll just watch
and silently judge us?

433
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,799
Pass. Our sexy dancing
is for ourselves.

434
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,679
And once to raise money
for a dog

435
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,079
that needed hip surgery.

436
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,320
Fine. If you won't do it,
I will.

437
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,919
Hey, everyone, look at me!

438
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,679
I'm sexy, I'm fun.

439
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,840
Ooh, yeah.

440
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,480
I'm rolling on some gum.

441
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,199
Did I accidentally tase her?

442
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,000
What's happening?
Why isn't this luring the crowd
towards me?

443
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,320
Because if you're
gonna be sexy,

444
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,680
you have to own it.

445
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,439
You look like
a white influencer

446
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,199
trying to choreograph
her own dance

447
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,719
instead of just stealing one.

448
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
I know. I'm trying,

449
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,640
but I'm just not comfortable
owning it.

450
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,800
Wait, that's it.
That's the answer.

451
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:17,719
Just like how you're all women
who don't wanna own shorts
that cover your butt,

452
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,039
I'm a woman
who doesn't wanna own<i> it.</i>

453
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,920
And one isn't better
than the other.

454
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,400
Whoa, whoa! Hold on.

455
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,120
So you're saying,
while we're all juicy asses...

456
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm all sass and glasses, baby.

457
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,480
Velma! Hurry up
and do something!

458
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,880
Yes, of course.

459
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,999
Girls, let's do a respective
yet equally valid dance.

460
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,559
Oh my God!

461
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,680
Norville, I've definitely
been here before.

462
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,280
I feel like all the answers
to my questions

463
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,079
about my parents are in there.

464
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,039
The bathrooms?

465
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,480
Wait. I mean in there.

466
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,040
Daphne, this is a bad idea.

467
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,239
It's too coincidental.

468
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,759
The serial killer could know

469
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,480
you're looking for your parents
and be manipulating you.

470
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,680
Wow. I would be
a really good serial killer.

471
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,119
Was that vocational test right?

472
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,279
I know it's risky, Norville,
but I have to try.

473
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,400
Finding my parents
is the only way to figure out

474
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,679
why I'm so different
from everyone.

475
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,960
This is gonna sound crazy,

476
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,760
but I love danger.

477
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,439
No. Not a cute one.

478
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,599
Apologize.

479
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,640
My moms
have done everything
to teach me to be safe,

480
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,840
but I'm still
danger-prone Daphne.

481
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,120
Fighting, dealing drugs,

482
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,359
possibly walking
into a serial killer's trap.

483
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,040
Who are my biological parents,

484
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,880
and why am I like this?

485
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,399
What's wrong?

486
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
Everything.

487
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:09,800
I hate danger,

488
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,119
so I can't mimic
your personality
to make Velma like me.

489
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,080
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to do.

490
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,160
No.

491
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,639
Yep. And it would've
worked, too.

492
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,239
I'm inquisitive
and athletic,

493
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,680
and I can fake being dumb

494
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,240
after carrying on
a conversation
with you all day.

495
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,879
-Mmm-hmm.
-But I can't
make myself like danger.

496
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,559
I'm far too sane.

497
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:28,200
So if that's the thrill ride
to nowhere Velma's
looking for

498
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,399
I'm wasting my time.

499
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,039
I'm sorry, Norville,
but trust me,

500
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
there's someone other than
Velma out there for you.

501
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Yeah, sorry. I can't do this
dumb talk anymore.

502
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:36,600
-I'm gonna hop.
-What?

503
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,039
You can't just leave me here.

504
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm not afraid
of who's in there.

505
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,919
I'm just afraid
they'll think I'm a loser

506
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,720
who couldn't get friends
to come with them.

507
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,159
Yeah, well, there's no world
where I'm ever solving
a mystery

508
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,519
in an abandoned amusement park.

509
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
So if you want a ride,
it's now or never.

510
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,679
Fine, I'm coming.

511
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,840
But you're only getting
two stars.

512
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,719
Velma, I know we've had
our differences,

513
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,599
but you really saved the day.

514
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,040
And not just because
your janky nails

515
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,560
came in handy
for cutting the cord.

516
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,279
I was pretty great today
wasn't I?

517
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,479
Possibly the greatest
woman of all time.

518
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,760
Even better than that girl

519
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,280
with a ponytail
that's on the quarter.

520
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,200
You know, after seeing you
take charge like that,

521
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,800
I really hope my little girl
grows up to be
just like you.

522
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
Wow. Thank you, Sophie.

523
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,200
On the inside at least.

524
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,559
Nope, not for me.

525
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
Yes, for me.

526
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,440
Fred?

527
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,439
I, uh, think you meant

528
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,120
to send this
to Daphne next door.

529
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,120
No, Velma, wait!

530
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm here
because I want you.

531
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,239
To be the before picture
in another diet pill scam?

532
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,879
I mean, at least
you're asking this time.

533
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,279
No, that book you gave me

534
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,319
opened my eyes
to your inner beauty.

535
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,679
Wait, really?

536
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,199
I've dreamt about this moment

537
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,520
one time on an airplane.

538
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,920
I was escorted off.
It's not important.

539
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,759
Hey, I'm as surprised
as you are,

540
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,560
but you know,
what can I say?

541
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,840
That book broke my brain.

542
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,279
So let's make the best of this

543
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
reverse<i> Beauty and the Beast</i>
nightmare, right?

544
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,480
Wait, what?

545
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,560
Anyway, wanna go
to Hand Stuff Point?

546
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,879
Fred, while I'm glad
you've learned

547
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,359
to appreciate inner beauty...

548
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
Oh, yes.
Speak your mind, baby.

549
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,520
Right. Well, I also prefer
inner beauty.

550
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,280
And, yes,
up until right now,

551
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,639
I found you irresistible.

552
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,600
But now
I just find you gross.

553
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,519
What? How?

554
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,600
You know I'm rich, right?

555
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,240
Like, I once sat through
an entire opera rich.

556
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,959
Sorry, Fred,
but for what it's worth,

557
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,920
I am keeping
the picture you sent me

558
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:35,920
for plane rides.

559
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,159
If Velma can be herself,
Gigi, so can you.

560
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
Hey, watch
where you're going.

561
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,640
Valedictorians have
the right of way.

562
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,640
Gigi?

563
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,959
Hi.

564
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,119
Are you talking
about my IQ?

565
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,280
You tell me.
