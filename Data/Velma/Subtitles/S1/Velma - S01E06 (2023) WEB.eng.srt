00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,839
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,719
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
about your hallucinations.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,440
But, Velma, I told you this.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,440
Your mother didn't go missing
because you solved a mystery.

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,360
She left us.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,719
La, la, la, la, la, la, la!

7
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,400
Be in my office Monday morning.

8
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:22,240
I'll tell you everything I know
about my mom, Dr. Edna Perdue.

9
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,480
That book you gave me

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,039
opened my eyes
to your inner beauty.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,960
Wait. Really?

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,560
Brenda?

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,719
I'm your mother, Carroll.

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,400
And I'm your father, Darren.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,400
<i> If there's one thing</i>
<i>teen dramas get right,</i>

16
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,039
<i>it's that nothing is ever</i>
<i>actually a teenager's fault.</i>

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,199
<i>We're all really just paying</i>
<i>for the sins of our parents.</i>

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,920
<i>They're either lying to us...</i>

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,519
Oh, yeah, you discover
that polonium, Marie Curie.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,879
<i> ...or trying</i>
<i>to change us...</i>

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,480
<i> ...or hiding</i>
<i>some dark family secret.</i>

22
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:08,760
Mom!

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,080
If Velma hallucinates
while learning the truth

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,720
about Grandma, she could die.

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,920
Let the adults handle this,
son. Blythe?

26
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:18,119
<i> But when it comes</i>
<i>to truly crappy parents,</i>
<i>no one beats my dad.</i>

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,960
Dad, I need to get
to school early

28
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,439
to talk to Principal Rogers.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,319
She might have clues
about Mom's kidnapping.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,719
That's great.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,280
Really? But you hate
that I think she's missing.

32
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,559
Are you kidding?
That's even better, Sophie.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,199
Uh, what's happening?

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,800
People only wear fleece

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,639
when they're looking
for startup money,
or...

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
Oh, no. Going hiking.

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,680
What's happening is
I'm taking paternity leave.

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,959
Paternity leave?

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,599
When I was born,
you doubled your work hours.

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,720
We know, but Amanda's birth
has made your father realize

41
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,280
he needs to find
a work-life balance,

42
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,920
or risk messing her up
the way he messed up--

43
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,240
Well, you know.

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,759
Hey, Velma,
want a ride to school?

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,759
We got champagne,
AC, and the driver
has a funny story

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,719
about how he survived
the Khmer Rouge.

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,359
Uh, sure, thanks.

48
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,480
Absolutely not, Frederick.

49
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,320
Unless this is your selection
for our hunt?

50
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,000
No, Father. I like her now.

51
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,920
Have you heard of inner beauty?

52
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,720
That's a myth, you fool!

53
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:18,359
Well, at least my relationship
with my father isn't that bad.

54
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,359
Principal Rogers, I just want

55
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,559
to say thank you for--

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,519
Hey, do you mind?

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,759
Oh, yeah, mmm.

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,199
All right. Go help Velma
not hallucinate

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,759
while she talks to your mom.

60
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,400
But don't let her
push you around.
You're your own man.

61
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,439
Damn straight.

62
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,880
And just real quick,

63
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,319
when do you need me
to have your pants mended by?

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,360
Ugh. Now.

65
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,240
But lunch will be fine,
I guess.

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,479
As I was saying, thank you
for agreeing to talk to me

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,119
about your
mad scientist mother.

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Now spill it!

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,080
Okay. Well, buckle up,
because things are
about to get weird.

70
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,679
See, in the 1970s,

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,880
my mother, Dr. Edna Perdue,
was a brilliant neurosurgeon,

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,520
<i>who had discovered a way</i>

73
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,080
<i>to keep the human brain alive</i>
<i>outside of the body.</i>

74
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,039
<i> I never should have</i>
<i>been an organ donor.</i>

75
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,839
A woman scientist?

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,400
<i> Her work</i>
<i>caught the attention</i>

77
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,839
<i>of Army General</i>
<i>Harry Meeting, who felt</i>

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,240
<i>he could use it to spy</i>
<i>on what he believed</i>

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,319
<i>to be the biggest threat</i>
<i>to the American way of life.</i>

80
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,360
Oh, let me guess. Communists?
Meat made from plants?

81
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,839
-Women's sports?
-No!

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,759
<i>Meddling kids.</i>

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,000
<i>It was the 1970s, and</i>
<i>according to General Meeting,</i>

84
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,359
<i>meddling kids</i>
<i>were ruining everything.</i>

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,640
War's not, like, cool, man.

86
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,999
<i>General Meeting had tried</i>
<i>to infiltrate these groups.</i>

87
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,800
But what if war is,
like, cool, man?

88
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,760
<i>But the meddling kids</i>

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
<i>always foiled him</i>
<i>with a technique</i>
<i>called mask pulling.</i>

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,359
<i>So, General Meeting</i>
<i>tried to infiltrate them</i>

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
<i>through hypnosis.</i>

92
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
<i>But this only worked</i>
<i>so long as no one ever...</i>

93
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,560
<i>...snapped their fingers.</i>

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,760
<i>So, when General Meeting</i>
<i>saw my mother's work,</i>
<i>he wondered,</i>

95
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,640
<i>what if she could</i>
<i>put a soldier's brain</i>

96
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,799
<i>into the head</i>
<i>of a meddling kid?</i>

97
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,919
<i>He called the program</i>
<i>the Special Covert Operations</i>
<i>Brain Initiative,</i>

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,079
<i>or SCOOBI.</i>

99
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,480
SCOOBI? And wait,
what did SCOOBI do?

100
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,280
It attempted to create
the perfect spy,

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
by swapping people's brains.

102
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,080
Oh. Did it work?

103
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,199
<i> No.</i>

104
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,280
<i>And as the years dragged on,</i>
<i>and the pressure</i>
<i>to produce a result grew,</i>

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,039
<i>she slowly went insane.</i>

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,839
<i>Until one day, my mom</i>

107
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,080
<i>bricked up her secret lab</i>
<i>in our basement,</i>

108
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,400
<i>hid her journals</i>
<i>so no one could</i>
<i>recreate her work,</i>

109
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,119
<i>and was committed</i>
<i>to the Crystal Cove</i>
<i>Insane Asylum.</i>

110
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,279
Wow, I can't believe
that's your mom. I mean,

111
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,680
playing God, removing brains.

112
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,040
That's some white people shit.

113
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,599
She was always a trailblazer.

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,359
But wait, my mom disappeared

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,240
after finding
Dr. Perdue's journals,

116
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,199
and the dead girls
all had their brains removed.

117
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,439
Could they be connected?

118
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
Wow. For all
your personality flaws,

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,080
you're actually
a pretty good detective.

120
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,879
If there is a connection
between your mom
and the dead girls,

121
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,279
the key to finding it
is in this box.

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,439
You're late, Daphne.
Are you rebelling already?

123
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,439
As a criminal, I like it.
As your dad, knock it off.

124
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,960
Sorry, to get past my moms,
I had to put on
their wedding DVD.

125
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,919
They'll spend all day arguing
about who let Uncle Lou dance

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,559
when they knew
he had a heart condition.

127
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,759
What's all this?

128
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,399
- Uh, that...
- Remember,

129
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,519
not a word about
why we really need her

130
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,119
until we know we can trust her.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,679
What happened?

132
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,479
Why is there a needle
in my good boob?

133
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
It's an adrenaline shot.

134
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,320
Your heart stopped
from a hallucination.

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,920
Norville, why didn't
you make me laugh?

136
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,879
I tried. I did three minutes
of hilarious new stuff.

137
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,239
You just didn't
get the references

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,759
because you haven't
taken calculus yet.

139
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,200
Velma, I'm sorry,

140
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,599
but I'm not telling you
anything more about your mom

141
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,279
until you stop
your hallucinations.

142
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,640
The nurse only has
one adrenaline shot left,

143
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,440
and I want shrimp for lunch.

144
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,240
Allergies be damned!

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,759
But if you think
my mom is connected to
the serial killer in any way,

146
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,760
I have to know.

147
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,839
Please.

148
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,200
Fine. Velma, your mom--

149
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,439
Norville, what am I gonna do?

150
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,199
I hallucinate
because I feel guilty

151
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,279
about having caused my mom
to disappear.

152
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,120
The only cure
is to find my mom.

153
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,320
Though, I have heard
some good things
about alcoholism.

154
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,480
Okay, well, uh,
when was the first time
you hallucinated?

155
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,279
Hmm. It was a few days
after my mom went missing.

156
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,840
This is all your fault, Velma.

157
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,320
Why'd you have to go

158
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,719
and solve your own mystery?

159
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,799
Okay, but you'd been
trying to find your mom
before that, right?

160
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,240
Why didn't the hallucinations
start until then?

161
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,519
As a man analyzing a woman,

162
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,999
-can we assume menses?
-No.

163
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,639
But wait, something else
did happen that day.

164
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,359
My dad took me out to breakfast
for the first time ever.

165
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,040
Hey, Dad. Great news.

166
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,999
I've been looking for Mom,
and I think I have
some new leads--

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,039
Velma, stop! For the last time,
your mother wasn't taken.

168
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,200
She left us.

169
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
Now, see if you can
solve the case

170
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,240
of how to entertain yourself
while I make work calls.

171
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,600
Wait, I've always wanted
my dad to love me more.

172
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,119
Maybe the hallucinations
are my subconscious

173
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,879
keeping me
from looking for my mom.

174
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,280
Because you saying
your mom was kidnapped
upsets your dad

175
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,039
and just makes it harder
for him to love you.

176
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,519
Exactly! Wait!

177
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Oh, no, I hallucinate
because I have daddy issues.

178
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,360
Gross.

179
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,160
Okay, so, don't search for

180
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,679
"Daddy issues
and teenage girls."

181
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,199
And bookmark.

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,920
But if your
hallucinations started

183
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,759
because your dad
doesn't believe
your mom was kidnapped,

184
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,079
maybe they'd stop
if you make him believe
she was kidnapped.

185
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,640
I tried,
but whenever I mention it,
he shuts me down.

186
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Then I have to eat a whole pie
to feel better,

187
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,320
and I will die
before I give that up.

188
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,080
What's another way
to cure daddy issues?

189
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,239
Eh, I wouldn't know.

190
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,680
The thought
of having any issues

191
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,080
with my own sweet, sweet daddy
is foreign to me.

192
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,639
Really? Even though
he's the one

193
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,200
who basically taught you
to be a beta.

194
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,439
Excuse me?
My father is not a beta.

195
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,760
He drives the speed limit,

196
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,439
no matter how many people
are honking at him.

197
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
Knock, knock.

198
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,720
Norville, can I grab you
for a second? I need a hand

199
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,320
-with some heavy lifting.
-Of course, Dad.

200
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,439
Because heavy lifting is
exactly what alphas like us do.

201
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,680
Thanks. We're helping
your mom's old boyfriend move.

202
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,119
Ah, that doesn't help.

203
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,439
Ah, come on.

204
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,360
Don't even think
about it, Aman.

205
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,159
I haven't slept in 48 hours,

206
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,919
so if you're serious
about paternity leave,
then you have to realize

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,959
your family is more important
than your phone. Oh!

208
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
I am so posting that.

209
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,240
Hey, Dad, can we talk?

210
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,760
You can be drunk,
if that's easier.

211
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,039
What? No!

212
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,599
Paternity leave applies
to all my children.

213
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Let's go to lunch. Run!

214
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,760
Aman!

215
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,520
Okay. Quick lesson
in the power of crystals.

216
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,479
This is angelite.

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,999
It treats anxiety

218
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,880
by transmuting
aberrant thoughts

219
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,719
into productive cathexis.

220
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,919
Whoa, cool!

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
So, do you rub it?

222
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,559
Or grind it up
and snort it at a party,

223
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,000
like regular anxiety meds?

224
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,119
You take it

225
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,239
and bang it on your head,
real hard.

226
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,879
Wait, really?

227
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,320
No.
Crystals are a hoax, Daphne.

228
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,400
Like vitamins, or internships.

229
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,279
That's why we loved
working here so much.

230
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,319
Charging idiots 30 bucks
for a mystical rock

231
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,600
feels like a crime,
but it's totally legal.

232
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,719
So, that's why
you turned to real crime

233
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,520
when the crystal market
collapsed, to chase that high.

234
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,560
Yes. But the party ended
when your moms raided us.

235
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,400
Sure, we got away,
but they stole you.

236
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,599
And now they're gonna pay.

237
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,639
Everyone's gonna pay.

238
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
Whoa, wait. What?

239
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,440
For crystals. Everyone's
gonna pay for crystals.

240
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,000
See, thanks to
underemployed millennials,

241
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,400
ex-reality stars,

242
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,000
and zero sense
of global security,

243
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,480
believing in crystals

244
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,679
is back, baby!

245
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,400
We can sell this hall
and retire

246
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:37,240
to the non-extradition country
of our choice.

247
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,160
Hello, Angola.

248
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,560
Wait. You're leaving already?

249
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,440
But there's still so much
I don't know about you.

250
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,799
Daphne, I'm on the run.

251
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,279
A few more days of mining,
and we're gone.

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
But we can get to know
each other until then.

253
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,199
Say yes, and we'll tell you
why you have orange hair.

254
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,400
Oh, my God, yes!

255
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,239
I smoked during pregnancy.
Like, a lot.

256
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,560
Like, I should be dead.

257
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,239
Oh. Well, I'm glad
you're alive.

258
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,320
Let's get to know each other.

259
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,039
So, what do you wanna
talk about? The Miller case?

260
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh, right. This is lunch
with my daughter.

261
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,760
Uh, a couple of things.

262
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,359
First, I think this place
has changed

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,479
since the last time
we were here.

264
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,599
Oh, my God,
I totally didn't notice.

265
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,960
Sophie's boobs are out
so much these days,
this seems normal.

266
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,280
Oh, speak of the devil.

267
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,160
"Buy diapers."

268
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,560
Oh, you think that's bad?

269
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,439
Sophie told me I can't
pee in the shower anymore,

270
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,319
because that's where
she bathes Amanda.

271
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,560
Now I have to pee in the shower
at school, like a weirdo.

272
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,320
Pro tip, aim for the drain.
She'll never know.

273
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,079
Oh, I'll try that.

274
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,359
Wait. Did you just
teach me a life lesson?

275
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,919
Yeah. You want another one?

276
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,519
Don't date anyone who owns
more throw pillows than books.

277
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,320
Yes! Oh, my God. I had no idea

278
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,520
you at least realize
Sophie kind of sucks.

279
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,720
It will make it so much easier
to kick her ass out
when I find Mom.

280
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,440
Wait. "Find Mom"?
Not this again.

281
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,520
But that's what I need
to talk to you about.

282
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,959
To stop my hallucinations,

283
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,440
I need you to believe me
that Mom was kidnapped.

284
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,519
Velma, please.

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Can't a father and daughter

286
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,599
just enjoy a nice meal
at a strip club,

287
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
-without it being awkward?
-Uh, no?

288
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,679
But we were having fun
for the first time ever.

289
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,879
Yeah, we were. Look at us.

290
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
Can we at least talk later?

291
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,000
I have to stop
my hallucinations.

292
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,320
Hold that thought.
I have to make some work calls.

293
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,079
Oh, so you're going
to work, are you?

294
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,080
Well, then call me
Ernest Shackleton,

295
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,040
'cause I'm headed to a pole.

296
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,519
Fred? What are you doing
at Nana's Nipples?

297
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,559
I thought rich guys went
to the Tits Carlton.

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
That's our next stop.

299
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,080
Yeah, my dad found out
I like you

300
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,959
and is now trying
to "normalize" my brain

301
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,880
back into thinking
girls like Chestiny here
are hot.

302
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:32,720
You!

303
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,479
Get away from my son!

304
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,400
He just asked the manager
if there's a stripper
gender pay gap!

305
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,679
There is. Guys make way less.

306
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,839
But thanks to you,
Fred won't call it
reverse sexism.

307
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,439
He-He-He's ruined!

308
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,519
Oh, yeah. Keep it all on.

309
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,599
Show me nothing, baby.

310
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,280
Velma, what are you
doing up there?

311
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm doing what every girl
is doing up here.

312
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm just trying to get
my dad's attention.

313
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,040
And one day, it will work.

314
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,240
Velma, stop!
You have my attention.

315
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,440
That's why I was on the phone.

316
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,079
I was calling Sophie
to tell her

317
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,839
I need to spend the rest of
my paternity leave with you.

318
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,760
Wait, what? Are you nuts?
She'll kill us both.

319
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,239
I don't care. Like you said,

320
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,119
we were just starting
to have fun together.

321
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,879
And let's be honest,
the last couple of years
haven't been very fun.

322
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,999
What with my hair turning

323
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
-gray--
-Mom being kidnapped.

324
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,279
Sure, right. All that.

325
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
So, what do you say
we go have some fun?

326
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:26,279
Just us.

327
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,279
Ahh! I said, "Wait!"

328
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,560
Eh, by the time
I say something,

329
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,480
I could have already paid
$5 for another coffee.

330
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,079
Oh, from now on,
I'm wearing 'em.

331
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,239
Amanda, where are you?

332
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,319
Oh, God!

333
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,720
To the best day ever.

334
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,600
And yes, I know I still need

335
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,719
to talk to my dad
to end my hallucinations,

336
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,119
but I don't want
the fun to stop.

337
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Yesterday, for the first time
ever, he said,

338
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,760
"Your birthday's
in March, right?"

339
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:31,120
Hey, can you answer that?
I'm, like, substitute
teacher-level hungover.

340
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,760
No, it's Gigi.

341
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,999
And you were right.
My dad has taught me
to be a beta.

342
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,639
So I'm working on power moves.

343
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,679
This morning, I left my bowl

344
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,400
-in the sink.
-Damn.

345
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,879
Hey, Velma.

346
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,720
When you see your pops next,
tell him thanks for me.

347
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,240
Homie changed my life.

348
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,519
Fred, I've told you.

349
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,439
My dad isn't
the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.

350
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,960
No, he helped my dad
buy Chestiny's contract
from the strip club,

351
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,120
so we could date
and get my head sorted out.

352
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,679
Isn't that right, babe?

353
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,799
Anything but kiss.

354
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,680
Uh, that's impossible, Fred.

355
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,119
My dad's on paternity leave.

356
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,520
The only love he's buying
right now is mine.

357
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,959
Yeah, I don't know.

358
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,800
Your dad figured out
all the legal junk yesterday.

359
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,199
Wait, what?

360
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,439
Oh, my God!

361
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,879
You only told Sophie

362
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,239
you wanted to spend
your paternity leave with me

363
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,240
so you could work
while I was at school.

364
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,479
What? No!

365
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm only here because--

366
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,120
'Cause I'm having an affair
with this woman!

367
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,759
An affair? How dare you?

368
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,239
Also, here's that extra work
you requested.

369
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,559
Where's that box?

370
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,479
I'm ready to learn
how my mom is connected
to those dead girls.

371
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,479
So you finally got your father
to believe you?
Freaking awesome.

372
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
That's right, I swear now.

373
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,160
And you're wearing
a leather jacket?

374
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,159
I stole it, baby.

375
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,720
Off a teddy bear in the mall.

376
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,520
We don't know
what's gotten into him.

377
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,519
I'm out of here.

378
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,039
And I might be late for dinner.

379
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,880
Don't pour my milk.

380
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,480
Okay, now give me that box.

381
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,119
Velma, wait. Are you sure
you won't hallucinate?

382
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes. My hallucinations
were caused

383
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,239
by my desire
to make my dad love me.

384
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,159
But after today,
he's dead to me,

385
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,559
and if I don't care
what he thinks,

386
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
then I won't hallucinate.

387
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,919
Oh, my God. Honestly,
I was, like, zero percent sure
that would work.

388
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,999
But I'm cured.
I can find my mom.

389
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,759
How is she connected
to the dead girls?

390
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,319
Okay, so after my mom died,
her house was put up for sale,

391
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,040
<i>and Fred's family bought it.</i>

392
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,599
<i>And that's what first got</i>
<i>your mom interested in her.</i>

393
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,840
<i>In her effort to learn more</i>
<i>about Dr. Perdue,</i>

394
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,839
<i>Diya uncovered the one thing</i>

395
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,959
<i>my mother never intended</i>
<i>anyone to find, her journals.</i>

396
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,999
<i>That's how she learned</i>
<i>Edna was my mom,</i>

397
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,439
<i>and that her secret lab</i>
<i>was still buried</i>
<i>underneath the house.</i>

398
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,239
<i> So,</i>
<i>that's what my mom</i>

399
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,279
<i>was doing at Fred's house</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve.</i>

400
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,599
<i>Looking for</i>
<i>Dr. Perdue's secret lab,</i>
<i>before Fred's family</i>

401
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
<i>- moved in.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

402
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,399
Hmm. Okay, but how does
this connect my mom
to the dead girls?

403
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,680
<i>There's only one explanation.</i>

404
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,840
<i>Your mom opened the lab, and...</i>

405
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,639
The ghost
of Dr. Edna Perdue

406
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,760
has returned
to finish her work!

407
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,400
Wait, wait, wait.
You're saying my mom

408
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,519
was taken by the ghost
of your mom?

409
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,039
Really? I thought only idiots

410
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,320
and B-list actresses
believed in ghosts.

411
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,239
Uh, have you seen
our school bathrooms?

412
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,639
No living human could do that.

413
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,399
Ugh, I don't have
time for this.

414
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
I have to go find my mom

415
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,799
and her not-a-ghost
serial killer kidnapper.

416
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,480
Damn it, Norville.

417
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,359
Where is everyone?

418
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,639
And the crystals
are all gone.

419
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,400
Wait. Are you leaving already?

420
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,640
But I'm not ready.

421
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,280
I need to know so much more.

422
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,560
Daphne, the only thing
left for you to know

423
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,400
is you deserve better than us.

424
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,840
A gun?

425
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,920
Hold on. Is that
a goodbye gift?

426
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,840
Oh, I didn't get you anything.

427
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,239
Sure you did. You are
our insurance policy

428
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,560
in case your moms
try and stop us
on our way out of town.

429
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,999
Wait, what?

430
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,000
Is that why
you let me find you?

431
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,959
Just so you could use me?
That's so manipulative!

432
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
Which explains
why I'm so manipulative.

433
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,799
But still, I'm your daughter.

434
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,599
And your parents
are criminals, Daph.

435
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm sorry--

436
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,239
Yeah, you are sorry, Darren.

437
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,319
We've been on to you
since you busted out of jail

438
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,479
and put a geode
through our daughter's window.

439
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,879
You have?

440
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,000
We're maybe not the best cops,
but we're great moms.

441
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,279
We always know
what you're up to, sweetie.

442
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,639
What's this?

443
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,519
"Brenda"? Huh! Why does
that name ring a bell?

444
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,800
She's one of the dead girls,
and that's her tank top.

445
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:22,840
You can see stains
from her boob contour.

446
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,080
What? Carroll found
that shirt down here,

447
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,159
and I upcycled it as a rag.

448
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,760
We only have
one planet, people.

449
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,359
Velma!

450
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,920
Where are you? I'm sorry!

451
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:42,679
Also, please be cool for once
and don't tell Sophie.

452
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,080
Velma? You can't be here.

453
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,959
I told you, Father forbids it.

454
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,799
Fred, there's a secret lab
under your basement
and I have to find it.

455
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,240
Now, you can help me,

456
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,959
or you can keep
telling yourself
that if you jump

457
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,159
through all of Daddy's hoops,
maybe one day, he'll love you.

458
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,720
Please. As if my father
has the time

459
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
to make me jump
through hoops. Hey!

460
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,319
Hairy girl not wrong.

461
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,080
Only way to earn
father's respect
is take a stand.

462
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,200
You want I help kill him?

463
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,279
Yeah, let's do it. Hmm?

464
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,280
Whoo-hoo! I'm rich!

465
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,239
Now Daddy will love me.

466
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,999
Norville, what's going on?

467
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,120
You're ignoring my calls
like I just took you
on a first date.

468
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,839
That's because a man
answers his phone

469
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,800
when he damn well
feels like answering
his phone, Lamont.

470
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,680
Okay, well, Gigi almost died.

471
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,959
She was stung by a bee
digging her pants
out of the garbage at school,

472
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,320
and the nurse was
out of adrenaline shots.

473
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,079
Oh, no!

474
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,679
I'm making her
a "Get Well" lemon cake.

475
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,680
-Wanna help?
-I'll get my zester.

476
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Wow. I never knew
how big it was

477
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,319
down here in the bad boy room.

478
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:53,599
I just hang by the door
ever since the rats
ate that butler.

479
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,119
The lab entrance!

480
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,839
But it's still closed.

481
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,880
If my mom didn't open it,
where'd she go?

482
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh. Maybe it's one of those
doors where you push in a brick

483
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,039
-and it opens.
-Fred, wait!

484
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,640
No!

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,320
So you really knew I was
with them the whole time?

486
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:12,960
Or was that just another lie?

487
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,360
Another lie?

488
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,080
The only thing we've ever lied
to you about is the dog.

489
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,959
Truth is, he went to a farm.

490
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,240
No, I know you stole me
from them.

491
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,440
Stole you?

492
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,200
We didn't steal you.

493
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,480
We took you.

494
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,880
We gotta go.

495
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,120
And there's not gonna be
enough room for all the goods
and Daphne.

496
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,679
Oh, okay. Well, as parents,

497
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,159
there's only one right
decision to make here.

498
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,040
Damn it! They got away!

499
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,640
Oh, my God,
I feel like such an idiot.

500
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,920
They abandoned me twice.

501
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,080
That's why we never
told you the truth.

502
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:49,919
We loved you
from the moment we saw you,

503
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,520
and didn't want you
to ever feel

504
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,199
like you were unwanted
for even a second.

505
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,200
I love you, too, Moms.

506
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,040
Ooh, angelite.
That cures anxiety.

507
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,359
<i> Velma? Sweetie?</i>

508
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,839
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
-Mom? Is that you?

509
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,280
I found you.

510
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,200
But did you, like,
get a weird haircut?

511
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,600
No, Velma, it's me.

512
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,080
The parent who only
abandoned you emotionally.

513
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,800
Dad? Wait. Did I die
and go to hell?

514
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:18,440
Damn it! I always knew
atheism was a gamble.

515
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,800
How did you find me?

516
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,240
I can locate your phone,
like any good parent.

517
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,640
Okay. Sophie installed it

518
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,119
so you never catch us in bed
talking smack about you.

519
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,079
No, no. I don't have
time to sit here

520
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,760
and listen to some
too-little-too-late excuse.

521
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,799
Yes, you do.

522
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:32,920
Because your legs
are still buried.

523
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,440
Now look.

524
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm sorry for how much I worked
when you were little,

525
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,239
but I figured you were fine
because you had your mother.

526
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,559
But then she walked out on us,

527
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,880
and I wanted
to be there for you,

528
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,200
but it's too hard
because I feel so guilty.

529
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,040
So, I hide at work.

530
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,679
But you wouldn't feel guilty
if you just believed
she was kidnapped.

531
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,560
Who would kidnap your mother?

532
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,280
No one wants to talk about 9/11
that much anymore.

533
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,040
Fine, don't believe me.
I'll just find her on my own.

534
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,719
I'm fine.

535
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,919
Footprints?

536
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,240
People were just here.

537
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,519
And what's this?

538
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,640
Jinkies!

539
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,400
"Jinkies"?
Why are you saying "jinkies"?

540
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:12,079
Is this like when you tried
to make "Keep it frosty"
a thing?

541
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,280
No!

542
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,800
Someone wrote "jinkies"
on this paper.

543
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,039
But why?

544
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,240
You'll never know, Velma.

545
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,720
Oh, no, Dad!
I need you to believe me

546
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,439
that Mom was kidnapped,
or I'm gonna die!

547
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,639
Okay, okay, I believe you,
I swear!

548
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,199
-I believe you.
-Oh, my God!

549
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,839
That... That did it.

550
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,759
-She's gone.
-Psych!

551
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,480
Oh, no, she's back. But how?

552
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,599
Hold on. Were you lying
about believing me?

553
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,199
Velma, I want
to believe, but...

554
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,560
Wait.

555
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,560
Oh, my God, you're right.
She<i> was</i> kidnapped!

556
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:42,360
I actually believe you,
for real this time.

557
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,680
-He does?
-You do?

558
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,960
He does!

559
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,799
No!

560
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,760
My hallucinations
are finally over.

561
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,040
Are you sure? 'Cause I feel
like you've said that before.

562
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,280
Like a few times.

563
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,880
No, it's over.
I know my dad believes me.

564
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,039
I'm so sorry

565
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,760
-I doubted you, Velma.
-It's okay.

566
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,840
Because when you saw
I was willing to die
for my truth,

567
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,359
you finally came around.

568
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,599
-Because you do love me.
-Yes.

569
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,960
But also, "jinkies" is written
in your mother's handwriting.

570
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,320
She was just here.

571
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:18,639
Jinkies!

572
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,000
Okay, now you're totally
trying to make it a thing.

573
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,120
So, if this was all about
your dad believing you,

574
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:38,680
how did making you laugh
also stop your hallucinations?

575
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,439
Right? Or kissing Daphne?

576
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,639
"Kissing Daphne"?

577
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,039
Uh, the point is, I don't know,

578
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,519
but I'm sure
I'll figure it out.

579
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,760
It would be pretty lazy not to.
Now, come on!

580
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,319
Whoever has my mom,
and removed those
girls' brains,

581
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,760
was just here.
So the question is,

582
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,080
where'd they go?
