1
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:06,600
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:08,439
No!

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,640
My hallucinations
are finally over.

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,159
"Jinkies" is written in
your mother's handwriting.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,079
She was just here.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,440
He is the future CEO of Jones
Gentlemen's Accessories!

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,559
Is he, though?

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,799
But I had to find you

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,177
because I still didn't know
if you'd listened to my VMs,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,427
voice mails, let
alone responded.

11
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:28,999
Gigi almost died.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,200
She was stung by a bee

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,159
and the nurse was out
of adrenaline shots.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,199
<i>Your
mom opened the lab and...</i>

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
The
ghost of Dr. Edna Perdue

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>has returned to finish her work!</i>

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,760
<i> So, at long last, my
hallucinations were cured.</i>

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
Damn it!

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,936
<i>I was able to completely
focus on finding my mom</i>

20
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,640
<i>and the serial
killer who took her.</i>

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,840
Oh, come on.

22
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,857
<i>But first I had to figure out why she'd left
behind the word "jinkies" for me to find.</i>

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,519
<i>Since my mom wrote mysteries,
I started by reading</i>

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,999
<i>all her old manuscripts
looking for the answer.</i>

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,760
<i>But the only thing I found in
them was a cure for my insomnia.</i>

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,457
<i>So, then I thought it might be the
serial killer's license plate number,</i>

27
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:18,839
<i>But it wasn't his license plate,</i>

28
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,839
<i>nor was it JiNKiES,
the party clown,</i>

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,759
<i>who'd fallen off the
radar awhile back.</i>

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,559
Jinkies! The clown!

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,800
Velma, I have to talk to you.

32
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,880
Not now, sorry.

33
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,359
<i> But wherever I looked,</i>

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,239
<i>it was just dead end after
dead end after dead end.</i>

35
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,719
Oh, God! Sophie! No!

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,280
There's a message written
on the wall, in her blood.

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,639
Oh, God, if she's dead,
who's gonna clean that up?

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,999
"Aman, will you

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,599
go to the Crystal Cove
Fog Festival with me?"

40
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,439
Demon! Back to hell with you!

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,720
Velma! Stop! This
was a fogposal.

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,080
A fogposal?

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,239
You know, like a promposal,
but for Fog Fest.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,800
Fog Fest?

45
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,896
You know, the one night a year
all of Crystal Cove comes out

46
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:06,600
to celebrate its world
famous spooky fog.

47
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,719
And pick a Fog King and Queen.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,040
Celebrates?

49
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,736
It's a word meaning...
Are you having a stroke?

50
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,239
No. I know what fogposals
and Fog Fest are.

51
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,959
What I don't understand is
how it can still be happening

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
with a serial
killer on the loose.

53
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,359
What happened to
curfew? It was working.

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,399
Curfew is over! Because
it's not a serial killer...

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,240
it's the
ghost of Dr. Edna Perdue.

56
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:30,360
And curfew can't
stop a ghost, Velma.

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,799
That's just basic physics.

58
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,200
Blythe went to the
press? But this is crazy.

59
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,039
People would rather
believe in a ghost,

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,559
than stay inside
for a few nights

61
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,905
just so they can party?

62
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,679
What's that?

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,016
Look, you're not the only one
worried about curfew ending, Velma.

64
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,239
Which is why no girl will be admitted to
Fog Fest without a date to protect them.

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,479
Smart, right?

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,159
Wait, girls have to
have a date? Great.

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,279
So Fog Fest is not only
dangerous, it's sexist, too.

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,599
Okay, well, at least I know the
police aren't buying this ghost crap.

69
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,840
<i> Attention!</i>

70
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,040
<i>All of you wondering why the police
have not yet caught the serial killer,</i>

71
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,359
<i>it's because it's a ghost and
not because we're incompetent.</i>

72
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,320
<i>Now let's get ready to party!</i>

73
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
But most of all,

74
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,960
I owe the honor of winning
Fog King to my Fog Queen...

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,840
...Velma Dinkley.

76
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,559
Velma?

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
Is that a joke, Fred?

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
Or are you being serious?

79
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,960
Or is it that cable comedy
thing where it's both?

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,320
No, I'm serious.

81
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,319
A girl-killing ghost is
living in our basement.

82
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:34,400
In the grand scheme of things, who
cares if I'm attracted to a nerd?

83
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,119
Fred, we have no issue with you
liking an intelligent woman.

84
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,799
Our problem is you're
going to take over

85
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,719
Jones Gentlemen's
Accessories someday,

86
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,879
and yet you seem to barely
grasp what it is we sell.

87
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,200
Not true. We sell ascots,
cufflinks, and for the ladies,

88
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,359
bags that make other
ladies feel poor.

89
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,799
No, Fred, we sell the best.

90
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,119
And Jones Gentlemen's Accessories
is sponsoring Fog Fest.

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,520
So, if you can't
prove you're the best

92
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,599
by being named Fog King,
how does that make us look?

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,160
Like assholes, Fred.

94
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,639
Like assholes.

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
You can't win with Velma.

96
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:09,719
So, either you find a way to come
home with that Fog King crown,

97
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,039
or do not come home at all!

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,479
Gigi, come on.

99
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,439
Norville was a bad boyfriend.

100
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,520
He ignored you when you
almost died from a bee sting.

101
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,400
And his grandmother
is 100% a ghost

102
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:26,999
who's killing our friends.

103
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,720
I know, but I still wanted
him to ask me to Fog Fest.

104
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:34,160
Guys, it's a serial
killer, not a ghost.

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,199
- Norville?
- Gigi, ghosts are scary,

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,200
but nothing's scarier than a
world where we're not together.

107
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,840
Will you go to Fog Fest with me?

108
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,119
- What?
- Mmm.

109
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
I'll have to think about it.

110
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,720
But if I say yes and the ghost
of your grandma steals my brain,

111
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,200
that's it, we are through.

112
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,799
I understand...

113
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,240
boo. Get it?

114
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,640
No.

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
But that's what
I love about you.

116
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,457
who am I kidding?

117
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,440
Of course I'll go to
Fog Fest with you.

118
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
- Norville!
- Oh, my...

119
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,840
You're going to Fog Fest?

120
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,897
You can't actually believe this
ghost BS about your grandma, too.

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,120
You're a man of reason.

122
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,839
You talked me out of
my flat earth phase.

123
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,960
Of course, I don't
believe in ghosts, Velma.

124
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,639
But I really hurt Gigi's
feelings by ignoring her calls,

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,719
and I will do anything
to make it right.

126
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,479
So, I need Fog Fest to happen.

127
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,040
And honestly, I think
you need Fog Fest, too.

128
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,800
What? No, I don't.

129
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,080
My anger is rooted solely in this
town's selfish desire to party

130
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,399
instead of stay inside
and stop a serial killer.

131
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,159
Velma, come on.

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,496
No one loves celebrating all the
crazy stuff that happens in our fog

133
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,320
more than you.

134
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,759
<i>From entering the
fog in one place</i>

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
<i>and coming out another...</i>

136
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,497
<i>...to thinking
you see a monster in the fog...</i>

137
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,177
<i> ...only to realize it's just
someone you know, holding something weird.</i>

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,016
<i> You even like
how things can somehow</i>

139
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,137
<i>farcically switch
places in the fog.</i>

140
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,096
You've been working
on that "jinkies" clue for days.

141
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,439
The best thing you can
do is let off some steam.

142
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,480
And what is steam,

143
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,777
if not hot fog?

144
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.

145
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,919
But girls have to
have a date to go.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,400
And my bottom of the barrel kill
myself desperation date is taken.

147
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,999
Oh, I'm honored
you'd think of me,

148
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,520
but why not just ask who
you always used to go with?

149
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,839
Hey, Daphne, can you believe
all this dumb ghost stuff?

150
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, God,
it's another ghost!

151
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,279
The ghost of Velma.

152
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,520
Someone make it disappear
by trying to talk to it.

153
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,600
Yeah, yeah, I know I've
been MIA, but what...

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,959
- What the hell, Fred?
- Go to Fog Fest with me.

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,319
Please.

156
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,880
Stop throwing money at my face.

157
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,680
You're supposed to
scare me, not hurt me.

158
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,839
No, Daphne. Fred's
really asking me,

159
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,719
and I'm supposed to be scared

160
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
he's back into basic hot girls who
work out and wear non candy jewelry.

161
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,960
Oh, if only that were true,
my buttery little beach ball.

162
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,799
- But I am asking Daphne.
- Huh?

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
I have to be Fog King.

164
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,839
Excuse me?

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Wait, you said
Fog King, not f...

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,039
In that case, I will
happily go with you, Fred.

167
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,079
- Yes!
- But, Daphne!

168
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,920
Are Fred and Daphne
are back together?

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,960
What does "jinkies" mean?

170
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,320
Well,

171
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,937
- we're off to Fog Fest.
- Have fun.

172
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll just be here, alone,
catching the serial killer.

173
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,760
It's a ghost.

174
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,642
You know what? I'm not
gonna let you ruin my fun.

175
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,720
Daphne. Daphne!

176
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,599
I see you ignoring me.

177
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,359
Yeah, what's that like?

178
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,160
Wait, and now you're drinking?

179
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,400
That's uncharacteristic.
What's going on?

180
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,279
Wait.

181
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,200
I forgot I also used my mom's
terrible manuscripts to kill spiders.

182
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,817
Detective
Diya Jinkies held the note

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,640
in front of a candle flame,
and a secret message appeared.

184
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,920
"I ache for you,
Detective Jinkies.

185
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,079
Love, Santa Claus."

186
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,799
Mom, gross!
Wait, that's it.

187
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,719
A phone number.

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,879
Hello?

189
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,079
<i> Is this
the serial killer?</i>

190
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,999
You better not make a
skin suit out of my mom

191
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,399
just because brown don't crack.

192
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,559
Damn it, he hung up.

193
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
Okay, Velma, what did you hear?

194
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,880
There was a crowd,
a roller coaster,

195
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,319
and a foghorn.

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,519
Oh, my God, the serial
killer is at Fog Fest.

197
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,399
My queen.

198
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,280
Okay, girls can't go to
Fog Fest without a date,

199
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,680
so our only hope of
getting in, is makeup.

200
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Like a lot. Like, I'm talking

201
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,920
40-year-old actress
had an audition.

202
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,800
Single guy, you can enter. Woman
with a date, you can enter.

203
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,079
Next!

204
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:52,840
Evening, officers.

205
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,640
My name is Manny.

206
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,697
And as you can tell by my
mustache, I am a male human,

207
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,559
and not at all related
to Velma Dinkley.

208
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay, sir, I don't need you
mansplaining who you are to me.

209
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,240
There's something
funny about you.

210
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,480
Not LOL funny,

211
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,400
but more thoughtful
and well observed,

212
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,999
like a female driven comedy.

213
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,119
Uh, are you suggesting I am
a woman dressed as a man?

214
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,639
Because if you are...

215
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,840
- Nut tap!
- Ahhh!

216
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,239
Very good.

217
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,839
Only a true man would know
the joy and camaraderie

218
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,760
found in the surprise tapping...

219
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,519
...of another
man's testicles. Ahhh!

220
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,759
And now, to find
the serial killer.

221
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,639
- Nut tap!
- Ahhh!

222
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,080
That is assault.

223
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
Where is
he? Where is he?

224
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,159
Where is the serial killer?

225
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,759
Ring. Ring.

226
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,839
There he is!

227
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,680
Wait. Why aren't we
dropping and puking?

228
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,880
I see the serial killer!

229
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,639
It's
a ghost, you idiot!

230
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,600
Also, sorry, my guy.

231
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,800
But I paid the carny to
keep us up here for a bit.

232
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,479
No, I have to get down
now. He's getting away.

233
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,280
Norville, what's going on?

234
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,160
Gigi, I have something
very important to ask you.

235
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:03,480
I told you no, I'm not wearing
elf ears when we make out.

236
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,239
Uh, no. Look, I am so sorry

237
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,599
I ignored your calls, when you
almost died from a bee sting.

238
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,999
I know how belittling it feels to be
sent to voicemail by someone you like.

239
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm talking about Velma.

240
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,159
- I used to really like her.
- I know.

241
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,959
Well, you deserve
better than that.

242
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,159
So, I am here tonight to ask...

243
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,159
Gigi, will you be my Fog Queen?

244
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,319
No, I can't die! Sophie's gonna
put a treadmill in my room!

245
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,800
Hey, guys, I'm Fred Jones.

246
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,160
Vote for me for Fog King,

247
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,839
or I will make it my
life's work to destroy you.

248
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,879
What?

249
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,439
Norville?

250
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,479
Where'd the serial killer go?

251
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,839
Who is that tasty snack?

252
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
Well, at
least I seem to have

253
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,479
scared the serial killer
away from Fog Fest.

254
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,279
Stop staring.

255
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,919
I know I'm eating like a caveman

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,057
in a natural history diorama,
but I'm having a bad night.

257
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
We're not disgusted.

258
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,319
We're impressed.

259
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,080
Can you teach me how to
unhinge my jaw like that?

260
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,440
I wanna join a sorority.

261
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,599
Impressed? But that's
such a double standard.

262
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,479
Every day at lunch, you're like,
"Hey, mayonnaise isn't soup."

263
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,000
We've never met
before, but I'm Olive.

264
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,160
As in O-live-to party.

265
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,479
Cool.

266
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,800
Well, I gotta squirt.

267
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,319
Oh, my God, and
you're hilarious.

268
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,960
Norville, what the hell is this?

269
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,120
You really think you can
beat me for Fog King?

270
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,360
Yes, I do.

271
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,919
You're gonna be a
big Fog King loser.

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
Guys, guys.

273
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,880
Since we're already
on the dance floor,

274
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,080
how about we settle this
the old-fashioned way?

275
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,272
Dance-off!

276
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,800
Ugh, those feel played out.

277
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,399
I was thinking a fight-off.

278
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,520
It's like a dance-off,
but with fists.

279
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,319
Oh, uh, I don't think that...

280
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,920
Norville, please!

281
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,879
Being Fog Queen isn't
that important to me.

282
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,239
Gigi, stop!

283
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,097
You're only saying that
because you're so damaged

284
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,720
by being sent to voicemail
by Velma, I mean me,

285
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,839
that you don't think
you deserve a crown.

286
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,719
But I... I mean you
do deserve a crown.

287
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,399
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

288
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,999
Guys put zero pressure on
you to wash your hands.

289
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,768
Even though I didn't
catch the serial killer,

290
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,519
at least tonight's
not a total loss.

291
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
Who are you?

292
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,200
Uh, Manny, the man, Jonas.

293
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,439
You remind me of
my friend, Velma.

294
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,839
Wait, so we are still friends?

295
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,319
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

296
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,959
Well, I like this song,

297
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,217
and my date is rolling around
on the ground with another guy.

298
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,400
Care to dance, mysterious Manny?

299
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,239
Oh, I'm a terrible dancer.

300
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,759
My body is really only
built to ram things.

301
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,239
Don't
care, we're dancing.

302
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,719
Oh, my God, Manny.
It's so cute

303
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,279
when guys pretend dancing
is lame and half-ass it.

304
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,559
You don't find it annoying?

305
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,559
You've clearly studied
dance for years,

306
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,759
and yet any bozo can take over a
dance floor just by doing the worm.

307
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,600
What's that? You're
gonna do the worm?

308
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,039
Hell, yes, you are!

309
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,640
No, I'm not doing the worm.

310
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm not even allowed to do it
without a note from my doctor.

311
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,199
Worm!
Worm! Worm! Worm!

312
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,040
Worm! Worm!

313
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,479
Yes, finally!

314
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,200
Wait a second. As a
guy, everyone thinks

315
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,640
my worst qualities as
a girl are awesome.

316
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,920
- Nut tap!
- Ahhh!

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,520
We're impressed.

318
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,840
Ah! Yeah!

319
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,680
That's it! I know how
to convince everyone

320
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,479
there's still a serial
killer on the loose.

321
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,816
Everyone.

322
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,039
I have something to say.

323
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,080
And as a man speaking
authoritatively,

324
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,920
you're going to listen to me
and you're going to believe me.

325
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,280
Ghosts are not real.

326
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,680
Look, I know that as
Americans, we wanna party.

327
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,359
But curfew cannot end because the
serial killer is still on the loose.

328
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,560
That's what my
daughter's been saying.

329
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,839
But for some reason I
believe it more from you.

330
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,199
We all do.

331
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,705
Okay, well, we're
safe for tonight

332
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,640
because I scared the
serial killer off.

333
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,039
But tomorrow, curfew's back
on, okay? What do you say?

334
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,119
What do we say?

335
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,080
We say, Manny for Fog King!

336
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,120
Manny for Fog King!

337
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,080
Wait, really?

338
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:16,959
What?

339
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,959
Okay, this is bad,
but we can still win.

340
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,280
Gigi, do you trust me?

341
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,360
- No, not at all.
- And why would you?

342
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,856
I wrapped your self-worth up in
a crown and failed to deliver it.

343
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,656
Fortunately, I have a plan.

344
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,239
If you fall off the
pier and I rescue you...

345
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,680
Holy crap!

346
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,776
No wonder men are so desperate
to hold onto their power.

347
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,199
This is the easiest shit ever.

348
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,200
As a guy, I can do anything.

349
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,919
So I say, "Lady, I'll give you the
parking spot when you stop being a bitch."

350
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,599
Manny! Manny!

351
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,639
- Oh, yeah!
- Manny! Manny!

352
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,320
No crown, no home!

353
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,159
What? Can I at least
get my jade roller

354
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,079
and $10,000 for emergencies?

355
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,040
- Manny!
- Manny for King of the world!

356
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,000
I bet you'd be
great at Fog King.

357
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,919
Hey, so I should probably go
before this goes too farce...

358
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,120
Uh, far, I mean.

359
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,960
Whoa, hey. You're, like,

360
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,359
drunker than a cool
babysitter. You okay?

361
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,719
Honestly? No, Manny.

362
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,999
I'm drinking because I've had
a terrible couple of weeks.

363
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,559
I know we just met. But
can you keep a secret?

364
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,680
Uh, am I a woman just
pretending to be a man?

365
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,719
I mean, yes.

366
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,440
Okay, so I'm adopted.

367
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,440
And I located my birth parents.

368
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,319
But they turned out
to be criminals!

369
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,399
Criminals! Oh, my God.

370
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,120
Why wouldn't you tell Velma?

371
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,879
That, uh, super cool and
attentive bestie you mentioned?

372
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,279
I've tried.

373
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,199
But unless you're helping
her find her dumb mom,

374
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,399
she has no time for you.

375
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,879
Okay, well, a missing
mom is pretty big.

376
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,799
My criminal parents
also abandoned me!

377
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
Like I was a puppy
after quarantine.

378
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,760
Oh, that's awful.

379
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,760
But is that bigger than...
No, no, you're right.

381
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,377
A good friend would
have been there for you,

382
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,799
even if your thing wasn't
worse than her thing.

383
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Still, this Velma kind of sucks.

384
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,239
Thank you, Manny.

385
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,039
I can't believe I told you,

386
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,840
but I feel like we have
this crazy connection.

387
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,199
Do you feel it, too?

388
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,120
I, uh, do.

389
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,279
But look, I really need
to tell you something.

390
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,800
I'd be super psyched
to kiss you right now.

391
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,599
I bet you would, Velma.

392
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,817
That's my actual mustache,
Fred. I just didn't shave it.

393
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,199
- Velma?
- Uh, no?

394
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,159
Uh, yes!

395
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,177
I've dreamt of those calloused longshoremen's
hands touching my face for weeks.

396
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,599
So as soon as she
slapped me, I knew.

397
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm so sorry, Daphne.

398
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,240
Ugh, I'd punch you, if men
didn't sexualize women fighting.

399
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,440
Baby, come on. You're
acting hysterical.

400
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,399
Damn it!

401
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,319
Okay. And now to officially

402
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
announce this year's Fog
King. You all know who it is.

403
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,321
Wait! Mother! Everyone.

404
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,640
I just learned that Manny
is actually Velma Dinkley

405
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,279
in disguise, and... to be Fog King.

406
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,560
- Oh, my God!
- What?

407
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:17,959
Hold on. Hold on a second.

408
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,240
If Manny's a female interloper,

409
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,599
is or is not the
serial killer a ghost?

410
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,599
Look, if we're being honest, just
like everything else these days,

411
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,560
the serial killer is whatever you
need it to be to feel your best.

412
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,960
And speaking of your best,
who wants to make me Fog King?

413
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,559
We all would, Fred!

414
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,257
Yes!

415
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,359
If we hadn't just
given it to Norville.

416
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,559
He rescued a girl who
fell off the pier.

417
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,000
I was pushed!

418
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
Thank you.

419
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,399
First and foremost, I need
to say, "You're welcome"

420
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,040
to my deserving Fog Queen, Gigi.

421
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,200
I knew this crown would
restore your self-worth.

422
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,919
Gigi, are you out there?

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,559
Gigi?

424
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,559
Gigi?

425
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,079
Daphne, I'm sorry. I wanted
to tell you I was Manny,

426
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,719
but as a guy, there's so little
consequence for your actions.

427
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,480
I was, like, "I'd be an idiot not
to at least try and go for it."

428
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,880
Ba-ba-booey!

429
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
You know, the sad thing is,
I'm not even mad at you.

430
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,719
I'm mad at myself
for letting you find

431
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,320
yet another way
to disappoint me.

432
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,479
I know, and I'm mad at myself

433
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,519
for being selfish
and a bad friend,

434
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,519
who only makes time for people
who can help me find my mom.

435
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,880
Maybe we should both be guys

436
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,760
and just stop caring
about feeling so much.

437
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,520
If you were a guy, you'd die
of gonorrhea within the year.

438
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,359
Yeah, but what a year.

439
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,520
Anyway, I didn't
mean to blow you off.

440
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,879
I just feel guilty ever doing anything
other than looking for my mom.

441
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,840
Can you forgive me?

442
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,400
Watch out!

443
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,079
Gigi! Where are you?

444
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,960
The king and queen are supposed to
tastefully grind on the dance floor now.

445
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,320
That belongs to me.

446
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,679
It belongs to the people.

447
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,920
We are a constitutional
fog-archy, damn it!

448
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,200
A churro? Ha!

449
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,839
Norville, stop!

450
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,029
Going through doors like this
isn't physically possible.

451
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,320
Oh, God, you're right!

452
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,599
My entire perception of
reality is crumbling.

453
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,039
Wait, no, it's just a ride.

454
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,959
Now come back here!

455
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,200
Velma, look. An
old-timey photo booth.

456
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,600
We can disguise ourselves.

457
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,999
Daphne, that's stupid.

458
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,880
It will take at least
five minutes to change.

459
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,439
Who would ever stop to put on a
costume in the middle of a chase?

460
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,320
Shoot. The serial killer
disappeared in the fog.

461
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,999
Yeah, but by fog rules,
he still has to be nearby.

462
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
Wait, Fred has his phone?

463
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
Okay? For the last time. Are you,
or are you not, the serial killer?

464
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm not. This dumb thing

465
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,440
must have gotten swapped with
my crown in the fog. So, like,

466
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
I know it's bad he
killed a bunch of girls,

467
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,960
but if I don't find
the crown right now,

468
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm gonna have to spend
the night in my limo.

469
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,679
Also, come to think of
it, has anyone seen Gigi?

470
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,199
I'm worried the
serial killer got her.

471
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,159
Oh, no!

472
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,839
Wait, no. There she
is, by the exit.

473
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,399
Gigi? Wait.

474
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,920
Are you a man who's been disguised
as a woman this whole time?

475
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:57,880
A Gi-Joe?

476
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,319
No. I switched clothes

477
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,399
with a dumb carriage
driver in the dumb fog.

478
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,680
Not that you care.

479
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,920
Not that I care?

480
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,599
Are you upset? How?
You won Fog Queen.

481
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,800
You showed the world you don't deserve
to be ignored by people you like.

482
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:14,080
You ignored me all night trying
to win those Fog King crowns.

483
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,720
Oh, my God, you're right.

484
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,839
I'm a monster.

485
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,599
No, you're not.

486
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,520
You're weird, sure, but
you're also sweet and amazing,

487
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,239
and deserve to be treated well.

488
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,960
Anyone who makes you feel like
you need a crown to prove that,

489
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,600
is the monster, Norville.

490
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Wait, me? Why are
we talking about me?

491
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,439
This whole thing was only ever
about you and your emotions.

492
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,920
Yeah, okay, my King.

493
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,719
A crown! Oh, I can go home.

494
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,400
Who's pathetic now, Father?

495
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,160
Well, I wasn't able
to convince the town

496
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,760
to keep a curfew to protect
them from the serial killer.

497
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,079
But it won't matter.

498
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,816
Now that you have the
serial killer's cellphone,

499
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,160
I know you're gonna catch
him and find your mom.

500
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,720
And after that, I will focus on
only things that you wanna do.

501
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,039
Like complaining about girls I
thought you were friends with.

502
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,279
I'd like that, thanks.

503
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,239
Oh! Damn, girl.

504
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,200
How'd you get all that ass
in those little slacks?
