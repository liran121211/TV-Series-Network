00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:07,639
<i> Previously on</i> Velma

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,280
She has no brain!

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,040
Now, when I try to
solve a mystery,

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,399
my guilt triggers
a potentially heart
stopping hallucination.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,280
Wait, you think
I killed Brenda?

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,239
You just said you were
going to do to me
what you did to her.

7
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:24,560
I meant pay you
to keep quiet.
I'm innocent!

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,680
Uh, Velma,
you should see this.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,800
Oh God, it's Krista!

10
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,600
And she also
has no brain.

11
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,759
<i> So, what's</i>
<i>more surprising?</i>

12
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,160
<i>Fred Jones being arrested</i>
<i>for murdering and</i>
<i>removing the brains</i>

13
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,039
<i>of Brenda Bright</i>
<i>and Krista McCray</i>

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,560
<i>or that his delicate,</i>
<i>teen heartthrob good looks</i>

15
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,359
<i>stem from the fact</i>
<i>that he hasn't gone</i>
<i>through puberty yet?</i>

16
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,080
<i> The murders.</i>
<i>Obviously, it's the murders.</i>

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,319
It's not small, it's scared!

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,920
<i> But it just</i>
<i>goes to show,</i>

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,039
<i>we all have secrets.</i>

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,879
Velma's birthday gift!

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,239
<i> Even the ones</i>
<i>we least expect.</i>

22
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,920
<i> But as much</i>
<i>as you try to hide</i>
<i>who you really are...</i>

23
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,639
Your ass is mine,
best friend.

24
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,919
<i>...Velma Dinkley</i>
<i>always knows</i>
<i>the ugly truth,</i>

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,039
Velma, have you
seen that sweater vest
I bought Sophie?

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,719
Uh, no.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,479
<i>Because without your ascot,</i>
<i>you're naked.</i>

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,280
<i>Jones Gentlemen's Accessories.</i>

29
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,600
<i>What are you, poor?</i>

30
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:53,720
Yes, Fred Jones,
heir to the Jones Gentlemen's
Accessories fortune,

31
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,679
was arrested last night
for murder.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,519
Yeah, thanks to me!

33
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,359
And according to
the police, Jones would have
gotten away with it, too.

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,879
if it wasn't for
his classmate...

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,959
Say my name, say my name.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,160
Vermin Dorkley.

37
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,040
It's Velma Dorkley!
I mean Dinkley!

38
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,840
And finally only
one lawyer has agreed
to represent Fred Jones.

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,480
Vermin's own father,

40
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,120
-Aman Dinkley!
-What?

41
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,119
Velma, winning
this case could make
your father rich!

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,959
I already bought
a baby monitor
that shoots on film.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,519
It just looks more real,
you know?

44
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,879
Exactly.

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,799
I mean, look at this
from my perspective, Velma.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,679
If you needed money
to keep your
pregnant girlfriend happy,

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
and then you heard what
the Joneses are
willing to pay,

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,640
I'm sure you'd agree
it's possible
Fred didn't do it.

49
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,560
Fred's a rich white guy
with a tiny dong.

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,239
He did it.
Now, excuse me.

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,159
I have to go find
my missing mother.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,280
You didn't mention
Fred had a tiny dong.

53
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:43,640
Oh yeah, real baby carrot.

54
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,800
And I'm going to ride it
all the way to victory!

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,560
Wow, people seem to
be taking to the fact

56
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,080
that Fred is
a brain stealing sociopath

57
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,760
-really well.
-All our classmates

58
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:57,679
are idiots or sheep,
so let's assume
they're high.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
Man, if I ever even think
about getting into 420,
420 culture,

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,960
or especially
420 related humor, kill me.

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,560
You know what 420 is right?

62
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,880
Um, yeah.
It's code for adults
who still watch cartoons.

63
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,040
Now, have you seen Daphne?
Her parents are detectives,

64
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,479
so I need her help
to get my mom's
cold case files.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,359
You want me to come with
in case you have
another hallucination?

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Thanks. But after
catching Fred,
I feel my hallucinations

67
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
are like the return of
high waisted jeans.

68
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,160
It took a while,
but we're finally through
the worst of it.

69
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,240
Sweetie, are you sure
you don't want to take
a mental health day?

70
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,200
It's not often your boyfriend
is arrested

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
for removing
two of your friends' brains.

72
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,479
Thank you.
But if the kids in
every teen show ever

73
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,600
can get through a brush
with a deranged serial killer,
so can I.

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,480
Good lord!

75
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,040
It smells like the
Playboy Jazz Festival
out there.

76
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:45,080
And a kid's eating
sheet cake at 8:00
in the morning.

77
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,479
-You thinking
what I'm thinking?
-Let's go get a sheet cake?

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,439
High five!

79
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,720
Hey, Daphne.

80
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,480
What do you want, Vermin?

81
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,960
Just to offer my
sincerest condolences

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,000
for the loss of your
more popular friends
that you picked over me.

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,400
Stop! I know you think
I'm a huge bitch
who ditched you to be cool.

84
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,480
What? That's so not true.

85
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,799
Fine.

86
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,080
I need a favor.

87
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,759
I need you to get me
my mom's cold case file.

88
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,800
Why would I do that?

89
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,920
We're not friends anymore.

90
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,759
-We're nemesises...
-Nemeses.

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,480
-That's why.
-Okay.

92
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:19,719
Well, I was hoping
you'd get it for me
for old time's sake.

93
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,240
I see.

94
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,599
Well, for old time's sake,
I'll give you the file...

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,319
-Really?
-For $500.

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,840
Five hundred dollars?
That's like,
a million dollars.

97
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,879
Well, like you said,
I'm a huge bitch.

98
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,040
I was being sarcastic.

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,719
You can't read tone
in graffiti.

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,560
Five hundred dollars
or nothing.

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,960
Now, first, thank you
for taking my case.

102
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,079
We could not be happier
you're on the team,
Velma's dad.

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,319
Sorry, what we meant
to say is that you are
our last choice.

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,119
And if you blow this,
my family will bring

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,279
the full weight of
Jones Gentlemen's Accessories

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,479
and Jones Gentlemen's
Accessories for Women

107
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,679
down on your head!

108
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,680
Okay, uh, well, the case
won't be easy.

109
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,479
Of course it will.
I'm innocent.

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,080
The only reason
people think I removed
those girls' brains

111
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
is because I
"basically confessed"

112
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,919
and have
"well documented anger issues".

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
I mean, does that even mean?

114
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,560
Hey! Am I on a hunger strike?

115
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,520
Where the hell are my pancakes?

116
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,040
Uh, are you trying to
choke me to death?

117
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,319
You forgot cutties.

118
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,399
You're embarrassing
ourself, Frederick.

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,039
It's bad enough
you still eat pancakes

120
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,679
and drink non alcoholic
beverages like a baby!

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,920
Yes, Father.
Sorry... Sorry, Father.

122
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,000
Our apologies, Aman.

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,600
Freddie is due in court
this afternoon, and the case
has everyone out of sorts.

124
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,679
No, this childishness
is actually perfect.

125
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,920
See, I feel the only way
to prove Fred's innocence

126
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,759
is to play up the fact
that he's a late bloomer.

127
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,120
I mean, the world
sees Fred Jones,
teen sociopath.

128
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,879
So instead,
let's show them Fred Jones,
innocent little boy.

129
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,239
It can't miss, right?

130
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,639
Please say it can't miss.

131
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,239
My girlfriend just bought
a $2,000 stroller.

132
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,840
-It hovers.
-William,

133
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,359
our son cannot go to prison.

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,320
He can barely survive
on the outside as is.

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,840
Victoria, admitting
he's a little boy is worse
than any crime.

136
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,360
It's embarrassing.

137
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,360
He is the future CEO of
Jones Gentlemen's Accessories!

138
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,799
Is he, though?

139
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, try it your way.

140
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,439
Great. I just hope people
can actually think
I'm a little kid.

141
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,840
Ah, crap. I'm all syrupy.

142
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:29,879
Bathies!

143
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
So, Velma,

144
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,679
what brings you to
Casa Del Norville Rogers,
Blythe Rogers

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,840
and me, his father,
Lamont Rogers?

146
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,079
Here for a Rogering,
as we might say?

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,840
Oh, I was just in
the neighborhood.

148
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,919
No ulterior motive whatsoever.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
Hey, that's a nice vase.

150
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,440
Is that worth $500?

151
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,480
Oh, hey, look who's busy
not finding my
missing mother.

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,360
Actually, Daphne's moms
are here

153
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,759
because they think we have
a Candy Man problem
at school.

154
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,639
And as the principal,
I've asked them
to go undercover

155
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,760
as high school students
to find them.

156
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,600
And that's the 4-1-1,
home skillet.

157
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:05,479
Words.

158
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,479
Candy Man?

159
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,119
I think you mean
Sugar Daddy?

160
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
And Sarah's 18.

161
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,680
Her parents are cool with it.

162
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,439
A Candy Man's
a drug dealer,
V-Dawg.

163
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I knew that.

164
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,520
So is Norville in his room?

165
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,679
What's going on, guys.

166
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,680
So today on Norville Snacks,
our World Tour

167
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,759
continues East,
as we say<i> ni hao</i>

168
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,439
to Beijing style shrimp chips.

169
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,359
-Norville!
-Velma! Not while I'm live.

170
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,839
I can't get banned for
your thoughts on South Asian
desserts again.

171
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm so sorry,
but this is important.

172
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,160
Daphne wants $500 for the file,

173
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,559
and all my money
is tied up in
streaming services.

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,359
Velma, I don't have it.

175
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,920
My mom's birthday
is coming up, and this year
she just wants cash.

176
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,680
Otherwise, you know
I'd give it to you.

177
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,519
I know, it's okay.

178
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,559
Like the dessert course
at an Indian restaurant
just forget it.

179
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,280
Wait in teen movies,

180
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,920
whenever a girl
needs money,

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,479
a guy sells something

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,799
and then blackmails
the girl into dating him
for it.

183
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,759
Problematic, but effective.
And hilarious!

184
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,360
So it was not easy,

185
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,120
but I got your $5.

186
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,999
I assume I-O-U's are okay?

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,639
It's $500, Velma.

188
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,239
But if you don't have it,
there might be a way
you can earn it.

189
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,279
I was thinking you could
come work for me.

190
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,639
Doing what?
And is the office culture cool?

191
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
Like, are there snacks?

192
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,480
You're the Candy Man?

193
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,880
Candy Woman.

194
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,559
And I have
your sugar right here.

195
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,199
Daphne, why would you
deal drugs?

196
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,920
You're beautiful and popular.

197
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,160
Being a bad girl too
just muddles your brand.

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,320
This doesn't make me
a bad girl.

199
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,320
According to TV,
it's morally okay
to deal drugs

200
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,079
if your life is just
kind of crappy.

201
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,840
Like your kid's sick,
you're a widow
with a mortgage.

202
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,479
You have to live on a lake
in Missouri.

203
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,160
Those are all
white people, Daphne.

204
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,320
Minorities on TV
can only deal drugs
to escape poverty.

205
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,960
Wait, that's it.

206
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,040
This is about you
trying to run with
your fancy rich crowd.

207
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,920
Yup, that must be it.

208
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,800
Because the brilliant
Velma Dinkley knows
everything about everyone,

209
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,480
and isn't afraid to say it.

210
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,599
Exactly. I spit truth
without a filter,

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,120
like every
comedian before
hashtag "MeToo".

212
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,440
Look, are you in
or are you out?

213
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,800
Oh, I'm out.

214
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,679
Because if you
don't give me
that file,

215
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,599
I'll tell your
police officer moms

216
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,120
their perfect daughter is...

217
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:20,039
You. Wouldn't. Dare.

218
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,319
Yeah, no, it was a dumb idea.

219
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
So what are we selling?

220
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,879
Oh, just the usual.
Zoinks, Jeepers,
Mystery Machine,

221
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,319
and of course,
guh-guh-guh-guh-ganja.

222
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,440
Only $80?

223
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,159
But I need $500
to get a girl to date me.

224
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,520
Hilarious. But no.

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,280
Psst. You want to
make some real money?

226
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,040
I don't have time
to flip houses,
but I'll hear you out.

227
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,640
Nice roller bag.

228
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,320
You selling bibles later?

229
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,559
Nice outfit.
You driving a big rig
to Bakersfield later.

230
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,039
No, dummy.
This is a disguise.

231
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,599
Because what we're doing
is illegal.

232
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,560
Oh, sorry we can't
all make it rain
cool shades, El Chapo.

233
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,880
You know what?
Let's just do this.

234
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't you want any tips
on selling?

235
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,839
Mmm, I think I got it.

236
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,439
Drugs are like crack
to these people.

237
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,119
<i>Now most cultures of the world</i>
<i>as a rule, wouldn't mix</i>
<i>kiwi and whitefish.</i>

238
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,319
<i>But they don't play</i>
<i>by the rules in North Korea.</i>

239
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,920
Drugs here!

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Get your drugs here!

241
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,039
Narc, narc.

242
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,239
White girl
with too much money
white girl with too much money.

243
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,600
You don't know me.
I'm a white girl who's bored.

244
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,919
Let's roll.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,439
Yeah. Go. I don't care.

246
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,200
Enjoy your slow descent
into organic farming, losers.

247
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,880
Look, I know you're a genius...

248
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
-Thank you.
-Who thinks she has
everyone pegged.

249
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,800
-Only because I do.
-But you might have
more success with this

250
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,880
if you went in
just a little less judgy.

251
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
Wait, I'm judgy?

252
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,600
You would say
something like that.

253
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,239
You want your mom's
cold case file, right?

254
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,359
Yes. Fine.

255
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,439
I'll try. I'll try.

256
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,039
If you want to
get swole, try Zoinks!

257
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,799
You'll be bouncing them
big old man boobs

258
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,719
faster than you can say,
"Who is this for?"

259
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,040
Yeah, we like the
sound of that.

260
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,079
What'll it cost?

261
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,719
Not much.
Just your dad's love

262
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
when you blow out
your knee and
lose your scholarship.

263
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,079
I was being helpful.

264
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,440
The sooner he can
focus on getting his real
estate license, the better.

265
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,039
Jeepers raises
your dopamine levels,

266
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,959
so it will definitely
help you memorize your lines.

267
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,039
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

268
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:14,959
Huzzah!

269
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,440
Yeah. I'm sorry, Velma.

270
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,040
I could feel you forcing that.

271
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,039
Yeah. You know
what else feels forced?

272
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Your belief that
you're the only one
sleeping with the lead.

273
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Oh, my God.

274
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,479
Sorry. Sorry.

275
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,119
Okay. You're fired.

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,439
What? Why?

277
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,279
Uh, will I sell you a kidney,

278
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:42,279
to get the $500
I need to make Velma date me?

279
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,759
I mean, I'd be a fool
not to at this point, right?

280
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,840
Justice for
Brenda and Krista!

281
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,040
It's a mob scene here
as Fred Jones arrives

282
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,479
for his day in court.

283
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
Aman, over here.

284
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,199
Aman! How could
you risk your career
and entire livelihood

285
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,159
on the most
unlikeable defendant

286
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,759
since that chimpanzee
who ate a woman's face?

287
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,280
Because what you see as risk,

288
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:08,280
I see as mere... child's play.

289
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,599
Hewo fwends! My name is Fwed!

290
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,760
What's yours?

291
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,599
Wow, I think I speak
for the entire journalistic
community when I say,

292
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,399
"Don't I feel like an asshole!"

293
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,359
No way this scrumptious muffin
removed those girls' brains!

294
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,200
T'anks, news lady!

295
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,960
Stop! No pictures!

296
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,600
Unless it's in portrait mode!

297
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,400
Oh, God,

298
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,200
he looks like Hitler!

299
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,240
And not just because
we compare everyone
to Hitler these days.

300
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:40,719
Ugh, come on!

301
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,679
You couldn't keep
your opinions to
yourself, could you?

302
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,879
I literally
had to take five Jeepers

303
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,319
not to strangle you... Whoa!

304
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,039
Oh, sorry, I can't just
conjure up a whole
new personality

305
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,200
whenever I want
like some sort of sexy witch.

306
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,639
Is that really
what you think of me?

307
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,119
Hey, girlies!

308
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,439
Okay, since you know so much,

309
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,239
why am I selling drugs?

310
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
Um, easy.

311
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,440
You're looking
to rebel against
your overprotective parents

312
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,159
but don't have
the balls to get pregnant.

313
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,439
Wrong!

314
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm saving money
to hire a private investigator

315
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,160
to find my biological family.

316
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:18,040
Yeah. Unexpected twist.

317
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,280
Holy crap. Really?

318
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,879
Looking for
your family is a big deal.

319
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,519
Yeah, it's just

320
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,080
you know how
different I am from my moms.

321
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,599
I need to
find out who I really am.

322
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,000
Where do I come from?

323
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,360
And how is my hair
the color of buffalo wings?

324
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:33,680
I just always
figured your parents
were Wilma Flintstone

325
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,559
and Daniel Dae Kim.

326
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,359
Freeze, person in baseball hat,

327
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:39,160
putting drugs
in my daughter's locker

328
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,680
and other Oompa Loompa person!

329
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,839
-We know you're the candymen!
-Linda!

330
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,599
You're a cop
and not a teenager?

331
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,799
But I love you!

332
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,240
What do we do?
I can't go to jail.

333
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,640
-Run!
-You know I can't.

334
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,639
I'd prefer jail.

335
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,439
I'm trapped!

336
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,160
Oh, God!

337
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,360
Oh, God, Daphne, no!

338
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
Baby want sheet cake?

339
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,240
Hey, hurry up in there!

340
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:51,840
Give me the money!

341
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,399
You wish, guy from
that "wanted" poster
all over town,

342
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,999
All right. Don't make me
come in the bathroom.

343
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
I'm a thief, not a perve.

344
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,640
Nothing can stop me

345
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,680
from buying Velma's love!

346
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
Oh, that might.

347
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,439
Hey!

348
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,600
It is Norville
from Norville Snacks.

349
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,920
Like, let him go, man.

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,519
Wait, you stoners
watch Norville Snacks?

351
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,160
Damn it! This is exactly
what happened to my
vlog about Lil Wayne.

352
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,600
God, where is that candyman?

353
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,800
I mean candyperson.
It could be anybody.

354
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,039
Even though we both
definitely know it's a man.

355
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:34,120
"I'm home and want
to adopt a sick cat.
Where are you?"

356
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,479
A cat needs our love!

357
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,119
Out of our way!

358
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,679
Whoa, that totally
worked, Velma.

359
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,919
A lotta help.

360
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,920
Oh, sorry. I was just
wiping some garbage
slime off your cheek.

361
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,839
Oh. Yeah, me too. Slime.

362
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,720
Okay. Well, thankfully,
your moms are still
hella bad detectives.

363
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,280
Yeah,

364
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,560
they still think I spent
$200 on a math tutor
named Coachella.

365
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,000
Wait. Am I enjoying
hanging out with you again?

366
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,999
Or is it the high
of moderate exercise?

367
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,760
I don't know. Maybe I'm
not the shallow monster
you think I've become.

368
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,400
Maybe you
judge people so harshly

369
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,279
because it's easier
to feel right from afar

370
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,359
than risk
getting close
and being wrong.

371
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,959
Okay, Easy, Dr. Phil.

372
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,519
I'm the brains
of this operation.

373
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,799
You're just the look,
style and effortless charm.

374
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,920
We do make
a good team, don't we?

375
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,680
Well,

376
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,160
speaking of teams,
someone's looking to score.

377
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,599
and if you
want your mom's file,

378
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,560
you're going
to sell to them my way.

379
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,839
That's him.
The guy in the beanie.

380
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,439
It's always
the guy in the beanie.

381
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,600
A beanie? It's 90 degrees out!

382
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,960
And I'm not supposed to assume

383
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,119
-he's hiding a bald spot?
-No! Less assuming!

384
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,479
More criminal behavior.

385
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,360
Go!

386
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,959
Drugs here.

387
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,360
Get your fresh
hot drugs here.

388
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,040
Hey, do you have
anything that can

389
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,559
make me feel better about
having ruined my life?

390
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,600
Wait, Dad?

391
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,639
Velma?

392
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,520
Why were you
selling drugs?

393
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,760
To make money, genius.

394
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,840
The real question is,

395
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
why were you
wearing a beanie?

396
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,239
Those are only
for television actors

397
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,119
who want you to know
that their roots
are still in theater.

398
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,039
Wait, you don't care
that I was buying drugs?

399
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,320
That makes sense.

400
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:17,439
You gambled our future
on Fred Jones' innocence

401
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,160
and now drugs
are the only escape.

402
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,559
But what do you
possibly need
drug dealing money for?

403
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,439
I already buy you
all the inhalers
you could ever want.

404
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,519
Oh, fine.

405
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,440
Daphne will give me Mom's
cold case file for $500.

406
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,839
Okay, look, I'll give you
the $500 for her file

407
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,599
if you help me
prove Fred's innocent.

408
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,119
What? Are you crazy?

409
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,240
Finding Fred innocent
would require me

410
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,039
to admit I'd incorrectly
pre-judged someone.

411
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,999
Wait.

412
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,759
Yeah. No, I was right.

413
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,799
Homeslice is like
Robert Durst level guilty.

414
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,720
Okay. But instead of just
staring at the evidence

415
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,000
and swearing very loudly,

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,920
do you maybe want
to ask me some questions?

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,039
Yeah, I do.
Why frame me?

418
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,199
Yeah, exactly.
Why would I do that?

419
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,400
Before you just
started talking,

420
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,120
I thought you were
our housekeeper.

421
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,200
Oh, my God,
could that be colder?

422
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,400
You know what?
Now I'm in a snit.

423
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,799
Let's regroup
after lunch.

424
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,240
Cutties.

425
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,840
Holy crap.
You are innocent.

426
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,720
He is?

427
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,320
Okay, here's
your $500 reward.

428
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,320
Good luck using it
to coerce Velma
into dating you.

429
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:32,560
Keep it. The stoners
caught him, not me.

430
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,160
If I want Velma
to like me now,

431
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,999
I'm just gonna have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

432
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,679
Bet a friend
I can make her fancy.

433
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,600
Ha! That's how
we got together.

434
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,520
Okay.
For my next witness,

435
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,639
I would like to call
the woman who caught Fred

436
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,320
my own daughter,
Velma Dinkley.

437
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
Velma, do you swear
to tell the truth,

438
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,519
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

439
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,640
So help me,
Shonda Rhimes, I do.

440
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,719
Now, Velma,
how long have you
known the defendant?

441
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,239
We met at lunch
in the eighth grade

442
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,000
when he confused me
for a beanbag chair.

443
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,159
Classic.

444
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,439
And what did you
think of my client?

445
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,600
Honestly, that
he was super hot.

446
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,759
But also that he was
just another
entitled rich guy

447
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,239
who might kill someone
because he has a tiny dong.

448
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,840
Unfortunately,
I was wrong about Fred.

449
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,400
<i>The way it's possible</i>

450
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,040
<i>I might have been wrong</i>
<i>about other people.</i>

451
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,079
Weird. It feels like
she's looking right at me.

452
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,519
Why would Velma want
to send me a message, Daphne?

453
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,680
Fred Jones did not kill
those two girls.

454
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,919
His whole life, Fred has
never had to lift a finger

455
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,959
to do anything.
He's been so pampered,

456
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,359
his body hasn't even felt
the need to fully mature.
I mean,

457
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,520
Fred literally
can't feed himself.

458
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,120
Uh, that's not true.

459
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,760
No, you...
You just cut the food
and put it on the...

460
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,439
W... What's the dumb thing
called? A dinglehopper!

461
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,080
Great. Show us.

462
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,560
Cutties.
Mother, cutties.

463
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,320
Oh, my God,
he is just like a little boy.

464
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:14,680
Exactly.

465
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,960
So tell me this.

466
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,999
How could someone
who can't even cut a steak

467
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,840
remove two girls' brains?

468
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,799
He couldn't!
Clearly Fred's innocent.

469
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,599
But at what cost
to his reputation

470
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,040
and that of his
family's business?

471
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,200
That lump has made
a mockery of us!

472
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,400
Be nice. Our son is free.

473
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,440
I'd say that lump
did quite well.

474
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,080
That's not true.

475
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,760
I'm a big boy.

476
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,960
A big boy who could
have removed those
dumb girls' brains,

477
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,639
no problem
if I wanted to!

478
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,439
Hear, hear!

479
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,000
Guilty.

480
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,480
Based on what?

481
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,439
Wow. Blonde-haired people
have bad days, too.

482
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,199
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

483
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,279
I'm ruined.

484
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,359
They wouldn't even
let me represent

485
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,999
a gymnastics coach now.

486
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
Daphne?

487
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,959
What are you doing here?

488
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,039
Wait. Did you
realize I stole
all your Zoinks?

489
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,760
-Please don't kill me.
-No, you're good.

490
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,879
I mean, return it
or I'll hurt you
very badly,

491
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,439
but I saw you on TV
and brought you this.

492
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,719
My mom's
cold case file! Thank you!

493
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,919
Wait, do you not
have potentially
fatal hallucinations

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
when you try to solve
mysteries anymore?

495
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,119
You remember that?

496
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
You had one of your
first ones at my house

497
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,440
back before...

498
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,999
Well, your fear pee stain
is still on my rug.

499
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,199
Well, I think I'm fine.

500
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,599
Norville helped me
get over them

501
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,759
in the last episode
of my hallucinations.

502
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Velma!

503
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,079
Are you hallucinating?
I'll put down newspaper.

504
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,320
No, it's a clue.

505
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:47,359
The last place my mom's
cell phone pinged

506
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,120
the night she went missing
was at Fred's house.

507
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,999
Damn it! I knew
that jerk was guilty.

508
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,840
Too bad
you'll never know for sure.

509
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,400
Ahhh! I was wrong again!
I'm hallucinating! Help!

510
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:00,280
No one can help
you now, Velma.

511
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,280
Solving mysteries
only causes pain.

512
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,280
Velma.
What do I do? Velma!

513
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,960
Try to make me laugh.

514
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,079
Okay, I, uh, oh,
I don't know any jokes

515
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,720
but my moms love my
impression of my Aunt Cindy.

516
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,399
I am sad
my husband died.

517
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,560
Anything?

518
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,640
No. Try something else.
Anything. Quick!

519
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,839
Oh God, my heart!

520
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,919
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

521
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,480
Did that work?

522
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,519
Yeah.

523
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,760
Great. Now even just
being myself won't work.

524
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,720
Romcoms can kiss my ass.

525
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,399
My name's Fred.
Who are you?

526
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,520
They call me The Thief.

527
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,560
What are you in for?

528
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,479
Thieving. But I'm innocent.

529
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,879
Aren't we all?

530
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,919
Ooh! Bunk beds!

531
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,319
Hoisties!
