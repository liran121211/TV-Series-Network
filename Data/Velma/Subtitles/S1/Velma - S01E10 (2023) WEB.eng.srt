1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,839
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,297
I had to find you because I still
didn't know if you'd listened to my VMs,

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,840
voice mails, let alone
responded. Did you?

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,399
<i> The police
found my mom's car</i>

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>abandoned and empty,
except for her glasses,</i>

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,400
<i>and a single wrapped gift.</i>

7
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,800
It's like what I said.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,279
Someone is trying to
recreate Dr. Perdue's work.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,919
Which means... Brains,
where's my mom?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,280
Best of luck in all your
future endeavors, Wilhelmina.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,519
Would you ever consider interning for
me at Jones Gentlemen's Accessories?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,827
Really?
Oh, my God, yes.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,800
What the actual hell?

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,800
Oh, my God, I do remember
who the serial killer is.

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,959
It's...

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,879
It's...

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,079
<i> It's me.</i>

18
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,160
<i> So, uh, yeah.</i>

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,879
<i>After all that, it turned out my mom
wasn't kidnapped by the serial killer.</i>

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,479
<i>Apparently, she was
the serial killer.</i>

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>And yet, it got worse.</i>

22
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:13,079
<i>Because it made no sense.
Reading Dr. Perdue's journals,</i>

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,320
<i>I couldn't understand why my mom</i>

24
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,439
<i>would recreate the work
of a mad scientist.</i>

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,079
I have to talk to her.

26
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,720
<i>Nothing added up. And yet,
no one seemed to care.</i>

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,959
Okay, the next item on the block

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,039
is this 1969 van,

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,280
recently used by Diya Dinkley,

30
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,559
one of America's only
female serial killers.

31
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,520
You can own a
piece of her-story.

32
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,119
<i> And yet,
it still got worse.</i>

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
Velma. There you are.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Any comment on today's
front page story?

35
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,560
<i>Because I'd also
lost my best friends.</i>

36
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,840
Norville, I'm sorry I accused your
dad of being the serial killer.

37
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,719
Norville, that's enough.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
Velma needs us.

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,320
The only thing I need is to
kick your ass for kissing Fred.

40
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,560
<i>And yet, it somehow
got even worse.</i>

41
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:00,440
Okay, the swelling from your
daughter's beating has gone down.

42
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,440
Can I go do your job for you and
question my obviously innocent mom now?

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
No. We need you

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,160
to watch something.

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,159
<i>So, why did you do
it, Doo-dad? Huh?</i>

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,319
Your choices on the
lady confession form are

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,440
"revenge, jealousy,"

48
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,959
or "You know how we get!"

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,879
Okay, I'll tell you.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,800
I did it because I wanted to
put the brain of a popular girl

51
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,920
into the head of
my daughter, Velma.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
What?

53
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,669
But that makes even less sense.

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,479
If she's now saying
she's guilty,

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,079
why did she pretend
to have amnesia?

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,879
Or try to frame me with
Brenda and Krista's bodies.

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,000
Velma, we're
struggling too,

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,719
but Diya insists she did it.

59
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,080
Meaning this afternoon, she'll
be sentenced to death row,

60
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,520
and, worse, brutally hounded
by true crime podcasters.

61
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,839
Death row?

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,456
Then please, just give me
five minutes down there

63
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,119
to figure out what's
really going on.

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,159
What's that?

65
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,479
Look, you didn't
hear it from us,

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,479
but the only way Cogburn's letting
you anywhere near your mom's cell

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,399
and potentially
messing up his case

68
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,960
is if you get arrested yourself.

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Arrested? I see.

70
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,119
Well, then call me
a medieval minstrel

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,759
'cause I'm about to loot.

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,320
Yeah. Unfortunately,

73
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,719
he's so worried about
you talking to your mom,

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,400
the only thing he'd arrest
you for right now is murder.

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,000
Murder?

76
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,120
Now, Daphne.

77
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,679
Though I married
into this company,

78
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm the one who built it
from a small ascot shop

79
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,199
into the multi-billion dollar

80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,760
target of child labor
lawsuits it is today.

81
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,999
- And I did it all by...
- Moxie!

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,360
Aggressively supporting
politicians who look the other way.

83
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,280
And I have impeccable taste.

84
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,040
Like this. Our
newest fragrance.

85
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,400
Oh, I love that.
What's it called?

86
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,320
"Smells Like Mommy."

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,319
Yes, it's terrible.
Freddie named it.

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,320
Which brings us to the
point of your internship.

89
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,719
You mean I'm not
just a diversity hire

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,519
- for the company photo shoot?
- No.

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,480
See, Freddie doesn't
listen to me.

92
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,999
But yesterday you were able to coax
him back to being popular like...

93
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,360
- A modern-day Anne Sullivan.
- A celebrity dog trainer.

94
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,400
Regardless, if Fred has any hope

95
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,720
of running this company
one day, I need your help

96
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,200
teaching him that same kind of
strategic thinking and drive.

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,520
So, I'd have to spend
more time with Fred?

98
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,159
I have to sort out some
personal stuff with Velma first.

99
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, hey, this is a good
business lesson to learn.

100
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,319
Nobody cares.

101
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,839
Fred, open up.

102
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,697
I need your help to get
arrested and save my mom's life.

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,919
Ugh, not now.

104
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,839
Fred?

105
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,559
Fred, why are you raging
out? Can I assume sports?

106
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,000
No, Velma.

107
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,897
I'm raging out because my
mom doesn't think I'm capable

108
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
of running the family business.

109
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,119
But she's wrong.

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,240
Look how good I paint
the company logo.

111
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,799
Your company logo
is an asterisk?

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,039
Oh, to indicate a troubling
footnote about child labor.

113
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
It's not an asterisk.
It's a flower.

114
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,000
I painted those ones better.

115
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,440
Wait, Fred. You
bought this van? Why?

116
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,720
Because all cool fashion
advertising for teens

117
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,960
is just trashy,
pedo-tinged sex stuff.

118
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
So, maybe if I drive
this thing around,

119
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,719
I can make Gentlemen's
Accessories cool

120
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,359
and prove to my
mom I'm not a joke.

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,880
Because nothing's trashier
or more pedo-tinged

122
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,079
than teens in an old van.
That's actually not a bad idea.

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Wrong! It is a good idea! I
can run the family business.

124
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,399
Oh, wait. You just agreed
with me. Sorry, I'm...

125
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm just sensitive from
always being wrong about everything.

126
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,159
Well, then I have good
news, 'cause I'm taking you

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,960
to the one place no one
will ever doubt you.

128
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,079
Officers, arrest me.

129
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,119
I've committed the only crime worse
than eating ethnic food on an airplane.

130
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,560
Don't care. Until your mom

131
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,120
is removed from our custody
and goes to death row,

132
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,639
your presence here is
like a condom in a porno.

133
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,080
Not wanted!

134
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,599
But would you arrest
her if someone like me

135
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,640
said someone like her
was bothering him?

136
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,200
Well, yeah, that would do it.

137
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,479
Norville, have you seen Velma?
She wasn't at the pep rally.

138
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,560
And you know how much she loves
knocking over cheerleader pyramids.

139
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,520
Sorry, Daph. But I'm just
too tired of Velma's bullshit

140
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,839
to care where she is.

141
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,119
Norville never swears.

142
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,159
Oh, my God.

143
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,599
Huh? A geode?

144
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,520
"My dearest daughter..."

145
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,919
<i> I almost died
while finding this.</i>

146
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,799
<i>I think it has something
to do with the murders.</i>

147
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,240
"And while I know it can never make
up for having abandoned you twice,

148
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,000
please consider us even

149
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,199
for the $10 I took from your
locker!"

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,639
Be quick. Your mom doesn't have
much time before her sentencing.

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,919
And the creature that lives
in the toilet feeds at 2:00.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,599
Mom?

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,079
- Velma?
- Mom!

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,016
I know you didn't really
wanna change my brain, right?

155
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,319
I assume you misspoke and meant
change my bra? 'Cause I get that.

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,960
Velma, I did it because
I wanted to put the brain

157
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,999
of a popular girl into the
head of my daughter, Velma.

158
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,680
- But why?
- No, Velma, listen to me.

159
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,399
I did it because I
wanted to put the brain

160
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,600
of a popular girl into the
head of my daughter, Velma.

161
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,479
Yeah, Mom. I get it. Wait.

162
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,440
You keep saying the
exact same thing.

163
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,119
Yes! When I try to say
what actually happened,

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,599
that's what comes out.

165
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,239
I don't think I had amnesia,
I think I was hypnotized.

166
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,200
Hypnotized? I thought that
only worked in '70s cartoons

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,639
and '80s comedy clubs.

168
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,880
Wait. But the cure
is always snapping.

169
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,399
Sorry. Time to go to death
row. You failed, Velma.

170
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,040
You're not ruining this for me.

171
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,560
Let me out of here.

172
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,080
My mom was hypnotized,

173
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,079
and the serial killer
is still out there.

174
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,240
Yes, he is, Velma.

175
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,519
Oh, no, he's here!

176
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,800
Daphne?

177
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,919
Sorry. I just had
to clear my throat.

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,319
My moms told me you were here.

179
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,519
Ugh, I'd rather you
were the serial killer.

180
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
Well, then, good news.

181
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,240
Because I have something
that might help us find him.

182
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,799
A pocket watch?

183
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Wait, I remember
that from somewhere.

184
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,199
And
do you remember me?

185
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,079
How am I on a dirt road?

186
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,399
Oh, no! I died, and
hell is a cross country race.

187
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,319
Wait. This is a memory

188
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,039
of the night I started
hallucinating, two years ago.

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,617
I'll never find my mom.

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,520
My mystery solving caused this.

191
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,056
No one will ever believe me...

192
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,199
because I'm a weirdo.

193
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, my God. I remember!

194
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,439
That pocket watch belongs
to the serial killer.

195
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,280
I recognize it because he
didn't just hypnotize my mom,

196
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,720
he hypnotized me two
years ago as well,

197
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,559
to cause my hallucinations
and keep me from finding her.

198
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,439
Now, did you check the watch

199
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,199
- for fingerprints or semen?
- No need.

200
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,599
There's an inscription.

201
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,639
Okay, but Daphne, it
belonged to a serial killer.

202
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,040
It's 100% caked in semen, and you're
just, like, holding it in your hand.

203
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,720
"Harry Meeting?"
Of course!

204
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,239
General Harry Meeting
hired Dr. Edna Perdue

205
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,799
<i>to run his Project SCOOBI
brain-swapping program.</i>

206
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>And he was a master of hypnosis.</i>

207
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,559
But, wait, he's dead.

208
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,999
- Man!
- Exactly.

209
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,440
Which can only mean one thing.

210
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,520
It's
General Meeting's ghost,

211
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,720
back to finish
Dr. Perdue's work!

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,160
For the last time,
ghosts do not exist.

213
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:21,640
So, if you'd like to
join me back in reality,

214
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:24,879
I'm gonna see if this watch jogs
any memories for the Brains.

215
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,759
I'll come with. But first...

216
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,639
I'm sorry about
kissing Fred. Forgive me?

217
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,639
And I promise nothing will
ever come between us again.

218
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,959
Hold up. I have to
take this. Victoria.

219
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,479
What? Fred was caught

220
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,880
trying to lure teens into
a van for trashy sex stuff?

221
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,280
I'll be right there.

222
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,959
I am so sorry. I have to
go. But here.

223
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,240
Perfume?

224
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,776
Is that to remember
you while we're apart?

225
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,520
Yes. But Victoria
also wants to know

226
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,679
if you like it and or
get a terrible rash.

227
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,839
Text me your
thoughts and be safe.

228
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,079
Fred, tell your mom I'm getting
in the car you sent right now.

229
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,160
What do you mean you
didn't send a car? Oh, God!

230
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,200
Ugh, fine. You sent a limo.

231
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,599
Yes, I know the
difference, you asshole.

232
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,999
<i> Okay.</i>

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,159
<i>Clap, clap. Group shower
discussion of the day.</i>

234
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,640
<i>Aren't you so over characters making
dramatic entrances on TV shows?</i>

235
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,120
- For sure.
<i>- Totally.</i>

236
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,399
I like the quiet characters
who don't get much to do.

237
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,719
I actually love
dramatic entrances.

238
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,720
- <i> Velma?</i>
- Yeah.

239
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,256
And before you say anything, my mom
didn't kill you and put you in those jars.

240
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,360
She was hypnotized
by whoever took you.

241
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,840
So please, tell me
you recognize this.

242
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,360
- Where was that?
<i>- I do...</i>

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
<i>not know.</i>

244
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,640
- <i> Sorry.</i>
<i>- I don't either.</i>

245
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:43,159
Well, great! Now I have nothing
and my mom's going to the chair.

246
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,800
Which is exactly what
you deserve, Velma.

247
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,299
Well, not your mom
going to the chair.

248
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,125
But you were given the
best thing in the world,

249
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,199
and every day you treated
it like worthless garbage.

250
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,760
Hair that's full of
bounce and easy to style?

251
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,360
No! Norville!

252
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,280
And now, he's
transferring schools

253
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,696
because it's too hard for him to be
around the person who betrayed him.

254
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,199
What? That's impossible.

255
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,119
I know I messed up
by accusing Lamont,

256
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,639
but Norville would've told
me if he was leaving school.

257
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,678
He did.

258
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,800
He left you a voice mail.

259
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,680
Just one of the 1,000
you never listened to.

260
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,718
I don't...

261
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,920
I don't have time for this.

262
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,639
I have to save my mom.

263
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,799
And where did her
phone come from?

264
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
We're naked!

265
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,959
What's wrong, baby?

266
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,599
Three Chaka Khan
songs have come on

267
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,680
and you haven't even
bobbed your head.

268
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,240
Ugh, nothing.

269
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,776
I'm just wondering if I made
the right decision to leave...

270
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,520
Oh, my God! I'm home!

271
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,120
So Brenda and Krista's
bodies were used to frame me.

272
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,799
But, wait. Lola's was
found by someone else.

273
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,119
Norville, where
are you when I need you?

274
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,520
Fine.

275
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,239
<i> Velma,</i>

276
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,600
<i>it's Norville. I'm switching
schools. See you in hell.</i>

277
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,240
<i>If I ever visit from
the Halls of Mandos.</i>

278
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,680
<i>That's a Tolkien reference,
which I know you hate.</i>

279
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,280
Damn it, Velma. Why didn't
you ever listen to these?

280
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,679
<i> Hey, Velma,</i>

281
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,159
<i>it's Norville, and
I have huge news.</i>

282
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,439
<i>It's banana pudding
day in the cafeteria.</i>

283
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,399
<i>Call me back!</i>

284
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>Hey, Velma, it's Norville.</i>

285
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,559
<i>Who's got two thumbs and
wants to say good morning?</i>

286
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,319
<i>This guy!</i>

287
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,433
<i>Yeah, that's maybe more of
a visual joke. Call me back.</i>

288
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,839
<i>Hey, Velma, it's Arnold,</i>

289
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
<i>the Actornator.</i> <i> JK, JK, it's Norville.</i>

290
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:26,999
<i>Call me back.</i>

291
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:27,959
<i>Call me back.</i>

292
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,999
<i>Call me back.</i>

293
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,679
Wow. This is the first
voice mail he ever left me.

294
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,359
<i>Uh, hey, hey, Velma.</i>

295
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
<i>It's Norville Rogers
from... From math.</i>

296
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,999
<i>I know we don't really
know each other,</i>

297
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,039
<i>but I... I just wanted to say</i>

298
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,959
<i>I'm sorry your mom got taken,</i>

299
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,559
<i>and I think it's cool that
you're wearing glasses now.</i>

300
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,879
Wow. He even noticed these.

301
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,159
Mom's frames are made by
Jones Gentlemen's Accessories?

302
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,439
A pocket watch!

303
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,279
Oh, my God! Harry Meeting used

304
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,479
Jones Gentlemen's
Accessories pocket watches

305
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,640
for his hypnosis. That's it!

306
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,159
Dad! Dad! I figured it out!

307
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,360
How to wash that sweater?

308
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,959
You've literally
never smelled better.

309
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,760
No, that's just some dumb
perfume Daphne sprayed on me.

310
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,879
Mom's innocent.

311
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
What? How?

312
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,479
My glasses! It was my glasses!

313
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,400
Mom didn't drop them in her
car the night she was taken.

314
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,559
She left them as a
clue for me to find.

315
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,359
But how are glasses a clue?

316
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:33,560
Unless they solve the mystery of
why a girl can't get a date, right?

317
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,720
Sorry, I'm
drunk. Please continue.

318
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,319
I'll explain everything on
the way to the Jones estate.

319
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,360
If I'm right, Daphne
and Fred are in trouble.

320
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,759
So, if the serial killer caused
your hallucinations with hypnosis,

321
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,760
how did me believing that your mom
was kidnapped stop them?

322
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,039
Because my hallucinations
preyed on my insecurity

323
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,920
that I'm a weirdo no
one would believe.

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,120
So, you believing me
counteracted that.

325
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,599
Same with Norville saying
he liked me.

326
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,720
I thought it was because
he made me laugh.

327
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,039
But it was because he
made me feel cared for,

328
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,599
the way a cool-ass boss bitch
like myself deserves to be.

329
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,959
And I'm falling off the wall.

330
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,439
Velma!

331
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,919
Are you okay? 'Cause if
not, we can definitely sue.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm fine. Just go get the cops.

333
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,840
On it. But could you
maybe fake an injury?

334
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,720
- The Joneses are a cash cow.
- Get the cops!

335
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,439
Okay. How do I sneak
into this lab again?

336
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,599
Hey, Angela Lansbury, or whoever
is in charge up there now,

337
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,400
please don't let me die today.

338
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,920
There are so many things I
haven't done yet in life.

339
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,559
Like, make a bucket
list. Or this.

340
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,359
<i> Hello.</i>

341
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>You've reached Norville Rogers.</i>

342
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:42,199
<i>And, if this is
Velma, don't forget</i>

343
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,999
<i>you're a piece of...</i>

344
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Norville, look, I know you hate
me, but in case I die tonight,

345
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,160
I just wanted to say you'll
always be my best friend.

346
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:54,519
That's it. Bye. Love you.

347
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
Love you? Oh, no!

348
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,959
Ah! What's happening?

349
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,040
Don't donate my body to science!

350
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,159
Ugh, great.

351
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,599
My phone's dead. Now I
can't call back Norville,

352
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,200
or order Thai food.

353
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,319
"To find the lab
entrance, walk 32 steps.

354
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,440
The jersey number of
the great O.J. Simpson"?

355
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,960
Ugh, God. Dr. Perdue, could
this journal be more dated?

356
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,440
"Now, look for the
stone that is as perfect

357
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,799
as Woody Allen and Mia
Farrow's marriage"?

358
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,839
Wait, there it is.

359
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,599
My glasses.

360
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,520
I hope this doesn't
keep happening.

361
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,399
Daphne, wake up.

362
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,839
Velma! Get
me out of here.

363
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh, and Fred, if there's time.

364
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,439
I will. I just have
to figure out how.

365
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,079
Oh, that's it.

366
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,319
Excuse me!

367
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,896
Wait. Do you think
seeing us fool around

368
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,639
will give the serial
killer a heart attack?

369
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,440
Worth a
shot. Oh, God!

370
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,839
And now you die, Velma.

371
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,240
Then I guess I better smell
good for Angela Lansbury.

372
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,599
Oh, my God, you're a genius.

373
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
How did you know the
perfume would do that?

374
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,959
My shrill voice
usually repels bats.

375
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,680
So when they attacked
me in the well,

376
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,959
I knew it had to be the
perfume driving them crazy.

377
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,240
Ahhh! Get, them
off! Get them off!

378
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,879
Wait, no. Keep them on.

379
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,039
Velma, how did you
know we were down here?

380
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,280
Was Fred right about the government
putting trackers in those vaccines?

381
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:03,319
No. After connecting General Meeting
to Jones Gentlemen's Accessories,

382
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,880
it was obvious.

383
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,480
So, it is the ghost of
Dr. Edna Perdue. I knew it!

384
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,720
Don't be an idiot,
Fred. It's the ghost

385
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,526
of General Harry Meeting.

386
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,159
Stop before I think less of
you. Just let me explain.

387
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,999
This all began when the serial
killer tried to frame me

388
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,679
<i>for the murders of
Brenda and Krista</i>

389
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,240
<i>by putting them in my
locker and recycling bin.</i>

390
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,199
<i>But then Fred raged out in court</i>

391
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,160
<i>and went to prison for
those murders instead.</i>

392
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

393
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,600
Wow, crazy couple of weeks.

394
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,760
But the third body, Lola's,
wasn't used to frame me. Why?

395
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,799
Because the serial
killer needed a body fast

396
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,719
to exonerate Fred and
get him out of prison.

397
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,639
But why would the serial
killer want Fred out of prison,

398
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,600
only to then take
him at Fog Fest?

399
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,159
Because the serial killer is...

400
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,319
- Mother?
- Victoria Jones?

401
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,720
Formerly known as
Victoria Meeting,

402
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,759
the daughter of
General Harry Meeting.

403
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,720
<i>Once I learned of her
past, it all made sense.</i>

404
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,119
<i>I mean, first off,
only a real monster</i>

405
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,879
<i>has a destination
wedding in Bali.</i>

406
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,560
What? Mother, how could you?

407
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:03,320
Because she wanted
to replace your brain

408
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,759
with that of
someone more capable

409
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,400
of one day running Jones
Gentlemen's Accessories.

410
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,600
Replace my brain? Hold up.

411
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,279
Am I not your special
number-one little guy?

412
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,440
I tried to encourage you,
Freddie, but in the end,

413
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,679
I couldn't let your incompetence
ruin my life's work.

414
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,840
The way my father's incompetence
ruined Project SCOOBI.

415
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,839
Huh? I thought
Project SCOOBI failed

416
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,879
because Dr. Perdue went insane
trying to swap people's brains.

417
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,480
That's the public
story. The truth is

418
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,719
<i>Dr. Perdue succeeded in her
brain-swapping procedure.</i>

419
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,759
<i>But then my father tried to take
all the credit for her work.</i>

420
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,759
<i>When Dr. Perdue found out,</i>

421
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,320
<i>she undid the experiment,</i>

422
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:49,560
<i>bricked up her lab
and hid her journal,</i>

423
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,840
<i>so her work couldn't
be recreated.</i>

424
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,559
<i>But hoping to make her talk,</i>

425
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,040
<i>my father had her
institutionalized.</i>

426
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,039
<i>But Dr. Perdue didn't crack,</i>

427
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,640
<i>and without the journals, my father
couldn't reproduce her results.</i>

428
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:06,039
<i>Project SCOOBI was shut down.</i>

429
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,239
- No!
<i>- And we lost everything.</i>

430
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,560
Wait. Our family was also poor?

431
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,600
Can this
day get any worse?

432
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,319
<i> To save us
from financial ruin,</i>

433
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,319
<i>I married William Jones, the
man whose family business</i>

434
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
<i>supplied the pocket watches
my father used for hypnosis.</i>

435
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,000
- You love me, right?
- Shh.

436
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,840
<i> And after building
Jones Gentlemen's Accessories</i>

437
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,640
<i>into a global brand,</i>

438
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:34,039
<i>you couldn't stand to see
it undone by your own son.</i>

439
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,280
<i>So you decided to give
him a better brain</i>

440
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,560
<i>by buying this house</i>

441
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,959
<i>and finding
Dr. Perdue's journals.</i>

442
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,239
<i> But your mom
had already found them.</i>

443
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
<i> So, when my mom
showed up here two years ago,</i>

444
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,040
<i>you hypnotized her</i>

445
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,999
<i>and made her rebuild
the lab, while you found</i>

446
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
<i>the perfect brain to
put in Fred's head.</i>

447
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
Case closed.

448
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,120
Okay, but why pick the brain
of a hot, popular girl?

449
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:57,040
We're literally the only
murders people care about.

450
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
Because I wanted
someone like me.

451
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,079
An ambitious,
status-conscious young woman

452
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,320
who could appreciate
what she might achieve

453
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:07,000
as the male president
of a global corporation.

454
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,920
But now I see the
perfect brain for Fred

455
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:13,080
is the one I tried
hardest to keep away.

456
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
William.

457
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,760
Oh, God. Look at his
eyes. He's hypnotized.

458
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,959
I had no choice.

459
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,839
The poor fool figured
out what I was up to.

460
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,440
Victoria!

461
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,759
Think this through. Once
my brain is in Fred,

462
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,999
I'll just go to the police.

463
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,840
Right after I've
looked at myself naked.

464
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,399
No, you won't, Velma,

465
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,559
because not only
are you brilliant,

466
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,759
who more than you
would truly appreciate

467
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,199
the advantages of being a
handsome, rich white man?

468
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,279
Oh, advantages?
You think we like

469
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,959
being president of the United
States 97% of the time?

470
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,359
The job sucks!

471
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,879
Having spent time
with the Brains,

472
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:56,079
I was reminded that hot,
popular girls your age

473
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,520
don't yet realize just how much
the deck is stacked against them.

474
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,680
But a stumpy know-it-all
with bad eyes

475
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,280
and a worse haircut,
such as myself, would.

476
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,679
You know what, Victoria?

477
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,039
You're right. I am so in.

478
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,399
- What?
- Velma!

479
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,039
- Fred will die.
- And worse, be embarrassed!

480
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,760
Exactly. I am so sick
of rich guys like you

481
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,999
not only not realizing how
much is handed to them,

482
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,160
but still thinking
they're the victims

483
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,920
when they mess everything up

484
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:28,279
because of their lazy
entitlement and fragile egos.

485
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,920
My ego is not fragile.

486
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,959
Yes!

487
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,759
Rage, Fred. Rage with the anger

488
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,600
of a dad who just bumped his
head and break your restraints.

489
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,319
No! What are you doing? Stop!

490
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,960
Fred, your mom is getting away!

491
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:50,479
You did this!

492
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,399
No, Fred. I only said those
things to rile you up.

493
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,080
I mean, yes, I feel
that way, but...

494
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,799
No. I'm glad you
said it, Velma.

495
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,920
Only friends tell
each other the truth.

496
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,639
And I'm proud to
call you a friend,

497
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,920
no matter how annoying
I find your voice.

498
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,679
Wow. I'm already loving
our new truth dynamic.

499
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,039
Now get out of here.
I'll stop my mom.

500
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:18,680
Hello, Mother.

501
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,880
Freddie, I'm sorry.

502
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,399
But I, um... I have an excuse.

503
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,719
- A good one.
- Really?

504
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,697
Quick, find the button that
makes the bucket go up.

505
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,360
It doesn't work like
that. We have to climb.

506
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,560
I see.

507
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:33,080
So, I guess I just
live down here now?

508
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,360
- Victoria? How?
- It's not Victoria.

509
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
Mother never could have
wanted to swap my brain.

510
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,999
She told me she's been possessed
by the ghost of Dr. Edna Perdue.

511
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,800
It made so much sense
when she told me,

512
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,079
I accidentally dropped the
gun and, well...

513
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,759
Here we are.

514
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,480
So, say your goodbyes, girls,

515
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,079
as I'm about to transfer your
brains to these cave walls.

516
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,600
Velma, if this is the end,

517
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,519
I need you to know
that I love you.

518
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,680
- I love you too, Norville.
- What?

519
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,119
- Norville?
- Daphne!

520
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
I mean, I love you, Daphne.

521
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,120
Velma, I got your
VM. Voice mail.

522
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:15,560
And I love you too!

523
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,960
Norville, watch out!

524
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,559
Well, it appears I've
gotten away with it,

525
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,320
you meddling ki...

526
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,239
Mother? Ghost of
Dr. Perdue? Hello?

527
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,200
Oh, my God. She's dead.

528
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,480
Like, really dead.

529
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,777
It's over.

530
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,320
It's finally over.

531
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,520
This feels amazing!

532
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,319
Like, best day ever! I
solved the case! Happy dance!

533
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,536
<i>It's true.</i>

534
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,439
<i>I'd solved the case for good.</i>

535
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,759
<i>But like all
prestige detectives,</i>

536
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,320
<i>had I actually lost
more than I found?</i>

537
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:58,159
Vermin Dorkley Day!

538
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,719
And we also have keys
for your friends.

539
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,960
We're not friends.
Norville killed my mother.

540
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,000
She tried to kill me first.

541
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,040
Only because she was possessed
by the ghost of your grandma.

542
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,800
Fred. Ghosts are not real.

543
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, what a surprise.

544
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,719
Velma's standing up for
Norville, the love of her life.

545
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,560
<i> No, that's stupid.</i>

546
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:20,919
<i>Sure, my personal life was in
shambles, but I got my mom back!</i>

547
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,440
Okay, so it's a dark mystery
origin story of Boo Boo Bear.

548
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,880
TV got even better while
you were kidnapped.

549
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:29,159
All right, sounds
great. Turn it up.

550
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,217
And maybe shut the curtains.

551
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,399
Velma, did you change
the locks again?

552
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
Let us in. We still
live here. Hello?

553
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,039
<i> Still, all our lives were
changed forever by what had happened.</i>

554
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,519
I can't sleep, Dad.

555
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,520
It's either my
Spanish test tomorrow,

556
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,239
or the fact that I
killed Fred's mom.

557
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
Have you tried marijuana?

558
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
What?

559
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,454
<i> And events
had been set in motion</i>

560
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,239
<i>that could not be reversed.</i>

561
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,239
<i> Because
little did we know</i>

562
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,719
<i>the real mystery
was just starting.</i>

563
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,959
Well, Cogburn, here's everything
I used to catch the serial killer,

564
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,239
bring home my mom, and basically
embarrass your entire force.

565
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,480
Oh, it takes more than
that to embarrass us.

566
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,720
But you ever feel like becoming a
real detective, we could use you.

567
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,800
You've got a sharp brain.

568
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:38,839
Thank you.

569
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,520
That actually means a lot.

570
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,680
yeah, almost like a man.

571
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,160
Another thing Velma
was right about.

572
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:09,080
No such thing as ghosts.

573
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,919
Hello? Hello, hello?
