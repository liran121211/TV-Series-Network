00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,071
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,759
Oh, no, Dad! I need
you to believe me

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,480
that Mom was kidnapped,
or I'm gonna die!

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,840
Okay, okay, I believe you,
I swear! I believe you.

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,240
You're weird, sure, but
you're also sweet and amazing,

6
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,959
and deserve to be treated well.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,680
Anyone who makes you feel like
you need a crown to prove that

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,280
is the monster, Norville.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,320
Oh! Damn, girl.

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,519
How'd you get all that ass
in those little slacks?

11
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:34,519
We have found a pattern.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,560
Each of the victims is hot.

13
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,920
Wow.

14
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,679
Well, I wasn't able
to convince the town

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,119
to keep a curfew to protect
them from the serial killer.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,479
But it won't matter.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,337
Now that you have the
serial killer's cellphone,

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
I know you're gonna catch
him and find your mom.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,776
I'm not going to school.
I'm not going to school.

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,879
<i>From the moment Daphne
and I met, it was special.</i>

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,920
Get outta here, you old bag!

22
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,479
<i>We had other friends, but
they were like granola bars,</i>

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,159
<i>only there for emergencies.</i>

24
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,657
Let's go, Daph.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,856
- <i>- Sure.
- We had hit a bumpy patch</i>

26
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,879
<i>when my mom disappeared
and Daphne got hot.</i>

27
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:22,600
Let's go, Daph.

28
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:24,480
- I'm Norville.
- You are who I say you are.

29
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,040
<i>But after almost dying together,</i>

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,360
<i>and nabbing the serial
killer's cellphone at Fog Fest,</i>

31
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,239
<i>it felt like we were finally back
to the way things were meant to be.</i>

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,400
Daphne.

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,159
Thelma, can you
help me find Fred?

34
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,039
He's missing, and I know your
people are great at tracking.

35
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,879
Sorry, I'm busy. And I've
told you, I'm not Navajo.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,119
Let's go, Daph.

37
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,559
I'm really glad

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,059
- we're finally friends again.
- Same.

39
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:51,319
Oh, my God, I'm so mad,
we're friends again!

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,399
We're gonna
die down here, Daphne.

41
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,920
And it's all your fault!

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,240
What?

43
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,599
You are the reason we're pinned
by a rock in this ravine!

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,640
If we die, it's your fault!

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,080
My fault? Nothing
is ever my fault!

46
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,279
Okay, Daphne, if you were a serial
killer, what would your password be?

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,279
I've tried "mustache fan", "I took
the red pill", and "van owner."

48
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,479
Daphne?

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,159
Daphne!

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,296
What have I told you about
texting during my times of need?

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,959
It's nothing. Relax.

52
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,440
Hey, you two knuckleheads
claim to be cops.

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,279
Can you hack the
serial killer's phone?

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,679
Unfortunately, without proof
that's the serial killer's phone,

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,000
our hands are tied.

56
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,800
But Daphne can definitely help.

57
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,560
She has phone hacking experience

58
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,279
- from "The Incident."
- Mom!

59
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,720
"The Incident?" What's that?

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,880
In my family, "The
Incident" refers to the time

61
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,080
my mom danced with a
male waiter on a cruise.

62
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,614
"The Incident?"
Oh, it was literally nothing.

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,320
Oh, wow, look at all
those homeless people.

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
Each one, a different story.

65
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,600
Uh, if it was literally nothing,

66
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,120
why are you changing
the subject?

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm
not changing the subject.

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,120
But wouldn't you agree that the
strongest use of flashbacks on TV,

69
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,440
is when one character's flashback
is intercut with another's

70
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
to eventually combine in
the present storyline?

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,800
You are totally
changing the subject.

72
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,480
You are, Daphne.

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,440
But it's interesting. You're
saying if this was a flashback

74
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,119
in your point of view, in
order for it to be earned,

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
we'd have to cut to...
I don't know, Fred?

76
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,399
Exactly.

77
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,497
I like it when they use a title
card with the character's name

78
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
when they cut to a
different flashback.

79
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,680
Now, that feels lazy.

80
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,880
It's stylized. It's Tarantino.

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,000
What is "The Incident?"

82
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,720
Whoa, where... Where am I?

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,679
Hey, let me out!

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
My parents will
never pay ransom.

85
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,639
They thanked the North Koreans
when they kidnapped my brother.

86
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,719
<i> Fred?</i>

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
<i>Is that you?</i>

88
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
Brenda? But I was at your
funeral. I got so wasted.

89
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,280
<i> It's not just Brenda,
Fred. Lola and I are here too.</i>

90
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,079
<i>Typical, even now, Brenda has
to be the center of attention.</i>

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,920
<i> Oh, not this
shit again, Krista.</i>

92
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,480
<i> Guys, stop fighting.</i>

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,920
<i>No boy is worth
sloshing your goo over.</i>

94
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,120
I still say it's more seamless
without the title card.

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,240
And I still say my old job
as a television executive

96
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,960
makes me worried audiences
won't be able to follow it.

97
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,720
Hey, is that the black light from the
Halloween we went as a sexy crime scene?

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm still technically
grounded for that.

99
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,039
Yep. My moms use
it to criticize

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,737
how well the other one
cleaned the bathroom.

101
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,759
But we can use the light
to tell which numbers

102
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,400
the serial killer presses
most often, by the smudges.

103
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,920
Ah-ha! So you did hack
into someone's phone.

104
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,800
Wait. Was "The Incident" me?

105
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,519
- No.
- Mmm.

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,439
But a while back, I was
low-key obsessed with someone.

107
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,040
I lost my mind for a hot second and hacked
their phone to see if they liked me.

108
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,280
They didn't. End of story.

109
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,960
Oh, so, like me and
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,159
That's all you had to say.
But who the hell was it?

111
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,559
Velma, focus.

112
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,839
Opening this phone is the
key to finding your mom.

113
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,240
The password
is one, two, three, four.

114
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,519
Yeesh, is the serial
killer my grandpa?

115
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,320
Shoot, he was careful.

116
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,599
No messages, no mail, no nudes.

117
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
Wait. He accidentally
took a photo in the woods.

118
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,159
That's Mount Crystal.

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
This is huge. We're
going there tomorrow.

120
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,107
And on the car trip, you will
tell me about "The Incident"

121
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,439
while I will either
laugh or scream at you.

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,839
Fine.

123
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,761
Wait, hold on.

124
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,239
Who do you keep texting?

125
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
It's no one. Don't
worry about it.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Y... You're alive?

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,879
- How?
<i>- All we know,</i>

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,176
<i>is that whoever took us plans to
put our brains in someone else.</i>

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,119
Oh, my God, Velma was wrong.

130
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,759
The ghost of Edna Perdue
is back to finish her work.

131
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,440
- <i> Ghost?</i>
<i>- Velma?</i>

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,160
<i>Has the absence of our
popularity left such a void,</i>

133
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,719
<i>you're now hanging
out with Velma?</i>

134
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,240
Uh, no.

135
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,399
<i> You
going from Daphne to Velma</i>

136
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,760
<i>is worse than going from a beloved
cartoon to a playful reimagining.</i>

137
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,160
Totally, right? Though
Daphne and I did break up.

138
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,479
<i>Well, isn't that perfect?</i>

139
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,439
<i>Fred Jones is finally single,</i>

140
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,439
<i>and here I am, just a brain.</i>

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,519
I'd actually say it is perfect.

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,199
Because I just learned the hottest
part of a woman is her brain.

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
<i>- Oh, did you?</i>
- Yes, Brenda.

144
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,960
Or should I
call you Brain-da?

145
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,120
<i>Jeez, get a jar, you two.</i>

146
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,640
Daphne, come on.

147
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,616
It's time to go look for the
serial killer in the woods.

148
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,920
And yes, saying that out
loud for the first time,

149
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,759
it sounds like a
terrible idea. But...

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,240
Hey, Velma, look. I'm
sorry it's so last minute,

151
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,760
but I can't go.

152
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,479
What? Why not?

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,160
I brought your favorite snacks,
water, and pictures of Tom Holland.

154
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,319
Now let's go, Daph.

155
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,840
Olive? What are you doing here?

156
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,360
And the only answer I'll accept

157
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,479
is using your long ass
arms to change light bulbs.

158
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,560
Today, Olive and I
are taking pictures

159
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,239
for the sexy calendar we sell to fight
discrimination against hot girls.

160
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,360
- What?
- Without our tireless work,

161
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,439
beautiful actresses would
never have the chance

162
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,399
to win awards playing
unattractive women.

163
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,919
I was gonna tell you last night,

164
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,534
but after you heard
about "The Incident,"

165
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,640
- I was worried you'd freak out.
- Freak out?

166
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm famously chill
about everything.

167
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,760
Why would I care

168
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,377
if the night after I learned
you were obsessed with someone

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,439
you wanna play Terry
Richardson with Olive?

170
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,719
Wait, hold on. Was
Olive "The Incident?"

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,720
Velma, we can talk about this
when you get back. I have to go.

172
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,519
This is my long ass
arm saying goodbye.

173
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Come on, Daph. For May,
let's try a picture

174
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,919
where I'm only wearing
flowers on my privates.

175
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,136
Shh! Let's
discuss inside.

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,879
Velma, what's happening?

177
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,759
I'm having a deadly
hallucination.

178
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,559
I thought those were over!

179
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,016
Me, too. Being so close to finding
my mom must have triggered it.

180
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,719
But go shoot your calendar.

181
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,897
I'm sure I won't have another one
in the woods and die all alone.

182
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,937
And that's why this is your fault,
Velma. You're so possessive,

183
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,520
you faked a hallucination just to
keep me from hanging out with Olive.

184
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,319
No, no. This isn't
Velma's fault, Daphne.

185
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,600
It's Norville's.

186
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,359
Yeah, Daphne, this
is Norville fault.

187
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,360
But just to be
clear, how exactly?

188
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,440
It started when we got
home from Fog Fest.

189
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,239
Well, I should go.

190
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,839
Your father likes
to tail me home,

191
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,840
and I don't wanna
keep him up too late.

192
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,719
My parents are
actually out of town.

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,999
So, could you be a
gentleman and unzip me?

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,639
Oh, say no more.

195
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,240
I do this for my
mom all the time,

196
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,977
now that she's perimenopausal
and constantly bloats.

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,599
Goodbye to her
reproductive years,

198
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,039
but hello to womanhood's
beautiful final chapter.

199
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,960
- You're good.
- Mmm.

200
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,360
Wait. Gigi, Is your cabin
up by Mount Crystal empty?

201
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,319
Maybe. Why?

202
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,439
No reason.

203
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,759
Well then, you
better go rest up.

204
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,360
You, too.

205
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,703
The last thing we want are canker
sores from a lack of sleep.

206
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,239
Olive, I'm sure Fred
hasn't gone missing.

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
He probably just got stuck
in his gold pajamas again.

208
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,079
Damn it! Not again.

209
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,519
<i>I told you to poke holes in it.</i>

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,240
Why am I such an idiot?

211
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,600
I'll never make it as a brain.

212
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,839
My parents always say
it's my worst attribute.

213
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,440
<i>You'll be fine, Fred. And
there's a lot of upside.</i>

214
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,639
<i>Like, you'll never have to
touch an old person again.</i>

215
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,800
Thanks, babe.

216
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,359
And maybe one day we
can connect our jars,

217
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:08,600
like one of those
hamster houses.

218
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,039
<i>I'd like that.</i>

219
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,799
<i>But do you think what
we're feeling is real,</i>

220
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,839
<i>or are we just making the best
out of a terrible situation?</i>

221
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,199
<i>Like, when I got a tan
at my grandma's funeral?</i>

222
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,720
I honestly don't know.

223
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,400
But it sure seems real.

224
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,559
<i>Seems real?</i>

225
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,280
<i>I didn't ask if it seems real.</i>

226
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,399
<i>I asked if it is real, Fred.</i>

227
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,319
<i>You know what? Just put
me back on the table.</i>

228
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,600
<i>I can't believe I let
you drink from my jar.</i>

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,680
Norville, what are
they doing here?

230
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,239
Hey, Daphne. Hey, Velma.

231
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,457
Why wouldn't they be here?
The woods belong to everybody,

232
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,079
thank you very much,
Teddy Roosevelt.

233
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,280
But this was supposed to be
a romantic getaway for two.

234
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,439
I have been hinting at this
since we started dating.

235
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,040
Hints? What hints?

236
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,399
You know, we don't
have to sneak around.

237
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,879
I have a cabin in the woods.

238
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,280
Ugh. Hey, so remember when I
mentioned my cabin in the woods?

239
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,360
Norville, I wanna go with
you to my cabin in the woods.

240
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,600
I'll go.

241
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,520
I thought you were bragging.

242
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,439
My parents have a timeshare near Area
51, but I feel tacky mentioning it.

243
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,720
Okay, but then why did
you wanna use my cabin?

244
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,279
We're looking for
the serial killer.

245
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,137
There was a picture of
Mount Crystal on his phone.

246
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,320
Hold up. The serial
killer is near my cabin,

247
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,560
and you didn't tell me, the hottest
remaining girl at the school?

248
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,400
I wasn't expecting
you to be here.

249
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,319
Also, for what it's worth,
Daphne is technically hotter.

250
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,959
You just have a mildly
better personality.

251
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,479
See? If Norville could take
a hint or read a signal,

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,999
we wouldn't be stuck here
like a<i> 127 Hours</i> reboot

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
with a bigger, more diverse cast

254
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,879
that old people
will gripe about.

255
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Fine. I might not be
great at reading signals,

256
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,160
but I am great at sending them
from my emergency homing beacon.

257
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,657
Everyone cheer for Norville.

258
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,976
Whoo-hoo!

259
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,079
- Yay, Norville!
- Yeah!

260
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,520
Falcon Two has visuals.

261
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,079
Preparing to lower
for extraction

262
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,920
<i>Copy
that, Falcon Two.</i>

263
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,080
<i>But we need you to abort
mission and return to base.</i>

264
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,360
Abort mission?

265
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:06,319
Sir, if we don't pull
these kids out right now,

266
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,080
they won't live
through the night.

267
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,120
<i>That's a
risk we'll have to take.</i>

268
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,639
<i>Fred Jones, the son of a wealthy
white family, has gone missing.</i>

269
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,120
<i>All local units are being diverted
to the search, effective immediately.</i>

270
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,960
Sir, when I became a helicopter
rescue person, I took an oath.

271
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,880
And I'd rather
die than break it.

272
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,559
Yay!

273
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,520
Have any of you seen Fred Jones?

274
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,719
What? No.

275
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,400
That tracks.

276
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,320
Okay, guys, since it looks
like this really might be the end,

277
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,360
I have a confession to make.

278
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,879
This is all Daphne's fault.

279
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,239
Velma, stop.

280
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,577
We have to figure out
how to get out of here.

281
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,866
We don't have time
for another...

282
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,760
It's embarrassing, Norville!

283
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,777
How is it embarrassing to be considered
the second hottest girl in school?

284
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,320
Well, third, if you
throw in my mom.

285
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,800
Hey, maybe we should go?

286
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,680
This is super juicy, but live
streaming it will drain my battery.

287
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,680
And I'm only here for your
hallucinations anyway.

288
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,239
Hallucinations? Well, Velma
doesn't have those anymore.

289
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,617
I mean, you wouldn't know it, given
how tired and puffy she still looks,

290
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,120
- but that's all sodium intake.
- I knew you were lying.

291
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,999
You slept the whole
car ride here.

292
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,279
It was like sitting in the
front row of a dolphin show.

293
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,959
I'm sorry, but can you blame me?

294
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,559
Just when we finally reconnect,

295
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,880
I learn you have some other
friend you're obsessed with.

296
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,559
Where are you going?

297
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
There is a serial
killer in the woods.

298
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,280
Or worse, a celebrity doing
a social media cleanse.

299
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,039
I don't care.

300
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,599
I'm so mad at you for lying, I'm
walking to town to find Wi-Fi,

301
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,360
and even if I don't find it,

302
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,400
I would rather call an actual
taxi from a stranger's landline

303
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,999
than spend one more
second with you.

304
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,039
That makes two of us.

305
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,879
I cannot believe I wore
edible underwear for this.

306
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,577
Do you think they'll be okay?

307
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
And did Gigi mention if
there's more edible underwear?

308
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,960
- I'm starving.
- They'll be fine.

309
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,559
Well, Daphne will be at least.

310
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,960
Is that a joke? Daphne is
too pale for the outdoors.

311
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,079
Her skin crisps like
a rotisserie chicken.

312
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,920
No, she's fine because
she's alone with Gigi.

313
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,080
Apparently, before you
and Daphne reconnected,

314
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,720
or whatever it is
you guys are doing,

315
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,080
Daphne had a thing for Gigi.
She even hacked her phone.

316
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,360
Wait, so the incident
wasn't Olive, it was Gigi?

317
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:10,640
Oh, no. And I just drove
Daphne right into her arms.

318
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:13,400
Velma, come on. I think
you're overreacting.

319
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh, my God!

320
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,600
For the first time in your life,
you weren't reacting enough.

321
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,360
- What's going on here?
- Velma, stop!

322
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,440
Gigi said there was a
cave down in that ravine,

323
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,720
so we came out to try and see if that's
where the serial killer was hiding.

324
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,360
But then the outcropping started
to break off under our weight.

325
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,840
Your weight? Please.

326
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,279
Legally, both of you should
still be in car seats.

327
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,400
Oh, my God, I'm so mad,
we're friends again!

328
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:46,480
We're gonna
die down here, Daphne.

329
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,880
So Daphne's obsession with Gigi
is why we're gonna die here,

330
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,439
sitting in puddles
of our own filth.

331
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm not in a puddle of my
own filth. Are you guys?

332
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,559
But more importantly, Daphne hasn't
been obsessed with me for a year.

333
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,480
Does no one read my blog,
<i>Gigi's Juicy Journey?</i>

334
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,839
It's true. I'm not
obsessed with Gigi anymore.

335
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,479
But this is
still all my fault.

336
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,359
Wait, what? For reals?

337
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,777
Because, honestly, I was really
grasping at straws when I blamed you.

338
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,120
No, it's my fault.

339
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,040
I know you're possessive, Velma.

340
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,999
But I've always said it's one of my
favorite parts of our friendship.

341
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,519
Said? Said to who? Was
it Gigi? I'll kill her.

342
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,320
Yes, I love that.

343
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,600
I was abandoned by my parents,
so I like feeling wanted.

344
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,936
And when we stopped
being friends,

345
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,719
I tried to recreate what we had.

346
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,520
But the only other person who's
ever found me irreplaceable

347
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,480
is the captain of
my tug of war team.

348
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,639
Why not tell me that?

349
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,880
Because after all
our ups and downs,

350
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,559
it felt really good to see
you jealous again last night.

351
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,279
Hold on. You wanted me to
get jealous and rage out?

352
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,719
Yes, but I didn't expect you to
lie about your hallucinations

353
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,417
just to drag me to the woods.

354
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,960
Help! The rock shifted.

355
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,799
It feels like I'm
flying Southwest.

356
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,239
Wait, if the rock can move,
one of us can wiggle out

357
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
and to avoid issues of sizeism,
it should be me.

358
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,120
Ahhh! Stop!

359
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,360
Velma, it's too tight.

360
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,040
One of us can get
out, but only if

361
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,560
we pick someone to
be crushed to death.

362
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,759
- Gigi, what are you doing?
- I picked.

363
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,840
This is Velma's fault, because
everything crazy that happens

364
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,400
is Velma's fault, Norville.

365
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,639
- It's Daphne's fault, Norville.
- It's Velma's fault.

366
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,920
Interestingly, we're
trapped in an actual fault.

367
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,280
Shut up, Norville!

368
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh, no.

369
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,137
Was that bathroom graffiti
prediction about me right?

370
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,319
Did I die and go to hell?

371
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,639
No, from the look
of these crystals

372
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,439
and the smell of horny bats,

373
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,960
this must be an extension
of the Crystal Mines.

374
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,280
The Crystal Mines?
Of course.

375
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,399
That would explain how the serial
killer moves around unseen.

376
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,720
And if he took a
picture around here... Mom!

377
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,240
Mom!

378
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,440
Velma, shush. Our fall
caused structural damage.

379
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,559
If we're not quiet, this
whole place could collapse

380
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,160
quicker than our
tenuous friendships.

381
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,200
That's it. We're getting out
of here right now, Norville.

382
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,919
We need to have a
little talk about us.

383
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,239
About us? Why?

384
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,439
You just saved Velma's
life instead of mine!

385
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,360
Hey, we're gonna head out.

386
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,520
Look, I know it's dangerous to be
in here, but I have to find my mom.

387
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,520
And maybe we should have a
little talk about us, too.

388
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,399
And no changing the
subject this time.

389
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,239
Yeah, okay. But have we even
discussed how the federal government

390
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,559
just kind of admitted
that there are aliens?

391
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,439
What was that?

392
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,079
Oh, no. Krista, wake up.

393
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,336
We fell asleep. I have to get
you back on the table before...

394
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,919
<i> What the hell?</i>

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,959
<i>Krista, you hooked up with Fred?</i>

396
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,280
<i>Fred said you broke up.</i>

397
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,359
Babies, hey.
Freddie can explain.

398
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,239
<i> And can you explain how
you also hooked up with me, Fred?</i>

399
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,360
<i> What?</i>

400
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes, I can actually.

401
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,000
Please don't be mad I
manipulated you, Velma.

402
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,479
I'm not mad. I'm shocked.

403
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,440
You've always been the
good one in our friendship.

404
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,320
You don't laugh when I trip, even
though I always laugh when you do.

405
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,519
Well, then maybe we're both
too messed up to be friends.

406
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,079
It's clearly not working.

407
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,760
I think you're right.

408
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,039
So, maybe it's time we
tried being girlfriends.

409
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,679
Girlfriends? Seriously?

410
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
I'm sorry. I'm
a... I'm a flawed man.

411
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,400
And that flaw is
that I love too much.

412
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,600
Fred?

413
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,520
You all mean so much to me because
of this crazy shared experience.

414
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,959
So many memories.

415
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,279
Lola's brain-ceanera,
Krista's pregnancy scare...

416
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,920
No matter what happens,
we are bonded for life.

417
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,560
And that's bound to lead to
some relationship weirdness.

418
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,800
We are the Fleetwood Mac of a guy
trapped in a cave with some brains.

419
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,680
Only, a landslide
won't bring us down.

420
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,959
<i>Well, when you put it like
that, maybe you're right, Fred.</i>

421
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,560
Oh, no!

422
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,119
The ghost of Edna Perdue
has finally come for me.

423
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Eat brain, ghost.

424
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,599
- Velma?
- Fred, what are you doing here?

425
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,639
No time to explain. I'm free.

426
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,559
It's Brenda's brain.

427
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,879
<i>Yeah, bitch. And don't say
it like it's more shocking</i>

428
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,000
<i>than you hanging out
with Velma again.</i>

429
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,359
Dry your tears,
world. Fred is back!

430
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,777
Back!

431
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh, no! Now I have
to yell louder

432
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,680
to be heard over
this collapsing cave.

433
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,760
Help!

434
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,798
Help!

435
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,240
Krista and Lola are here, too.

436
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,160
We discovered the
serial killer's lair.

437
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,720
<i>What do you mean,
quote, "Discovered it?"</i>

438
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,159
<i>We were already here.</i>

439
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,320
<i>Yeah. Nice colonial
mindset, Columbus.</i>

440
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,159
But how is this possible?

441
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,239
Who would keep
their brains alive?

442
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,519
Not that I'm not super excited
you're still around, ladies.

443
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,920
It's like what I said.

444
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,400
Someone is trying to
recreate Dr. Perdue's work.

445
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,679
Which means... Brains,
where's my mom?

446
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,439
Indian woman. Lots of opinions
on weight and personal hygiene.

447
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
<i> The only person we've seen
is that freak in the welder's mask.</i>

448
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,479
What? But that's impossible.
My mom has to be here.

449
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,080
Guys, something's
causing the cave to collapse!

450
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,159
<i> This is what happens...</i>

451
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,737
<i>when you
invite unpopular girls, like Velma</i>

452
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,639
<i>to a party.</i>

453
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,719
Velma, we have to go!

454
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,359
You go. Take the brains.

455
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,760
I know my mom is here and I'm
not leaving until I find her.

456
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,798
Oh, God.

457
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,639
Velma, you'll never make it.

458
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,920
You can barely
clear a jump rope.

459
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,800
Leave the brains. They
wouldn't save you. Trust me!

460
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:30,479
No. I need to learn to be
cool with your other friends.

461
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,759
She's not gonna make it!

462
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,160
Oh, my God, I made it.

463
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,999
Wait. Am I secretly athletic?

464
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,560
Oh, no!

465
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:47,199
Don't let them plant
a tree in my honor!

466
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,239
- I got you!
- What? Who?

467
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, my God! Mom!

468
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,279
That's right,
Velma. Mom is here.

469
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,720
It's all gonna be...
Okay.

470
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:05,080
It's okay. We've got you dried
up, old version of Velma.

471
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,800
Mom, it's you. I
finally found you.

472
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,840
I knew you would. I thought
about you every day.

473
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,719
Hey, not to interrupt the
moment, but we really need to go.

474
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Follow me.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,959
Yes!

476
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,440
It's still here.

477
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,840
Mom, whose van is this?
Why did they take you?

478
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,480
And what were they planning to
do with Dr. Perdue's research?

479
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,257
I'll tell you everything
when we get out of here.

480
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,000
Now, get in this
mystery... Jalopy.

481
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,279
Oh, god, there's
no exit anywhere.

482
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,079
Who am I? Jean-Paul Sartre?

483
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,319
Did you get that, Mom? No exit? Like
Sartre's seminal play about hell?

484
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,999
I do. Very good.

485
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,520
I've missed you constantly
seeking my approval.

486
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,919
And I've missed constantly
needing your approval.

487
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,759
Guys, please. Less
reconnecting, more not dying.

488
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,880
We're not gonna die. I think.

489
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
Uh, we might actually. Oh, boy.

490
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,640
Hold on!

491
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,840
Velma, what principle
of physics am I using?

492
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,200
Centripetal force.

493
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,479
A-plus.

494
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,160
Jesus Christ,
just watch the road!

495
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,599
Daphne has become very rude.

496
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,320
Tell me you're not
still best friends.

497
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,239
Sunlight! There
must be an opening.

498
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,840
Wait, no, it's lava. Crap.

499
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,760
I've just finally realized
that all the problems we have

500
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,600
are because you
still like Velma.

501
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,840
Gigi, that's insane.

502
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,560
No one knows my
heart better than me.

503
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,240
Not even Mary J. Blige.

504
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,960
And if I'm lying about liking
you, then let her send me a sign.

505
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,920
Oh, my God, we made it!

506
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
Fred's alive!

507
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,280
I am never having a scary
adventure in a van again.

508
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,440
Now may I hug my
daughter, Daphne?

509
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,799
Yes.

510
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,639
Hey, I don't wanna
ruin the moment,

511
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,080
but the brains are
starting to smell.

512
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,016
- God, you're okay.
- It's a special day

513
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,279
here in Crystal Cove,

514
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,159
as one of our worst
nightmares comes to an end.

515
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,760
That's right. Fred Jones
has been found alive.

516
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,839
What's more, Fred seems to
have single-handedly located

517
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,039
the brains of the
murdered hot girls

518
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,440
and their cleaning
lady, Diya Dorkly.

519
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,159
Though one big
question still remains.

520
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:50,719
What is the cleaning
lady's immigration status?

521
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,759
Okay, time to go.

522
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,479
Velma, It's okay. I'll
see you at the hospital.

523
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,880
But, Mom, you still haven't
told me who did this.

524
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,759
Who took you?

525
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I didn't tell you yet?

526
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,440
It's... I...

527
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,119
I can't remember.
