1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,320
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Brains, where's my mom?

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,440
Indian woman. Lots of opinions
on weight and personal hygiene.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,120
The only person we've seen
is that freak in the welder's mask.

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,759
Leave the brains. They
wouldn't save you. Trust me!

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,279
<i> The police
found my mom's car</i>

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,800
<i>abandoned and empty,
except for her glasses,</i>

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,759
<i>and a single
wrapped gift for me.</i>

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,079
In that case, I will
happily go with you, Fred.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,399
- Yes!
- But, Daphne!

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,759
Are Fred and Daphne
back together?

12
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:35,160
Maybe it's time we
tried being girlfriends.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,160
Girlfriends? Seriously?

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,519
Mom, you still haven't
told me who did this.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,759
Who took you?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,999
I...

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,279
I can't remember.

18
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,679
My butt looks amazing.
Hopefully, this time,

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,479
nothing causes my
implants to come out...

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,639
<i> So, after two
years of searching,</i>

21
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,440
<i>I had finally found my mom.</i>

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,039
They didn't come out. Nice!

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,280
<i> There was
just one tiny problem.</i>

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,919
Mom, you don't remember who
took you and the hot girls

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
because you have amnesia?

26
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,799
Oh, is that what
the doctor said?

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,280
Kidding.

28
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,320
Amnesia joke, which I can
make because I have it.

29
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,080
But amnesia's
curable, right Doc?

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,720
All we need is a
ladder and a coconut.

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,759
99% of the time, yes.

32
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,080
Hey, no offense, but can we just
let the actual doctor explain?

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,199
Just being a white guy with a
clipboard doesn't cut it anymore.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
Sorry, your insurance
only covered the diagnosis

35
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:31,159
and the applesauce.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,760
Now, according to
your mother's chart,

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,159
she's constructed a
sort of mental wall

38
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,759
to block out the past two years.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,880
If Diya's memories do return,
it will be within 72 hours.

40
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,439
After that, they're
gone forever.

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,519
- Gone forever?
- Gone forever?

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,080
Oh, sorry. Can we
try that again?

43
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,400
Now, the good news is, if
you can keep Diya happy,

44
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,799
her memory should come back
within that time frame.

45
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,880
So my mom can't get upset
for the next 72 hours?

46
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,399
That's a lot of lying, but thankfully,
I'm damn good at it.

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,760
Great. Now, have there
been any changes at home

48
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,160
your mother might
find upsetting?

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,879
Uh, hmm. Changes at home?

50
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,679
Nah, their marriage
is strong as ever.

51
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,800
Aman, why is the
Spooner's waitress,

52
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,239
who used to flirt
with you, here?

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,599
You didn't tell her?

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,079
Oh, uh, we just found
someone no one likes

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,536
in case you needed an organ.

56
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,672
- But you don't, so...
- Ahhh.

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,759
Bye.

58
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,240
Okay. My
mom has 71 hours

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,599
to restore her memory and
identify the serial killer.

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,840
So we need to turn this spotless
and well-loved dream home

61
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,639
back into the normal person
dump she remembers ASAP.

62
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,160
Fine. Thank God, I have
my inspirational pillows

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,960
to keep me sane
during all of this.

64
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,280
"Breathe. Keep calm
and carry wine.

65
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,239
You're not an alcoholic.
You're a mom."

66
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,432
Ah, there's no time for this.

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,999
My mom is almost home.

68
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,040
- You're taking too long!
- Ahhh!

69
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,479
So long, stupid child proofing.

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
Perfect.

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
Daphne, what are you doing?

72
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
You have to put
your back into it,

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,816
if we're gonna make this
place smell like my mom.

74
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,759
Sorry, it's just... Look.

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,999
I know now is not about me,

76
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,759
but it's just been
hard to concentrate

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,519
since you said we should try
being girlfriends in the caves.

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,480
- Were you serious?
- Uh, yes!

79
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,120
Unless you don't want to. In
which case... As if, bitch.

80
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,440
No, I do!

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,937
In fact, the Brains
are throwing themselves

82
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
a welcome home
party this weekend,

83
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,999
and I was thinking we could
dramatically upstage them

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
by going as a couple.

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,879
That sounds amazing, but
will I even be invited?

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Since being rescued
from the caves,

87
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,039
the Brains are more
popular than ever.

88
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,599
<i>Okay, fam. Today's
Steal Her Style</i>

89
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,559
<i>is Brenda, Krista and Lola.</i>

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,599
<i>So, for this, you're
gonna need a jar,</i>

91
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
<i>some goo, and a saw.</i>

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,320
Velma, it's fine. I'm popular
enough for both of us.

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
You just relax and heavily
medicated trophy-wife it.

94
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,176
Ahhh! My mom is home!

95
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,079
It's so weird, you remember Sophie,
the flirty Spooner's waitress,

96
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
but not who kidnapped you.

97
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,737
As weird as you
remembering her name,

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,176
but not where you put
your wedding ring?

99
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,839
Welcome home, Mom.

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,519
I'm home.

101
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,616
What's the matter? Did
you forget we're poor?

102
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,879
No, I can't really see anything.

103
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
Of course, because
I have your glasses.

104
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,080
They fell off in your car
the night you were taken.

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
Here are your old ones to wear.

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,360
Oh, I thought I'd keep the nice
ones. Kind of my thing now.

107
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,999
I just
remembered something!

108
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,959
It was while I was deciding
to buy these frames

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,319
that I first learned
about Dr. Edna Perdue.

110
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,439
Oh, my God, it's working.

111
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,679
Your memory is coming back.

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,439
Does that mean you
remember this too?

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,319
Yes.

114
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,416
Oh, that's the present you forced me to
buy you because you ruined Christmas,

115
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,719
solving one of your
mysteries, right?

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,320
Wait. Were you
annoying back then?

117
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,039
Uh, no, false memory.

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,919
Still, I swore I wouldn't
open it until I found you.

119
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,000
Which means... Please
don't be a puppy.

120
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,439
Oh. Red Mary Janes. Perfect.

121
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm glad I waited this long and
put so much expectation on it.

122
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,479
Stop. You were a little
girl when I bought those.

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,920
You grew up while I was
kidnapped, and I missed it all.

124
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,760
Everything has changed.

125
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,919
Wait, why did I buy
those glasses again?

126
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,199
Velma! She's getting upset,
and losing her memories.

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,759
Quick! Make her feel good

128
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,417
by telling her she's more
attractive than her sister.

129
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,920
Mom, it's okay.

130
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,880
I may be older, but I'm
still the same old Velma.

131
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,799
I didn't offer to load the
dishwasher once while you were gone.

132
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,319
So I haven't ruined your life?

133
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,959
Your grades didn't suffer?
You're still valedictorian?

134
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,239
- Yep.
- Oh, good.

135
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,000
Bring me your report cards.

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,056
I'm sure the happiness I feel
will help me remember everything,

137
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,120
and we'll finally catch
the serial killer.

138
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,296
Hey, is anyone else gonna
contour their cerebellum for our party?

139
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,480
Hey, girlies.

140
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,319
I'm excited for the party.

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,280
What's going on? Why
are you icing me out?

142
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Uh, because you tried to
leave us for dead in the mines.

143
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,639
Your popularity is
officially revoked, Daphne.

144
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,399
Please update your status to
"loser" across all social platforms.

145
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,080
What? You can't be serious.

146
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,280
Update your status to "loser"
across all social platforms.

147
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,839
This is so stupid.

148
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,479
Oh, my God. Daphne's out.

149
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,679
Welcome to exile.

150
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,039
I'm out for two timing
the Brains in the caves.

151
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:36,120
Even the girl who pretends to be
a cat won't talk to me anymore.

152
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,679
Please. Those girls
don't decide if I'm popular.

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,680
Society's obsession
with looks does.

154
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,039
Not cool, Muffin.

155
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
Norville! I need your help.

156
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,959
Not now, Velma! This
is for the state championship.

157
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,960
Really? It's not the entertainment
at a Virgin Convention?

158
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,679
That's tomorrow.

159
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,559
Just tell me what you need.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,057
I'm running out of time for my mom
to remember who the serial killer is.

161
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,200
So I need you to break
in to your mom's office,

162
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,760
change my grades and print
me a new report card.

163
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,919
Wait, what?

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,936
So, are you done now?

165
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,879
Can you do it?

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,120
Phew, they
saved me my seat.

167
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
I knew those bitches needed me.

168
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,960
Keep walking.

169
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,319
Whatever. Watch this.

170
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,720
Hi, boys. Mind if I...

171
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:31,959
Oh, God! But the only seat is
at the table by the garbage.

172
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,576
Daphne, stop!

173
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,519
Any movement will
upset the garbage bees.

174
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,160
My only hope is to be
accepted as their queen.

175
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,600
But the only other place to sit
is out in the sun! I'll freckle!

176
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,399
The Brains can't do this to us!

177
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,639
They already have.

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,839
Incoming, losers.

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,399
Here's your fake report card.

180
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,479
I can't believe I'm defying
my parents like this.

181
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,720
Norville, thank you.

182
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,200
Sincerely. You're an
incredible friend.

183
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,839
Oh, no! The serial killer
is here to finish the job!

184
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,279
And it's all your fault because you took
too long to get me my new report card!

185
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,119
Sophie? What are
you doing here?

186
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,919
In your rush to throw us out,

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,897
Amanda's blanket got left behind
and she can't sleep without it.

188
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,454
Throw you out?

189
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,840
Wait, you lived here?

190
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,240
Aman, did you have an affair
and a baby while I was...

191
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,000
While I was... Wait, what
happened to me again?

192
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,657
She's freaking out and
forgetting everything.

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,960
Like when Al Pacino tries
to return to the stage.

194
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,840
Mom, it's okay. Dad, uh, didn't
have an affair and a baby.

195
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,639
Then whose baby is that?
And why is she here?

196
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,799
Because... Because...

197
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,360
The baby is mine. He's mine.

198
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,440
- She.
- She's mine.

199
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,279
Yours? What? Who's the father?

200
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,520
And the only acceptable answer is
you sat on a public toilet seat,

201
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,160
which we've talked about.

202
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,360
I didn't. But you'll
like the father.

203
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,560
It's, uh...

204
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,319
It's, uh...

205
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,199
It's a tale as old
as time, really.

206
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,416
See, the Archangel Gabriel appeared
before Velma and announced...

207
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:05,280
Norville!

208
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,599
The father is Norville.

209
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,439
Why would you tell your
mom the baby is yours?

210
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,879
She's already had an
unwanted baby in her life.

211
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,799
Because we have to
protect her memory,

212
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,136
and anything's better than learning
your husband cheated on you

213
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,440
the instant you were kidnapped.

214
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,200
It wasn't the instant
she was kidnapped.

215
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,440
It was six weeks.

216
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,480
But why would you
say I'm the father?

217
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,362
Or am I just having my
favorite recurring dream?

218
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
No, it's because moms love you.

219
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,480
You're like if Michael B.
Jordan had a baby with leggings.

220
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,160
- Velma?
- She's waking up.

221
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,159
Mom, what's my name?
How old are you?

222
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,120
And how old do you
tell people you are?

223
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,520
Velma, I'm okay.

224
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,016
And we're gonna talk about
your baby in a second,

225
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,599
but that's not why I passed out.

226
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,280
It's because I was overcome
by another huge memory.

227
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,839
Was it where you
put the TV remote?

228
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
It's been two years
of living hell.

229
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,680
No. I was in the basement of
Fred's house before they moved in.

230
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,720
<i>But the lab entrance
was bricked up.</i>

231
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,000
<i>Fortunately, Dr Perdue's
journals showed a secret way in.</i>

232
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,000
So I tore its wings off with my
teeth as a warning to the other bats.

233
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,799
And that's
all I remember.

234
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,279
But still, you had a memory.
Which means I'm right.

235
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,480
You like that I had a baby,
and that Norville's the father.

236
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,479
I don't like that
you had a baby.

237
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,600
But, even though Aman
and I had our problems,

238
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,559
it's better than him
having cheated on me.

239
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,199
And Norville does seem
like a great father.

240
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm a teddy bear.

241
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,279
I'm named after Theodore
Roosevelt, a wealthy demagogue

242
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,120
who massacred indigenous people
in the name of imperialism.

243
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,840
But if Amanda is my
gorgeous granddaughter,

244
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,239
then why is that
waitress in my house?

245
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:47,640
Oh. Sophie's my
boss at Spooner's.

246
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,999
So we asked her to watch Amanda
while you recovered your memory.

247
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,040
And I said, "Hell,
no! This is insane!

248
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,439
Are you people out of
your goddamn minds?"

249
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,280
So, Dad offered her money.

250
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,599
So much money.

251
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,640
Thank you. But now
that the truth is out,

252
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,079
Velma and Norville can look
after their daughter themselves.

253
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,880
Like hell we can.

254
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,999
I mean, of course. How hard can
watching it be? Right, Norville?

255
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,119
Norville?

256
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,359
Hey! You said this
was your dream!

257
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,039
Will you at least
chip in for college?

258
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,920
I was also
offered a vacation to Bali.

259
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,479
Well, Sophie's got this.
Wanna see my report card?

260
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,040
I know I should be more upset
about this, but I'm not.

261
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:32,160
Well, there is a lot of opportunity
for fugly babies these days.

262
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,000
Amanda could grow
up to be a meme.

263
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,079
No, it's just, there's nothing
better than having a daughter.

264
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,880
You never stopped
looking for me.

265
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,919
I'm only alive because of you.

266
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,040
I love you, Mom.

267
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,719
I love you so much,

268
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,679
I'm gonna let Amanda
sleep in your room.

269
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,960
Nice try.

270
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,297
Just make sure Amanda
doesn't fall off the bed

271
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,616
the way you always
did at that age.

272
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,640
- What?
- Nothing.

273
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,920
Good night, girls.

274
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,279
Okay. This
isn't that bad.

275
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,919
Oh, God!

276
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,319
Norville!

277
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
Where did you go?
You know I legally

278
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,696
can't be alone with a child after
I ate my health class egg baby.

279
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,680
Sorry. Had to go tell my
parents what we're doing.

280
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,439
My dad is very excited.

281
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,319
My mom, however, wants me to transfer
schools and find better friends.

282
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,680
Can you believe that? Velma?

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,879
- Velma, she's hungry.
- She's not hungry.

284
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,799
When I showed her my
boobs, she fainted.

285
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,400
She's just being a pill.

286
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,920
Daphne?

287
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,400
Hey. I might be on the
outs with the Brains,

288
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,359
so I don't think we
can go to that party.

289
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Oh. I don't care about that.
I just wanna be with you.

290
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,039
Mmm. Same.

291
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,759
Though in the ideal world I'd
have both popularity and you.

292
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,440
Daphne! Velma told me
you're Amanda's godmother.

293
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,959
And to think, I always assumed

294
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,377
you'd be the one to get
knocked up first.

295
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,719
- What?
- Hey!

296
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,564
Save those judgment
nuggets for your grandbaby.

297
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,937
Now give me a second.

298
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,639
Norville
and I are pretending

299
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,680
to be Amanda's parents
for the next 32 hours,

300
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,159
to help my mom remember who took her
and the Brains, before he strikes again.

301
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,720
You're pretending to
be in a relationship?

302
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,519
Wait! That's it!

303
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,759
That's how I can
be popular again!

304
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,879
Freddie? Sweetie!

305
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,559
Daphne, that poor girl you used
to date, is here to see you.

306
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,520
Oh, no! Fred!

307
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,199
What happened?

308
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,376
Don't tell me your father's kinks are genetic.

309
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,640
No, I was
practicing getting swirlied,

310
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,440
and I must have passed out.

311
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,759
I don't know how much
longer I can take being unpopular.

312
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,640
How do network
sitcoms handle it?

313
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,080
By maintaining an undying
faith in looking backwards,

314
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,119
which is exactly
what we're gonna do.

315
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,200
I was thinking, we always got more
attention as a couple than as individuals.

316
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,319
Like J.Lo and Ben,
or avocado and toast.

317
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
Or drinking and boats.

318
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,759
Exactly. So, I'm thinking that if
we faked a dramatic public reunion,

319
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,559
we could capture the hearts
and minds of the student body

320
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,919
and be popular again.

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,519
That is a very
good idea, Daphne.

322
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,520
I wish Fred were a
little more like you.

323
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
You mean poor? Gross.

324
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,679
Did Fred drive Daphne to school?

325
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,839
I know they're social pariahs
right now, but this is

326
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,000
huge.

327
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,720
Aw, she's so happy
with you guys.

328
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,079
And like they say, leave a baby
with whoever makes her smile.

329
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,120
- Bye.
- Mmm-mmm.

330
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,960
I love their love.

331
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,479
- Where's Amanda?
- Who?

332
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,520
Pack it up. Tables are done.

333
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,119
Velma, I'm sorry, but this
video of your talent show

334
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,640
isn't making me happy enough
to remember anything else.

335
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,400
<i> Oh, sorry, Howie
Mandel. But don't worry.</i>

336
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm working on something that
will definitely do the trick.

337
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,217
Just hold tight.

338
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,760
Velma, I changed your grades.

339
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,080
I agreed to be the fake
father of your fake baby.

340
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,000
But I will not compromise my
journalistic integrity for you.

341
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,920
I refuse to print this headline.

342
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,919
But my mom is so
close to remembering

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,280
who the serial killer is and only has
six hours left to regain her memory.

344
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,480
Too bad. My best
reporter, Woo Jin,

345
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,480
just accidentally named a
source in his life story,

346
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,680
and I fired his ass with
the harshest words I know.

347
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,559
Best of luck with all
your future endeavors.

348
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,440
Damn. From you, that's no joke.

349
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,080
But this headline
could be the difference

350
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,319
between making my mom
happy enough to remember

351
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,519
and the serial killer
taking a million more girls.

352
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,959
Me upstaging my cousins is an
intergenerational slap in the face

353
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,640
to my mom's sisters, and
that's her number one dream.

354
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,920
Fine, I'll do it.

355
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,120
But could you at least
change Amanda's diaper?

356
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,160
Wow. Way to take advantage
of someone at a low moment.

357
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,198
Classy.

358
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,200
Hello? Lamont?

359
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,479
Someone wants you to
change their diaper.

360
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,599
A welder's mask?

361
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,359
Hello, Velma.

362
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,640
Has your mother
regained her memory yet?

363
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,639
Norville,
what are you doing?

364
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,599
Your mother's about to
steal all of your green.

365
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,760
And if I do, will this stupid
land finally be settled?

366
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,400
Please say it will be settled.

367
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,040
Sorry. I'm worried about Velma.

368
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,846
I haven't heard from her
since this afternoon.

369
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,399
Huh. I wonder
where she could be.

370
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Oh, no!

371
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,520
- Freeze, Lamont!
- Dad, what's going on?

372
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,639
Wait. Is this a prank?

373
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,119
Like when
the seniors beat me up?

374
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,599
I wish, but no.

375
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,936
Care to explain

376
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,680
what this was
doing in your desk?

377
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,399
My welder's mask.

378
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,879
Dad, you didn't.

379
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,440
I did, son.

380
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,840
Guilty as charged.

381
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,479
I handcrafted you a
sword for your birthday.

382
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,359
Case closed. Wait, what?
Today's your birthday?

383
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,720
Yes. And my dad isn't
the serial killer.

384
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,960
He only has a welder's mask
because he made me a sword

385
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,519
like I've been begging him to.

386
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,440
Oh, please. That could
just be a cover story.

387
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,119
Oh, yeah. No, he
definitely made that.

388
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,697
Okay, well, this is starting
to look like a false alarm.

389
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
Thankfully, the
damage isn't too bad.

390
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,759
Wow, Daphne.

391
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,880
Disembodied brains are
attending your high school,

392
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,599
and the serial killer
is still out there,

393
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,440
but hashtag Fraphne is
the top trending story.

394
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,559
And listen to this text
I just got from Brenda.

395
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
"Hey, girlie.

396
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,040
Hope you and Fred can make
it to our party tonight.

397
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,359
No hard feelings. Remember,
I'm literally heartless."

398
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,880
Oh, it worked. We're
officially popular again.

399
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:03,239
I can't ever
repay you, so I won't.

400
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,319
That's fine. It'll
be repayment enough

401
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,839
to see Brenda's amygdala shake

402
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,040
when Velma and I steal the
show by arriving as a couple.

403
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,520
What? You and Velma?

404
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,120
But everyone is expecting
us to go together.

405
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,119
But we can't pretend
to date forever.

406
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,319
I'm already one conversation about
affirmative action away from killing you.

407
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,599
I'm just saying, if
white people are now

408
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
the minorities on camp...

409
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,480
Daphne, as much as it shocks
me to say this, Fred is right.

410
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,599
People expect you
to go together,

411
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,199
and it's not forever.

412
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,376
Just until you're popular
enough to do whatever you want,

413
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:35,560
like a homophobic
chicken sandwich chain.

414
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,159
Smart girl.

415
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,239
Which reminds me,
would you ever consider

416
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,800
interning for me at Jones
Gentlemen's Accessories?

417
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,400
If you can make Fred popular,

418
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:48,280
I'd love to see what you
could do with a $90 headband.

419
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,800
Really? Oh, my God, yes.

420
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,039
And call me crazy, but
make the headband tiny.

421
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,679
Now it's for dogs.
You're welcome.

422
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,600
Brilliant. But keep
this between us for now.

423
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,320
Not everyone in the company is as
receptive to outside ideas as I am.

424
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,120
I am so sorry
about your house.

425
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:13,079
And you should absolutely place the
blame where it's due. The police.

426
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,079
I don't care about
my house, Velma!

427
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,119
I care that you accused my dad of being
a serial killer without even telling me.

428
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,799
I know, but I saw the
welder's mask and freaked out.

429
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,217
And I wanted you to finish the
headline about me for the paper.

430
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,560
Which, did you? 'Cause I
couldn't help but notice

431
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:27,800
you had time for a board game.

432
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,079
This is unbelievable.

433
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,719
I put you above
everything in my life.

434
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,720
But I draw the
line at my family.

435
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,399
If our situations were reversed,

436
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,456
you'd have left me for dead
after my first hallucination.

437
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,639
But I was worried my mom
wouldn't recover her memory.

438
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,097
She only has an hour before...

439
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,839
Yeah, I don't care!
You're a bad friend.

440
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,719
And you look terrible in orange.

441
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,639
Norville, please. You say that every
time I mistake dwarves and elves.

442
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,119
An elf is a luminous spirit,
and a dwarf is a hairy oaf.

443
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,920
But most importantly,
they are not friends.

444
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,639
And neither are we.

445
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,680
Best of luck in all your
future endeavors, Wilhelmina.

446
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,759
Amanda, I don't
think he's kidding.

447
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
Amanda?

448
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,480
Oh, God!

449
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,120
Amanda! Come back!

450
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,479
Seriously!

451
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,399
Stop, Amanda.

452
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,719
Watch out!

453
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,216
Hey, that's how

454
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,496
I got my baby to nap, too.

455
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,816
Amanda, please!

456
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,119
If you stop rolling,

457
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,576
I'll stop trying to sell
you on the dark web.

458
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,360
Aw, look
at the happy couple.

459
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,280
- Aren't they so...
- Happy.

460
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,719
Exactly. Happy.

461
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,479
Or are you just faking
it to be popular?

462
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,519
Wait, what?

463
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,959
- Did you know?
- What?

464
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,599
No.
We're a happy couple.

465
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,479
- Tell 'em, Daph.
- Yeah, we love each other.

466
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,959
Great. Then prove it.

467
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,999
<i>- Kiss.</i>
- Whoo!

468
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
Kiss?

469
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,479
Or all your
popularity goes away forever.

470
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,360
Yeah, sure. Easy.

471
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
What the actual hell?

472
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,839
Velma? What are you doing here?

473
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,680
Amanda rolled here
to find her mom.

474
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,879
Her mom?

475
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,359
Velma, what are
you talking about?

476
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,399
Mom? What are you doing here?

477
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,296
The Brains invited us when they learned
your mom was in the caves with them.

478
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,319
And T-B-H, we thought
she'd be cool and order us alcohol.

479
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
Velma, what's going on?

480
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,479
Uh, nothing. I just thought

481
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,936
taking a little spin on the dance
floor with your granddaughter,

482
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,119
might give you the happiness
nudge you needed to...

483
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,336
Sophie, what the hell?

484
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,319
Velma,

485
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,720
the 72 hours are up.

486
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,519
She didn't remember who
took her and the Brains.

487
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,840
We have to tell her the truth.

488
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
No need. I think
I figured it out.

489
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,320
You did have an affair,
Aman, while I was kidnapped.

490
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:00,799
- And a child.
- Yes.

491
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,839
But for what it's worth,
both of those things

492
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,439
only happened after
Sophie and I fell in love.

493
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,320
I'll stop talking.

494
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,799
Mom, I'm sorry we lied,

495
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,959
but we had to try to
help you remember.

496
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,079
But... I do.

497
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,959
Oh, my God, I do remember
who the serial killer is.

498
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,039
What? How?

499
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,279
I don't know.

500
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
Maybe I'm relieved
to finally be freed

501
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,959
from my loveless and sexually
unfulfilling marriage.

502
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,280
- Rude.
- Stop!

503
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,159
I wasn't asking for
an actual explanation.

504
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,799
Just say who the
serial killer is.

505
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,399
Of course. It's...

506
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,759
It's...

507
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:36,958
It's...

508
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,359
It's me.

509
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,199
Okay, you are so
ordering us alcohol now.
