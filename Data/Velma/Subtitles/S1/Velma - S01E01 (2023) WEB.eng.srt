1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,479
<i>My name is Velma Dinkley.</i>

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,279
<i>And this is my origin story.</i>

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,800
<i>Sure, normally, origin stories</i>
<i>are about tall, handsome guys</i>

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,040
<i>struggling with the burden</i>

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,040
<i>of being handed</i>
<i>even more power.</i>

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,519
<i>And if they are about girls,</i>

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,920
<i>it's usually like,</i>

8
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,480
<i>"Hey, what made</i>
<i>this hot chick go crazy?"</i>

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,559
<i>So, to remedy this,</i>

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,519
<i>I've decided</i>
<i>to finally share...</i>

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,279
<i>...the bone-chilling events</i>

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,799
<i>that drove me to assemble</i>

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,880
<i>the greatest team</i>
<i>of spooky mystery solvers ever.</i>

14
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>Yeah, it was me.</i>

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,359
<i>Not Fred and his weird sex van.</i>

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>This is my story, told my way.</i>

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,719
<i>And it starts</i>
<i>with a murder, bitch.</i>

18
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:53,920
Brenda?

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,920
This school sucks.

20
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,119
Oh, hey.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,720
Team shower
discussion topic of the day.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,119
Have you ever noticed
how pilot episodes of TV shows

23
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,080
always have
more gratuitous sex and nudity

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,200
than the rest of the series?

25
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,960
-Oh, my God, I have.
-So true.

26
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,639
That's how we learned
what Rachel Brosnahan's
boobs look like.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,719
And Don Cheadle's butt.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,160
Well, I, for one,
think it's lame.

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,400
-Agreed.
-So lame.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,720
The lamest.

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,360
Oh, I actually kind of love it.

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,600
Sex sells.

33
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:29,799
And in today's
overcrowded market,

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,999
you need a hook.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,000
Um, the only hook
a good show ever needs

36
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,839
is good storytelling.

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,439
Then why was your favorite part
of the<i> Riverdale</i> pilot

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,920
when Betty and Veronica kissed?

39
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,280
Well, because
it was instantly called out

40
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,719
as tired in the scene.

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,440
No. It's because it was hot.

42
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,640
You can
have it both ways.

43
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,880
No, you can't.

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,160
Just admit
we are all secretly perverts.

45
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,440
Never!

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,839
And how do you feel about
race-blind casting, Daphne?

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,999
Well, as an Asian woman,

48
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,400
I, um, think it's cool.

49
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,480
I mean, not to oversimplify
a thorny issue,

50
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:13,080
but everyone loves it
when white people play
Jesus or a professional boxer.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,479
Why can't it ever go
the other way, right?

52
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,760
Uh, yes.

53
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,999
I wasn't expecting
such an enlightened answer

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,199
from such a bitch.

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,360
Velma?

56
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,079
What the hell?
You almost killed me.

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,159
Guess I didn't try hard enough.

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,119
See? Now, if this was a show,

59
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
it'd be super hot
if you two kissed.

60
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,240
Krista, if this was a show,

61
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,600
you'd be killed off
for being horny.

62
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,559
Brenda?

63
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,280
Wait, did you climb
in my locker to prove
how skinny you are again?

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,399
Ugh. We get it.

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,399
She has no brain!

66
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,519
I am not dissing her.
She has no brain.

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,520
Hello?

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Anybody? I know my rights.

69
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,440
I get a phone call
and a handsome detective

70
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
I infuriate
with my indifference.

71
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,480
Who killed Brenda,
Velma?

72
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,079
You're not real,
you're not real.

73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Who isn't real,
sweetie?

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,519
Uh, God's not real
if you two morons
are running this investigation.

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,320
Oh, how we've missed
that sense of humor, girl.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,399
Seriously. How long has it been
since Daphne had you
over to our house?

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Uh, since my mom went missing.

78
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,720
Two years ago.

79
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,640
Oh, right. That.

80
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,440
Oh, my God. You totally forgot.

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,719
No, we didn't.

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,840
Every day,
we're closer to finding Doodad.

83
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,360
Diya. Her name is Diya.

84
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,560
You know what?
We're done here. Peace.

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,799
Unfortunately,
we're not done here, Velma.

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,600
You're a suspect
in Brenda's murder.
Now sit.

87
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm a suspect?

88
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,000
I thought lesbians
were good at solving crimes.

89
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,599
It's like
the one positive stereotype
perpetuated by cop shows.

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Velma,
she was found in your locker

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
and you were lurking
around the showers

92
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,199
like a gym teacher who isn't
a gym teacher anymore.

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,999
Clearly,
someone's trying to frame me.

94
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,199
And I wasn't lurking.

95
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,960
I was waiting to shower alone.

96
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,999
Because of your weight?

97
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:03,959
What? No.

98
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,599
Because of your handsome face?

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,760
My face is fine.

100
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,719
Because of your
hairy gorilla arm?

101
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,039
No, because I hate
your stupid adopted daughter
and her fake-ass friends.

102
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,680
And yet you and Daphne
used to be best friends.
Isn't that right?

103
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,919
Yeah, until Daphne got hot
and ditched me

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,879
to hang out with Brenda
and the other popular girls

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,199
at Spooner's Malt Shop.

106
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,200
I could kill them all.

107
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,959
Okay, I see how this looks bad.

108
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,479
Look, we know you couldn't
kill Brenda, sweetie,

109
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,359
but we also know
we're not, like,
the best detectives.

110
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,320
So the only way
we're going to convince
the sheriff you're innocent

111
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,680
is if you help us find
Brenda's actual murderer.

112
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,679
Help you find
Brenda's murderer?

113
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,319
But that's a mystery.

114
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,960
And I don't solve mysteries.

115
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,839
Not anymore.

116
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,280
Then you're screwed.

117
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:02,000
You've got 24 hours
and then we arrest you.

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,439
But still, so good seeing you.

119
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,560
We miss you.

120
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,480
Say hi to your father
and Doodad.

121
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,399
Diya!

122
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey!
Watch where you're going, jerk.

123
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Oh. Hey, Fred.

124
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,520
-Do I know you?
-It's Velma, from school.

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,319
You cheat off me in Spanish
because you think I'm Mexican.

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,959
Maybe.

127
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,559
I have a disease
where I can't recognize
people who aren't hot.

128
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,719
My doctor says it's basically
sickle cell for rich guys.

129
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
Is it called rudeness?

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,439
It is. You're like, smart.

131
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,720
Oh, wow. Thank you.

132
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,719
Yeah, not a compliment.

133
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Anyway, have you seen Daphne?

134
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,319
- She texted--
- Oh, Fred.

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,559
Thank God you're here.

136
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,519
Brenda's--

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,960
Into me. No, I know.

138
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,399
I'm<i> caliente,</i>
as this one's people would say.

139
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,599
No. Brenda's dead.

140
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,880
What? No!

141
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,680
She was my plan B
if you ever got too clingy.

142
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,600
What happened?

143
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,319
-Ask Velma.
-Who?

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Me, Fred.
We were just...

145
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,479
Forget it.

146
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Not now, Daph. Geez.

147
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,000
Then when, Fred? When?

148
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,200
And just FYI,
I didn't kill Brenda.

149
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,360
And how are you
going to prove that, Velma?

150
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,080
You don't solve
mysteries anymore.

151
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,359
You're not real.
You're not real.

152
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,680
Seriously, who is this weirdo?

153
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,439
Did your moms, like,
adopt another kid?

154
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,519
Dad! You can't
just eat soggy fries
from the takeout container.

155
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,640
You have to crisp them
in the oven first.

156
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,200
I saw you eat a fry
out of the vacuum cleaner
last week, so spare me.

157
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,199
-I've had a long day.
-You've had a long day?

158
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,600
I was accused
of a murder I didn't commit.

159
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,359
And whose fault is that?

160
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,800
Excuse me?

161
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Don't you raise your eyebrows
at me, Steve Harvey.

162
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,359
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

163
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
Fine.

164
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,880
Velma, I love you.

165
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,560
But I'm a lawyer,
so trust me when I say this.

166
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,799
People only think
you murdered Brenda
because you...

167
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,160
Were voted "Most Revenge-y"
in the school yearbook. I know.

168
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,239
Oh, those yearbook guys
have no idea what's
coming to them.

169
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,840
No, because you're a weirdo.

170
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,399
Ever since
your mother disappeared,

171
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,199
you haven't even
tried to hang out
with the normal kids

172
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,319
at Spooner's Malt Shop.

173
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,720
Maybe I'd hang out there more

174
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,080
if you hadn't knocked up
a Spooner's waitress

175
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,599
while your actual wife
is still missing.

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,440
Velma, that's not fair!

177
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,319
I'm not just a waitress.
I'm also--

178
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,759
A basic bitch
who doesn't even know
how to use hashtags?

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,199
No, I'm also, hashtag,
the owner of Spooner's.

180
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,440
Oh! The baby's kicking hashtag.

181
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,879
Hashtag, get my new camera
out of my bag, Aman.

182
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,639
You got an actual camera?

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,199
With what money?

184
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,239
Dad says we can't even afford
to buy me a second sweater.

185
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,400
Oh, God!

186
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,079
I know,
but it's about priorities.

187
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,359
You need a real camera

188
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,280
to capture real,
unmanufactured moments.

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,079
Well, I have to go
prepare myself for prison.

190
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,159
Not that you care.

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,519
Velma, real talk,
shero to shero.

192
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,999
People only think
you're a murderer

193
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,280
because you're a creepy loser.

194
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,080
But that will change tonight,

195
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
when you become
a glamorous waitress
at Spooner's Malt Shop.

196
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,080
That was Brenda's
favorite song.

197
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,199
And yeah,
normally in pop culture,
when a slutty girl is murdered,

198
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,959
we're all a little like,
"Well, maybe she deserved it."

199
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,600
But that is what made Brenda
so special.

200
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:26,679
She was the rare slut
that did not deserve
to be murdered.

201
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,800
Thank you, Krista.

202
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,360
That was beautiful.

203
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,560
But Brenda wasn't
just a rare slut.

204
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
She was a rare friend.

205
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,840
In fact,
she was such a rare friend,

206
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,559
she made my previous
so-called best friend
look like a piece of crap.

207
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,439
Especially now that I know
she's the main suspect
in Brenda's murder.

208
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,880
Daphne, sweetie,
that was private.

209
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,959
Bump this noise.

210
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,359
Nope.

211
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,959
Hello?

212
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,480
You're not real.

213
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,959
You're not real.

214
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,960
You're not real.

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
I am real! A real man, Father!

216
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,640
Who are you?

217
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,320
If I tell you,
will you remember?

218
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,520
I have an illness!

219
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,519
What are you
doing out here, Fred?

220
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,119
I guess since you're a stranger
I'll never see again,
I can tell you.

221
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,639
I'm trying
to pull myself together

222
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,920
so I can be the man
my father expects me to be.

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,879
Zam! DILF city.

224
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,000
-Sorry. Continue.
-No, I get it.

225
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,800
And I want to be
as manly as him.

226
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,559
But since Brenda died,
I can't stop crying
like a total puss.

227
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Hey, hey. It's okay. I get it.

228
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,040
I have this whole thing
with my mom.

229
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,960
Did she put her cigars
out on you?

230
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,679
Uh, no.

231
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,839
My mom smoked cigarettes.

232
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,760
<i>Figuring that out was</i>
<i>the first mystery</i>
<i>I ever solved.</i>

233
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,200
Oh, shit. Hi, sweetie.

234
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,239
<i>See, my mother wrote mysteries.</i>

235
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,600
<i>And from that day on,</i>

236
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,000
<i>she gave me</i>
<i>little mysteries to solve</i>

237
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,559
<i>while she worked and smoked.</i>

238
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,519
<i>Like the case</i>
<i>of the missing idea juice.</i>

239
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,440
<i>But eventually,</i>

240
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,200
<i>I grew bold,</i>
<i>and sought mysteries of my own.</i>

241
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:28,720
<i>But instead of feeling excited</i>
<i>I found my Christmas presents,</i>

242
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,719
<i>I felt terrible.</i>

243
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,159
<i>I'd ruined Christmas.</i>

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
<i>But still,</i>
<i>my mom felt so bad for me,</i>

245
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,800
<i>she ran out to buy something</i>
<i>I could unwrap</i>

246
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,760
<i>Christmas morning.</i>

247
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,719
<i>That was the last time</i>
<i>I ever saw her.</i>

248
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Hey, don't forget
to buy yourself
something from me.

249
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,799
<i>That night,</i>
<i>the police found my mom's car</i>

250
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,839
<i>abandoned and empty,</i>
<i>except for her glasses,</i>

251
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,279
<i>and a single</i>
<i>wrapped gift for me.</i>

252
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,799
<i>So I put on my mom's glasses</i>

253
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,799
<i>and vowed I wouldn't</i>
<i>open her gift</i>

254
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,919
<i>until I found her.</i>

255
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,040
<i>But I felt so guilty</i>

256
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,320
<i>that it was my mystery solving</i>

257
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,960
<i>that had caused her</i>
<i>to go missing,</i>

258
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,439
<i>I started having</i>
<i>horrifying hallucinations.</i>

259
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,879
This is all your fault, Velma.

260
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,879
Why did you have to go
and solve your own mystery?

261
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,360
Now, when I try
to solve a mystery,

262
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,520
my guilt triggers a potentially
heart-stopping hallucination.

263
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,960
Could exercising
and eating less
fried food help?

264
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,800
We'll never know.

265
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,040
Wow. After hearing that,

266
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,559
I not only feel
emotionally hooked,

267
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,840
I understand the stakes
of your journey, Velma.

268
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,880
You remembered my name.

269
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,000
Huh? That's never happened
to me before.

270
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,079
Fred! Watch out!

271
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,839
You're right! If anyone ever
saw me talking to you,
I'd die of shame.

272
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,719
Velma!

273
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,679
There you are!

274
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,159
Norville? What the hell?

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
You didn't answer my VMs.
Voice mails.

276
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,920
And then my dad heard me
call you the B word,

277
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,440
so I lost my phone
for 24 hours.

278
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,999
But I had to find you

279
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,480
because I still didn't know
if you'd listened to my VMs,

280
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,159
voice mails,
let alone responded. Did you?

281
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,239
Yes. And I don't want to do
our math homework together.

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,360
Just email me
your answers like always.

283
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,600
Yes, of course.

284
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,919
Though I left you
some other VMs, voice--

285
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,160
I know what VMs are!
Get to the point.

286
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,280
I already did.

287
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,759
In my VMs.

288
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
<i> Velma,</i>

289
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,239
<i>it's Norville. From math.</i>

290
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,599
<i>I know who killed Brenda.</i>

291
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,960
Oh, my God. Who?

292
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,440
I left you six more VMs.

293
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,439
<i>So I guess what I'm saying is,</i>
<i>I don't know who killed Brenda.</i>

294
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,280
Damn it, Norville,
you're wasting my time.

295
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,600
If I can't convince people
I didn't kill Brenda
by tomorrow,

296
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,919
I'm going to be arrested.

297
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,239
I know, But I also know
how to find out

298
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,479
who did kill Brenda.

299
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,159
Have you ever wondered
why Spooner's,

300
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,719
a boring malt shop
owned by a woman
with a "breathe" tattoo,

301
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,559
is the coolest spot
in Crystal Cove?

302
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,280
Only every day of my life.

303
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,760
On TV shows,

304
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,719
the malt shop owner
is always a friendly Black man,

305
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,840
or a spicy meatball Italian.

306
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,119
So you're like,
"Oh, the kids come here
for the folksy wisdom."

307
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,479
But Sophie has no wisdom.

308
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,480
Just a lot of T-shirts
with puns about wine.

309
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,040
Exactly. I think it has
something to do with drugs.

310
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,839
Which I hate.

311
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,959
So, I had one of my reporters
on the school newspaper
investigate Spooner's.

312
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,759
Guess which one.

313
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,639
Uh, Dorkus McNoFriends?

314
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,999
Well, Dorkus was actually busy.

315
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,639
So I gave Brenda my camera

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,599
to photograph
anything suspicious there.

317
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,640
And she said she got a picture
of something weird
in the bathroom,

318
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,880
but didn't say what.

319
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,759
Wait. So you think--

320
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,240
No, I know Brenda was murdered
to keep that photograph
from getting out.

321
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:21,839
Holy crap.

322
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,640
Sophie just got a new camera,
which I know we can't afford.

323
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,319
Hashtag, get my new camera
out of my bag, Aman.

324
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,799
But what if she didn't buy it?

325
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,999
What if she took it from Brenda
after killing her,

326
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
to protect the secret
of Spooner's popularity?

327
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:35,239
If I can find
your camera on Sophie,

328
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,960
I'd solve Brenda's murder
and send Sophie to jail.

329
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,239
It's a win-win.

330
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Or maybe we could find
the camera together?

331
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,879
Together? Oh.

332
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,600
-Hmm.
-Oh, yeah.
Just because it's mine.

333
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,200
But also your hallucinations.
I could maybe help?

334
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,440
Oh, Okay. Phew.

335
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,319
I thought you were, like,
suggesting a date.

336
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,079
A date? You wish.

337
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,719
A date. What?

338
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,839
Holy mother of God.

339
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,720
Yes, it's true.

340
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,720
Sophie photographs babies
dressed up as vegetables.

341
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,080
It's our dirty little secret.

342
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,079
But that's how
she afforded the new camera.

343
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,480
Okay, but if this isn't
Norville's camera,

344
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,040
who killed Brenda?

345
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh, no! The camera!

346
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,000
Is someone trying
to solve a mystery?

347
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,719
No. I was just
asking a question.

348
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,040
Heart attack.

349
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,319
Velma, what is this?

350
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,239
Did you eat
all the gummy vitamins again?

351
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,080
Damn it, Aman. Can't you see
that she's trying to solve
a mystery?

352
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,880
There you go.

353
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,079
Get it all out.

354
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,079
Yep. Okay. Oh, boy.

355
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,599
Still more.

356
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,040
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,479
I thought you killed Brenda
because she figured out

358
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,360
the secret
to your diner's popularity.

359
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,480
I get that.

360
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,719
But there isn't
any secret to it.

361
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,399
Just good food, great tunes.

362
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
And I let teens
have sex in the bathroom.

363
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,079
And I'm sorry
I didn't believe you
about your hallucinations.

364
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,800
But, Velma, I told you this.

365
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,800
Your mother didn't go missing
because you solved a mystery.

366
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,479
She left us.

367
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,999
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
No, she didn't.

368
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,919
Something bad happened to her,
and it's my fault.

369
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,919
Because if Mom just left us,
it means she didn't love us.

370
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,719
Which is insane.
Sure, you were
a huge jerk, Dad, but I was...

371
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,120
Oh, my eye!

372
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,239
My book!

373
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,359
My idea juice!

374
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:38,480
Oh, God.

375
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,000
Mom wasn't taken.

376
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,000
She left because she hated us.

377
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,599
Yes.

378
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,560
So you can stop feeling guilty
about your mysteries,<i> beti.</i>

379
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,639
And you can start
changing your personality
to fit in and avoid prison.

380
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,839
Whoo-hoo!

381
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,079
What? Too soon?

382
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,960
No.

383
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,279
No, you're right.

384
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,240
It's time to stop
feeling guilty and move on.

385
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,279
Wow.
Are you an exchange student

386
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,840
from a more
sexually liberated country?

387
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,399
No, it's Velma.

388
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm just unburdened
by the belief

389
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,640
I caused my mother
to go missing.

390
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,599
Well, now that you're not
a total dog,

391
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,919
do you want to hang out
at Spooner's Malt Shop later?

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,319
Yes.

393
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Because I'm just a normal,
well-adjusted teen now.

394
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,079
Like all of you.

395
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,999
She is.

396
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,280
My opinion's changed.

397
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,439
Velma,
do you like playing cards?

398
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,879
Because I'm calling bullshit.

399
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,880
This outfit
is clearly just a ploy

400
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,079
to make us think you're not

401
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,720
a brain-removing
serial killer anymore.

402
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,840
Uh, no, it's not.

403
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
Enough!

404
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
My fellow populars, yes.

405
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,520
Underneath
this banging new look,

406
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:03,199
Velma is still the fashionably
challenged loser

407
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,799
we depend on
for group projects.

408
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,080
But last night, we spoke.

409
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,720
And yes, while it was awful,

410
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,919
I learned this is
not a creature
capable of murder. Nay.

411
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,520
It is just a scared little boy
who wants our friendship.

412
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,879
Perfect.

413
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,120
Well, well, well.

414
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,960
Well, well, well.

415
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,560
-Well, well, well.
-Look, whatever this is,
can you just get to it?

416
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,400
Class is starting.

417
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,480
I have a whole speech.

418
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,200
Fine. I'll just
skip to the main part.

419
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,079
Well, guess what, Velma?

420
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,359
If you want my boyfriend,
you can have him.

421
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,480
Boyfriend?
You think I want Fred?

422
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,760
I mean, sure,
if someone was, like,

423
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,120
"Want to see
a naked picture of Fred?"

424
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,240
I'd be like, "Hubba hubba!"

425
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,679
But I'd say that about anyone.

426
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,119
LeBron, Helen Mirren, a mummy.

427
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,520
- Fred? Naked?
- Hilarious.

428
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,439
We've been dating for a year,
and he still won't even
take his pants off.

429
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,559
A year?

430
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,959
-He gay?
-I haven't heard that rumor.

431
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,239
I have heard rumors
about other people.

432
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
Yeah, we've all heard
those rumors.

433
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,440
Anyway, Fred's
so self-conscious
about his body,

434
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,679
he kicks everyone
out of the bathroom
at Spooner's Malt Shop

435
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
when he has to use it.

436
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,280
So have fun with that.

437
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,279
Wait. The bathroom
at Spooner's Malt Shop?

438
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,360
Oh, my God.

439
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,359
Norville!

440
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,960
Hey, I was rethinking

441
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,200
our friendship this morning,
and maybe it's healthy if I--

442
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,440
No time!
Drive me to Fred's house!

443
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,879
I'll get my windbreaker.

444
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,400
Why would Fred kill Brenda

445
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:01,399
just because
she photographed him
in the bathroom?

446
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,359
Why wouldn't he?

447
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,640
If I were a rich white dude,

448
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,720
I'd kill everybody
just to get away with it.

449
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,839
But won't looking for my camera
trigger your potentially
fatal hallucinations?

450
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,160
Though
"Saving Friend from Death"

451
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,879
would make
for a great college essay.

452
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,600
My hallucinations have stopped.

453
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,480
Once I realized
solving mysteries

454
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,079
didn't cause
my mom to go missing,

455
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,040
I no longer felt the guilt
that triggered them.

456
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,840
Okay, but have you given
any thought

457
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,999
to all the other ways
you could die trying
to solve a mystery?

458
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,159
Crushed by
a revolving bookcase?

459
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,119
Attacked by bats.

460
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,199
Falling off a fence.

461
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Stop. I'll be fine.

462
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
Velma, did you fall?

463
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,639
No, I'm cool
and graceful like a swan.

464
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
Okay, 'cause it really
sounded like you fell.

465
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,239
What?

466
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm bored.

467
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,600
Norville! Get off my jock
and let me solve this mystery.

468
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,879
Oh. God,
I'm starting to hallucinate.

469
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,640
<i>You just said those were over.</i>

470
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,759
Well, I guess I needed
more than three minutes online

471
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,199
to make a mental health
diagnosis, didn't I?

472
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,720
Wait. This isn't so bad.

473
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,119
No, it's not bad, Velma.

474
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,319
But it's going to be!

475
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,239
Help me, Norville!

476
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,159
<i>Velma! Velma! Can you hear me?</i>

477
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,519
<i>Just remember,</i>
<i>these hallucinations</i>
<i>are only in your head,</i>

478
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,920
<i>so focus on what I'm saying.</i>

479
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,600
Velma!

480
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,760
Velma.

481
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,800
You're not
saying anything.

482
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,879
<i>I know! I'm, uh,</i>
<i>kind of drawing</i>
<i>a blank right now.</i>

483
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,080
<i>Have you seen</i>
<i>any good movies lately?</i>

484
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,320
Oh, God.
Here comes the big one.

485
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
<i>Stop! You can't die.</i>

486
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:42,079
Why? I'm weird
and no one likes me.

487
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,080
That's not true.

488
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
I like you.

489
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,200
Like, like like you.

490
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,320
- Wait, what?
- Velma.

491
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,599
No, you don't.

492
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,760
You're like a brother to me.
That's hilarious.

493
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,639
Wait. Norville.

494
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,039
Your joke worked, you genius.

495
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,959
-Keep making me laugh.
<i>-I wasn't joking.</i>

496
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,559
<i>Your face is why</i>
<i>I get up in the morning.</i>

497
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,839
That's perfect.
One more time should do it.

498
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,359
Make it super cringy.

499
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,760
You're
the main character
in all my dreams.

500
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,480
Okay, stop.
I'm peeing. I'm peeing.

501
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:15,600
Norville, it worked.

502
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,039
Who knew you were so funny?

503
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,119
Yes, it's hilarious.
I'm the funniest man alive.

504
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,200
This is not
what I need right now.

505
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:26,720
Bingo.

506
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,039
Well.

507
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,439
These are just
Krista hooking up with--

508
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,639
Damn, Krista. Get it.

509
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,800
But why does
Fred have the camera?

510
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,999
Because Velma,

511
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,120
Brenda also photographed this.

512
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,159
Wait. Your secret is
you're hairless?

513
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,600
Uh, if I was hairless,

514
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,999
I'd literally wear
a bikini to school every day.

515
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,320
Not hairless, Velma.

516
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,600
I haven't finished going
through puberty yet.

517
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,880
I'm a late bloomer.

518
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,600
How else are my features
so boyishly delicate?

519
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,520
But Father says,
if people know,

520
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,519
they'll laugh,
and never respect me

521
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,640
as the man
and unquestioned leader

522
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,280
that I am meant to be.

523
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,680
So we keep the secret
hidden away

524
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,000
to avoid embarrassment.

525
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,880
Which is why Brenda,
and her stupid camera

526
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,599
left me no choice
but the unthinkable.

527
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,480
Oh, no.

528
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,879
It's okay.

529
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm just gonna to do to you
what I did to Brenda.

530
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,839
What the hell?

531
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,640
You saved my life.

532
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,359
You're not terrible cops,
after all.

533
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,879
They assumed
you were a package thief.

534
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,840
It worked out, didn't it?

535
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:41,560
Okay. Well,
I proved my innocence.

536
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,840
Can I go?

537
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,639
I'd like to wash
Fred's leg blood
out of my mouth.

538
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,360
Yeah, sweetie,
you're free to go.

539
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,119
But we're taking credit
for the arrest.

540
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,239
Linda lost her taser
on a loop-de-loop
roller-coaster last week,

541
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,080
so, uh, we need a win.

542
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,119
Wait. You think
I killed Brenda?

543
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,479
You just said

544
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,040
you were going to do to me
what you did to her.

545
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,200
I meant pay you to keep quiet.

546
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm innocent.

547
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,319
I'm too much of a puss
to kill someone.

548
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,040
I'd laugh, Fred.

549
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,319
If I wasn't
standing next to this
secret comedian over here.

550
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:09,199
Man, if I found
humor attractive,

551
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,119
I would be
all over you right now.

552
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, well.

553
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,839
Hey, so if you
no longer feel guilty
for your mom's disappearance,

554
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,239
why do you think
you hallucinated?

555
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,599
The rules feel a bit muddy.

556
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,079
Muddy?

557
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,279
Oh, sorry I'm not a drunk
on the verge of losing custody,

558
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,720
like every other woman
solving murders these days.

559
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,359
Clearly I hallucinated
because I do still feel guilty.

560
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,280
As annoying as I was,

561
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,640
in my heart,

562
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,799
I know my mom
loves me too much to have left.

563
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:41,360
It was my mystery solving
that caused her disappearance.

564
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,919
But after catching Fred,
I'm back, baby.

565
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,799
I'm gonna find my mom,
or die trying.

566
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,679
Yuck! That is one mystery
I don't want to solve.

567
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,039
Right?

568
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,519
Velma,

569
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,039
you should see this.

570
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,120
Oh, God! Krista!

571
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,959
And she also has no brain!
