1
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:07,319
<i> Previously on</i> Velma...

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,440
The last place
my mom's cell phone pinged

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,359
the night she went missing
was at Fred's house.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,440
My name's Fred. Who are you?

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
They call me "The Thing."

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,480
Oh God, my heart!

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,520
Did that work?

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,480
Yeah.

9
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,399
Well, good luck
finding your mom.

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,319
What the hell just happened?

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
<i> So, yeah,</i>
<i>let's do this.</i>

12
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,639
<i>I've avoided it long enough</i>

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,959
<i>with winks and nods.</i>

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,039
<i>Let's finally talk</i>
<i>about only thing</i>

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,639
<i>you've ever really wanted</i>
<i>to know about me.</i>

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,359
-<i> Is Velma Dinkley, ga--ga--</i>
<i>-</i> Velma, snap out of it!

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,040
You fed the cat
Sophie's prenatal vitamins.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
Oh, sorry.

19
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:16,320
I was just thinking about mom,
and only mom.

20
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,159
She disappeared
at Fred's house. Bye.

21
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,440
Norville.

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,719
Guess what Daphne gave me?

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,280
Uh, is it mononucleosis?

24
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,800
Because I saw
you two kiss last night.

25
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,480
Daphne and me kiss, what?
Her hands on my hips, what?

26
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,879
The heat of a thousand suns
passing between us, what?

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
Time both infinite
and finite -- Okay, we kissed.
But it's not a big deal.

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,999
You possibly being gay
is a huge deal.

29
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,839
For one, it reduces me
to a cliched
straight best friend.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,399
Norville, we only kissed
because Daphne was trying
to stop a hallucination.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,879
She gave me
my mom's cold-case file.
And guess what?

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,440
The last place
her cellphone pinged,
was Fred's house.

33
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,439
Wait, Fred. That's huge.

34
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,880
Though not,
"you might be gay," huge.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,159
Okay, stop.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
In this day and age,
you can't speculate

37
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,360
about someone's sexuality
unless they're famous,

38
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,679
or Peppermint Patty.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Wait, you didn't tell anyone,
did you?

40
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,600
Mazel on your
first kiss, Velma.

41
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,040
- You told your dad?
- He's a therapist.

42
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,799
I thought you might want
to talk to someone

43
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,920
about whether you like women,

44
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,160
or maybe women
and one cool guy?

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,320
Your dad is a high school
guidance counselor,

46
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,919
the lowest form of therapist.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,079
He's worse than
the free therapy app
I downloaded

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
that's obviously
Russian spyware.

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,039
Okay, well,
I think you're gonna have
a little more respect

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,839
for my dad
after this morning.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
He's running
a mental health assembly

52
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,080
to help students process
the murders.

53
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,520
There's gonna be
hella pamphlets.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,999
Welcome, kids!

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,199
I'm Nutso,
The Mental Health Squirrel.

56
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,679
Good morning, my students!

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Good morning,
Principal Rogers.

58
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
Good morning, Mom.

59
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,079
And now my turn.

60
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,760
Good morning, my students!

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,039
Good morning, Dad!

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,880
Good morning,
my beautiful boy.

63
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,119
And welcome to
the Crystal Cove High School

64
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
Mental Health Assembly.

65
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,879
How y'all doing, good?

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
Bad, you idiot!

67
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,480
Two of our friends
had their brains removed
by Fred Jones.

68
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:13,399
See, your dad is worse
for teen mental health
than waist trainers.

69
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,159
Well, you can talk to me
about your feelings.

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,880
My dad says
therapy is in my blood.

71
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,759
I just got my mom to admit
she never wanted kids.

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,479
Norville, I don't need to talk
to anyone about anything.

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Oh, God. Daphne is looking
right at me. Hide!

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,240
...comfortable opening up.

75
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,960
So in sum, you can't spell
mental health without me.

76
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,840
You can't spell "Kill me,"
without me either.

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,159
Okay, okay. That's enough.

78
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,959
Unless someone
has a topper?

79
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,840
No? Well, in addition
to spending three minutes
on mental health,

80
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,519
the school board is requiring
that all girls attend

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,719
a women's self-defense class

82
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
to protect themselves
from any future serial killers.

83
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,679
Uh, why don't
the boys have to take
a "Don't Murder Girls" class?

84
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,319
Because I only have
$50 in the budget

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,160
to combat centuries
of toxic masculinity.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,800
Now, please welcome
your women's
self-defense class teachers.

87
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
Moms?

88
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
All right, ladies.

89
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,399
Who's ready to grab
their friends

90
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,159
and roll around on the floor
for a little bit?

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,320
So hot.

92
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,840
Oh, God. Get off your ass!

93
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,399
We're gonna talk to Fred
about my missing mom right now.

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,359
Oh, give me
one of those tattoos

95
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,200
that's actually secret clues
about how to escape prison.

96
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,240
I learned how to do this
while at Ole Miss.

97
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,639
I can do butterflies
and Confederate flags.

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Jones, there's, like,
a talking meatloaf here
to see you.

99
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,599
Velma?

100
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,440
Norville. How do I look?

101
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,119
Is it obvious I have
two bean bags in my bra?

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,160
Wait. Are you still attracted
to Fred?

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,639
He's a convicted serial killer
who might be connected to
your mom's disappearance.

104
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,719
That's why I'm so confused
about Daphne.

105
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,360
Sure, she was my first kiss,
but whenever I used to make out
with my hand,

106
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,959
I called it Fred.

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,159
Okay, Velma,
you have to talk about this
with someone.

108
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,600
I don't have time.

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,399
I have to focus on finding out
what happened to my mom.

110
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,839
So many mysteries,
so little time.

111
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
-Daphne?
-Maybe another kiss will help
clear things up.

112
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:03,959
Muah!

113
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,319
Oh, God. I'm hallucinating.

114
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,479
Muah, muah, muah, muah, muah.

115
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,720
Hi.

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,760
Velma, what do I do?

117
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,079
Should I kiss you
like Daphne did?

118
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,520
Without consent,
I'll remind you.

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
No, don't kiss me.

120
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,039
I'm already confused.

121
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,160
Kissing me would confuse you.
Wait, why?

122
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,640
This isn't about you right now.

123
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:27,519
Just make me laugh
like last time.

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,360
But a kiss might awaken
passions we've been
too scared to admit.

125
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,520
Why deprive ourselves
that knowledge?

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,680
Oh, my God, that was hilarious.

127
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,799
Thank you, Nor--

128
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,799
Hey, get your friends off me.

129
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
Great, if I'm banned
from prison,

130
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,840
how am I gonna question Fred
about my mom's disappearance?

131
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,040
Let me question Fred.
I have a plan.

132
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,280
You just need to figure out
your feelings for Daphne.

133
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,839
Also, your bean bags
are leaking.

134
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,479
Okay, listen up.

135
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,399
These are the skills
you need to survive.

136
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,279
When a massive, burly man
springs up and attacks you,

137
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,320
notice, she said,
when you get attacked,
not if.

138
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,840
Don't fight.

139
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,840
Just make like a grown man
who lightly stubbed his toe.

140
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,360
Yell, fall down, and go limp.

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
Now, to demonstrate.

142
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:15,239
We've pre-selected
our own daughter, Daphne

143
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,679
to play the beautiful
but vulnerable victim,

144
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,799
while the gruff assailant
will be...

145
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,359
-Velma.
-Who's calling me gruff?

146
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,439
I'm not gruff.

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,480
Wait, I'm with Daphne.

148
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,680
Uh, I have to go
to the bathroom.

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,560
Uh, me too.

150
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,559
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,879
So, uh, this is so stupid,
but before rolling around
on each other,

152
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,519
I thought maybe we should

153
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,839
talk about our, uh, kiss.

154
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,840
Just in case you're confused.

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,399
I am.

156
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,279
I mean, hanging out
and dealing drugs
together yesterday

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
made me realize
how much I've missed
our friendship.

158
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,800
So I guess my question is,
do you...

159
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,519
-like me?
-Like you?

160
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,360
I haven't really
thought about it.

161
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,840
You were dating Fred,
until he went to prison.

162
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,439
Do you like me?

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
I asked you first.

164
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,279
Don't try to make me
the vulnerable one here.

165
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
Well, I mean, you kissed me.

166
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,560
To stop your hallucination.
But then you kissed me,
like, whoa!

167
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,559
Well, then let's just say
we kissed each other.

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,200
Even though we both know
it was you who kissed me.

169
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,279
Which is impossible
because I don't like you
like that.

170
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,399
I like Fred.

171
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,999
Oh, good.

172
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
Because I don't like you
like that either.

173
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,599
Perfect. We're on
the same page.

174
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,919
Wow. I'm so glad
we resolved all our issues

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
before we had
to punch each other.

176
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,880
Me too.

177
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,760
And... Fight to see
who's less vulnerable.

178
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,120
What the hell, Daphne?

179
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,920
If I was a real attacker,
you could've hurt me.

180
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,359
You're supposed to go limp.

181
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,399
And potentially let myself
get hurt by you instead?

182
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,199
My journal's
not gonna believe this.

183
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,360
Cool it, ladies.

184
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,240
There is no room
for personal beef
in this class.

185
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,400
We are not here
to attack each other.

186
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,279
-At least not until tomorrow.
-Why?

187
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:04,159
What's tomorrow?
Oh, no. Is it fajita day
in the cafeteria?

188
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,560
Last year some kid lost an eye
fighting for guac.

189
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,320
No, after mastering

190
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,320
today's self defense
techniques, tomorrow
you'll be competing

191
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,880
in the All Crystal Cove
Women's Self Defense
Class Tournament.

192
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,479
What? How will fighting girls
help us defend ourselves
against attacks from guys?

193
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,719
Is first prize a gun?

194
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,280
It is now. Great idea!

195
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,040
But the point of this
is to determine

196
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:28,279
who was the least vulnerable girl in school.

197
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,079
Okay, but...

198
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,760
is the best way to prevent
an attacker really just
to become one.

199
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,480
Works for Batman.

200
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,279
Good luck tomorrow, girls.
And may the least
vulnerable girl win.

201
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:48,480
Wait. You wanna give me
therapy? I don't know.

202
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,239
Jones men normally bury
their emotions until they
explode on a family vacation,

203
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,519
Sure, but therapy isn't just
a great way for therapists
to remodel their kitchens.

204
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
It also helps people.

205
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,759
And I thought there might be
some things in your past
you'd want to discuss.

206
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,359
Like, how Father stood me up
at my birthday party?

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
I tried to steer
the hot air balloon myself,
but I was only four.

208
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
Huh. Yeah, you think
we should start there?

209
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
But I'd actually
rather talk about moms.

210
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,359
Oh, I do miss my mom.
Uh, prison is cool,

211
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,760
but nobody watches me pee
quite like Mother.

212
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,880
Wow, another great place
to start, but...

213
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,759
what do you think
about Velma's mom?

214
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,799
Diya Dinkley, she went missing
at your house.

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,399
Uh, you know,
I think visiting time's over.
I should go.

216
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,360
Everything okay over here,
with the guy who put me
in prison?

217
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,439
Look, pal.
I don't want any problems.

218
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,799
I'm just talking to my friend
on behalf of a female friend

219
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
who might become
more than a friend
if I play my cards right.

220
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
You're wasting
your time, buddy.

221
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,120
Romantic relationships
between old friends
rarely work out.

222
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,360
It's always one-sided.

223
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,480
That's not true!

224
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,599
Okay, first girl to move
the other off the mat
advances. Ready?

225
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm going to beat
the Brazilian butt lift
out of you.

226
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,719
You'll never undo
the work of Dr. Gross.

227
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm on the website.

228
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,920
And... Fight!

229
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,720
Whoo! Yes!

230
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,039
Pathetic.

231
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Wow, I can't believe
I was gonna fake a limp
to get out of this.

232
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,799
-That's it. Go limp.
-Wha...

233
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,439
Protect my butt.
Please throw me on my face.

234
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,079
Sorry, I can't tell which one's which.

235
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,800
Where do you think
you're going?

236
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,080
Kill her, honey.
I mean, go sportsmanship!

237
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,360
Sportsmanship her up
and teamwork out the pieces.

238
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
I am not vulnerable.

239
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,839
No one will ever hurt me.

240
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,280
So he pushed me, and I said
classic transference.

241
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,719
and that's the last thing
I remember.

242
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
Guess I'm not as great
a therapist as I thought.

243
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,960
Norville, stop.

244
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,840
First rule of therapy,
you are as great
as you think you are.

245
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,359
Unfortunately, no one
will ever take you seriously
as a therapist

246
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,679
without this one little thing.

247
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,239
A PhD in psychology?

248
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,920
Please.

249
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,840
I never finished mine
and literally
no one's checked. No.

250
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,559
The only thing a therapist
really needs
is a good cardigan.

251
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,840
It makes you look so dumpy
and non-threatening,

252
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,679
people instantly
feel comfortable
opening up to you.

253
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,239
How do I look?

254
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,760
Like I want to scream
about how loud
your mom chews.

255
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,080
Hey,
it's working already. Hmm.

256
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,239
Daphne, this is ridiculous.

257
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Are we really going
to fight instead of just
talking about what happened?

258
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
If memory serves,
I asked you a question.

259
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,799
I'm still waiting
for an answer.

260
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,640
Fine. I'll admit it.

261
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,320
I do like you like that.

262
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,120
What, are you scared
of having feelings for a girl?

263
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,320
Velma, please.
I have two moms.

264
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,159
I was baptized
on the set of<i> Ellen.</i>

265
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,599
It's just I have
a lot more at stake than you.

266
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,520
Daphne. Why are you talking
to that?

267
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, I get it.
You have more at stake,

268
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,080
because I'm not
as popular as you.

269
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,919
What? You're not popular
at all.

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,439
Well, let's see how popular
you are,

271
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,800
after I kick
your perfect ass, Daphne,

272
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,720
Oh, I'll give you something
to journal about.

273
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,960
Dear Diary,
Gird your loins.

274
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
Wait, they pulled me
out of mosque for you?

275
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,439
Yes. I thought we could
continue your therapy.

276
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,880
What? No way.
Why would I wanna--

277
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,199
Whoa, I feel funny.

278
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
Did they drug our food again?

279
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,559
So what were we
talking about, Doc?

280
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,879
We were discussing
your feelings

281
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,199
about the night
Velma's mom, Diya,
went missing.

282
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,040
Right, so Father had
just bought our house.

283
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:30,959
It was a dump. And he had
this brilliant idea to burn it
for the insurance money.

284
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,119
But instead of fraud,
you committed murder.

285
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,559
I wish.
You can get over murder,
but this could ruin a man.

286
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll never tell.

287
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,639
So unflattering
and disarming.

288
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,559
The truth is, on the night
we were going to burn it down,

289
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,199
my father stood me up,
just like on my birthday.

290
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,439
Only this time, Bill Gates
didn't even jump out
of a cake for me.

291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,039
Wait, that's it?
And that's worse than murder?

292
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,280
Oh, then some Indian lady
pulled up.

293
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes. Tell me about her.

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,519
Why, you into that? Respect.

295
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,999
- No. What was she doing there?
- I don't know.

296
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,679
My dad told me never
to pay attention to women
over 35.

297
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,960
Okay. This is useless.

298
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,120
You clearly had nothing
to do with Diya's kidnapping.

299
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,559
Sorry, Doc.

300
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,999
You're not getting out of here
until you help me

301
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,639
with my passive aggression.

302
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,240
But if you really wanna leave,
I guess I can just go suffer

303
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,800
with the other guys
waiting to talk to you.

304
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Welcome fans
of women's self-defense!

305
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,440
Now who's ready for some
bone-crushing empowerment?

306
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,360
In one corner,

307
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,520
weighing in at 110 pounds,

308
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:44,319
and with a social media
reach of 12,300,

309
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,960
Daphne,
"the Ginger Jack-Hammer" Blake.

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,520
And in the other corner,

311
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,759
weighing in at "how-dare-you?"

312
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,800
And with a social media
reach of,

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,759
"she says
she's too good for it."

314
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,799
Velma, Indian middle name,
Dinkley.

315
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,320
Yay...

316
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Sit down.

317
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,400
Now let's find out
which girl is less vulnerable.

318
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:10,239
Hydrate up.
You're gonna need it
when you're crying later.

319
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Wow. I haven't seen someone
this overly confident

320
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,400
since my moms
on election day, 2016.

321
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:18,560
Really thought
Jill Stein had it.
Anyway. Fight!

322
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
What?

323
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,440
How's your stomach so hard?
Are you a robot?

324
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,400
Is that why you never shower
after gym?

325
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,160
No, my stomach's
like my lips,

326
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:29,559
soft, and a lot of weird noises
come out of it.

327
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,239
What you felt was...

328
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,200
- Wait, that's my journal.
- Yeah,

329
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,039
and I'm about to perform
the audiobook.

330
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
With voices and everything,
innit?

331
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,759
Velma, please don't do this.

332
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,119
You hurt me. I hurt you.

333
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,999
Hey, everyone.
So you all think that Daphne
is the perfect,

334
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,199
beautiful, girl-next-door,
right?

335
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,679
Well, it's a lie.

336
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,240
According to her own journal,

337
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,319
Daphne is so messed up
that she has a daily session

338
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,399
with our school
guidance counselor, Lamont.

339
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,439
to discuss her issues.

340
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,880
Guys, come on.

341
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,359
I just made Daphne vulnerable.
I win.

342
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,839
Now laugh as we watch
her precious popularity
fade away.

343
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,439
Why would we do that?

344
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,279
Mental health is no joke,
no matter how lame Lamont is.

345
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,439
Yeah. No matter
how lame I am.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,439
Daphne, Daphne!

347
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,079
Oh, no.

348
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,880
Look, Velma, the only way
you're going to avoid
suspension

349
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,839
is if you apologize
to Daphne.

350
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,359
I have to apologize?

351
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,640
She kicked me so hard,
my tubes are now tied.

352
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:45,719
Yes, but you hurt her feelings,
which is way worse these days.

353
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,759
Now, would you care
to tell me why?

354
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,800
No way. And good luck
trying to get in my head
without your cardigan, sucker.

355
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,880
Yeah, Norville told me
about your little trick.

356
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,479
Fine. I know I have to talk
to someone

357
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,280
about my feelings
for Daphne, but...

358
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,399
But my mom is the person
I talk to when I'm confused.

359
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,280
and talking to anyone else
feels like a betrayal,

360
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,559
like I'm admitting
she's gone for good.

361
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,519
I see that, but hasn't
not talking to someone else

362
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
gotten you even further
from finding her.

363
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,400
Okay. That feels smart,
but it's coming from you so...

364
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah. No,
I surprised myself there.

365
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,279
I'm really just supposed
to talk to kids about college,

366
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,400
but my point is...

367
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,200
uh...uh... Nope. Lost it.

368
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,919
I think you meant that

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,320
by refusing to figure out
my feelings for Daphne
in the beginning,

370
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,439
I just made this whole mess
with her instead.

371
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,560
That's it. You know,
a smart girl like you

372
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:43,559
would be real
Smith College material.

373
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,919
Okay, but do I still have
to apologize to Daphne?

374
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,280
I only read her journal
because she said she was
too popular for me.

375
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,559
Up to you, Velma.

376
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
But sometimes
when you're being attacked,

377
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:55,440
-the best thing to do is--
-Go limp.

378
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,800
You're right.

379
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,039
I was going to say
go for the eyes!

380
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,239
So it looks like Fred

381
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,559
isn't connected
to your mom's disappearance.
Good news, right?

382
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
No, it's terrible news.

383
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:09,359
It means my big clue
is a dead end,
and Fred is probably innocent.

384
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,119
Yeah, but isn't it
a little comforting

385
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,439
to see a rich white guy
get wrongly convicted for once?

386
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm too distracted to enjoy it.

387
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,159
I need to make things right
with Daphne.

388
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,920
Wait for me, okay?

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,999
Unless you feel like
getting me a snow cone
and immediately coming back.

390
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,680
Sure. I don't have
anything else scheduled
for right now. Oh, crap!

391
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,680
Well, 10-minute rule.
Norville is not coming.

392
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,360
Guess I'll have to channel
my childhood trauma
into becoming a lawyer

393
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:47,520
and helping my imprisoned
brothers appeal
their convictions.

394
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,920
No, nobody leaves.

395
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,159
Why does everyone think
they can stand me up?

396
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay. Riot it is.

397
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,919
What do you want, Velma?

398
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
I came to apologize.

399
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm sorry I read your journal
out loud to everyone in school.

400
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:24,479
-Velma.
-Yes, I know, I know.

401
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,159
Now you want to apologize
to me?

402
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,599
-For what?
-For saying I'm not
popular enough for you.

403
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,880
-I never said that.
-Well, someone said it.

404
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,759
-You said it
-And I meant it.

405
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,240
This has nothing to do
with popularity, Velma.

406
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,440
Do you even know
why I've been talking
to Lamont?

407
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,079
No, honestly, I just flipped
through your journal
looking for sexy stuff.

408
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,400
Bit of a snooze, IMHO.

409
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:44,119
Okay, well, I'm talking to him

410
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
because searching
for my birth parents

411
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,239
has brought up
a lot of feelings
of abandonment for me.

412
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,079
I'm sorry.

413
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,639
-When my mom--
-Exactly.

414
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,959
When your mom went missing
you abandoned me too.

415
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,119
What? Only after you got hot
and ditched me.

416
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,840
That's not true.
You shut me out first.

417
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,239
I shut everyone out.
I still haven't seen
my dentist,

418
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,639
nor do I intend to.

419
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,359
Okay, so maybe a little fault
in our falling out
lies with me?

420
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,719
And then we kissed,
and it was amazing.

421
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
But you said you didn't like me
like that and I freaked out.

422
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,520
'Cause I thought you're going
to go away again.

423
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,000
So wait, is this an apology?

424
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,640
Well, do you like me?

425
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,920
You know I do.

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,559
But I'm also, kill me,
super attracted to Fred.

427
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,319
Whoa! You do need therapy.

428
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Honestly, I think
what I really need is a friend.

429
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,560
Me, too.

430
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,999
But also,

431
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,599
-maybe a friend who fu--
-No.

432
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,160
Let's just keep it simple
and try and be friends again.

433
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,360
Yeah, you're right.

434
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:39,160
I can only obsess
over one woman at a time.

435
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,319
And right now
it has to be my mom.

436
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,480
So should we hug it out?

437
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,199
Friends hug, boobs touch,
no crotch.

438
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,839
Boobs touch, no crotch.

439
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,479
-Maybe, let's just shake. Yeah?
-Yes, love a shake.

440
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,079
Just two friends,
sharing a casual handshake.

441
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,040
Good night, friend.

442
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,759
Good night, friend.

443
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,440
Well, at least
my hallucinations
are back to normal.

444
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,160
What the hell, Norville?
You're supposed
to drive me home.

445
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,960
Now I have to walk.

446
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,919
I have literally
never been madder.

447
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,879
Hi, Dad.

448
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,080
Son, I hate to say it,
but you're not ready
for the cardigan.

449
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,640
With medium power
comes medium responsibility.

450
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,280
I know. I'm sorry.

451
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,680
Crystal Cove Insane Asylum?

452
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,440
Why is this in here?

453
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,359
What? Oh, that.
I... I... I have a friend
who works there.

454
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,359
Doctor... uh... Bad Excuse.

455
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,399
Why do you have this, Dad?

456
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,319
Son, there's something
I need to tell you

457
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
about your mother.

458
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,439
Hey, stranger.

459
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,880
Look, a cabin.

460
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,760
We can ask directions to town.

461
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,000
Ask directions?

462
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,680
I thought your nickname
was The Thief,

463
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,799
not The Puss.

464
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,200
Fine, suit yourselves.

465
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,159
Okay, now who has a phone
so I can call my driver?

466
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,600
Oh, you guys want to use
one of your drivers?

467
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,039
Freeze! Police!

468
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,440
You'll never
take me alive.

469
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,599
But why won't we
take you alive, Fred?

470
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,839
Because I wanna look tough
to impress my father.

471
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,439
<i> Go to bed.</i>
