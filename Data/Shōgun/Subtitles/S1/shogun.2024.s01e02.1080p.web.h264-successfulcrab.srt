1
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:19,142
<i>My name is John Blackthorne!</i>

2
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:21,345
I'm English,
pilot of the <i>Erasmus,</i>

3
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:22,613
a Dutch merchant vessel.

4
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,880
Lies! You're a pirate!

5
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,616
They don't know about us,
do they?

6
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:56,614
The great Lord Yoshii Toranaga
wants to meet you.

7
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,315
What does he want with me?

8
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,156
Play with your balls, maybe.
How should I know?

9
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:38,529
Hmm.

10
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:54,392
<i>This English pilot...
how do you mean</i>

11
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:55,793
he is obscene?

12
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:00,465
You know the sort.
Uh, dirty. Diseased.

13
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,032
And he's got a filthy mouth.

14
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,002
He's like a back-passage whore
of the 15th rank.

15
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,504
Know what I mean,
Father-Visitor?

16
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,475
These journals are proof
of his depravity.

17
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,342
Look, Your Eminence.

18
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,313
Sacked, slaughtered and
pillaged his way through Manila.

19
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:17,448
He's a real piece of work,
that one. Brutal savage.

20
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,967
So we show these
to the Japanese.

21
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,645
And he will be hanged
for piracy.

22
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,323
I'm afraid it may not
be so simple.

23
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,756
Despite the discord in Osaka,

24
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:29,527
Toranaga is still
president of foreign relations.

25
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,761
He's a thorough man.

26
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:34,031
I fear he'll want a complete
translation of this journal.

27
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,301
Perhaps a bit too complete.

28
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,012
I'll thank you to leave now.

29
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,985
So you know, this, uh, pirate...

30
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:57,321
he's not a man to leave
his fate with God.

31
00:09:58,522 --> 00:10:00,524
I suggest you don't, either.

32
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,933
So he knows everything
about Macao.

33
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:11,968
Christ as my witness...

34
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,254
with these <i>bushos</i>
on the verge of open war,

35
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,541
the last thing we need
is any discussion

36
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,609
of past entanglements.

37
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,280
Well, then let us
be grateful our visitor

38
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:24,448
- does not speak Japanese.
- Hm.

39
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,585
I'm going to the castle where
Toranaga has been sequestered.

40
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:32,056
I'm to translate for him
this afternoon.

41
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:33,757
Martin.

42
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,495
These are critical times
for the mission.

43
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:41,932
You will see to it
this man is not a problem.

44
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:47,931
Shit.

45
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:20,964
Good morning.

46
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:24,435
My name is Martin Alvito
of the Society of Jesus.

47
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:25,969
You must be the <i>Anjin.</i>

48
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,405
- What does that mean?
- It means "pilot."

49
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,374
The way <i>Tsuji</i> means
"translator" for me.

50
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,044
You are in the court
of Lord Yoshii Toranaga,

51
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,448
and I am the interpreter
to the Council of Regents.

52
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,016
Oh, good, so you'll
be able to twist my words

53
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:41,618
in your Portuguese favor.

54
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,030
What did you just say?

55
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,816
Exactly what you said.

56
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,601
I will translate
without prejudice.

57
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,504
Well, seeing as you're
so bloody honest,

58
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,407
perhaps you would
do me the courtesy

59
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,942
of telling him we are enemies.

60
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:06,476
Tell him yourself.

61
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,379
The Japanese word
for "enemy" is <i>teki.</i>

62
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,815
Gesture at me and say the word.

63
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,749
He will understand.

64
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,685
I may be your enemy,

65
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,889
John Blackthorne
of the <i>Erasmus...</i>

66
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,424
but I am not your assassin.

67
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,960
That you will do yourself.

68
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,477
Hm.

69
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,952
He wants to know
why we are enemies.

70
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,954
Because our countries
are at war.

71
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,261
Tell him where you're from.

72
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,528
England.

73
00:13:58,529 --> 00:13:59,830
It's an island kingdom,

74
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,299
1,000 miles north of Portugal.

75
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,482
Why are you at war
with my kingdom?

76
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,385
Because England refuses
to be intimidated by Catholics.

77
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,622
You are not Catholic?

78
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,391
There are two
Christian religions.

79
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:29,226
Protestant and Catholic.

80
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,695
We English are Protestant.

81
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,367
Yes.

82
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,970
Though I won't know for sure
till I'm dead.

83
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,851
I am not a pirate.

84
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:00,857
My ship contains
letters of marque

85
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,362
from the rulers
of a nation called Holland,

86
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,029
authorizing us to trade
in all seas.

87
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,566
And to defend ourselves against
anyone who dare stop us.

88
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,942
I cannot conceive of being
an enemy to you, Lord.

89
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:31,488
Then I would commend
my soul to God.

90
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,958
For surely I would die

91
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,528
by the hand of a <i>teki</i>

92
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:38,962
like you.

93
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,780
Move.

94
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:54,978
This is Lord General Ishido.

95
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:57,130
Toranaga's chief rival.
If you value your life,

96
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:59,283
do not say a word.

97
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,590
Bow. Fast.

98
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:03,880
You are to be detained.

99
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,384
- For how long?
- I do not know, <i>Anjin.</i>

100
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,051
But I will pray for your soul.

101
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:10,288
What have you told him,
you bastard?

102
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:11,939
This is fucking great.

103
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,506
There's clearly been some sort
of misunderstanding.

104
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,340
Where are you taking me?

105
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,509
If I've committed
some sort of offense,

106
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,878
I apologize. Apolo...

107
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,981
Do any of you people understand
a damn word I'm saying?

108
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:38,581
You, up front...
where are you taking me?

109
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,721
No, I protest this treatment!

110
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:47,758
I'm a guest of your lord,
not a prisoner.

111
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:50,460
Oh, fuck.

112
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,796
This is a mistake!

113
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:46,717
Amen.

114
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,449
The seÃ±or is real?

115
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:21,318
Who are you?

116
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:28,141
You are safe here.

117
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:29,826
Children of my flock.

118
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:32,145
Persecuted for their faith.

119
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:34,465
You speak Portuguese yet?

120
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,333
Not Portuguese.

121
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,702
Speak the truth before God.

122
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:40,821
I'm English.

123
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:42,940
The Jesuits put you
here too, then?

124
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,041
Jesuits put you here?

125
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:47,311
Oh.

126
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:02,326
You should let me
give you absolution.

127
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:06,030
Are these men all marked for death?

128
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:08,665
Death is the only
punishment here.

129
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:13,403
Father, there's been
a mistake, I...

130
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:16,741
I'm a guest of Lord Toranaga.
I'm not meant to be here.

131
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:18,543
Toranaga brought you to Osaka?

132
00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:19,643
Yes.

133
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:22,012
And I must be allowed to leave.

134
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:25,483
Dear God, you're a child
in the wilderness.

135
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,851
You don't know their games.

136
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:33,457
<i>Toranaga is a prisoner
in Osaka castle.</i>

137
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:37,327
<i>Isolated by his rivals
on the Council of Regents.</i>

138
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,997
<i>There's Sugiyama, descended from</i>

139
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:44,367
<i>the richest samurai family
in Japan.</i>

140
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,770
<i>Ohno, a feared warrior,
whose affliction</i>

141
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:50,324
<i>of leprosy led him
into the arms of the Church.</i>

142
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:53,877
<i>And Kiyama, a man
whose faith in Christ</i>

143
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:57,281
<i>is guided only
by his greed and ambition.</i>

144
00:25:57,282 --> 00:26:00,685
<i>All of them are in
the palm of Ishido,</i>

145
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,385
<i>caretaker of the castle.</i>

146
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:04,321
<i>Any day now, these men</i>

147
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:06,790
<i>will vote on Toranaga's demise.</i>

148
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:10,727
Hear me, my son.

149
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:13,730
I alone will tell you the truth.

150
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,902
If Toranaga
claimed you as an ally,

151
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:20,404
you'll never leave Japan alive.

152
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,320
Ah.

153
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,601
Toranaga was born Minowara.

154
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:48,038
A name that carries
great weight in Japan.

155
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,910
For centuries, his ancestors
dominated this country,

156
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:55,779
carrying with them
a divine mandate.

157
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:58,748
Mandate?

158
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:02,619
A title,
revered through the ages.

159
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,490
The ultimate rank
a mortal can achieve.

160
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:08,826
Shogun.

161
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:14,631
And Toranaga...
does he seek this title?

162
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:18,502
Who knows what lurks
in the heart of a Minowara.

163
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:31,582
Another soul for every hour

164
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,917
of the day.

165
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:38,422
It's nothing for you
to fear now.

166
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:40,374
You'll die a martyr.

167
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,326
On the cross, perhaps.

168
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:45,463
I'm sorry, Father,
I didn't come all this way

169
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:47,531
around the world
just to die on a cross.

170
00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:58,308
Then why did you?

171
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:00,577
You came here to wage war.

172
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:06,817
I would have stood by you.

173
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,722
I came here in '72,
clutching my rosary,

174
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,424
visions of the souls
I would save.

175
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:17,662
Then I learned the true
tenets of the cloth:

176
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:20,931
silk, gold and guns.

177
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:23,884
These Jesuits care nothing
for their souls.

178
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:26,838
They've made an idol
of that cursed Black Ship.

179
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,041
That's how they dominate trade.

180
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:33,343
The Chinese hate Japan.

181
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,413
So all trade goes
through the Portuguese.

182
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:36,980
It's usury.

183
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:40,551
The late <i>Taiko</i> even tried
to put a stop to it,

184
00:32:40,552 --> 00:32:43,220
but the Church had
incited the rebellion,

185
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:45,890
smuggled guns from
that secret base in Macao.

186
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,408
Macao.

187
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:48,925
Mm.

188
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,529
I met a man who said
he'd been to that fortress,

189
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,830
said there were
Japanese soldiers...

190
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:54,931
hundreds of them...

191
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,500
all converted to Catholicism.

192
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,469
You're telling me
the lords here don't know?

193
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,305
It's too late for that now.

194
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:04,742
You don't understand.
I must tell them.

195
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:06,476
That's my way out.

196
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:08,562
You can't play their game.

197
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:10,989
Their rules are too opaque,

198
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,417
their hearts too guarded.

199
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:14,885
You don't know me.

200
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,754
I've known a thousand of you.

201
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:41,512
How many different ways
I can tell you I don't give a shit?

202
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:43,347
Hurry up, let's go!

203
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,233
Fuck!

204
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:47,643
Ugh.

205
00:33:47,644 --> 00:33:49,199
Come on.

206
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,754
Let's go.

207
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:52,657
You and Carlos have to get
your stories straight.

208
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,525
He told me you had
the manifest. Fuck off.

209
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,267
On your way
to the castle, Father?

210
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:05,536
Good morning, Captain.

211
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:07,655
As you know...

212
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:09,773
I've had no word.

213
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:10,974
As soon as Toranaga calls on me

214
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:13,578
to permit the Black Ship
to depart,

215
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,778
you'll be the first to know.

216
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:17,781
That's what
I'm worried about, see.

217
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:20,051
Hearing the old monkey's
not long for this world.

218
00:34:20,052 --> 00:34:22,519
The Church is doing all it can

219
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,856
to keep your business
running on time.

220
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,824
You mean our business.

221
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:33,631
Cock-sucking prig.

222
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:13,304
And which is your
stronger tongue, now...

223
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:15,338
Portuguese or Latin?

224
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:17,809
I have more occasion
to practice Portuguese.

225
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,810
But it comes slowly.

226
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:22,246
To this day,
you remain my best pupil.

227
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:27,752
Though I must admit my surprise.

228
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,286
Seeing you yesterday,

229
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:31,621
Toranaga involving you
in his affairs.

230
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:33,390
I do not wish to
translate anymore.

231
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:35,693
I do not like this man,
the way he speaks to you.

232
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:38,062
You have always
had good instincts

233
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:40,431
about those with bad intentions.

234
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,436
Lady Maria.

235
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,241
The dark thoughts you have
confessed to me in the past.

236
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,644
Are they still with you?

237
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,949
I trust you know I pray for you.

238
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:01,919
On this matter and others.

239
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,721
Especially with the heretic.

240
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:07,757
I've read his journals.

241
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:09,660
Whatever your heart
tells you about him...

242
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,530
...he is guilty of worse.

243
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,854
Ah...

244
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:41,852
Oh...

245
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:44,375
Your confession, say it quickly.

246
00:39:44,376 --> 00:39:45,575
No, this can't be.

247
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:48,545
I'm not supposed to die here.

248
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:50,714
The Blessed Virgin
is watching over you now.

249
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:52,884
Confess before me,
all sins past and present.

250
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:54,918
You go with your God, Father.

251
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:14,672
Dear Lord,

252
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:17,224
forgive me my pride.

253
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,777
Let this not be my end.

254
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:21,979
I beg you.

255
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,665
Oh?

256
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:05,609
Ah.

257
00:43:11,615 --> 00:43:13,317
Toranaga.

258
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,473
Good morning, seÃ±or.

259
00:43:36,474 --> 00:43:39,477
I am to be your interpreter
for today.

260
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:40,777
You speak Portuguese?

261
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:42,747
It is my honor
to learn the language

262
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:44,549
of my Christian teachers.

263
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,316
Catholic teachers.

264
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:50,421
I serve Yoshii Toranaga-sama.

265
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,890
My name is Toda Mariko.

266
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:55,959
John Blackthorne.

267
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,595
And you should know
I'm not Catholic.

268
00:44:07,338 --> 00:44:08,906
My lord would like to say
that he is sorry

269
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,808
for the time
you spent in prison.

270
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:16,380
I'm grateful to be alive.

271
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:30,009
He asks about your country.

272
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,595
Your rulers and customs.

273
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:38,469
Just this morning, I was...

274
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,404
set for death and...

275
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:42,539
and now, um...

276
00:44:43,674 --> 00:44:46,510
I know I am considered...

277
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:49,347
an enemy, in your country.

278
00:44:49,348 --> 00:44:51,182
But assure you

279
00:44:51,183 --> 00:44:53,284
my queen is wise.

280
00:44:53,285 --> 00:44:55,385
And thoughtful.

281
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:57,654
And would want to be your ally.

282
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:19,811
My master asks for you
to draw a map of the world.

283
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:21,879
Oh.

284
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:25,816
Thank you.

285
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:45,235
Um...

286
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:48,539
This is the limit...

287
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,407
of what I know.

288
00:45:51,742 --> 00:45:53,744
The earth is round.

289
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:55,646
Like a fruit.

290
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,685
Uh, Japan is here.

291
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:03,954
My country, England...

292
00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:05,422
is on the other side
of the world.

293
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:13,397
We came by way
of Magellan's Pass.

294
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,902
We are the first outsiders
to use it

295
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:20,972
because the Spanish
and the Portuguese

296
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:22,573
kept it secret.

297
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,746
And for us, it was safer
to sail this way.

298
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:34,519
Because we had to avoid
a Portuguese base

299
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,853
in Macao.

300
00:46:46,697 --> 00:46:48,999
It employs Japanese mercenaries.

301
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,301
I'm told you call them ronin.

302
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:54,906
A secret Catholic fortress,
used for gunrunning.

303
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:57,608
Employed during an uprising
some years ago.

304
00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:22,767
My master asks that, later,
you write this map

305
00:47:22,768 --> 00:47:24,685
and mark the Portuguese bases.

306
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:26,603
If I may, I will explain now.

307
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,577
This is the way Portugal and
Spain carved up the New World.

308
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:36,279
70 years ago,
they signed a treaty

309
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,549
that split undiscovered land
between them.

310
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,684
Your country falls...

311
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:44,422
...into the Portuguese half.

312
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:46,523
So it belongs to them.

313
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,652
I'm sorry, sir, but...

314
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:18,588
I assure you their arrogance
is unbelievable.

315
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:21,892
Please tell him it's written
into legal documents.

316
00:48:21,893 --> 00:48:24,595
Each Spanish and Portuguese king
has the right to lay claim

317
00:48:24,596 --> 00:48:26,630
to any non-Catholic land
they discover

318
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:29,033
and to replace its government
with Catholic rule.

319
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,501
This is a lie.

320
00:48:31,502 --> 00:48:32,636
No.

321
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:36,407
Do you swear by your God?

322
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:38,575
Yes, I do.

323
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:08,672
He asks what you seek here.

324
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:13,744
To vanquish our common enemies.

325
00:49:26,857 --> 00:49:28,726
My master says
you should not war against

326
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:30,927
the Portuguese in Japan.

327
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:33,363
You are outnumbered.
It is hopeless.

328
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,605
Unless I win.

329
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:21,411
his personal quarters.

330
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:23,413
This is a great honor

331
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:25,415
I hope you will enjoy.

332
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:31,054
Is that his?

333
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,457
That battle armor
was ordered specially

334
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:36,828
by Toranaga-sama
after he saw it in a dream.

335
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:39,680
Its style goes back
many generations.

336
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:42,533
All the way
to the Minowara Shogunate.

337
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:46,336
Shogun.

338
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:54,978
I wanted to thank you

339
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:56,781
for translating so honestly
on my behalf today.

340
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:59,483
No thanks are necessary.

341
00:50:59,484 --> 00:51:01,819
My efforts are in service
of my lord.

342
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:04,622
How long have you
spoken Portuguese?

343
00:51:04,623 --> 00:51:06,556
14 years.

344
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:08,559
As long as I've been
a Christian.

345
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,828
Well, you speak very well.

346
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:12,396
Hm.

347
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:15,967
These women can assist you
in preparation for your bath.

348
00:51:15,968 --> 00:51:17,785
Uh, thank you, but...

349
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:19,762
I've already bathed.

350
00:51:19,763 --> 00:51:21,618
Oh. In the prison?

351
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:23,473
No, in the village.

352
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:26,043
But that was some time ago.

353
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:27,978
What, two...

354
00:51:27,979 --> 00:51:30,447
two baths in a week?

355
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:31,968
What, do you want me
to catch the flux?

356
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,960
Wait, Mariko.

357
00:51:45,997 --> 00:51:48,299
I know you hold these priests
in high regard,

358
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,601
but I beg you to consider
their motives.

359
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:52,703
Your lord is in danger.

360
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:56,707
And I have a ship.

361
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:01,445
I would advise against
speaking out of turn.

362
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,980
Yes.

363
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:06,316
Oh, and...

364
00:52:06,317 --> 00:52:09,620
you will please address me
as Mariko-sama.

<i>Martin Alvito has just
received word</i>

366
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:49,586
from Toranaga.

367
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:52,556
He's denied our departure papers
for the Black Ship.

368
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:56,627
This God-cursed heretic
doesn't even have the decency

369
00:53:56,628 --> 00:53:58,695
to ruin us slowly.

370
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:02,800
Let this be my burden, Father.

371
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,411
No!

He has made you hatamoto, which
is a very great honor.

374
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,562
We should not be seen together.

375
00:59:37,332 --> 00:59:38,867
It is war.
