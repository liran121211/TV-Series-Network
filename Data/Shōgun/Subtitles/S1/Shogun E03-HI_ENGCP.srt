1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,226
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on </i>Shogun<i>.</i>

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,809
[in English] My name is Toda Mariko.
I am to be your interpreter.

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,042
[in Japanese] He claims there is
a Portuguese base in Macao.

4
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:20,083
What do you seek in Japan?

5
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,375
[in English]
To vanquish our common enemies.

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:26,625
Lord Toranaga invited Mother
to meet a barbarian.

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,333
If you had this barbarian,

8
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,624
and a vassal to control him,

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,250
things might be different.

10
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,166
You do have a way

11
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,583
of being in the right place
at the right time.

12
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,292
[in English] I found this on your ship.

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,583
We show these to the Japanese
and he will be hanged for piracy.

14
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,708
[in Japanese]
There's so much I don't know.

15
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,541
Perhaps we should learn more
about these bases

16
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,833
before negotiating further arrangements.

17
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:54,708
[in English] He's denied
our departure papers for the <i>Black Ship</i>.

18
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,750
Let this be my burden, Father.

19
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,875
[grunts]

20
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,208
[in Japanese]
The assassin didn't come for me.

21
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,458
[pants, grunts]

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,917
She came for him.

23
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,833
[chuckles]

24
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,792
It's a good will.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,917
Our best yet.

26
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,250
[squire] Will it really be today?

27
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,708
[sighs]

28
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,667
Your sword.

29
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,750
You heard about last night's attack?

30
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:36,833
What do you know
about the society of the Amida?

31
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,625
[inhales deeply]

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,542
Only what everyone knows.

33
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,833
They are assassins.

34
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,292
Sworn by the most sacred oaths
of the Buddha Amida.

35
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,792
And for my head…

36
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,958
What might you pay?

37
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,000
[door closes]

38
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,500
[breathes deeply]

39
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,708
You've decided to take my life, fine.

40
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:23,625
Let's be done.

41
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:30,125
Aren't you my reliable friend?

42
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,542
Or has Ishido poured poison in your ear?

43
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,458
I'm told he visited your home.

44
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,750
What was his offer?

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,750
Your seat on the Council.

46
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,667
Did it interest you?

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,792
[chuckles]

48
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,833
Absolutely not.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,417
Then what do you want?

50
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,583
The Suruga Province.

51
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:05,917
To expand my fief.

52
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:12,583
But I'd need my head to rule.

53
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,125
You shall keep it.

54
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,417
The assassin was sent to kill the Anjin.

55
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,875
So for their safety,
I need the Anjin and Lady Kiri

56
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,625
brought to your fishing village in Ajiro.

57
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:36,958
Do this,

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,833
and Suruga is yours.

59
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,167
And what will you do here?

60
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,708
Watch the morning with me.

61
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,917
[Martin, in English]
My apologies, Captain-General.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,083
But your <i>Black Ship</i> must stay where it is.

63
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,125
Toranaga has come to better understand

64
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,292
the great profits being made
from our monopoly over the China trade.

65
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,833
He has invited us to provide a report
on our rates of exchange.

66
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:02,583
You… [stammers] …men of the cloth
with your impotent pricks.

67
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:06,208
We bring the profits. We dictate terms.

68
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,458
And we are here at their pleasure.

69
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:13,000
Until Toranaga receives this report,
you won't get clearance to leave.

70
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:18,417
I am sitting on one million ducats
that has to get to Macao.

71
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,792
I won't lose this wind.

72
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:25,667
That pilot should have been taken care of
before he even reached Osaka.

73
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,917
Captain, you forget yourself.

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,125
And you forget I don't work
for the Church. I work for the Crown.

75
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:40,042
Let it be known
the <i>Black Ship</i> sails tonight.

76
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,375
[groans]

77
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,042
Get all the cargo on board.
We're leaving anyway.

78
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,583
H-Hey, hey. [grunting]

79
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,542
We... We leave without clearance,
we don't get invited back.

80
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,958
The longer we sit around,
the worse that pilot makes it for us.

81
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,083
We're on the wind tonight.

82
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,292
A pilot?

83
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,125
[chuckles]
He's still alive. I'll be fucked.

84
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,708
[Blackthorne] He's going to bleed me then.

85
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,792
I'm sorry? I do not understand.

86
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,917
This warlock here.

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,875
He aims to bleed me to release
the foulness from my blood. [winces]

88
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:22,333
I'm not familiar with this warlock,
but I can assure you this man is a doctor

89
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,917
- who cares for the sick and injured.
- [winces]

90
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,917
[in Japanese] Please hold still.

91
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,684
[in English]
What's been said about the assassin?

92
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,583
Only that she belonged
to a very dangerous sect.

93
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,667
[Blackthorne groans]

94
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,042
She had served as a palace maid for years.

95
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,292
Some train their whole lives
for a single kill.

96
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,375
It is very costly.

97
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
[Blackthorne] A price few could afford.

98
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,958
You refuse… [grunts] …to see it,

99
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,250
what those priests
are capable of even now.

100
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:52,458
Christ! [groans]

101
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,165
How much are the Jesuits
paying this one to kill me?

102
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
[in Japanese] He's too tense.

103
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:00,708
He doesn't need a doctor...

104
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,917
He needs a woman.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,875
"<i>Onago ja</i>." What did he say?
What did the warlock say?

106
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,667
Since you are so upset,

107
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,542
the doctor suggests we send a woman
to pillow with you instead.

108
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,125
Pillow?

109
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:22,042
Uh, it is polite for the physical joining
of a man and woman.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,500
[grunts] If he's not a warlock,
he's most certainly a pimp.

111
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,958
Would you prefer a male companion?

112
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,042
Dear God, where am I?

113
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,500
[in English] Who's he?

114
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,135
[in Japanese]
Is the animal behaving himself?

115
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,542
Yes, Buntaro.

116
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,333
We're leaving Osaka immediately.

117
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,375
The barbarian is to join us.

118
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,792
Where are we going?

119
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,958
Back to Ajiro,
with members of Toranaga's clan.

120
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,332
I don't understand...

121
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,625
It's not for you to understand.

122
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,083
[sliding door closes]

123
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
[sniffles]

124
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,083
[gasps]

125
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,250
Thank you for this gift of their remains.

126
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,167
I'm grateful, Grandfather.

127
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,583
There's a party leaving for Ajiro tonight.

128
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,750
Our lord commands you to join them.

129
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:45,208
Your father gave his life
for those swords.

130
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,625
In Korea,
we fought until we were as good as dead,

131
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,500
and then we kept fighting.

132
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,125
Those are the swords of a samurai.

133
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry for your husband and baby.

134
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:10,125
But they died because
they belonged to a greater fight.

135
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,250
And now…

136
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,042
it's your turn.

137
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,125
[samurai speak Japanese]

138
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,957
We'll move around the city
by cover of the forest,

139
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,038
then regroup at the galley.

140
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,292
Expect a fight.

141
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,875
There are many who want the Anjin dead.

142
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,458
[samurai speaks Japanese]

143
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,625
Your father isn't coming?

144
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,292
He insists on staying.

145
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,250
Then it's goodbye for good.

146
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,542
Lord, your will.

147
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,250
Not today.

148
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:53,042
[in English] May I at least speak
with Toranaga before we go?

149
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,542
I'm afraid it will not be possible.

150
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,018
[in Japanese]
The barbarian will walk beside the litter,

151
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,708
and remain within sight.

152
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,917
[in English] Yabushige-<i>sama</i> asks that
you stay close to the litter as we walk.

153
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,542
[in Japanese] Mother!

154
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,083
Please don't go.

155
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,917
You'll be brought to your
grandfather's castle, where it's safer.

156
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,708
You're not a suckling child!

157
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,458
Go back inside.

158
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,833
What is Kiri no kata doing?

159
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,417
Coming, Hiromatsu.

160
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm a tired old woman.

161
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,833
You must forgive me.

162
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,792
On any other day I would.

163
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,125
I wish I could leave this prison with you.

164
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,000
When I see you again,
your child will be here.

165
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,083
[Hiromatsu] This is taking too long…

166
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,500
[speaks Japanese]

167
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,792
Hurry. You should be on your way.

168
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,018
Lord! There's someone at the gate!

169
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,625
[samurai] Someone's coming!

170
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,875
It's Lord Ishido!

171
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,542
[grunting]

172
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,750
[sighs]

173
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,833
[grunts]

174
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,500
A fine afternoon, Yabushige.

175
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,000
I was just informed
the barbarian was leaving Osaka.

176
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,750
And Kiri no kata as well.

177
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,958
A surprise, I must say.

178
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,122
[Yabushige speaks Japanese]

179
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,250
With all due respect...

180
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,458
Lady Kiri is not a hostage
who begs favors.

181
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,874
She's free to come and go.

182
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,916
This is true,

183
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,125
but your father and I agreed on protocol
during his visit.

184
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:08,250
A day's notice
before the departure of high people,

185
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,167
so I can pay respects.

186
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,583
Jozen. Proceed with the inspection.

187
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,500
Grays are forbidden through this gate!

188
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,917
That's agreed by protocol.

189
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
You haven't even seen a battle,

190
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,333
you brazen brat.

191
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,208
Why not here?

192
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,833
- Why not now?
- [laughs]

193
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:33,167
A misunderstanding, I'm sure.

194
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:39,625
Lord Ishido honors us
by paying his respects.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,208
Let him through.

196
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,875
Excuse me.

197
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:01,958
[Ishido speaks Japanese]

198
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,583
Lady Kiri.

199
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,708
Sorry to see you go.

200
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,833
And I'm sad to leave,

201
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,583
but my lord says
there are too many assassins in Osaka.

202
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,750
I feel the same way.

203
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,333
I'm told the barbarian
was attacked last night.

204
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,583
I'll have Jozen and my men
escort you to the galley.

205
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,457
That won't be necessary.

206
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,042
As protector of Osaka Castle, I insist.

207
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,476
- [Shizu grunts]
- [servant speaks Japanese]

208
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,542
- [samurai speaks Japanese]
- [Shizu groans]

209
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,333
[servant] Here, sit down.

210
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,458
Lady Shizu is having pains again.

211
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,916
[Shizu] I'm all right, really…

212
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,999
[servant] The doctor said
she needed more rest.

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,749
[Shizu pants] Please don't worry.

214
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,292
[servant] She's in her final weeks!

215
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,583
[servant, Shizu speak Japanese]

216
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,708
I'm fine.

217
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,625
Well, everything's in order.

218
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,708
[speaks Japanese]

219
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,625
I wish you a safe journey.

220
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,417
[horses approaching]

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,667
Lord Ishido was confused
by your sudden departure.

222
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:42,750
No doubt he understands
I must serve my pledge to Toranaga.

223
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,583
And please remind your lord,
I keep my promises.

224
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,458
Well done.

225
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,292
[sighs]

226
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,417
Now…

227
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,583
it's in the hands of the gods.

228
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,583
[in English] Did you know?

229
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,875
I think no one knows.

230
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,167
My lord is famous for his trickery.

231
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:27,625
When he was six years old,
his father traded him to a rival <i>busho</i>.

232
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,583
As a hostage, he learned one truth.

233
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,000
That enemies are everywhere
and friends, nowhere.

234
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,083
To show your true heart
is to risk your life.

235
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:39,917
What happens if he's found?

236
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,375
He will be killed. And all of us.

237
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,208
Hold them at the gate!

238
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,583
I need to verify all members of the party.

239
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,208
Lord Ishido cleared us to depart.

240
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,667
It is Lord Ishido's order.

241
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,375
[groans]

242
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,917
All travelers are to be verified.

243
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,333
[travelers murmur]

244
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,167
- [in English] No one's going to stop him?
- [guard speaks Japanese]

245
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,458
[door closes]

246
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,308
[in English] No one's going to stop him.

247
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,375
This is unacceptable.

248
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,375
Peering into ladies' private quarters?
It's not proper!

249
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,125
What is the barbarian saying?

250
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,250
[in English] Worse than that, it's vulgar!

251
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,875
Unholy perversion!

252
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,505
[in Japanese]
I think the barbarian is offended.

253
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:51,624
In his country it is improper to…
leer at women.

254
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,000
This is Japan!

255
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,958
[in English] Am I the only man present
who treasures the purity of a woman?

256
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,458
- [grunts]
- [gasps, breathes shakily]

257
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,318
[in Japanese] You must excuse him.

258
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,417
He's ignorant of our customs.

259
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,958
[grunts, shouts]

260
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,167
[in English]
A woman's virtue is her glory!

261
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,042
A blight on us all!
My God, the shame of it.

262
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,457
[in Japanese]
His customs are very different,

263
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,333
and I find it's very hard to reach him…

264
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,542
[in English]
You, sir, are a silly little man.

265
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,958
And your hair looks
like the tail of a pony!

266
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,687
[in Japanese] What is this buffoonery?

267
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,292
Lord Ishido has ordered us all
to the harbor.

268
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,750
Let them through.

269
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,917
- [horse whinnies]
- [samurai speaks Japanese]

270
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,893
[in English] Well, I hope he didn't mind
the part about the pony.

271
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,833
[sighs]

272
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,917
[in Japanese] This is the man
we're risking our lives for…

273
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,125
[in English] What happens when
Ishido's men learn who they are escorting?

274
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,292
I'm certain my lord has a plan.

275
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:56,667
Is it true what you said
about the purity of women in your country?

276
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,125
Christ, no.

277
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,750
Foul slatterns and trollops
everywhere in London.

278
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:07,792
Like your doctor friend,
whoring women to injured guests.

279
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,167
[chuckles]

280
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,958
You yourself insinuating that I would have
an interest in casual buggery.

281
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:16,125
We think pillowing is necessary
to good health.

282
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,083
In fact, some say

283
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:22,625
the moment of the clouds and the rain
is as near to heaven as they can get.

284
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,083
The clouds and the rain.

285
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,833
- It means...
- Thank you, I understand the metaphor.

286
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,125
I've just never heard it
put so poetically.

287
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,625
Especially by a married woman.

288
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,250
I'm assuming that man's your husband.

289
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:42,708
Yes. His name is Toda Hirokatsu.

290
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,667
Though friends call him Buntaro. He's, uh…

291
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,167
a strong and admired warrior.

292
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,958
- And the boy your only child?
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,625
Do you have children?

294
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,708
Yes.

295
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:04,583
My boy Tudor and my daughter Elizabeth.

296
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,958
And what are they like?

297
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,958
[sighs]

298
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,875
[arrow whistling]

299
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,667
- [grunts]
- [travelers gasp]

300
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,708
- [Mariko gasps]
- [Buntaro shouts in Japanese]

301
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,708
[Blackthorne, in English] Get down! Fast!

302
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,167
- [breathes heavily]
- [arrow whistling]

303
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,458
[grunts]

304
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,208
[samurai shouts]

305
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,184
- They're on the ridge.
- [samurai 2 speaks Japanese]

306
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,292
[grunts]

307
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,208
- [in English] Is it Ishido-<i>sama</i>?
- [pants]

308
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,250
No, I do not think so.

309
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,000
- [gunshot]
- [samurai speaks Japanese]

310
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,958
[samurai 2 shouts in Japanese]

311
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:38,750

[grunts]

314
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,833
Father…?!

315
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,167
[servant whimpers]

316
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,917
- [grunts]
- [ambusher 2 yelps]

317
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,208
[grunts]

318
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,675
[in English]
Get back before we're all killed.

319
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,167
[samurai 3 shouts in Japanese]

320
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,458
It's the Christians.

321
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,625
They've come again for the Anjin.

322
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,750
[samurai 2 speaks Japanese]

323
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:29,042
Lord Kiyama...
Ishido's men are down there too!

324
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,708
Then they'll die with the heretic.

325
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:35,458
- [samurai 2 speaks Japanese]
- [samurai shouting]

326
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,792
Here they come.

327
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,083
[samurai grunting]

328
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,875
It's Toranaga…

329
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,500
We've been betrayed!

330
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,625
Lord Jozen...

331
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,249
Toranaga was hiding in the caravan!

332
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,792
He's here!

333
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,292
Huh?

334
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,250
Don't let Toranaga get away!

335
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,250
[Jozen grunts, speaks Japanese]

336
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,083
[samurai grunting, shouting]

337
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:09,667
[in English] We have to help him.

338
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,250
[grunting]

339
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,042

[ambusher 3 shouts, grunts]

342
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,667
[in Japanese]
Are they… fighting each other?

343
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,667
Something isn't right…

344
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,167
[samurai grunting]

345
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:42,083
[ambusher 4 grunts, yelps]

346
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,958
[panting]

347
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,666
One of these days

348
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,667
I'd like to know about your plan
before it happens.

349
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,875
I'll keep it in mind.

350
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,667
Lord Ishido must be informed!

351
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:57,622
[samurai 4 speaks Japanese]

352
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,042

00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,000
- [shouting]
- [Mariko grunting]

356
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,042
[grunting]

357
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:18,458
Hurry to the ship!

358
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,750
We'll hold them off here

359
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,250
and catch up to you later.

360
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:24,708
[grunts]

361
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,375
Alert the men in the harbor.

362
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,417
The heretic is on his way.

363
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,083
[speaks Japanese]

364
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,726
[Blackthorne, in English] To the galley
while we still have the chance.

365
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,542
[Mariko] Wait, this crew may be hostile
to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

366
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,458
[indistinct chattering]

367
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,625
[Blackthorne] Well, I'll be damned.
I know this crew.

368
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,250
You think I'm friendless?

369
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,708
[pants] Captain-<i>sama</i>.

370
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,042
[in Japanese] Anjin!

371
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,125
[chuckles]

372
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,292
[in English]
We sailed together out of Ajiro.

373
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,292
Is that what I think it is?

374
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:10,042
The Portuguese <i>Black Ship</i>.
Their trading vessel.

375
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,083
[Blackthorne] Ready the oars.

376
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,917
What was that damn word again? Ah!

377
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,542
[in Japanese] Now, row.

378
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,458
[ambusher 5] Toranaga is escaping Osaka!

379
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,917
Everyone get to the harbor!

380
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,083
[ambushers shouting]

381
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,833
[ambusher 5 speaks Japanese]

382
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,667
Wait!

383
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,917
Buntaro! He's coming!

384
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,393
[in English] We got to go back.

385
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,458
We must continue on!

386
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,695
[in English] Oh, for Christ's sake,
he could still make it.

387
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,917
[ambusher 6 speaks Japanese]

388
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:25,958
[Buntaro grunts]

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
[grunts]

390
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:49,792
[panting]

391
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,500
[in Japanese] Toda Hirokatsu!

392
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,458
[breathes shakily]

393
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,292
[shouts]

394
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,208
[ambushers shout]

395
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:42,083
[Buntaro shouting, grunting]

396
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,250
Lose the rowboats and sound the drum.

397
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,167
There's no time to spare.

398
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,250
[samurai speaks Japanese]

399
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,083
[samurai speak Japanese]

400
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,458
[samurai 2 speaks Japanese]

401
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,122
[samurai 3 speaks Japanese]

402
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,458
[samurai 4 speaks Japanese]

403
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,167
- [in English] Ah, Mariko-<i>sama</i>.
- [samurai 3 speaks Japanese]

404
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,375
- [in English] Do they fish at night here?
- [samurai 4 speaks Japanese]

405
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:29,958
Toranaga was with them all along.

406
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,417
Yabushige betrayed us.

407
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,957
Those boats blocking their escape…

408
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,833
are they Kiyama's men?

409
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,434
[in English] If we attempted
to break through those men

410
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,792
- would they board and attack us?
- Yes.

411
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,125
Then we're sunk.

412
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,208
[in Japanese] We die.

413
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,958
[in English] But they can't sink her.

414
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,413
[in Japanese]
He wants us to approach the Black Ship.

415
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,750
Towards that carrack!

416
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,167
[in English]
If you leave without clearance,

417
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,458
you will ruin any chance
we have left at diplomacy.

418
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,542
I will ruin more than that with pleasure.

419
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,875
This is not a debate, Captain-General.

420
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,083
It is in your best interest
to follow protocol.

421
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:27,208
Captain-General,
it's, uh, quite a show upstairs.

422
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,292
Might want to see it.

423
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,792
[speaking indistinctly]

424
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:51,500
Ahoy, <i>Inglés</i>! [chuckles]
Still alive, I see!

425
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,917
How's your leg?

426
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,583
[Rodrigues] Fine! How's your mother?

427
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,625
- Dead!
- Ah.

428
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:05,333
Behold, I bring you Lord Yoshii Toranaga,
who seeks an audience!

429
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:09,875
Ferrying around the man himself!
It's one way to die!

430
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,833
[chuckles]

431
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,042
[Martin] Toranaga claims
the men in fishing boats are pirates.

432
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,765
He requests an escort through the harbor.

433
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,708
[in Japanese]
If your Black Ship protects my galley,

434
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,333
you have my permission
to leave Osaka harbor.

435
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:37,101
[in English] He's giving clearance
for the <i>Black Ship</i> to leave Osaka.

436
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,417
[scoffs] Thank him for permission
I don't need,

437
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,042
but the price just went up.

438
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,958
[in Japanese]
The Captain feels this is not enough.

439
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,625
[Toranaga scoffs]

440
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,375
In that spirit, how about this…

441
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,124
When the Black Ship leaves Macao,

442
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,917
it will carry
ten thousand tael silver coins for me

443
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,667
to invest in the silk trade.

444
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,667
Half the profit would be his.

445
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,708
[Martin, in English] Toranaga offers you
10,000 silver coins to invest.

446
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:09,052
- [chuckles]
- He would retain half the profit.

447
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,375
Yes.

448
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,250
[Toranaga] Hmm.

449
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,375
[in Japanese] Also Tsuji,
I offer something to you.

450
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,417
In my home city of Edo,

451
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,292
I will allow the construction
of a Christian church.

452
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,708
[in English]
He's giving us a church in Edo.

453
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,207
[in Japanese] In exchange,

454
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:32,000
I need your help
with Lords Kiyama and Ohno.

455
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,583
How do you mean?

456
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,250
They are allied with Ishido right now.

457
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,667
I need you to bring them to my side.

458
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:47,309
[in English] He asks us to turn
the Christian lords in his favor.

459
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,208
That is bribery. And impossible.

460
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,708
Eminence, it is a church in Edo.

461
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,958
We will not compel men by faith.

462
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:58,458
Especially not on this man's behalf.

463
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,917
Although, we could suggest such an idea.

464
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,875
Prayerfully, of course.

465
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,125
[slurping]

466
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:13,083
[in Japanese]
The Father-Visitor pledges his assistance.

467
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,333
Fine.

468
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:22,333
Now rid me of these pirates
so I may leave Osaka.

469
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:28,125
[Captain, in English]
There is just one more thing.

470
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,792
That English pilot, he stays behind.

471
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,583
[in Japanese] He asks that
you leave the heretic in Osaka.

472
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,583
The Anjin is my guest.

473
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,333
[Martin speaks Japanese]

474
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,125
I must warn you
about this man you've taken in.

475
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,458
He is not the merchant he claims to be.

476
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,667
[in English] Well done, Martin.

477
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,917
We will be able to hold him
to that promise of a church.

478
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,125
Even after he is dead.

479
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:12,833
[in Japanese] All lords and ladies
are to be brought to the Portuguese ship.

480
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,375
And our guns?

481
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,750
Lord Toranaga has been forced
to abandon them.

482
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,917
And the Anjin.

483
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,250
[distant shouting]

484
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,750
[in English] The <i>Black Ship
</i>will bring us out of Osaka.

485
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,792
But you must stay.

486
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,333
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:39,208
[samurai speak Japanese]

488
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,208
[sailors speak indistinctly]

489
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,017
[sailor, in English] Tie down that line.

490
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,375
[sailors shouting]

491
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,417
Fuck this.

492
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,250
Captain-<i>sama</i>, sound the drums.

493
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,167
[in Japanese] Sound the drum!

494
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,167
[sailors speaking Japanese]

495
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,792
[sailor speaks Japanese, grunts]

496
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,333
[sailors continue speaking Japanese]

497
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,625
[sailors grunting]

498
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,667
[shouting indistinctly]

499
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,958
[sailor 2, in English] Hoist it up!

500
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,250
Come on! I thought you were sailors!
Race them out!

501
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,208
[speaks broken Japanese]

502
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,750
He means 'faster'!

503
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,833
[sailors grunting]

504
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,917
[sailor 3, in English]
Sir, he's coming up alongside us.

505
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,000
[sailor 4] H-Hey! Steady!

506
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,208
How fast can that bitch go, Rodrigues,

507
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:22,208
you black-eyed son
of a shit-festered whore?

508
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,792
Your lips are on the devil's arse!

509
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,542
They're on your mother's first!

510
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,625
[chuckles]
Might even miss the son of a bitch.

511
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,125
He gets any closer, sink him!

512
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,875
[chuckling] With pleasure, Captain.

513
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:43,375
[whispers indistinctly]

514
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,042
[speaking Japanese]

515
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,750
[laughs]

516
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,500
[sailors shouting indistinctly]

517
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,250
They'll never get through, Lord.

518
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:07,292
[sailors speaking indistinctly]

519
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,375
[sailors grunting]

520
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,917
[in Japanese] He's mad.

521
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,167
[sailor shouts indistinctly]

522
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:20,208
[sailors continue grunting]

523
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:25,292
- [in English] Five points to port.
- Aye, sir. Five points to port!

524
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,708
- [sailor 5] Five points!
- [sailor 6] Go watch the gulch!

525
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,375
Five points it is.

526
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,667
[ambushers shouting]

527
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,083
- [ambusher shouting in Japanese]
- [laughs]

[ambusher 2 shouts]

529

00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,417
[in English] My sincerest gratitude!

531
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:59,875
My sincerest "fuck yourself!"

532
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,833
I warned you once, Rodrigues.
They'll never keep me here!

533
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,208
You're not out yet, you salty whale's tit!

534
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,417
[in Japanese] Anjin!

535
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:09,958
Look out!

536
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,500
[sailor 7 speaks Japanese]

537
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:20,875
[laughs, in English]
Let's see him ride out of this one.

538
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,167
[breathes deeply]

539
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,292
[sailors grunting]

540
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,708
[in Japanese] Hurry! Hurry!

541
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,458
[grunting continues]

542
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,184
- [in English] Bring him over broadside!
- [sailor 8] Maintain speed, maintain!

543
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,292
Damage the hull, Captain.

544
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,750
[sailor shout indistinctly]

545
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,417
- Five more points!
- [sailor 9] Hold steady!

546
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,667
[sailor 10]
They're going to crash into the shores!

547
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,750
[sailors grunting]

548
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,958
Either sink me or let me pass,
but make up your fucking mind.

549
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,417
[sailors shouting, groaning]

550
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,042
[laughs]

551
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,875
By Christ's blood, Captain-<i>sama</i>!

552
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:30,167
[shouts] What the hell are you doing?
You're giving him the edge!

553
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,875
No. No, he already had it.

554
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,167
[in Japanese] He did it!

555
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,542
[chuckles]

556
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:42,000
Well done, you glorious bastards!

557
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,708
- Yes! Yes!
- [stomping on floor]

558
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,625
Well done, you glorious bastards!

559
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,292
Well done!

560
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,250
That's a debt repaid.

561
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,375
God be with you. You'll need him.

562
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,375
[chuckles]

563
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,250
[in Japanese] It appears they got through.

564
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,417
[samurai speak Japanese]

565
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:17,792
Mariko.

566
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:21,417
Please thank the Captain-General
for the use of his ship.

567
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,958
But seeing as my pilot has left Osaka,

568
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,708
I'll now return to my galley.

569
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:38,125
Men wish to conduct their affairs
with the blade, I do not object.

570
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:44,458
But when there's violence in the city
I swore to protect

571
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,333
I consider it a personal affront.

572
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,083
I share your outrage over last night.

573
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,125
Too many bandits in this city.

574
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:59,167
We agreed on a lawful execution
of that barbarian.

575
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:05,000
Yet Toranaga stole him from my custody,
and you did nothing.

576
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:09,375
In a matter of days,
there would have been no Toranaga.

577
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:13,292
I'd have handed you the heretic myself.

578
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,712
- [Jozen speaks Japanese]
- [footsteps approaching]

579
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:16,958
Pardon me.

580
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,125
[speaks Japanese]

581
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,708
Lord Hiromatsu has come with a message.

582
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,458
Esteemed Regents.

583
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:46,833
Lord Toranaga regrets that
for personal reasons

584
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:51,292
he has decided

585
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:55,625
to resign from the Council.

586
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:02,208
With apologies.

587
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,958
This piece of paper changes nothing.

588
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,042
We'll impeach him, four to none.

589
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,750
As would be your right.

590
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,250
But if I recall…

591
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:23,875
the Taikō required five Regents
for any vote.

592
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,625
And now…

593
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,000
I fear you have only four.

594
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,958
[inhales deeply]

595
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:55,250
This galley will carry me to Edo,
where I have business.

596
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:58,416
You will remain in Ajiro

597
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:02,417
and help Yabushige train a new regiment.

598
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,832
But Yabushige conspires with Ishido.

599
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,416
He was betraying us in the open…

600
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:07,417
And?

601
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,208
…and I am your son.

602
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,208
Why am I so unworthy of your trust?

603
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,792
When will you understand,

604
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:22,625
you are playing a game
of friends and enemies…

605
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:28,333
when you have only yourself in this life.

606
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:32,042
[grunts]

607
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,583
[in English] Good morning.

608
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,375
Good morning.

609
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,917
I'll never tire of this weather.

610
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,875
Soon it will be winter.

611
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,500
It is a very difficult season in Japan.

612
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,583
Try England.

613
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:03,042
It's humid in the summer.

614
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:04,667
Endless winters.

615
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,042
And, of course, famine every six years.

616
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,167
Still, you must look forward
to going home.

617
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:16,417
To be reunited with your family at least.

618
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,875
Last night you asked about my daughter.

619
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,667
The truth is I've never met her.
I left England before she was born.

620
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:37,375
One year, eleven months,
six days from Amsterdam.

621
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,250
She'll be two years old now.

622
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,042
You serve your lords honorably.

623
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:48,917
I have no lords.

624
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,208
I left of my own accord.

625
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,833
And this, this is what beckoned me.

626
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,625
The horizon more than the deep.

627
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,583
The freedom more than the horizon.

628
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:08,583
The fair wind.

629
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:14,333
To be far enough out that you look around
and there's nothing but open seas.

630
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:18,917
No yesterday. No tomorrow.

631
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,250
Just today.

632
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,083
I'm sorry about your husband.

633
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,750
[in Japanese] Please thank the Anjin
for his assistance in Osaka.

634
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,458
He acted bravely.

635
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:51,582
[Mariko, in English]
He thanks you for your bravery.

636
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:57,875
[in Japanese] Our Christian friends
gave me a gift before we parted…

637
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,083
[in English] My lord says
this was a gift from the priests.

638
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:04,250
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
I'm told they are proof of piracy.

639
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,333
[Mariko, in English]
They prove you are a pirate.

640
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,792
[in Japanese] A crime punishable by death.

641
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,417
[in English] Which means death.

642
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,208
[sailor speaks Japanese]

643
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:20,750
Of course…

644
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,958
these will take a long time to translate.

645
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:29,022
[in English] My lord says
he will have to have them translated,

646
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,292
and that it will likely take a long time.

647
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,333
[in Japanese] In the meantime,
we must prepare for war.

648
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,500
I would like him to train a regiment
in foreign tactics

649
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,208
using the weapons from his ship.

650
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:47,038
[in English] He would like you
to assemble a regiment

651
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,500
and teach them your tactics.

652
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,417
I'm sorry but I'm just a sailor.
I'm not familiar with…

653
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:03,833
[Mariko speaks Japanese]

654
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:07,792
Please tell him it would be a great honor.

655
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:10,542
[in Japanese] He says he would be honored.

656
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:15,375
All I ask for in exchange is
the return of my men and my ship.

657
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,083
[Mariko speaks Japanese]

658
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,417
- Yabushige.
- [speaks Japanese]

659
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:29,958
You and my son will learn
everything there is to know

660
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,167
about the way barbarians war.

661
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,916
I understand.

662
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:38,083
And as he will now be my vassal,

663
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:42,000
we can't keep calling him 'barbarian'.

664
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,125
I proclaim him…

665
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,583
'Hatamoto'.

666
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,917
[in English] He has made you <i>hatamoto</i>,

667
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,542
which is a very great honor.

668
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,250
Oh.

669
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,417
Uh…

670
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:02,958
[in Japanese] Thank you.

671
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:05,583
[sighs]

672
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,749
[in Japanese] Now, please ask the Anjin

673
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,917
if he would join me for a swim.

674
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,500
[breathes heavily]

675
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,542
[in English] My lord would like you
to teach him how to dive.

676
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:27,542
[grunts]

677
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:31,625
It's best to start
from the top of the gunwale.

678
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:36,125
Jump in headfirst while extending
your hands to break the water.

679
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,292
[in Japanese] Show me.

680
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,417
[pants, in English] Observational learner.

681
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,958
[panting]

682
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:50,542
[in Japanese] Again.

683
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,000
- [in English] He says, "Again."
- Ah.

684
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:55,875
[grunts]

685
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:04,208
[panting]
How many more times must I do this?

686
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,458
- Until he is satisfied.
- [grunts]

687
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:10,667
[continues panting]

688
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:16,500
[in Japanese]
Perhaps he can try again tomorrow.

689
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:19,542
[breathes heavily]

690
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:20,917
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

691
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:23,667
Today I will learn how to dive.

692
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,708
[panting]

693
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:26,958
Wait.

694
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:39,792
If I asked for a race to the shore,

695
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,792
would the Anjin join me?

696
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,875
[in English] My lord would like
to race you to the shore.

697
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,708
But I warn you not to let him win.

698
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:48,417
My lord hates that.

699
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,208
I wouldn't dare.

700
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:57,875
[in Japanese] Here we go.

701
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,000
[speaks Japanese]

702
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,208
[grunts, inhales deeply]
