[grunting]

3
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,042
[Ochiba] Your father treasures you.

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:21,083
We're prisoners to that woman.

5
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,250
You must stop these games.

6
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,500
Promise to release the hostages.

7
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,583
[in English] I now wish to forge
allegiances benefiting this country.

8
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,500
I just need a new banner to sail under.

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,625
You wish to sail
on Yabushige-<i>sama</i>'s behalf?

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,792
Which is more important?

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,917
Survival of our clan, or Japan?

12
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,708
Do not give up on our lord.

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,875
Even when it appears
he has given up on himself.

14
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,125
- [Toranaga] Hiromatsu…
- [groaning]

15
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,625
…knew his duty well.

16
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:57,833
Now are you ready to do your part?

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm ready.

18
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,208

[gasps]

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,500
[samurai 1] She's been caught
three times now.

31
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,500
Her father was
the treacherous Akechi Jinsai.

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:01,083
She's the last of his line.

33
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,833
Her husband showed her mercy,
yet still she seeks death.

34
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,250
[Martin] May I sit with her alone?

35
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,500
[breathes shakily]

36
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,333
[in English] Mariko-<i>sama</i>, is it?

37
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,125
In my culture, we would say Maria.

38
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,458
[in Japanese] A beautiful name.

39
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,042
[breathes shakily]

40
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,250
[Martin] You are too young to be this sad.

41
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,125
I'm not much older.

42
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,500
I've known sadness and loss too.

43
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:54,833
But I believe God spared me for a purpose.

44
00:02:56,417 --> 00:03:00,250
And now he's spared you.

45
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,708
[in English]
Our Father, who art in heaven,

46
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,708
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,

47
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,375
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

48
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:18,125
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil…

49
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,833
[in Japanese] For when you have no words…

50
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:43,625
and you just need something to hold onto.

51
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,417

Well, we're making our approach.

57
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,958
[Mariko] Yes.

58
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,417
Why did he send you here?

59
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,292
It has nothing to do with you.

60
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,917
We are simply traveling
to Osaka at the same time.

61
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,583
Well, my life is mine and yours is yours.

62

[speaks Japanese]

63
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,309
[Blackthorne, in English]
Ah, your friends are back from Macao

64
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,750
with the overpriced silk they traded for
criminally underpriced Japanese silver.

65
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,792
True friends of the Jappos.

[grunts]

67
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,125
Tell him as soon as we arrive at
the castle we'll be met by Ishido's men.

68
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,833
He's to remain close.

69
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,708
You are instructed to stay close
once you are met by Ishido-<i>sama</i>'s men.

70
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:49,917
[speaks Japanese]

71
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,583
[in Japanese] You translated honestly?

72
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
[chuckles]

73
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,083
I did.

74
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,125
I hate this fucking city.

75
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,000

[samurai speaks Japanese]

78
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,083
[in English] Lord Ohno's family.

79
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,375
Everyone in the castle is
now a hostage to Ishido-<i>sama</i>.

80
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,292
If a member from every noble family is
trapped here, none can oppose him.

81
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,292
[speaks Japanese]

82
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,208
We'll meet Lord Ishido tomorrow.

83
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,542
I want you there with me.

84
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,833
No.

85
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,833
We'll make our proposal then.

86
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,917
Understand?

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,667
- Uh... Lord Ishido.
- Mmm.

88
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Mmm.

89
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,250
- Tomorrow. Yes.
- [grunts]

90
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,750
- [grunts]
- Yabushige, thank you for trusting me.

91
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:45,750
When I deliver to you the Catholic gold,
you won't regret it.

92
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,958
Do you understand?

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
[sighs]

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,833
Certainly.

95
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,333
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

96
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,350
[in English] Well, we're together again.

97
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,542
Get some rest, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

98
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:07,417
[grunts]

99
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,000
[Kiri, in Japanese]
It's true… you're here.

100
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,792
I apologize for the tight quarters.

101
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:25,625
We had to give up rooms
for Lord Otomo's family.

102
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,375
I'm so sorry for what you've endured.

103
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,458
[baby coos]

104
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:37,958
And Lady Shizu,
welcoming a son in this cruel place.

105
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,375
I wish I could have been with you.

106
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,458
[baby fussing]

107
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,500
Is there word from Lord Toranaga?

108
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,542
Let's hope this works.

109
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,208
[priest sniffs, in English]
You are certain it was the heretic?

110
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:16,083
[laughs] It's hard to miss the foul smell
coming off of the galley.

111
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,167
Whole escort of Jappers with him.

112
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,292
And the lady translator too.

113
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,042
- Lady Maria?
- Mmm. Your little friend. [laughs]

114
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,292
Toranaga is planning something.

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,417
We have got to find out what it is.

116
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,375
[sighs]

117
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,083
I do not think the heretic is
here on Toranaga's behalf.

118
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,917
When I was in Edo, he had been cut loose.

119
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,458
Toranaga has given up.

120
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:46,333
Or you are blind to their trickery.

121
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,208
This felt different.

122
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,792
His most loyal vassal killed himself
right in front of him.

123
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,083
If John Blackthorne is here,

124
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,583
it is only because he is trying
to find his own way out.

125
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,292
Tempest in a bottle.

126
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,750
War is coming.

127
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,625
[Yabushige, in Japanese]
What a handsome gift.

128
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Show me your bow.

129
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,125
[sighs]

130
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,083
No, not like that.

131
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,583
If we're going to win over our enemies,

132
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,193
the least you can do is bow right.

133
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,000
Your back, here! That's it.

134
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,750
What are you doing?

135
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,833
You show him how.

136
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,167
[grunts, speaks Japanese]

137
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,167
[chuckles]

138
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,792
[grunts]

139
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,167
Good, great! Great. That's it.

140
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,792
- Why…
- Mmm.

141
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
Now, don't speak.

142
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,792
And don't disappoint.

143
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,500
[speaks Japanese, chuckles]

144
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,833
[guest 1 speaks Japanese]

145
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,958
[guest 2 speaking Japanese]

146
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,250
[Kiyama] Ah, Yabushige.
I see you made good time from Edo.

147
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:16,250
How kind of you to return my prisoner.

148
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,500
My pleasure.

149
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,542
But he isn't for you.

150
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,833
He wishes to pledge himself to Ishido.

151
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:28,708
After all, no one lord should possess
all the guns in Japan…

152
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:29,958
wouldn't you agree?

153
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,542
[scoffs]

154
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,708
It won't matter.

155
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:36,583
The barbarian will soon be
at the mercy of the Church.

156
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,625
Carry on with your boring
Christian squabbles.

157
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,833
But don't wrinkle him.

158
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,667
He's mine.

159
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,583
[grunts]

160
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,333
[in English] Good evening.

161
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,875
I am Kiyama Ukon Sadanaga.

162
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,167
Member of the Council of Regents.

163
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,625
Ah, yes. The most humble servant
of the Lord on high.

164
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,708
And a servant of the Portuguese.

165
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,667
Which comes first?
God or your purse strings?

166
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,583
I don't trouble myself too much
with the matters of faith.

167
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,667
I am, however, a student of trade.

168
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
- [sighs]
- And I can tell you that

169
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:22,542
we have quite enough pirate merchants
in this country already.

170
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:27,625
Your kind arrived here too late.

171
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,125
My kind?

172
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,667
But I'm not a pirate.

173
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,875
[samurai 3 speaks Japanese]

174
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,708
[speaking Japanese]

175
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,750
Welcome, Yabushige.

176
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,375
On Lord Toranaga's behalf,
I surrender to the Council.

177
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:23,583
And offer my condolences for the death
of the Taikō's brilliant wife.

178
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,833
Hollow words from a traitor.

179
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,583
As I once explained to Nebara Jozen,

180
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:37,083
I was deceived into leading Toranaga
out of Osaka.

181
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:42,708
Was that before or after you were deceived
into killing him?

182
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,917
[Yabushige groans, sighs]

183
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,583
If you wish for my head,
you shall have it.

184
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:52,333
But before that,
might you take a look at my gift.

185
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,000
The Anjin was once
Toranaga's prized hatamoto.

186
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,417
Now he is loyal to me.

187
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,750
He's well-trained,

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,167
and an excellent sea captain.

189
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,667
The Heir has no interest in a barbarian.

190
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:16,792
Dismissed.

191
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,208
[speaks Japanese]

192
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,458
[sighs, speaks Japanese]

193
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,750
Bow.

194
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,250
Move back.

195
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,292
We tried, Anjin. I don't know…

196
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,167
[Yabushige sighs]

197
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,208
[samurai 3 speaks Japanese]

198
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,792
[Ishido] Welcome back to Osaka,
Lady Mariko.

199
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,083
I congratulate you and Ochiba no kata

200
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,667
on your joyous engagement.

201
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,750
I'm surprised you joined
this spineless traitor on his journey.

202
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,833
Do you bring news
of Toranaga's progress from Edo?

203
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,125
Only that my lord still mourns.

204
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,042
Naturally, he has been devastated
by the death of his son.

205
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,375
He has others.

206
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,083
[chuckles]

207
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,292
It's a pleasure to see you, Mariko.

208
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,750
It's been too long.

209
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Yes.

210
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,833
Since we were girls.

211
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,292
Mariko and I spent many years
in Azuchi together.

212
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,750
Do you remember how we used to compete
in poetry competitions?

213
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,167
I remember.

214
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,208
In Daiyoin's memory,

215
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,333
there will be a poetry competition.

216
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,542
If you could choose the first line,

217
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,167
it would be a great honor.

218
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,458
I think it should be…

219
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,917
<i>While the snow remains</i>

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,417
<i>Veiled in the haze of cold evening</i>

221
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,167
<i>A leafless branch…</i>

222
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,792
Excellent.

223
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,542
If a bit bleak.

224
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,833
It will give us something
to look forward to

225
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,250
amidst all this death and treachery.

226
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:54,125
Unfortunately, I won't be competing.

227
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,625
What are you saying?

228
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,917
I'm sorry,

229
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,500
but I will not be here.

230
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:07,792
I'm leaving Osaka tomorrow
with Kiri no kata and Shizu no kata.

231
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,667
[people murmuring]

232
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,333
Leaving for where, Mariko?

233
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,542
[Mariko] To meet our liege lord in Edo.

234
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,792
He has requested I escort them myself.

235
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,333
He...

236
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:28,875
Toranaga will be here in a few weeks,
as you said.

237
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:33,000
It's been months since
the Lady Shizu has seen Lord Toranaga.

238
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,250
And my lord hasn't yet seen
his newest son.

239
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,333
Lady Mariko...

240
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,708
Let's find another time
to discuss this private matter.

241
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,101
Perhaps you can call on us...

242
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,708
Thank you, but no.

243
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,708
I am leaving tomorrow.

244
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,792
You forget your manners!

245
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,417
Forgive me,

246
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,125
that was the last thing I intended.

247
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:04,542
I will return with my lord on the day
we are required to be in Osaka.

248
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,667
Unless we are confined here.

249
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,250
No one is confined here.

250
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,875
But since you choose to speak
in this outrageous fashion,

251
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,250
it is my duty to ask the Regents
for a formal review.

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Lord Kiyama?

253
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,250
What do you think?

254
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,833
I agree.

255
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,250
Good.

256
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,208
Mariko will remain here until then.

257
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,708
I would be honored…

258
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,708
[sighs]

259
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,667
However…

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
my first duty is to my liege lord,
and I am ordered to leave.

261
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,875
[Ishido] You will be patient!

262
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,458
I cannot delay my departure,
even for a little time.

263
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,542
The matter is closed!

264
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,375
The matter is closed…

265
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,083
when you have the manners
to let me finish.

266
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,000
I am no peasant to be trodden on.

267
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,875
I am daughter of the great Lord…

268
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,500
Akechi Jinsai.

269
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,167
My line has been samurai
for a thousand years,

270
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:38,958
and I will never be captive,
or hostage, or confined.

271
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,292
I am free to go as I please…

272
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,167
as is anyone.

273
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,833
You will await the meeting of the Regents.

274
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,625
There is nothing more to discuss.

275
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,500
[Yabushige] What in the name
of all gods possessed you?

276
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,917
Has your mind left you?

277
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,042
And is this body of yours… stupid?

278
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,583
[huffs]

279
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,292
[Mariko] So sorry.

280
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,292
[Yabushige exclaims]

281
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,417
Tonight was unexpected.

282
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,375
[scoffs]

283
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,458
You knew exactly what you were doing.

284
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,750
On Toranaga's behalf.

285
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,250
I know it, Ishido knows it…

286
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,708
[pants]

287
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,083
What are Toranaga's plans?

288
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,958
I can help him, we can do this together.

289
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,042
Tell me your orders!

290
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,667
- Yabushige.
- What is it!

291
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,542
It is not my intention
to disrupt your peace.

292
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,750
Or any peace.

293
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,542
[Yabushige, Blackthorne grunt]

294
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,125
I suppose this one's part of it.

295
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:08,292
- [Yabushige speaks Japanese]
- The Anjin is here on his own business.

296
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,375
[grunts]

297
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:14,625
I'm sorry, but please excuse me.

298
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,750
[speaks Japanese]

299
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,458
I am very tired from the day.

300
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,708
[scoffs]

301
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:26,625
"Leafless branch"... what a terrible poem.

302
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,917
Who writes about leafless branches
in the spring?

303
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,750
[huffs]

304
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,833
- Come on, idiot!
- [speaks Japanese]

305
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,958
[breathing heavily]

306
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,500
[in English] Why have you done this?

307
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,583
I need rest.

308
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,750
I must leave in the morning.

309
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,250
But you can't leave.

310
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,417
They'll stop you.

311
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:56,208
Judging by the armed guards
everywhere I look, probably by force.

312
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,333
Then Ishido-<i>sama</i> would be admitting
I remain here by force.

313
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:04,083
As well as every lord and lady
being kept prisoner in this castle.

314
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:14,125
You'd walk into a sword
just to prove the blade is sharp.

315
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,583
Please, Anjin-<i>sama</i>,

316
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,292
you must not involve yourself.

317
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,083
Can you do this…

318
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,500
for the sake of everything
we have been through?

319
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,583
[breathes shakily]

320
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,792
[son, in Japanese] As your son,

321
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,750
I am concerned for our house.

322
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:50,458
I am only doing my duty.

323
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,875
To whom?

324
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,000
Your family?

325
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,750
It's difficult to explain.

326
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
[in English] What about your duty to God?

327
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:05,167
Please, Lord Kiyama's a fellow Christian
of highest rank.

328
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,167
He asks you to remain in Osaka.

329
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:12,500
He says that our families are one
under the banner of God

330
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,625
which is why I am to become betrothed
to his granddaughter.

331
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,500
We serve Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

332
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,625
You will marry as our lord instructs.

333
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:28,917
[sighs]

334
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,708
[son] I am tired of being in this family.

335
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,375
These things they say about your name,
I am always ashamed.

336
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,500
And for what?

337
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,583
What have I done?

338
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,667
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
[inhales sharply]

339
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,250
Then stop this.

340
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,292
If you try to leave today, you'll be held.

341
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,083
And if you are disgraced…

342
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,875
[in Japanese]
…then I am no longer your son.

343
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,417
[Yabushige mumbles]

344
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,833
[sighs]

345
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,042
[whispering]

346
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,708
[baby fussing]

347
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:13,125
My Lady, are you ready?

348
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:21,875
Let's go.

349
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,542
[guard 1] Everyone get ready!

350
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,125
We're leaving.

351
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,958
[guard 2] Excuse me, Lady Mariko,

352
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,875
do you have a permit to leave?

353
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:55,042
Excuse me, but we require none.

354
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,708
Lord Ishido has instituted orders
throughout the castle.

355
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,625
You must have a permit.

356
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,833
I have been ordered by my lord
to escort his ladies to Edo.

357
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,500
Please let us pass.

358
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,167
I'm sorry, but without a permit,
no lord or his retinue

359
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,750
may leave Osaka Castle.
It is Lord Ishido's order.

360
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,583
You leave me no choice.

361
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,125
Please kill him.

362
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,167
[grunting]

363
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,667
[groans]

364
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,833
The Lady will leave now!

365
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,917
[guard 1 speaks Japanese]

366
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,333
[gasps, grunting]

367
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,000
Miyai, would you please take charge?

368
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,417
It would be an honor, my Lady.

369
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:19,792
Kill them!

370
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,875
[shouting, grunting]

371
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,833
[grunts, pants]

372
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,625
I'm honored to have served you.

373
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:51,792
- [shouts]
- [grunts]

374
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,417
- [chokes]
- [grunts]

375
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:56,792
[grunts]

376
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,958
[guard 1 speaks Japanese]

377
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,125
[Mariko] Lord Kiyama, Lord Ohno…

378
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,667
Please order these men out of my way.

379
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,042
They are not ours to order.

380
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,500
Those men belong to Lord Ishido.

381
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,458
We are powerless.

382
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:36,292
Then it's true we are all being kept
here against our will.

383
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,625
I will call for a meeting!

384
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:44,250
I am a vassal of Lord Toranaga
and my orders are clear.

385
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,208
I must be permitted to obey my lord.

386
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:51,708
[breathes shakily]

387
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,792
[gasps]

388
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,000
Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

389
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,417
Please get out of my way.

390
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,458
Lady Mariko must not be harmed!

391
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,625
[grunting, panting]

392
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:09,167
[Mariko grunting, panting]

393
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,458
[screaming]

394
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
It is not possible
to fight through all these men.

395
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,208
We must go back.

396
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,083
However…

397
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:19,250
these men have prevented me
from doing my duty to my liege lord

398
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,500
and I cannot live with the offense.

399
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,875
I will take my life at sunset.

400
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,958
[sighs]

401
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,208
Lord Kiyama.

402
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,333
As a Christian, you understand

403
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,667
it is a mortal sin to take my own life.

404
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,083
I formally ask that you be my second.

405
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,458
[speaks Japanese]

406
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:44,625
I am obligated to her
as a fellow Christian.

407
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:49,083
Otherwise she faces eternal damnation.

408
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,000
That is her choice.

409
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,667
[Ohno] It's a bluff.

410
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:58,875
She won't forfeit
her eternal soul with suicide.

411
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,458
[Ochiba] You're all wrong.

412
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:06,167
Lady Mariko will do as she says.

413
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:11,958
It is her vengeance.

414
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,083
On fate.

415
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,208
On all of us.

416
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:25,250
She will die to be free of the disgrace
that has burdened her.

417
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:32,083
And then all of Osaka will be disgraced
for letting her die.

418
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,167
[chuckles]

419
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,375
A bit extreme, don't you think?

420
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,250
What is your counsel?

421
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:51,083
I have no counsel for you, Lord Ishido.

422
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,667
If you allow her to die,

423
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:01,292
there will be a revolt
from every high family in Osaka.

424
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:07,417
If you allow her to leave,

425
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,875
the hostages will also demand to leave.

426
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,583
Ishido's men began locking
all the palaces…

427
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,542
we managed to leave just in time.

428
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,417
We ask for the honor of joining you
in waiting for Lady Mariko.

429
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:32,875
We are pleased to have you.

430
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:49,125
The Anjin has been summoned
for an audience with the Heir.

431
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,625
[bell tolling]

432
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:05,542
[chuckles]

433
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,958
I'm told your Japanese is decent.

434
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,000
Can you understand me?

435
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,583
Yes.

436
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,917
But I respectfully request
you use simple words.

437
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,042
A prepared phrase.

438
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,250
Smart of you.

439
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,500
I wonder if Mariko taught you that.

440
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,167
Thank you for coming.

441
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,458
The Heir requested an audience
with the Anjin.

442
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,083
As we need a translator,
I asked you to come.

443
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,917
[in English] She asks of me to translate.

444
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,750
It is a ruse to bring me before her.

445
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,208
Please let her speak.

446
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,167
[in Japanese] It would be an honor
if I can be of use.

447
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:13,417
The Anjin thanks the Heir
for this audience.

448
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,292
These games must stop.

449
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,708
I play no games.

450
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,583
I have only my duty to uphold.

451
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,958
You can't bring nobility
to your lord's warmongering.

452
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,625
By being a worm on Toranaga's lure,

453
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,417
you will not win your freedom.

454
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,208
[Mariko] So sorry, but you're mistaken.

455
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:45,500
My lord wishes only to end this fight.

456
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,375
[Ochiba] Would you translate
for the Anjin?

457
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:58,250
I want him to understand
the relationship we once had.

458
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:03,625
When we were girls,
Mariko did everything well.

459
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,458
She always knew where to stand,

460
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:09,625
when to leave the room
without being asked.

461
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:16,875
It was easy for her.

462
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,583
[in English]
She talks about our childhood together.

463
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,750
She and I grew up like sisters.

464
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,707
[in Japanese] But our fathers were
enemies, you see.

465
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,417
Their misery was ours.

466
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:37,625
Wars raged, even in our castle.

467
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,958
But I had Mariko.

468
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:50,542
She was my happiness.

469
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,500
And then she was sent away.

470
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:07,083
For years, I couldn't recognize
this woman I was told she'd become…

471
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,167
That Mariko, in her father's name,

472
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:15,375
wished to become a martyr…

473
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,000
But I see her now.

474
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,833
The girl who did everything right,

475
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,708
with anger growing in her chest.

476
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,208
All she seeks is destruction.

477
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:38,333
Aren't you tired of all this?

478
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,208
What should I do?

479
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,167
Surrender to some pointless death?

480
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,583
Wither like your "leafless branch"?

481
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:53,125
Only you can end the games
you accuse me of playing.

482
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,333
[Ochiba] I don't have that power.

483
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,833
I don't exist, except to protect my son.

484
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:14,583
Tell me, how will piercing your heart
protect your son?

485
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,542
[in English] We should go now.

486
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:40,917
[in Japanese]
Accepting death isn't surrender.

487
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,375
Flowers are only flowers
because they fall.

488
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,042
[in English] Toranaga has thousands
of warriors at his disposal.

489
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,083
[panting]
Vassals coming out of his <i>kosode</i>.

490
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,684
It's the mark of a coward
to send a woman to do his bidding.

491
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,833
You misunderstand him.

492
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,417
[samurai 5 speaks Japanese]

493
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:17,162
[in English] No, I understand perfectly.
He's taking advantage of your loyalty.

494
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,083
Your life is worth more than this.

495
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,250
Life and death are the same.

496
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,083
Both can have value and purpose.

497
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,917
Only one is permanent.

498
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,055
You have nothing to prove to these people.

499
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,750
You've made your point.

500
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,708
There's no need to die for it.

501
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,708
There is every need.

502
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,042
It is the very reason
my father kept me alive.

503
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,875
What I'm asking...

504
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:53,000
What I'm begging is,
if not for good sense,

505
00:41:53,875 --> 00:42:00,208
if not for God,
then will you consider living for me?

506
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,208
[panting]

507
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,875

[speaks Japanese]

509
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:48,958
Your offer of service instead of death...

510
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,167
He accepts.

511
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,917
But he has a request…

512
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,667
[groans]

513
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,338
[Martin, in English] <i>All these years,
you still have your cross with you.</i>

514
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,833
Your mind is set again.

515
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,500
Yes, it is.

516
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,292
I wish to be confessed.

517
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,542
Then speak it here.

518
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,042
[Mariko]
<i>Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

519
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:41,875
But I can only confess
that I am not worthy to confess.

520
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:52,875
Daughter of God,
I wish I could say proper Mass for you.

521
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:59,875
<i>But here we have no altar or vestments.</i>

522
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,500
Then let us drink <i>cha</i> from an empty cup

523
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:08,667
for all the years we have known each other
and for the little time that is left.

daughter of Akechi Jinsai,

529
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,917
leave this poem as my final statement.

530
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:45,667
Lord Kiyama,
please come forward to second me.

531
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,458
[grunts]

532
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,165
[in English] I will do it.

533
00:47:56,417 --> 00:48:00,042
Hell is no place I haven't already known.

534
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,833
Let it from your mind.

535
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,958
Please wait until I have fallen.

00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:55,167
[breathing shakily]

538
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:05,083
[Ishido speaking in Japanese]

539
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,167
[scoffs]

540
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,750
Your permits.

541
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,458
Stupid as it is
to have to come right back,

542
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:28,208
you are free to leave in the morning.

543
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:29,792
[breathes shakily]

544
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:33,917

545
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:36,625
[hostage] Lord Ishido!

546
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:41,208
I also ask to leave.

547
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:44,250
And me. With my family.

548
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:49,083
May we expect safe passage too?

549
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,250
Are we jailers?

550
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,042
No one is hostage in this castle.

551
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:59,875
If you wish to leave, then apply
for your permits and it will be done.

552
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,750
A mere woman, threatening her own suicide,

553
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,167
and flouting the Heir's welcome…

554
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:08,292
Disgusting.

555
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:16,958
[gasps]

556
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:31,083

562
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,042
Lord, if you'd like to rest,
we have the watch covered.

[grunts]

564
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,125
I was going to sleep,

565
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:06,583
but those hens unearthed
all the saké in the castle.

566
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:08,292
[chuckles]

567
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:10,208
I suspect they'll be up all night.

568
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:14,708
I can understand
their desire to celebrate.

569
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:15,792
[chuckles]

570
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,375
Go ahead, drink.

571
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,458
I insist.

572
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:20,542
[grunts]

573
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:21,625
Good.

574
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,458
[chuckles]

575
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,083
Huh?

576
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:27,167
What is it?

Intruders!

587

594
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,250
[in English] Who are they?

595
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,208
Shinobi. They have come for me.

596
00:55:58,917 --> 00:56:00,917
[samurai shouting]

597
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,917
[in Japanese] It's Ishido…

598
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
he'll never let us leave alive.

599
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:08,417
They've infiltrated the castle.

600
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Quiet!

601
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,750

[in English] Listen.

603
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,500
Tell them to move back.

604

Look out!

613
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:42,875
We should go to the dozo.

614
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,458
Its doors will protect us.

615
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:45,809
No, we should go to the gate!

616
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,417
I will not risk being captured.

618
