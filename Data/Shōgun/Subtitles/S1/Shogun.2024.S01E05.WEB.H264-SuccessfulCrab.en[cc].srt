1
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,169
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun.

2
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:18,419
Lord Toranaga has decided
to resign from the Council.

3
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:23,669
The Taikō required five Regents
for any vote.

4
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:26,960
[Toranaga] Lady Ochiba
requested to return to Osaka.

5
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,169
Obviously I've granted it.

6
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:30,877
To do otherwise
would have been a hostile act.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,627
You're not a suckling child!

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,252
[in English] <i>I'm assuming
that man's your husband.</i>

9
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,127
His name is Toda Hirokatsu.
Though friends call him Buntaro.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,335
[in Japanese] Wait!

11
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,460
Oh, for Christ's sake,
he could still make it.

12
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:44,252
[Toranaga] Toda Hirokatsu!

13
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,460
- Shit.
- [Mariko] Sorry.

14
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:53,502
I am happy to see you have changed
your mind about bathing.

15
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,085
[Mariko] <i>You seem in good spirits.</i>

16
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,377
[Blackthorne]
<i>After a night of good company.</i>

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,919
The courtesan was acceptable then.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,627
[Nagakado, in Japanese] Nebara Jozen!

19
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,335
Your presence here is intolerable.

20
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,085
You're savages.

21
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:07,835
[shouts]

22
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,210
Damn it all.

23
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,627
Why is this happening to us?

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,835
Beastly cannon, piles of corpses...
we didn't ask for this.

25
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,585
[rumbling]

26
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:41,294
[peasant] There's an army coming!

27
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:42,710
Thousands of them!

28
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,169
[horses whinny]

29
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,252
[combatant shouts]

30
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,002
Toranaga-<i>sama</i>!

31
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,460
[Nagakado] My father's returned...

32
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:07,335
[Buntaro shouts]

33
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,669
Mariko...

34
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,127
He's alive!

35
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:20,794
Look who it is!

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,377
It's your husband!

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,002
[pants]

38
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,794
[breathes shakily]

39
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,920
[Kiyama] Any day,
the Lady Ochiba will be returned to us

40
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:32,295
from Toranaga's castle in Edo...

41
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:38,461
Let us ensure that the mother of the Heir

42
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,961
comes home to a safer city
than what she left.

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Toranaga must be impeached.

44
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,753
[Sugiyama] I agree.

45
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:52,461
His escape from Osaka was not
only a mockery of this Council

46
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,336
but also an insult to the Heir.

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,795
Ohno...

48
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:57,753
...what do you think?

49
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,628
Impeach.

50
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,795
How fortifying to see us this united...

51
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:08,378
It's only...

52
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:13,045
Toranaga's resignation has made
impeachment impossible

53
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,836
with our Council now incomplete.

54
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:22,211
Let us vote on his replacement.

55
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:28,211
Ishido's friend, Ikeda, would make
an excellent Regent.

56
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,753
[laughs]

57
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,086
The man's an idiot.

58
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,711
The seat would stink of countryside.

59
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,503
Perhaps Hiroda?

60
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,753
The seat would stink of Christian.

61
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:56,753
[servant] Lord Kiyama sends his regrets.

62
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:04,545
I propose Maeda.

63
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:07,545
Wonderful choice.

64
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:11,961
I won't sit on a Council
with that rotten syphilis.

65
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:14,795
I'd rather slit my own belly.

66
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:16,753
Sugiyama.

67
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,586
Perhaps you were unaware...

68
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,128
Maeda is Ohno's cousin.

69
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:34,003
[Sugiyama coughing]

70
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,753
I see why she is called 'Lady of Steel'.

71
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,253
Your first time hunting?

72
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:11,045
My husband hasn't had cause to invite me.

73
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:15,461
He's a miracle, your husband.

74
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,586
It took him twenty days to return to us.

75
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:25,003
I'm in awe that he survived.

76
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:29,336
A contingent of ronin helped him fight
his way out.

77
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:34,961
By the time they reached Edo,
only two men were left.

78
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,628
It was a terrible ordeal.

79
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:48,420
A diary of all that the Anjin has said
or done since you left.

80
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:52,920
I ask that you remain at the Anjin's house

81
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,753
and continue your duties as interpreter.

82
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:57,961
And my husband?

83
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:03,211
I've instructed Buntaro to move
in to the Anjin's house with you.

84
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,545
This way you can serve them both.

85
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:10,670
Father!

86
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
[sighs]

87
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:15,253
Tell me...

88
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:20,670
Was it my son's idea
to murder Nebara Jozen?

89
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,378
I don't know.

90
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,170
Killing him was incredibly foolish.

91
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:31,003
Ishido will likely use it
as a pretext for war.

92
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,003
Father.

93
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:41,045
Mariko, please give this pheasant
to the Anjin.

94
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,586
A token of my gratitude.

95
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:55,086
[sighs]

96
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,586
I know you're upset with me.

97
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,878
Did it ever occur to you

98
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,836
that by killing Jozen,

99
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,628
you might have been doing
Yabushige's bidding?

100
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:13,795
No...

101
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,670
Maybe it was his eager nephew

102
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,545
who tricked you into being so stupid.

103
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,045
Father...

104
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,586
You will address me as Lord!

105
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,253
Stop behaving like a child!

106
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:27,420
Rotten animals...

107
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:30,586
Horses are worse than men for treachery.

108
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:36,128
You so easily fell into their trap.

109
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:38,045
Broken to another man's fist.

110
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:41,878
Like a falcon, but without the beauty.

111
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,336
[bird shrieks]

112
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,503
All men are like falcons.

113
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:52,128
Some are flown straight from the fist,

114
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:54,295
killing anything that moves.

115
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:01,545
Others are lazy and tempted by the lure.

116
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:06,961
But all men can be broken.

117
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:14,295
Learn to fly them at the right game,

118
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:18,795
and they will do your hunting for you.

119
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:20,836
[servant speaks Japanese]

120
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:28,711
Until you can understand this,

121
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,586
I am stripping the cannon regiment
from your command.

122
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,170
- [rain pattering]
- [thunder rumbling]

123
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,045
[servant] A messenger has arrived.

124
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,295
[gasps]

125
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:25,795
Lord, it's Jozen.

126
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:32,253
[breathing shakily]

127
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:41,003
[in English] As I live and breathe,
the most precious gift there is.

128
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:42,253
Do you see that?

129
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,336
I do my part, and the old man does his.
Now we're getting somewhere.

130
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,253
You can't understand a word I'm saying,
but when I was your age,

131
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:50,211
one of my first chores was cleaning game.

132
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:52,086
My father would poach
from the estate in Chatham.

133
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,003
Watch this.

134
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:53,961
Please watch this.

135
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:57,336
[in English] Now, we'll hang it up
for a few days to mature,

136
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,545
maybe a week, depending on the weather.

137
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,628
[huffs] There we are.

138
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,003
[in Japanese] So sorry, but...

139
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:09,128
the bird will rot, no?

140
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,795
You understand, 'rot'?

141
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:14,711
[grunts]

142
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:16,086
[in English] Yes, yes.

143
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,045
There will be a terrible stench.

144
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,670
But this is a gift from Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

145
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,420
It must be the best pheasant
this village has ever prepared.

146
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:26,503
Now, this next part is very important.

147
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:29,420
No one is to touch this bird.

148
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,961
[in Japanese] Understand?

149
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,628
Forbidden, yes?

150
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:36,711
Um.

151
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,295
If touch... die!

152
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:49,795
We'll order him knives
of his own from Mishima.

153
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:53,961
From now on,
nothing he uses will touch our food.

154
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,503
[cook] There's a fine cook
in the next village.

155
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:59,170
When I want another cook I will tell you.

156
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:00,336
Lady Fuji...

157
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,586
The Anjin may eat whatever he wishes
in his own house...

158
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:05,961
Forgive me for interrupting...

159
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:12,336
Lord Toda is here to see you.

160
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,920
[Fuji] Uncle.

161
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,170
It's wonderful to see you returned safely.

162
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:23,295
Where is Mariko?

163
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,545
Ordered to Lord Toranaga's camp.

164
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:29,628
Should I send for her?

165
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:33,503
I am ordered to quarter here.

166
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:38,920
Bad enough my wife must live
under a roof with the Anjin.

167
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,128
But now, I am to do the same.

168
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:47,211
You've narrowly escaped death.

169
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,836
We'll see to it you are well-cared for.

170
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:53,378
How is it being consort to a barbarian?

171
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,295
Sorry...

172
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:02,128
I am consort to a hatamoto,
I wouldn't know.

173
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:09,503
Does he make you pillow?

174
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:11,295
No.

175
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,336
Thankfully

176
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,961
the Anjin prefers the company
of other women.

177
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:27,378
Barbarians should stick
with barbarian women.

178
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:34,378
Tell the Anjin I'll be back for dinner.

179
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:46,336
[Yabushige]
The training has gone quite well.

180
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:48,753
The barbarian's cannon tactics

181
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:50,586
offer surprising new advantages.

182
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,586
I look forward to a demonstration.

183
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,711
[speaks Japanese]

184
00:14:56,211 --> 00:15:00,961
Though I will be sure to keep my distance

185
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:03,878
after what happened to Nebara Jozen.

186
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,461
[speaks Japanese]

187
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:09,586
"Return to Osaka,

188
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,961
and pledge loyalty to Ishido."

189
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,961
I heard those are your orders.

190
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,295
As always, you see through everything.

191
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:19,045
What are you going to do?

192
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,586
Of course I remain with you.

193
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,545
They'll declare you a fugitive.

194
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,045
True.

195
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,545
But since that sunrise in Osaka,

196
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:35,003
you and I are bound by fate.

197
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,045
Is that so?

198
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:42,170
Or maybe it was you who manipulated my son

199
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,961
into attacking Jozen?

200
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,211
No, I would never...

201
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,295
That way you could delay
your response to Ishido,

202
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:56,211
and continue playing both sides.

203
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:58,711
Lord... Nagakado decided

204
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:02,211
Jozen could not be allowed
to report on the cannon...

205
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,795
Nagakado is not clever enough
to think of such an idea.

206
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:08,586
[breathes loudly]

207
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,461
You're right.
I'm afraid it was my nephew Omi.

208
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:15,711
He was drinking saké with Nagakado
the night before.

209
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:17,753
Perhaps his words planted the wrong idea.

210
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,461
That Omi.
I will discipline him on your behalf.

211
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:26,461
Discipline?

212
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,545
[speaks Japanese]

213
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,170
[chuckles]

214
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:35,545
He found a way to force
our enemies to attack.

215
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:39,378
Why would I need to discipline
such a promising young man?

216
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:41,961
[speaks Japanese]

217
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:45,253
If I were to attack them
in the stronghold of Osaka,

218
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,920
I would surely lose.

219
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:51,086
But thanks to your nephew

220
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,378
they are sure to take offense,

221
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,961
and must draw out to attack us here.

222
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,586
We can entrench ourselves.

223
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,170
Drain their numbers.

224
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:03,295
[chuckles]

225
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,545
Exactly as you say.
I was thinking the same thing.

226
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,628
Inform your nephew...

227
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:14,628
I'm giving him command
of the Anjin's artillery.

228
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,003
[speaks Japanese]

229
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:19,086
A deserving reward for Omi.

230
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
[grunting]

231
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,378
This man is a loyal, hard worker...

232
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:45,878
A perfect cover for the spy
you still haven't found.

233
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:48,836
[snorts]

234
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:51,920
He's toying with me.

235
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,253
Batting me around
like a bird with its prey.

236
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,836
In my own province no less!

237
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,711
Toranaga has given you command
of the cannon regiment.

238
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:06,253
Train them well.

239
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:15,586
Uncle, if it's your wish,
I will relinquish command to you.

240
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:18,045
[speaks Japanese]

241
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,170
What did you just say?

242
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,795
Do you imagine
the regiment belongs to you?

243
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:31,461
How can you relinquish
what already belongs to me?

244
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,961
[speaks Japanese]

245
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,045
Find Toranaga's spy.

246
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,420
[sighs]

247
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,961
Go to Osaka.

248
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:47,920
We should fix things with Ishido

249
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,295
for when this all turns to shit.

250
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,295
Things were worse in Korea.

251
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:07,461
We had to eat silkworms cooked in shoyu.

252
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,503
People don't die from flies.

253
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:25,003
You and me...

254
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:27,128
we're both cursed.

255
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:31,253
First, the Anjin contaminates our kitchen
like a vengeful tatarigami.

256
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,211
And now your husband is back
from the dead.

257
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:38,503
One more reason for us to eat.

258
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,795
He'll be here soon.

259
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:51,586
If you think the Anjin is in danger,

260
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,378
you'll tell me, right?

261
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,045
Why would he be in danger?

262
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,878
[in English] I understand your husband is
to stay with us now?

263
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,878
Is there anything you feel
I should be preparing for?

264
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,086
Dinner?

265
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,211
Dinner.

266
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,211
And you will be a gracious host.

267
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,170
[grunting]

268
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,795
[in Japanese] Without a good rock,

269
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:08,961
a garden is just a place of growing.

270
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:11,711
[Blackthorne] I agree, Uejirou.

271
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:26,045
Welcome to my home, Lord Buntaro.

272
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,670
It's Lord Toda.

273
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:32,753
[in English] My husband wishes for you
to address him as Toda-<i>sama</i>,

274
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:35,920
as Buntaro is reserved
only for those close to him.

275
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:41,211
Tell Toda-<i>sama</i> it's a relief
he was able to escape Osaka,

276
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:44,420
and an honor for him to have observed
our cannon regiment today.

277
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,128
[in Japanese] The Anjin says

278
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:49,670
only a great warrior
could have survived as you did.

279
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:53,295
He is also honored that you saw
the cannon regiment he trained.

280
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:59,128
My bow can fly faster,
and at a greater range than any cannon.

281
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,545
[in English] He believes that in the hands
of a true samurai,

282
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:03,961
the bow and sword will
always outmatch the cannon.

283
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,378
Oh.

284
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:08,628
Well, perhaps we should have
a friendly contest sometime.

285
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,045
[insect buzzing]

286
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,128
[sniffs]

287
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:16,420
[in Japanese]
Did something die in this house?

288
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,253
Excuse me, dinner is served.

289
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,128
[in English] Now, for my esteemed guests
on this wonderful evening,

290
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:33,295
I am proud to present to you tastes
from my home country.

291
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:37,628
We call it English rabbit stew.

292
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:41,378
Now, admittedly, I had to substitute
a few of the ingredients, sake for sherry,

293
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,586
and a few other things,
but that's the beauty of a good stew.

294
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,586
It all tastes like gravy in the end.

295
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:52,211
Mariko?

296
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:56,586
We are particular eaters, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

297
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,545
It is our loss.

298
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:06,003
It's not the same without sherry anyway.

299
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,378
Now, here you go. [grunts]

300
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:14,128
Oh, please, eat.

301
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:26,378
[scoffs]

302
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:29,378
[in Japanese] Look how he eats.

303
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,961
Like a baby monkey.

304
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,420
[in English] What did he say?

305
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:38,753
My husband comments on the way
you eat your noodles.

306
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,878
The sound you make while eating
reveals the depth of your pleasure.

307
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:45,170
Oh. [laughs]

308
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,961
[slurps]

309
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,961
[slurps]

310
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,378
[scoffs]

311
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:00,836
[in Japanese] Clever monkey.

312
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,378
He learns tricks fast, doesn't he?

313
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:15,253
You know where I come from, only
women drink from a tiny cup like that.

314
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,753
[in Japanese]
The Anjin says that in his country,

315
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,003
bigger cups are used for drinking.

316
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:29,545
[in English] The polite size of the sake
cup helps us to enjoy the drink and...

317
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,420
This is how we drink.

318
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,420
[grunts]

319
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:25,045
[grunts]

320
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:27,503
[groans]

321
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:33,128
[in Japanese] If the Anjin asks for more
saké, tell him this was the last of it.

322
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:37,045
And pour that stew into the sea.

323
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,670
[pants]

324
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:45,170
[Blackthorne, in English] Seeing as
we're toasting, I have a toast to propose.

325
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,378
If you cheat, cheat death.

326
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,711
If you steal, steal the heart of a woman.

327
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:53,836
If you lie, lie in the everlasting warmth
of her bosom.

328
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,586
And if you drink, drink with me.

329
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:03,586
[sighs]

330
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:08,628
[in Japanese]
It's like being in a barbarian land.

331
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:14,170
Soon we'll be eating with our feet.

332
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:17,045
[in English] What did he say?

333
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:19,920
Perhaps it is getting late.

334
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,628
I think Fuji-<i>sama</i> appears to be tired.
Fuji-<i>sama</i>...

335
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:25,128
[in Japanese] You must be tired.

336
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,253
[Blackthorne, in English] Oh, nonsense.

337
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,878
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, ask your husband
if he could share

338
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:33,503
the... the story of his escape in Osaka.

339
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:37,753
Never too late for a good story.

340
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,795
Go on, ask him then.

341
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,253
[in Japanese] Forgive me.

342
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:48,170
But the Anjin...

343
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,586
has heard great tales of
your heroism in escaping Osaka.

344
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,753
He says he would like to hear them.

345
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,711
Heroism is for the dead,

346
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:05,753
and stories are for children.

347
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,003
The Anjin has said improper things,
I apologize.

348
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:19,378
Perhaps it is more acceptable
to boast in his country.

349
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:23,961
Then ask about his battles.

350
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,503
Isn't he the great samurai
who trains Lord Toranaga's regiment?

351
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,961
[in English] He would like to know
about a war you have fought in.

352
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:37,336
Ah, I don't know.

353
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,045
All of my war stories are full of holes.

354
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:41,795
[Mariko] Please listen.

355
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,336
My husband is tired
and has had a lot to drink.

356
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,586
You must tell him a story.

357
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:50,211
But choose your words carefully.

358
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:54,795
[in Japanese] No.

359
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:57,211
War

360
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,461
Talk

361
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:01,170
You

362
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,461
Kodai!

363
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:10,711
Bring a bow!

364
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,253
[sighs]

365
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:21,336
Have him choose a post.

366
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:24,503
[in English] The gateway of your house.

367
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:26,711
He asks you to choose a post.

368
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:27,961
What? He's going to shoot it?

369
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,378
The left or the right post.

370
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:32,503
- Oh, the man can't even see straight!
- Please.

371
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,545
Choose.

372
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:36,086
Right.

373
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:37,503
[in Japanese] Right post.

374
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,336
[in English] Mariko-<i>sama</i>, you should move.

375
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:45,711
[breathes shakily]

376
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:46,961
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, move.

377
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,170
Mariko-<i>sama</i>!

378
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,628
[gasps, pants]

379
00:29:03,003 --> 00:29:03,961
[in Japanese] Uncle...

380
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,211
[in English] Mariko-<i>sama</i>,
get out of the fucking way!

381
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,545
Oh, for...

382
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:25,795
[sighs]

383
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:31,961
Please tell him that,
while I understand that in this country,

384
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:35,420
like mine, a man's wife is his property.

385
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:38,211
But I believe strongly...

386
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:41,836
that his wife merits better.

387
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:52,378
[Mariko, in Japanese]
He says that a wife is property

388
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:54,461
and a husband may do what he wants.

389
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,878
But the Anjin...

390
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:03,086
wonders if you should
treat your wife with more courtesy.

391
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:10,961
[laughs]

392
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,253
[Buntaro] Makes me laugh.

393
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,253
You of all people...

394
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:20,003
That you deserve courtesy.

395
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,878
Tell him what your name is.

396
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:27,878
Tell him!

397
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:33,461
[Mariko, in English]
I am to tell you about my family.

398
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:37,378
[in Japanese] Tell him about
the disgusting, filthy line you come from.

399
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:45,545
[in English] I am daughter
of the late Lord Akechi Jinsai.

400
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:51,086
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, you don't have to do this.

401
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,253
[in Japanese]
Daughter of the treacherous assassin.

402
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,545
Just make up a story.
He'll never know the difference.

403
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:05,295
My father's Lord was Kuroda-<i>sama</i>,
ruler of Japan before the Taikō.

404
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:12,795
Kuroda-<i>sama</i> was corrupt and murderous,

405
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:15,545
and so my father killed him
out of love for the Realm. [sniffs]

406
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,670
For this,
he was hunted along with my family.

407
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,878
All of my brothers, sisters...

408
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:28,336
and my mother.

409
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:36,086
They all knelt before my father who
was forced to execute them, one by one...

410
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:40,503
before committing seppuku himself.

411
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:48,753
I was just married
and not permitted to fight.

412
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:54,836
Each year,
on the anniversary of my family's murder,

413
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:59,711
I ask my husband to let me
take action against this injustice.

414
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,545
But I can do nothing.

415
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:09,920
Because my husband orders me to live.

416
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,253
I ask you to remember <i>The Eightfold Fence</i>.

417
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,253
Excuse me.

418
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,461
Who gave you permission to leave?

419
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:36,503
Mariko!

420
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,795
[breathes sharply]

421
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,378
- [snoring, grunts]
- [thudding]

422
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:54,753
- [Mariko grunting]
- [banging]

423
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:58,586
[Mariko sobbing]

424
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,420
[Buntaro] This is your fault.

425
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:03,295
Do you understand?

426
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:05,003
- [Mariko sobs]
- [Blackthorne grunts]

427
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:06,295
[Buntaro] Say something!

428
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:09,211
- [gasps, grunting]
- [banging continues]

429
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:11,711
[panting]

430
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:16,211
[Fuji pants]

431
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,670
Get out of the way. I said move. Damn you.

432
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,253
[Fuji] My uncle has already left.

433
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:20,711
Get out of the way!

434
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:21,628
[in Japanese] Now!

435
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,170
[pants]

436
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,003
[Mariko sobs]

437
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:29,503
[in English] Get back! [sobs]

438
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:33,211
[in Japanese]
He should not have seen this.

439
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:35,253
- [sighs]
- [in English] Oh, Christ.

440
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:39,211
[in Japanese] I tried to stop him

441
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:41,711
but he won't listen.

442
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:44,711
I ask that you both leave.

443
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:47,878
Please leave!

444
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:49,211
[sobs]

445
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:53,711
If you disturb this home,
you dishonor the Anjin.

446
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:56,836
[sobbing]

447
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,878
What is there to dishonor?

448
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,253
This house is cursed.

449
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,503
[sobbing]

450
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:17,128
[in English] Buntaro!

451
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:19,545
Look at me!

452
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:19,878
Oh, what are you doing?

453
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:20,961
Get up!

454
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:25,295
[Buntaro, in Japanese]
I've disturbed the harmony of your home.

455
00:35:25,961 --> 00:35:28,545
Please forgive me.

456
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:32,670
Saké.

457
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:34,670
[in English] Sake?

458
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:38,420
Is that your excuse?

459
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:41,670
Get up, you bastard, on your feet!

460
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:44,295
[spectator whispers]

461
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:55,086
[in Japanese] Because of the saké.

462
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:03,836
[in English] Sake.

463
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,045
You piece of shit.

464
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:04,752
[in Japanese]
Their feathers are too damp, Muraji.

465
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:06,294
I agree.

466
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:09,544
But hiding the pigeons here

467
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,336
was your idea in the first place.

468
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:14,502
[scoffs]

469
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:18,586
Yabushige is hunting
for a spy in your village.

470
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:25,127
Lord, please allow me to surrender myself.

471
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:26,919
[Toranaga] Not a chance.

472
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:30,086
Your real name is Tonomoto Akinao,

473
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:34,252
my long-serving, prized samurai.

474
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:38,169
You will remain my spy.

475
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:41,169
Then what's to be done?

476
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:44,044
[Toranaga] Find him another spy.

477
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,586
We can't go on like this.

478
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:55,502
The stench of death,
arrows sticking from our walls...

479
00:37:56,336 --> 00:38:01,002
Villagers are starting to whisper
there's a tatarigami in your house.

480
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:04,002
[in English] Morning.
Where is Mariko-<i>sama</i>?

481
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,919
[in Japanese]
Anjin, I have a favor to ask.

482
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:12,377
This awful smell. May we get rid of it?

483
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:15,169
I don't understand anything you're saying.
Where is she?

484
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,711
[Fuji sighs, grunts]

485
00:38:21,086 --> 00:38:23,502
[horse approaching]

486
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,211
[Blackthorne] You all right?

487
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:46,002
All of this is my doing.

488
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:50,752
Mariko-<i>sama,</i> your husband's brutality
is no fault of yours.

489
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:54,627
We should not be seen together.

490
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,211
Ah, the pox on that.

491
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,961
Don't put it behind that folded fence
of yours, whatever you call it.

492
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,461
[stutters] I see you.

493
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:01,544
Your disgust for him.

494
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:04,336
If you wanna be free of that
shitless coward, then be free of him.

495
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,961
Still, you understand so little.

496
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:11,711
Your swords.

497
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:15,502
Fuji-<i>sama</i> believes they were
given to her father as a battle honor.

498
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:20,127
The truth is he died a coward,
begging for his life.

499
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:22,252
Her grandfather bought them
from a drunken samurai

500
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:24,961
for three bags of rice
to spare her the embarrassment.

501
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:27,252
But she knows nothing, and we say nothing.

502
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:31,127
Because our silence is what she merits.

503
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,419
I will give my husband nothing.

504
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,961
Not even my hatred.

505
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:45,544
Because that is what he merits.

506
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:54,127
It's a good story, Mariko-<i>sama.</i>

507
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:56,961
And I understand the sentiment,
but you take it too far.

508
00:39:57,502 --> 00:40:01,461
Honestly, shuffling around with your
manners and your buried self for what?

509
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,961
I would not expect for you to understand.

510
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,669
Oh, forgive me,
but you'd die to avenge your father.

511
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:11,627
You'd live in anguish
to spite your husband.

512
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,711
Which is it?

513
00:40:12,794 --> 00:40:14,044
What becomes of you?

514
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:19,086
My life is mine, and yours is yours.

515
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:26,711
If you can't see that,
you'll never be free of this prison.

516
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:31,919
No, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

517
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,169
It is you who is imprisoned.

518
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:42,752
If freedom is all you ever live for,
you will never be free of yourself.

519
00:40:48,294 --> 00:40:50,502
I will honor my duty as your translator.

520
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:54,336
But from this day forward,

521
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,919
the only words we share
will be from others' lips.

522
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:36,252
What's the matter with everyone?

523
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:43,544
What is it?

524
00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:50,627
Pheasant.

525
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:53,669
[in Japanese] Bird

526
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:54,586
Who

527
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:56,961
Took

528
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:00,169
It was Uejirou.

529
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:02,127
[in English] Our gardener?

530
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:06,794
Old bastard should get a medal
just for being able to climb up there.

531
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:08,877
It's fine.

532
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,961
It's been up there long enough anyway.

533
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,002
[in Japanese] Uejirou, good.

534
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:17,711
Fetch him.

535
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:21,377
Uejirou is dead.

536
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,461
Dead?

537
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:29,586
How?

538
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:32,127
Lord.

539
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:36,461
Because you said it was forbidden.

540
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:39,211
'If touch... die!'

541
00:42:40,336 --> 00:42:41,669
[in English] What have you done?

542
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:52,544
You put that old man to death
over a stinking, God-cursed pheasant.

543
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:56,211
[sniffles]

544
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:00,586
What the hell is wrong with you?

545
00:43:02,794 --> 00:43:04,586
[in Japanese]
It is my responsibility to bear.

546
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:07,086
[in English] Why in Christ's name
didn't you ask me?

547
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,294
[Fuji, in Japanese] Please...

548
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:12,919
Please take my life.

549
00:43:14,544 --> 00:43:16,127
[breathing shakily]

550
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:21,711
[in English] Go away.

551
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,752
All of you!

552
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:30,044
[breathes shakily]

553
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:32,836
Go away!

554
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,419
[in Japanese] It was my fault
for being difficult with my husband.

555
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:55,294
I beg your forgiveness.

556
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,461
Buntaro may do
whatever he wishes to his wife.

557
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:02,961
But right now I cannot have
my translator harmed.

558
00:44:03,044 --> 00:44:04,586
[horse whinnies]

559
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:07,627
[Nagakado] Lord, you have another visitor.

560
00:44:09,086 --> 00:44:09,919
Excuse me.

561
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:23,377
[Blackthorne, in English] Lord.

562
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,169
When we were at sea, we discussed
my training your army in European combat.

563
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:30,169
I feel I have now fulfilled that duty.

564
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:37,211
I ask that my ship and my men be returned
to me so that I may leave and not return.

565
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:42,336
[in Japanese] Your arrangement
about training the cannon regiment...

566
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:46,002
He believes it is now complete.

567
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:48,294
And...

568
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:53,419
he would like to leave Japan permanently.

569
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:03,211
There's a shadow on both of you.

570
00:45:06,252 --> 00:45:08,169
[in English] He asks what troubles you.

571
00:45:08,752 --> 00:45:10,627
I am troubled by your whole damn country.

572
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,044
Life has no value to you.

573
00:45:14,836 --> 00:45:17,586
Only the meaningless rituals
you are trapped in.

574
00:45:19,169 --> 00:45:23,711
Like Uejirou, who died for nothing.

575
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:26,836
[in Japanese] He's upset about
a matter with his gardener.

576
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:31,669
He will stop acting like a child.

577
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:36,127
[Mariko] It is my understanding that
you ordered no one to touch that bird.

578
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:38,961
And by law,
your house could not disobey that order.

579
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:41,877
Nor could they allow the rotting pheasant
to ruin the peace of the village.

580
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:43,169
The bird meant nothing to me.

581
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:45,502
Your words gave it meaning.

582
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:52,669
[Toranaga]
I can't be bothered with this nonsense.

583
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:54,919
Hmm.

584
00:45:57,836 --> 00:46:00,836
[in English] A meeting was called
with Muraji who is the village headman.

585
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:03,502
But he determined it was a house problem.

586
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:05,544
So someone had to steal it and bury it.

587
00:46:06,044 --> 00:46:08,877
And Uejirou announced that he had been
sick lately, so he volunteered.

588
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:12,836
He died for a great purpose.

589
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:15,044
It was a better end
than he could have hoped for.

590
00:46:18,794 --> 00:46:19,794
I killed him.

591
00:46:23,169 --> 00:46:25,127
Lord, forgive me. I killed that old man.

592
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:29,294
There is no use dwelling
on what cannot be undone.

593
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:31,252
How can you believe that?

594
00:46:31,336 --> 00:46:34,919
We live and we die.

595
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,002
[birds squawking]

596
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,377
[Mariko] We control nothing beyond that.

597
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:42,961
[rumbling]

598
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:45,794
- [samurai shouting]
- [rumbling intensifies]

599
00:46:45,877 --> 00:46:47,544
[samurai shouting]

600
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:55,002
[rumbling intensifies]

601
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:56,294
[samurai shouting]

602
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:13,461
[in Japanese] Don't move!

603
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,169
[samurai shouting]

604
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:18,002
[grunts]

605
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,711
[gasps]

606
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:21,711
[panting, grunts]

607
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:23,419
[in English] Jesus!

608
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:24,919
[in Japanese] Father!

609
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:28,044
[Blackthorne, in English]
Where the hell is he? [panting]

610
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:30,211
[grunting]

611
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:32,294
[grunting]

612
00:47:43,336 --> 00:47:45,961
[grunting, panting]

613
00:47:46,044 --> 00:47:47,044
He's here!

614
00:47:49,794 --> 00:47:51,627
[panting, grunting]

615
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:52,961
[in Japanese] Father!

616
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:55,919
[Blackthorne] Clear his head!

617
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:57,086
There he is.

618
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,794
[samurai straining, panting]

619
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:12,961
- [speaks Japanese]
- [grunting]

620
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,877
[coughing, wheezing]

621
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:20,002
[gasping]

622
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:26,211
[Nagakado] Any injuries?

623
00:48:26,294 --> 00:48:27,127
[Mariko] Lord!

624
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:33,002
[coughing, breathing heavily]

625
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,377
[Mariko] Your swords...

626
00:48:35,752 --> 00:48:37,961
[panting]

627
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:50,127
These belonged to Fuji's father.

628
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:54,961
They may not be much but I'd be honored
if you would accept this gift.

629
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:56,044
[sighs]

630
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,502
[laughing, panting]

631
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:09,919
[in Japanese] Thank you.

632
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:15,586
[samurai shouting]

633
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,211
[Nagakado] Father.

634
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,627
Look...

635
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:28,086
- [samurai shouting, speaking Japanese]
- [rumbling]

636
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:59,502
[villagers sobbing, shouting]

637
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:22,211
[horse whinnies]

638
00:50:22,294 --> 00:50:25,002
[villager shouts]

639
00:50:37,336 --> 00:50:38,336
[gasps]

640
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:52,002
[sighs]

641
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:55,211
We only discovered these
after the earthquake.

642
00:51:57,336 --> 00:51:58,961
As my uncle said,

643
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:02,419
there was a filthy spy all along.

644
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:05,544
Who lives here?

645
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:09,169
An old gardener.

646
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:11,044
Name was Uejirou.

647
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,961
Worked for the barbarian.

648
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:16,919
Died just yesterday.

649
00:52:20,461 --> 00:52:21,669
Lucky for him.

650
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:02,919
[Yaechiyo] Mother!

651
00:53:11,544 --> 00:53:16,836
Glad you've returned safely, Lady Ochiba.

652
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:36,086
I owe you my gratitude, Lord Ishido.

653
00:53:37,044 --> 00:53:40,461
I'm told my release from Edo was
thanks to your Council

654
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:44,544
putting pressure on Toranaga.

655
00:53:45,252 --> 00:53:52,002
The Regents are pleased
for your safe return.

656
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:59,294
I'm also told
the Council was outmaneuvered.

657
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:05,502
That Toranaga has once again
conspired and paralyzed it.

658
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:10,002
I will restore the Council.

659
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:11,086
When?

660
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,794
[chuckles, sighs]

661
00:54:17,086 --> 00:54:20,169
Forgive my impatience.

662
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:26,961
But I fear for my son's future.

663
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:31,169
If anyone attempted to harm
the Taikō's heir,

664
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:32,836
I would give my life.

665
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:33,877
In that case...

666
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:38,919
The time for politics has come to an end.

667
00:54:44,336 --> 00:54:51,336
The Council will answer to me.
