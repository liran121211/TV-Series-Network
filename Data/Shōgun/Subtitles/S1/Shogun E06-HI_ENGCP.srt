00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,167
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on </i>Shogun<i>.</i>

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Look who it is!

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,125
He's alive!

4
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:19,083
Tell him about the disgusting,
filthy line you come from.

5
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:22,250
[in English] I am daughter
of the late Lord Akechi Jinsai.

6
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,708
My father's Lord was ruler of Japan
before the Taiko.

7
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,042
So my father killed him
out of love for the Realm.

8
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,500
Get back!

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,917
Your husband's brutality
is no fault of yours.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,333
We should not be seen together.

11
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,917
From this day forward, the only words
we share will be from others' lips.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,958
- [samurai yelling]
- [grunts]

13
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,042
[in Japanese] Father!

14
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,250
- [grunts]
- [pants]

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,375
[Nagakado] Father. Look…

16
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:47,542
[Yaechiyo] Mother!

17
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:50,542
[Daiyoin] Glad you've returned safely,
Lady Ochiba.

18
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,708
I'm told the Council is outmaneuvered.

19
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,000
The time for politics has come to an end.

20
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:02,792
The Council will answer to me.

21
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,875
- [Young Ochiba speaks Japanese]
- [laughing]

22
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,583
This is Mariko.

23
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,542
She's the daughter of Akechi Jinsai,
my new vassal.

24
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,875
Make her feel welcome.

25
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:43,625
[humming]

26
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,792
[laughing]

27
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:54,458
[Kuroda] You got something to say to me?
You insolent lout!

28
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,250
[humming continues]

29
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,958
[young Ochiba]
Why are they so angry with each other?

30
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,250
[samurai, monks grunting]

31
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,875
[Toranaga] Akechi wait…

32
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,125
Be patient.

33
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,000
I know how you're feeling…

34
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,625
Now is not the time.

35
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,250
[grunting]

36
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,333
[breathes shakily]

37
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,250
Go back to bed, Mariko.

38
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,042
You're only dreaming.

39
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,042
[humming ends]

40
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,167
[shouting, grunting]

41
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,125
[referee] Ippon!

42
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,083
- [shouting, grunting]
- She's good.

43
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,750
[referee] Enough!

44
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:52,250
[Mariko] I don't understand
why he's doing this…

45
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,666
Your marriage to Buntaro
will be an alliance

46
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,750
for both families to smile on.

47
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,250
That's a joke.

48
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,417
You know the Toda clan is
a worthless alliance.

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,792
But your father treasures you.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,375
Then why is he casting me away?

51
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,958
Mariko.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,750
All these years
and I still don't understand you.

53
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,416
We have every privilege.

54
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:36,042
Let us choose to look away
from what we cannot control.

55
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,125
[chuckles]

56
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,250
[Akechi] <i>Mariko…
my most cherished daughter.</i>

57
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,208
<i>It pains me to see you
with so many questions.</i>

58
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:08,042
<i>You have always been an obedient child,</i>

59
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:12,083
<i>but now I ask that you serve
something greater…</i>

60
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,458
<i>Your duty is what endures.</i>

61
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,375
[raindrops pattering]

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,167
<i>There is nothing more.</i>

63
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,667
[Toranaga] We have all suffered
so much loss…

64
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:10,708
You may feel unable
to bear the weight of it.

65
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,208
But death is the end of having lived.

66
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:23,958
It is an affirmation of life itself.

67
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:29,542
Anjin.

68
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,208
Come forward.

69
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,875
During the earthquake,

70
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,000
the Anjin saved my life for a second time.

71
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,624
I will grant him

72
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,583
a fief near Kanagawa, worth 600 koku.

73
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,333
[in English] For your bravery,

74
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,625
he has decided to grant you a fief

75
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,083
that will provide an annual salary
of 600 koku.

76
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,582
[in Japanese]
He is now chief admiral of the Kantō.

77
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,000
And general in charge
of our cannon regiment.

78
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,018
[in English]
He has also made you his chief admiral

79
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:06,000
and general of the cannon regiment.

80
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,208
[in Japanese]
For all those who lost their lives…

81
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,042
their deaths will not be wasted.

82
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,792
[chanting]

83
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,833
[all chanting]

84
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,208
[Yabushige] <i>Thousands dead.</i>

85
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,500
[groans]

86
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,083
Reports are even worse in the north.

87
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,292
We'll never be able
to face Ishido like this.

88
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
So…

89
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,583
The Anjin now commands
the cannon regiment?

90
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,833
It's Toranaga's decision.

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,125
The army used to be mine,
but now it's out of my hands.

92
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,875
Even so...

93
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,583
For a barbarian...

94
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,291
What are you on about?

95
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,333
Our forces are in shambles.

96
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,250
Any day now
we'll be dragged into this fruitless war,

97
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,292
and your concern is just one barbarian?

98
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:32,542
[exclaims]

99
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,458
[grunts]

100
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,875
Time to write another will.

101
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,042
[sighs]

102
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,792
[grunting, breathing shakily]

103
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,292
[Mariko praying in Latin]

104
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,958
[praying continues]

105
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,722
[in English]
Our Father, who art in heaven…

106
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,912
- [stops praying]
- [Blackthorne] …hallowed be thy name.

107
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,250
[praying in Latin]

108
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,518
[Blackthorne, in English]
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

109
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,833
on Earth as it is in heaven.

110
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,250
- [continues in Latin]
- Give us this day our daily bread.

111
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,000
And forgive us our trespasses,

112
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,375
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

113
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,083
And lead us not into temptation,

114
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,792
but deliver us from evil.

115
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,625
- For thine is the kingdom…
- [Latin stops]

116
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,458
…the power and the glory,
for ever and ever.

117
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,500
- Amen.
- [Blackthorne] Amen.

118
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,333
[thunder rumbles]

119
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,917
[indistinct chatter]

120
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,440
[Buntaro, in Japanese]
Lord, for the way I've embarrassed you…

121
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,708
I am truly ashamed.

122
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,292
Not me.

123
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,207
You've embarrassed your household,

124
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,208
and the home of my hatamoto.

125
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:22,292
I am no longer useful to you.

126
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,042
I lose myself when I'm around her.

127
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,208
Then divorce her.

128
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,708
Please forgive me…

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,167
Not now, after all these years.

130
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:42,417
After her father's treachery,

131
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,333
I thought she'd be grateful
I spared her life.

132
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,542
But she has always been ice.

133
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,417
Asking for death, again and again.

134
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,417
For years, the ice has not melted.

135
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,250
But…

136
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,167
With him, it's different.

137
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,042
[samurai] My Lord,
you have another visitor.

138
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:20,542
Mariko is only doing what I demand of her,

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,167
which is more than I can say of you.

140
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,583
I order you…

141
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:29,000
To isolate yourself from her
for seven days.

142
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,250
Yes, sir.

143
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,167
Anjin.

144
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,292
The Anjin asked for my time.

145
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,173
[in English] Please tell him I am sorry
about what happened to his army.

146
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,958
[in Japanese]
He says he is sorry for your army.

147
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,322
[in English] However, I must ask

148
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,083
why he lavished me with the gift
of his cannon regiment last night.

149
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,000
[in Japanese] These many gifts
you've blessed him with...

150
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,374
He wishes to know why.

151
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,583
He questions my generosity?

152
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,434
[in English] He asks if you refuse them.

153
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,143
[Blackthorne]
It's not a matter of refusing.

154
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,917
I've already explained this to him before.

155
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,375
I'm unable to serve him
in the way he wishes me to.

156
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,250
So I wish to leave.

157
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,917
[in Japanese] He cannot fulfill
the service you ask of him.

158
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,375
And says he still wishes to leave Japan.

159
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,125
Which service does he prefer?

160
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,625
[in English] He asks what service
you would rather be given.

161
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,750
If I were to remain in the Japans,

162
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,750
I would formally ask again
for the return of my ship…

163
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,000
[in Japanese]
He asks for the return of his ship.

164
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,393
[in English] …so that I may sail
against his enemies and mine,

165
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,833
the Portuguese.

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,625
[Mariko, in Japanese]
So he might sail against the Portuguese.

167
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,458
[in English] As his chief admiral,

168
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,708
there are still ways
I can disrupt his enemies.

169
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,750
For example, I could attack
the Portuguese Black Ship at sea,

170
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,625
harming trade to the port controlled
by his Catholic rivals on the Council.

171
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,833
I'm told their names are Kiyama and Ohno.

172
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:33,667
Thus stifling the flow of Portuguese
Catholic wealth and its accompanying power

173
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,250
which will ultimately be brandished
against him and his country.

174
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
This is not in our Lord's interest.

175
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,167
I'm sorry, were you going to translate?

176
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,625
[in Japanese] The Anjin wishes
to attack the Black Ship

177
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,332
in order to harm trade in ports
controlled by the Catholic Regents.

178
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,542
What cause would I have
to attack a friendly nation?

179
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,018
[in English] He says that
the Portuguese are a friendly nation,

180
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,417
and he would never attack their vessel.

181
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,458
The Portuguese are neither here
for the good of Japan nor Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

182
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,268
They're here to gain
in the name of their God.

183
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,625
Why do you cling to this?

184
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,417
[in Japanese] What is this arguing?

185
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:26,417
[in English] Excuse me. I am reminded
an interpreter should interpret only.

186
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,708
Well, seeing as you're my interpreter
and nothing more,

187
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,458
I would politely ask you to tell him

188
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,833
Portugal is friendly
only to their profits.

189
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,917
[in Japanese] He believes
the Portuguese are only here to profit.

190
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,958
I will not be discussing this any further.

191
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,208
[in English] That is all for now.

192
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,000
[in Japanese] You stay.

193
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,292
What is between you and the Anjin?

194
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Nothing.

195
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,833
Only words.

196
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,167
I won't tolerate
this disruption in my clan.

197
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,042
We are dangerously close to defeat.

198
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,583
I understand.

199
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,374
One cannot serve themselves
above the cause.

200
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,917
The Anjin will not be granted his request.

201
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,041
But to settle his mind,

202
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,208
please arrange for him
a night at a brothel.

203
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:36,208
Hire their finest courtesan.

204
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,542
I will negotiate personally.

205
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,292
And join him.

206
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,625
As a translator.

207
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:54,292
In case he talks while he pillows.

208
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:09,667
[screaming]

209
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,958
[samurai 2] Arson! Run away!

210
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,333
[breathing shakily]

211
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,500
Ishido's taken the Regents hostage.

212
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,916
They've been locked in the castle,
along with their families.

213
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,833
He's forcing their vote against Toranaga.

214
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,375
We leave now.

215
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,125
Come, this way.

216
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,458
Please hurry Shizu, get on this.

217
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,917
[grunting, wincing]

218
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
She won't make it.

219
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,042
We'll only slow you down.

220
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,082
You must warn Toranaga yourself.

221
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:47,958
No.

222
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,833
Please, I beg you.

223
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,500
- Hurry!
- I'm sorry.

224
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,167
[samurai] Stop him! Stop!

225
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,583
By Lord Ishido, I order you to stop!

226
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,292
Don't let him through! Stop!

227
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,875
It's Toda!

228
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:20,625
[in English] Refused at the gates.
It is even worse than we thought.

229
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,708
What has happened, Eminence?

230
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,167
[priest] Osaka Castle's been locked down.

231
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,042
Ishido claims
there is a plot to kill the Heir.

232
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,667
And he's order... [grunts]

233
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,375
And he's ordered that
no Regent shall be allowed to leave

234
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,417
until they can elect the fifth member
and sentence Toranaga to death.

235
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,667
This is her doing.

236
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,042
Lady Ochiba?

237
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:47,958
This campaign to eliminate Toranaga,
it has accelerated since her return.

238
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,875
That woman has no such power.

239
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,375
I would not underestimate her, Eminence.

240
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,375
Child of a murdered <i>busho</i>.

241
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,458
[priest sighs]

242
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,417
The only consort
to give the Taiko an heir.

243
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,042
And she despises the Church.

244
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:06,708
I think the time has come for us
to turn towards Toranaga as an ally.

245
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,917
That man is a Minowara, Martin.

246
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,042
I have never understood
this hold he has on you.

247
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:17,792
Let us pray that we can bring him
to our side when this is done.

248
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,708
[humming]

249
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,792
[humming continues]

250
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,625
[laughing]

251
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,083
[person, in Japanese] There's no time!

252
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,167
Lady Ruri!

253
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,542
Dress.

254
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,875
You must leave at once.

255
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,250
Your father was murdered in Kyoto.

256
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,000
[breathing shakily]

257
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:16,042
[person 2 shouting]
Keep that fire in check! Protect the lady!

258
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,583
Never return.

259
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,708
[child] <i>Mother…</i>

260
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,583
Mother…

261
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,708
[chuckles]

262
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,792
It's time for you to go now.

263
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:36,125
[actors singing]

264
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:43,167
[flute playing]

265
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,208
[actors] <i>He slays the false vassal.</i>

266
00:20:53,542 --> 00:21:00,417
<i>He slays the false vassal.</i>

267
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:25,958
We're prisoners to that woman.

268
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,250
It serves no one to say such things.

269
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,500
This will be over soon…

270
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,583
When?

271
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,250
When the fifth Regent is confirmed
and Toranaga's threat is eliminated.

272
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,832
Then Ishido will release the hostages.

273
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:52,667
We'll always be their hostages now.

274
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,292
We're just puppets.

275
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,958
It's the end of the Realm.

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
[performance continues]

277
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:24,625
Is this the era of peace
our Taikō fought to build?

278
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,000
We cannot be too safe these days.

279
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,208
Nonsense.

280
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,208
Ishido is nothing more
than the Taikō's favored koshô.

281
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,208
Good at some things, never great.

282
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,167
You are choosing the wrong ally.

283
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:54,833
<i>Dear Lady Ochiba…</i>

284
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,208
[singing echoing, fading]

285
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:13,667
[Daiyoin] I was sorry to hear
of your father's death.

286
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,750
Terrible, how powerless we can be to fate.

287
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:24,458
We are all just pebbles,
pushed and pulled by the currents.

288
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:27,458
My husband is the ruler of Japan,

289
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:34,417
and I was unable to give him an heir…
did you know that?

290
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:40,375
This has been in my family
for over a hundred years.

291
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:45,250
It is the only one of its kind.

292
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:52,083
I am prepared to pass it on
to the consort who can bear us a son.

293
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,833
<i>You would be known
as "Ochiba no kata" from now on.</i>

294
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,250
[singing echoes]

295
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,250
[Daiyoin] <i>A woman may lose everything
she's ever had...</i>

296
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,167
<i>But she may also take it back.</i>

297
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,500
<i>She must stare without fear
into the cruel eyes of fate...</i>

298
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:30,583
<i>And make herself seen.</i>

299
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:47,417
[actor] <i>If we have a son,</i>

300
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:59,125
<i>prestige will spread in every direction…</i>

301
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,333
[singing ends]

302
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,708
[Ishido] Lord Ito…

303
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:19,917
Your depiction of our late master was
quite profound.

304
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:23,542
Too kind, Lord Ishido.

305
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:30,833
I am but a weak flicker
to his glow of light.

306
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,208
You're not alone.

307
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,458
As a boy,

308
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,542
I looked up to the Taikō as proof

309
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:42,875
that even a peasant like me
could lift himself to great heights.

310
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,375
[chuckles]

311
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:47,333
Some are born under a banner of greatness,

312
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,250
others must claim it.

313
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,583
Your nōh skills are unparalleled,
Lord Ito.

314
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:05,125
Though you are taller
than the Taikō I once served.

315
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,250
[chuckles]

316
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:11,208
If only I could cut myself at the knees…

317
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,500
A minor fault, of course.

318
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,833
[both chuckle]

319
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:18,375
[Ito] I take it seriously.

320
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:23,375
Acting is my grand passion.

321
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,458
And how about politics?

322
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,792
Have you heard of the plot
against the Heir?

323
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,958
Toranaga's provocations
must come to an end.

324
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:40,292
Would you join the Council
and vote for his death?

325
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:49,083
I'm grateful for your wisdom
in suggesting Lord Ito.

326
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,375
In all my time with the Taikō,

327
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,292
he never spoke of a woman
like he spoke of you.

328
00:26:56,333 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm beginning to understand why.

329
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,458
I miss the Taikō's strength.

330
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,458
Truly.

331
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:16,500
It's as if we live in his shadow.

332
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,375
In most ways.

333
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,625
Though, in the end, he fell short.

334
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,667
He failed to rid us of Toranaga.

335
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,833
Why is it you hate him so much?

336
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,833
Eliminate Toranaga…

337
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:46,292
and it will be your shadow we speak of.

338
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,833
[Toranaga] All of Osaka belongs
to Ishido now.

339
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,583
You are lucky to have escaped alive.

340
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,250
This is lunacy.

341
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,750
My father has only ever been
loyal to the Heir.

342
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,083
They are the ones who conspire!

343
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:29,250
Our allies are pressured
into becoming our enemies

344
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,042
with each passing day.

345
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:38,750
Unless they see
through this obscenity and protest.

346
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:42,625
If we wait for that, it will be too late.

347
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:45,917
The time has come…

348
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,667
…for Crimson Sky.

349
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,458
What is Crimson Sky?

350
00:28:57,292 --> 00:29:01,542
[Hiromatsu] A plan formulated long ago…

351
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:07,375
A single, violent rush on Osaka Castle.

352
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:12,958
We would eliminate the Council
and form a new government.

353
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:18,125
With Toranaga as sole Regent.

354
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,125
Shōgun…

355
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,458
[exhales sharply]

356
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:26,042
An attack on Osaka is
like strangling your own neck.

357
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:31,249
Ishido's allies control the city.

358
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,125
[Hiromatsu] Lord Toranaga's half-brother…

359
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,250
Saeki Nobutatsu.
We could join forces with him.

360
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,917
It wouldn't be enough.

361
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,125
What would you do, Omi?

362
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,667
A fifth Council member,
obedient to Ishido,

363
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,708
will mean your death sentence.

364
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,375
Then it is Crimson Sky.

365
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,167
[Omi] Perhaps that could work, but…

366
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:05,667
Why take the risk when there's still time?

367
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,000
There's no time for waiting.

368
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,667
Father...

369
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,333
Reclaim our family's legacy
and become Shōgun.

370
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:14,624
You have never lost a battle...

371
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,583
Because I've never been first
to declare one!

372
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,458
There will be no Crimson Sky.

373
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,708
I have never sought to be Shōgun,

374
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,042
and I never will.

375
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:33,083
Find me a plan that isn't certain death.

376
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,125
[sliding door opens, closes]

377
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:41,083
[Mariko] You will forgive
the late notice, Gin,

378
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,624
but Toranaga instructed me

379
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:46,000
to inquire if the Lady Kiku is
free tonight.

380
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,708
What an honor.

381
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,625
[sighs]

382
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,375
And such lovely lacquerware too.

383
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,000
Unfortunately, it's nothing special.

384
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,417
I'm ashamed we must use it,

385
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,292
but so much was destroyed
in the earthquake.

386
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,375
Mmm.

387
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:15,625
Lady Kiku would be honored
to attend to this client.

388
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,958
Although…

389
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:22,500
I'd have to reimburse others
who booked her.

390
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,792
And, after the earthquake fires,

391
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:30,958
poor Kiku had four kosodes
ruined by water.

392
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:33,500
Hard times for us all.

393
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,750
500 monme would be acceptable.

394
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:40,083
So sorry, perhaps I wasn't clear.

395
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,417
I do not wish to buy
all the Tea Houses in Izu,

396
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,875
only the Lady's services for one evening.

397
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:52,792
I don't know if you've heard
of my Tea House,

398
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,708
but please understand
it is no ordinary brothel.

399
00:31:56,792 --> 00:32:00,250
I might even say there is no place
like it in all of Japan.

400
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:04,375
My ladies are artists
of the very first class.

401
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:08,000
They enrich the mind
and nurture the spirit.

402
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,208
I assure you

403
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:14,000
the price is quite merited.

404
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,750
Then 100 monme.

405
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:22,542
400 monme would be the lowest I could go.

406
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:29,417
Surely Lord Toranaga
would want to enjoy his evening.

407
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,542
Oh, so sorry...

408
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,292
Lady Kiku is not for Lord Toranaga.

409
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,583
She is a gift for the Anjin.

410
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,042
[coughs, swallows]

411
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,875
He is hatamoto now,

412
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:47,292
and chief admiral
of Lord Toranaga's cannon regiment.

413
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,208
I would think 200 monme are enough.

414
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:55,457
Then, will you be joining him?

415
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,542
It's only…

416
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:03,917
I've heard you and the Anjin
are never seen apart.

417
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,667
It is my duty to translate, yes.

418
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:13,167
Then I think you will enjoy your time
in my Tea House.

419
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:20,000
Some call it the Willow World,

420
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,583
because my ladies
are like lilies in a lake.

421
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
There you will find no prying eyes
from the outside world.

422
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,333
All of this I guarantee…
for so very little.

423
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,667
300 monme will suffice.

424
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,708
You will be treasured guests.

425
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:55,374
Lady Gin says with Lord Toranaga's support

426
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:59,125
I could become
the most cherished courtesan in the Kantō.

427
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,583
[sighs]

428
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,708
I don't understand why Lord Toranaga

429
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:13,792
values the barbarian so much.

430
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:20,125
The barbarian is nothing to me.

431
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,976
[Mariko, in English]
This is a great honor you have received.

432
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,333
Lady Kiku is
the most coveted courtesan in Izu.

433
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,292
It's not the honor so much

434
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,667
as being unable to understand
why in Christ's name I'm receiving it.

435
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,458
Usually wives like me are not permitted
to go through the gate.

436
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,667
But in this case
a special exception has been made.

437
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,625
Does Toranaga-<i>sama</i> know about…

438
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,417
There is nothing to know.

439
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,125
[groans]

440
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,167
[Mariko] Gin's Tea House is
famed for its many wonders,

441
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,625
but you must be careful.

442
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,708
Our every gesture is being observed.

443
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:23,250
[courtesan, in Japanese] Welcome.

444
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,750
[Gin] I hope you will enjoy
your private evening.

445
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:15,583
[in English] What do I say?

446
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,958
[Mariko] It is fitting
to share your reaction.

447
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,500
Tell her she's beautiful.

448
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,750
[in Japanese] "<i>Sonata wa utsukushii</i>."

449
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:35,791
I am honored to serve the Anjin

450
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,458
on this beautiful evening.

451
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:42,958
And I'm grateful that Lady Mariko
has also come to this place.

452
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,750
[in English] It does feel
like we're being watched.

453
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,208
We must try our best to find this
as pleasurable as possible.

454
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,750
And how am I to find this pleasurable?

455
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,958
By not making a scene.
For both of our sakes.

456
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,458
Compliment the way she poured your sake.

457
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,917
It is considered a rare art.

458
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,833
Courtesans like Kiku-<i>dono
</i>study it for years.

459
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,833
You pour very well.

460
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,782
[Mariko, in Japanese]
The Anjin compliments your service.

461
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,958
[sips, swallows]

462
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:54,333
I imagine everything is quite different
from his homeland.

463
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,958
[in English] She assumes it is different
from where you're from.

464
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,333
I'd say so.

465
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,792
Where I come from our prostitutes
are neither this well presented

466
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,250
nor as inquisitive.

467
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:09,625
[in Japanese]
He seems to prefer his homeland.

468
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,542
May I?

469
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,625
[sighs, in English] Why not?

470
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,625
Another fine pour.

471
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,999
[in Japanese]
Hana, look where the flask just was.

472
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,208
What do you see?

473
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,875
I see nothing, Elder Sister.

474
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:39,000
[Kiku]
You see where the flask is no longer.

475
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,833
Presence is felt most keenly in absence.

476
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,042
[Hana] Yes, Elder Sister.

477
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,559
[in English] Kiku-<i>dono</i> teaches
her young apprentice

478
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,250
about empty space and its symbols.

479
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,500
[grunts]

480
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,708
[Kiku] Mariko.

481
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,958
[in Japanese]
Where we are is a private place.

482
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:14,500
Dark… if one wants it dark.

483
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:22,292
A woman cannot look away
when another suffers.

484
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,792
Perhaps the Anjin would allow me
to explain

485
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,292
why the Willow World is among

486
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,208
the most treasured planes of existence.

487
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,250
[in English] She wishes to explain to you
the meaning of the Willow World.

488
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:02,500
[in Japanese] People who come to this
place have something they wish to forget.

489
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:09,500
Be it boredom, pain,
hardship, disappointment.

490
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,292
[Mariko, in English]
Most come here to escape

491
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:17,250
from boredom or pain,
hardship or disappointment.

492
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:22,292
[in Japanese] They believe this place is
about physical pleasure…

493
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,895
[in English] They believe this place is
about physical pleasure,

494
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:26,875
which it is.

495
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,250
But it can be more.

496
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:34,083
[in Japanese] The people I meet…

497
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:37,167
[in English] The people she meets wish
for a different life or circumstance.

498
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,750
[Kiku speaks Japanese]

499
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,875
[Mariko, in English] They want to be
anyplace other than where they are.

500
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:47,167
[Kiku, in Japanese]
I offer you relief from this.

501
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,542
[in English] I offer you relief from this…

502
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,167
[Kiku speaks Japanese]

503
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,708
[in English] …and safety
to create one perfect moment

504
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,833
that you wish to inhabit completely.

505
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,333
[Kiku speaks Japanese]

506
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,917
[Mariko, in English]
Settle your eyes on what you desire.

507
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,583
My unclothed form.

508
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:15,958
Just as I am with nothing between us.

509
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,167
I ask you into my openness.

510
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,208
I ask you.

511
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:29,167
[in Japanese] …to be here with me now.

512
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,583
[breathes shakily]

513
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:49,375
[Kiku] I would like to invite the Anjin
into a private room.

514
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,167
[Mariko, in English]
She invites you away with her now.

515
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,625
[in Japanese] Will you join us?

516
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,750
It must only be you.

517
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:10,875
[sighs]

518
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,083
It's the barbarian.

519
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:12,458
- That's Lady Kiku.
- She's so pretty.

520
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,000
[Kiku] Thank you kindly.

521
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,683
[Nagakado] All my father does
is lavish him with gifts these days.

522
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,000
Fortune does appear to smile on him.

523
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,883
[in English] Please tell Lady Kiku
I don't have the words to thank her.

524
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,917
[in Japanese] He expresses his gratitude.

525
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,083
Tell him, please visit again.

526
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,833
I will count the moments.

527
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:47,458
[in English] She is honored.

528
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,708
[sighs]

529
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,583
[sighs]

530
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,078
[in Japanese] How did it go?

531
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,208
The Anjin was pleased with his gift.

532
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,750
Kiku is exceptional.

533
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:37,958
Mariko…

534
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:42,042
What do you remember of your childhood?

535
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,583
I recall you being close
with Ochiba no kata.

536
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,833
She was Ruri then.

537
00:44:57,417 --> 00:44:59,292
After she became Ochiba no kata,

538
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,542
I have not seen her since.

539
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,125
The way she wars against us…

540
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:16,708
What could have turned her
into the woman she is today?

541
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:19,417
Fate.

542
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:22,458
Hardship.

543
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:27,083
We all have things we must war against.

544
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:33,583
Yet most of us do it with honor.

545
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,708
[chuckles]

546
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,208
[Mariko] Forgive me…

547
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,542
but most of you are men.

548
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:53,458
A man may go to war for many reasons.

549
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:55,583
Conquest,

550
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,208
pride,

551
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,292
power…

552
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:02,083
But a woman

553
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:08,417
is simply at war.

554
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,083
[chuckles]

555
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,000
Your father once told me

556
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:20,083
he wished you'd been born a man.

557
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,625
Now I see why.

558
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:29,792
He had great plans for you.

559
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:40,250
Then he should have married me better.

560
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,917
Mariko…

561
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,292
You didn't know?

562
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:54,208
It was all his plan.

563
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,500
Marrying you off.

564
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:02,417
To put you as far away
from his fight as possible.

565
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,917
So that you might survive

566
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:12,208
and one day return to finish it.

567
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:29,833
All these years, you must have known…

568
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:39,667
I've failed him.

569
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:48,375
No, Mariko.

570
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:57,292
Your war isn't over.

571
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:06,542
[Ishido] The time for discussion
has now concluded.

572
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:10,708
Lord Ito is loyal to the Heir,
and to this Council.

573
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,958
In one voice, let us vote.

574
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,792
[sighs]

575
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,167
Yes to Ito.

576
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,167
Yes to Ito.

577
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,167
What say you, Sugiyama?

578
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,583
I'm sorry.

579
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:39,000
But no.

580
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:45,083
There has been no evidence
of any plot against the Heir.

581
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:50,208
I will conduct no vote

582
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:55,042
until all hostages are released.

583
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,917
Hostages?

584
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:04,208
You dishonor the wishes
of our great Taikō.

585
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,125
Then you dishonor
the most loyal servant of this Realm.

586
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,208
I alone here

587
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:25,000
serve the Realm.

588
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,875
[Ishido] <i>It will mean a delay,</i>

589
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,625
<i>there's no doubt about it.</i>

590
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,500
I will propose Sugiyama's impeachment,

591
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,708
then plans can move ahead.

592
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:46,125
So sorry, but I'd like to know...

593
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,750
When is "then"?

594
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:51,542
Please be patient.

595
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,875
You're playthings.

596
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:03,917
You have no idea the enemy you face…

597
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:08,667
You asked before

598
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:13,167
why I hold these feelings
against Toranaga.

599
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,542
It began in my childhood in Azuchi.

600
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:24,250
All those years I watched him…

601
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:28,708
whispering…

602
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,125
plotting…

603
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:37,292
Sure, it was Akechi Jinsai
who took my father's life,

604
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,708
but it was Toranaga who planned it.

605
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:51,042
His secret heart is no secret to me.

606
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:56,875
Serious accusations.

607
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:06,458
Tell them in public
and his end will be swift.

608
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:09,083
What would be the point?

609
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:13,250
None of you can stop him.

610
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:21,083
Have you heard what I went through

611
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:25,250
to give the Taikō a son?

612
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:31,000
No one else could achieve it.

613
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:36,333
Hundreds of women… consorts…

614
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,708
Not Daiyoin…

615
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:43,708
Daiyoin… who drugged me with bitter herbs,

616
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:48,875
forced me to endure unmentionable things
in order to conceive.

617
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,542
Only I become mother of the Heir.

618
00:51:56,333 --> 00:52:01,875
And do you know how?

619
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:17,292
By compelling fate to look at me.

620
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,875
So I could

621
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:29,458
scratch out its eyes.

622
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,875
[Sugiyama] Wife, wake up!
We're leaving the castle.

623
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,125
Wake up!

624
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,208
[samurai] My Lord, someone's there.

625
00:52:56,708 --> 00:53:00,583
It was wrong

626
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,958
to side with a simple bureaucrat.

627
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:10,000
That's all you will ever be.

628
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:24,542
[Toranaga] <i>Lord Sugiyama is dead…</i>

629
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:30,958
Killed by bandits
while trying to leave Osaka.

630
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:38,167
Ishido will soon control the Council.

631
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:44,417
I expect to be

632
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,458
falsely impeached

633
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:53,625
and war will be declared on my clan.

634
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:56,375
I desire no lands.

635
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,083
I want no honors.

636
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:05,667
But if traitors place
the Taikō's heir in danger,

637
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,708
then I must defend him.

638
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,292
Crimson Sky it will be.

639
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,417
[grunts]

640
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:22,500
We'll send a message
to my brother asking for his support,

641
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
then we'll rush Osaka
and obliterate our enemies.

642
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:29,000
The time has come.

643
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,667
[samurai chanting]

644
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,958
[samurai cheering]

645
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,833
[cheering continues]
