1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,226
<i>Previously on Shogun</i>

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,583
She has always been ice.

3
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,500
But... With him, it's different.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,083
Say something!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,333
Buntaro! Look at me!

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't move!

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,125
Thousands dead.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,333
Our forces are in shambles.

9
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,250
The time has come
for Crimson Sky.

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,375
A single, violent
rush on Osaka Castle.

11
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,583
Lord Toranaga's half-brother...

12
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,708
Saeki Nobutatsu.
We could join forces with him.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,542
I expect to be falsely impeached

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,875
Crimson Sky it will be.

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,417
The war is over!

16
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,083
The war is over!

17
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,417
The war is over!

18
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,958
Lord Toranaga has won!

19
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,917
My compliments, Lord Toranaga.

20
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,292
Not many men win
their first battle

21
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,167
before pillowing with
their first girl.

22
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,583
I formally surrender.

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,625
Tell your scribes that
Mizoguchi fought with honor.

24
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:34,458
It was fate that forced me into
declaring an unwinnable war.

25
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:12,583
I want it recorded that I was
seconded by the boy warlord.

26
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,875
Maybe we'll meet again
in the afterlife.

27
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:03,250
Maybe the one holding the sword

28
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,333
will be me.

29
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,750
How long since they last spoke?

30
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,042
Too long.

31
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,875
And if his brother says no?

32
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:31,375
Then this war is lost
before our swords are even wet.

33
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,750
Make sure the barbarian knows
to keep his mouth shut.

34
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
He understands, Lord.

35
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,292
In that nearby valley

36
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,750
I spied a decimated army.

37
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,375
Was it just me?

38
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,167
It's true.

39
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,917
My garrison endured much loss
in the recent earthquake.

40
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:44,083
So in your desperation,

41
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,417
you had no choice but to summon

42
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,667
the vast legions of
your mediocre brother.

43
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,792
You piss-drinking bastard!

44
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:03,417
I was looking forward to
a grand welcome by your forces.

45
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,667
My consorts were all
trembling in fear!

46
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,750
You look well, brother.

47
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,875
If you had nothing to do but
guard the still waters of Yuzenji,

48
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,708
you would also look good.

49
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,250
So the rumors are true.

50
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,917
You've tamed a barbarian.

51
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,292
Anjin.

52
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,000
Anjin-<i>sama</i>,
do not forget to bow.

53
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,042
It is an honor
to meet my liege lord's kin.

54
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:54,125
The honor is mine.

55
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,333
The Anjin is my hatamoto.

56
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:05,708
His cannon tactics are crucial
to our cause.

57
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,167
You have a proposal for me.

58
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,417
I do. The kind best
discussed tomorrow.

59
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,458
Tonight, we'll get
good and drunk.

60
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,292
I like this proposal already!

61
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,917
Samurai of the Kanto!

62
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:30,958
My men are eager to
spill blood by your side!

63
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,917
Thank you for coming, Saeki.

64
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,917
But first, I'm told there are
hot springs in the area.

65
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:47,917
Follow me.

66
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,208
It's usury...

67
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,500
One night for Kiku's services
cost 300 monme,

68
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,917
one week, twelve thousand?

69
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,375
Just to flirt with my
mongrel of a half brother.

70
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,417
Gin did begin
at a much higher price,

71
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,750
but I was able to
reduce her fee...

72
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:36,042
if you agreed to a private
meeting for one stick of time.

73
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,500
Absurd...

74
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,292
My lord wanted to see me?

75
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,047
During tonight's banquet

76
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,042
the Anjin will be on
his best behavior.

77
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,292
And he will wear his swords,
not his pistol.

78
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,125
As he is hatamoto.

79
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,583
Our lord urges you to be at
your best, and to please carry your swords

80
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,792
as is befitting a <i>hatamoto</i>.

81
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,125
Lord, may I ask...

82
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,292
Does this order of
Crimson Sky mean that

83
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:15,792
I am to be given maritime
command during our attack?

84
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,833
He asks about his
role during Crimson Sky.

85
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,375
As for the Anjin's
ship and his role...

86
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,333
I've decided nothing.

87
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,792
And that is the end of it.

88
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,160
Our lord has made no
decision regarding you or your service,

89
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,500
and I suggest you
take this no further.

90
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,750
Perhaps I misunderstand
these honors he has done to me.

91
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, here I am bestowed countless gifts.
Titles, swords and fiefs.

92
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,417
But when it comes time to
actually serve him, I am ignored.

93
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,595
I'm beginning to wonder if these
gifts have any bloody meaning at all.

94
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,292
What exactly is...

95
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,415
Crimson Sky?

96
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:15,167
I did not bring him here
to discuss Crimson Sky.

97
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,292
I urge
you to let this go.

98
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,667
Please tell him I am ready
for whatever our fate may bring.

99
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,333
He says
he stands with you...

100
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,583
whatever fate may bring.

101
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,625
Well, if it isn't Lord Omi.

102
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,250
I came to request Lady
Kiku's company later.

103
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,000
Is she available?

104
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,083
A pity she's not.

105
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:13,583
For his brother, Lord Saeki,

106
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,708
Lord Toranaga has bought
one week of her time.

107
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,167
Surely I can just
speak with her...

108
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:25,042
For an eager young
samurai like you,

109
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:29,875
perhaps we could find
a more suitable courtesan?

110
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,458
No, I think not.

111
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:35,375
Ever since Kiku pillowed here
with the barbarian,

112
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,292
your Tea House has been spoiled.

113
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,708
What the Anjin does
in my Tea House

114
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:44,292
is not my business to discuss...

115
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,625
But from what I recall,

116
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:54,000
his mind was on someone
else that night.

117
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,708
Fuji!

118
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,875
Grandfather!

119
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,500
I'm so embarrassed,
I didn't know you'd be visiting.

120
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,167
I wished it to be a surprise.

121
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,125
You keep a clean home.

122
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,875
It's adequate.

123
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,958
I wanted to deliver
these myself.

124
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:01,375
When we parted in Osaka,
I promised I'd keep them safe.

125
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:08,083
Thanks to you, we are reunited.

126
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,000
When my service is complete,

127
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,958
I will end my life
and become ashes too.

128
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,500
Why not live?

129
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:26,958
And bask in the victory
they died to achieve.

130
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:36,000
Will there be victory?

131
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,417
Forgive me.

132
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,625
With so much
strength on our side

133
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,750
of course we'll have victory.

134
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,917
Your son, Buntaro...

135
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,125
We're honored to have him.

136
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,000
I hope Ishido sends
all of Osaka to face us.

137
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,593
I hear that your first
kill on the battlefield

138
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,792
is better than your first woman.

139
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
Where did you hear that?

140
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,500
Many speak of it that way.

141
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,750
Depends on the woman.

142
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:05,292
Your boy is finally a man!

143
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,458
The last time I saw Nagakado,

144
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,917
his chin was as
hairless as his balls.

145
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,292
Hey nephew,

146
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,583
I bet you have a different girl
for every day of the moon.

147
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,500
Just like your father.

148
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,958
Slander.

149
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:30,125
Your uncle is far more gifted with women.

150
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,792
More lies!

151
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,958
--What's funny?

152
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:38,750
Saeki-<i>sama</i> remarks about how long it has
been since he has seen Nagakado-sama.

153
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,667
It must bring you great honor...

154
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,917
Seeing your
wife perform her duty

155
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,958
to the Anjin with such devotion.

156
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,917
You mean her duty to our lord.

157
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,375
Uncle, you honor me
with these stories.

158
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,125
What was my father
like when he was young?

159
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,667
This is a good story!

160
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,177
Did you know that
your father was still a boy

161
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,042
when he won his first battle?

162
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,167
Yoshii Toranaga,
the boy warlord.

163
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,425
But that's not even the good part.

164
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:32,292
I'm told when the disgraced
Mizoguchi bowed to him in surrender,

165
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:36,167
it was your father,
just twelve years old,

166
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,250
who struck his enemy's head from
his shoulders with a single blow

167
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:55,042
Lord Saeki,
did you receive our lord's gift?

168
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,583
The courtesan, yes.

169
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,292
Many thanks.

170
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,083
She's beautiful, but
beauty's a fleeting pleasure.

171
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:11,458
Like trying to grasp a river,
or fuck a sunset.

172
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,583
Tomorrow we'll speak formally
on the matter of our alliance.

173
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,667
Why not tonight?

174
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,250
Patience.

175
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,917
Nonsense.

176
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,750
I can't live in this suspense!

177
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:33,875
What will the great Yoshii
Toranaga offer me for my army?

178
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,167
I quite like it here.

179
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,000
Perhaps my brother

180
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,167
would give me Izu?

181
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,750
Wouldn't
that be something.

182
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,250
Nephew.

183
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,292
I do have one more
story about my brother.

184
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,542
Not many know it.

185
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,750
He was once sent
away as a hostage,

186
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:04,792
to ensure our alliance
with the Imatani clan.

187
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:10,708
Our mother told him to be brave.

188
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,792
That a Minowara
does not feel fear.

189
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:21,625
But the moment he left her arms,

190
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,083
I'm told my brother
shat his pants

191
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:30,708
and rode his horse
for ten messy <i>ri</i>.

192
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,042
I mean no disrespect, of course.

193
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,417
I just meant to say,

194
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,000
I always felt for that horse...

195
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Nagakado.

196
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,458
What do you prefer?

197
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,375
Stories, legends...

198
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,875
or the truth?

199
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,375
This proposal, for example.

200
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:23,792
What a legend that would make,
for me to become Lord of Izu.

201
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,542
Unfortunately...

202
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,208
I already received
another offer.

203
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,250
Huh?

204
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,375
Lord!

205
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,833
Saeki's army has blocked off
every road leading out of Izu!

206
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,833
Every checkpoint is
now being guarded.

207
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,375
On whose orders?!

208
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:26,208
"By order of the
Council of Regents:

209
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:29,167
we invite Lord Toranaga

210
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:35,750
to submit before us in Osaka,
and answer for his treachery.

211
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,167
He is to deliver his response

212
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,500
to Saeki Nobutatsu,

213
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:48,375
our ambassador
and newly appointed Regent."

214
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,833
Regent...?

215
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:55,583
So Ishido finally
managed to fill my seat.

216
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,917
What lord could
refuse this honor?

217
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,750
You're damning the Realm.

218
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,917
Nagakado...

219
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,375
Your formal sentence
for the murder of Nebara Jozen,

220
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,917
and the order to commit seppuku.

221
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,292
Don't accept it!

222
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:33,083
I am honored to consider
the Council's request.

223
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,167
I will thoroughly
contemplate this,

224
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,292
and submit my answer
tomorrow by sunset.

225
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:53,083
You and your vassals will remain
in Ajiro until your decision.

226
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,684
<i>What happens if he surrenders?</i>

227
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:20,375
We will be marched to Osaka and
forced to grovel at Ishido-s<i>ama'</i>s feet.

228
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,875
Toranaga-<i>sama</i> will be
sentenced to death.

229
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,875
And half his men will commit
s<i>eppuku </i>out of allegiance to him.

230
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,125
My <i>Erasmus</i> is
still moored in that cove.

231
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,833
If you could get me the
clearance I need to go aboard,

232
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:35,458
then tonight I could go below, test
the bilges. Easy dive over the side.

233
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,500
Check the keel, she'll
need cleaning and scraping.

234
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:41,125
Yabushige's men could help with
stepping the spare bowsprit in the hole.

235
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,667
I fix the sail myself.

236
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:47,083
And then we could be out of
that channel in... We could...

237
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,167
What could we do, Anjin-<i>sama</i>?

238
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,292
Anything is better than
standing here pissing around.

239
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,750
Recently
you sent your general, Igarashi,

240
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,917
to negotiate a secret peace
with the Council.

241
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,417
Lord Ishido wanted
your general returned

242
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,250
with his response.

243
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,500
Muraji,
whose crest is that?

244
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,625
Ishido-<i>sama.</i>

245
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,625
Bloody wonderful.

246
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,083
Not even
a whisper of a plan?

247
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:01,542
Our lord is in contemplation.

248
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,083
At least let me ride out and
get word to our troops in Edo.

249
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:15,917
Saeki has eyes all
over this mountain.

250
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,333
We'd be dead before you got there.

251
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:31,542
Father.

252
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,542
What have you decided?

253
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,292
Do we die with
blood on our swords?

254
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,989
Why is it that only those who
have never fought in a battle

255
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,333
are so eager to be in one?

256
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,792
Well, well.
Lord Toranaga...

257
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,875
Forgive me for the trouble,

258
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,208
but Lady Mariko did promise me
a stick of your time.

259
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,000
Go back to counting your silver.

260
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,375
Can't you see we're busy?

261
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,708
No, Nagakado.

262
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:11,625
A promise is a promise.

263
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:20,208
Who can say how many sticks
of time we have left?

264
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,917
I humbly thank you
for this honor.

265
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,458
Even when your future
is out of reach,

266
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:38,250
you would kindly
indulge my ideas for it.

267
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,042
What is it you want?

268
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:48,167
Do you know what it means
to live in the Willow World?

269
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,417
It means pouring out your life
in service of great men.

270
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,167
Your youth, energy,
wit, and charm...

271
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,125
all of it is given away.

272
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,458
Then your flower wilts with age,
and you are discarded.

273
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,750
Why is any of this my concern?

274
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,875
You're building a
new city in Edo.

275
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,875
I think it could set a standard
for the future.

276
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:24,917
There is no future
for some of us.

277
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,667
Still, in Edo...

278
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,917
Please take the Willow World
under your protection.

279
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,375
Even after you're gone.

280
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:49,250
Imagine a district contained
within its borders.

281
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,833
No longer brothels, but Tea
Houses like I've made here.

282
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,208
All gathered in the same place.

283
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,875
And the formation of a guild
for courtesans.

284
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,417
Grant us this bright future.

285
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:09,042
Let us age with the grace we
devote our youth to cultivating.

286
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Please...

287
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:24,625
Thank you for this
novel distraction.

288
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,375
But...

289
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,958
I'm afraid my future is too short
for your far reaching plans.

290
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,458
Is it?

291
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,583
Your advisors believe
your end is near,

292
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,208
but myself, I wonder...

293
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,708
My fate is written.

294
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,708
Fate is like a sword.

295
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:07,083
Useful only to those
who can wield it.

296
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,333
I was born in a gutter.

297
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,208
Raised as a ukareme.

298
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:18,375
Most would curse such
a loathsome fate.

299
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:24,375
But my hardships taught me
ambition and guile,

300
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:32,167
and made me
the most successful Lady in Izu.

301
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,292
Just as your hardships

302
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:37,833
made you into the cunning man
you are today.

303
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,833
It's only that it
doesn't make sense...

304
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,167
Lord Toranaga.

305
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:47,250
Any spy could tell him
about the army coming his way...

306
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:51,333
Why leave your weakened garrison
so exposed?

307
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,208
Why make such a
careless mistake?

308
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,167
Do you assume any of
this to be my will?

309
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,167
After the earthquake
that decimated my army?

310
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,667
My apologies, Lord.

311
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,750
I must have misunderstood.

312
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,917
What do I know?

313
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,375
I'm just an old whore.

314
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,292
And my stick of
time is finished.

315
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:56,125
Seems there's not
enough water to share.

316
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,042
Huh?

317
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,042
So good.

318
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:43,333
What makes you so certain
our lord has a plan?

319
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:44,792
What else is there?

320
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,333
Surrender?

321
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:49,417
My father wouldn't know how.

322
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:54,792
Sometimes I wish we could
go back to our old lives...

323
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,542
before that barbarian
ship arrived.

324
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:01,583
When this was just
a sad and poor fishing village.

325
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,958
That's true.

326
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,708
But life here was peaceful.

327
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,333
So much has been taken
from us since then.

328
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,125
Every good thing we've ever had

329
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:21,125
is now gone because
we reached for more.

330
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,375
We just need a plan.

331
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,625
We'll bring down as many of
these spineless pigs as we can...

332
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:28,577
"Spineless pigs"?

333
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:37,000
Your insults are as
dull as your blades.

334
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,750
None of this has been easy for
me, you know.

335
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,000
Your father and me...
we've had our troubles.

336
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,500
But we are still family.

337
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:50,583
Aren't you ashamed
of what you've done?

338
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,125
There's no shame
in thinking about one's legacy.

339
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,458
Think about yours, Nagakado.

340
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,958
To be slaughtered
like chickens...

341
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,667
Forgotten before
you could even be remembered...

342
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:10,208
If it's my fate, then it
will be a beautiful death.

343
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,458
That's not beauty.

344
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,292
Death...

345
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,583
is just a lonely
path in the woods.

346
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,792
Bet by now you're wishing
it had been you in that pot.

347
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,917
Your end would
have been swifter.

348
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,667
I'm bound to this fate.

349
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,833
Every death I escape,
there's another waiting.

350
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,250
First on that cliff.
Then in Osaka.

351
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,333
Now this.

352
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,750
Why am I speaking to you.

353
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,667
It's like pissing in the wind.

354
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,875
You don't even know
how to use that.

355
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Draw it.

356
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,625
Hurry.

357
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,643
Draw it.

358
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,500
This
appears to be occurring.

359
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,583
Hold it properly.

360
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,417
Two hands.

361
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,417
One more time.

362
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:47,542
Pick it up!

363
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,917
Again? Uh...

364
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,250
I see what this is. I'm a fucking sailor.
I don't know this blade from the handle.

365
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,453
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

366
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Pick it up now.

367
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,083
Um... Now I am
picking up the sword calmly.

368
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,125
What's so funny?

369
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,417
What are you doing?

370
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,250
Well, go on then.

371
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,542
Might as well be now.

372
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,773
You would have died
if I wasn't here.

373
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:58,833
You idiot.

374
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:16,542
You're still too hurt
to swing a naginata.

375
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,708
If there will be
war, I must fight.

376
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,583
It will be good
to finally fight.

377
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,125
We'll honor the memory of those
who've gone ahead.

378
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:28,792
Like your late husband.

379
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:34,458
What Tadayoshi did for
my father that day...

380
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:41,875
It should have been me standing
up to Ishido and his insults.

381
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:45,458
If I'd been braver,

382
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:52,250
maybe Tadayoshi and your son
would still be with us.

383
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:02,292
We do what we can, when we can.

384
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:07,458
We can only hope it's enough.

385
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,792
All lands in Okazaki

386
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:21,667
should be passed to my
grandchildren when they come of age.

387
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:26,292
And also...

388
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,250
Gin.

389
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,083
Have two cho of land
in Edo set aside

390
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,917
for her to use as she wishes.

391
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,125
Lord, Toda Hirokatsu!

392
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,750
Lord, with due respect...

393
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:10,083
I have something urgent
to discuss with you.

394
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:14,667
I ask that my wife remain.

395
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,083
Before we die,

396
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,675
I beg permission
to take the barbarian's head.

397
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,208
Why?

398
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:44,458
He's only aligned with you
out of his own interests.

399
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,250
And...

400
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,542
I don't like the way
he looks at my wife.

401
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,042
You accuse this man of soliciting
the affections of your wife?

402
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,292
Yes.

403
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,292
And Mariko is encouraging this.

404
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,288
Is that what you're saying?

405
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:12,750
I ask permission to take his
head, not hers.

406
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,292
Answer the question!

407
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,917
If you thought this true,

408
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:22,500
you would have to take her head
the same instant.

409
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,375
What do you say?

410
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:37,000
My life is for my
husband to take.

411
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,625
I...

412
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,625
I don't accuse my wife.

413
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,833
Then you cannot
accuse the Anjin.

414
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,500
How is this to end?

415
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:03,333
My words were petty.

416
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,333
Please forgive me.

417
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,625
Where do
you stand in this?

418
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:31,042
I am your servant.

419
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,250
You keep saying that,

420
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:39,583
yet you constantly confuse your
priorities with this barbarian.

421
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,708
There is no confusion.

422
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,625
No more having things two ways.

423
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,833
We are one thing or the other.

424
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:49,375
Are you with me in our fight
against your father's enemies,

425
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:52,833
or are you with the barbarian?

426
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:55,750
I order you to choose!

427
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,542
Lord...

428
00:42:58,917 --> 00:42:59,917
I have...

429
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:05,250
served you loyally
and utterly.

430
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,542
But I beg you...

431
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:15,292
every hour I wait for death

432
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,958
is like drowning in
a river of anguish.

433
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,250
Tonight...

434
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,667
Let it end.

435
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:36,292
Free me

436
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,833
of this cursed life.

437
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:37,792
Last night,

438
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,583
when my brother told
that ridiculous story...

439
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,250
why didn't you speak up?

440
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:46,917
Forgive me for not defending you
from those insults.

441
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,333
No. Not that one.

442
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,875
The one about
beheading the general.

443
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,292
Mizoguchi.

444
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,375
Oh.

445
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,667
It's absurd.

446
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,333
A single stroke?

447
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:04,917
You were there.

448
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:09,083
It was nine times
before that head came off.

449
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,167
What a fucking mess you made.

450
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,875
Who picks a child
to be his second?

451
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:44,917
Your formal answer, please.

452
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:52,083
Lord Saeki...

453
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:57,167
I bow before you

454
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:01,375
and agree to travel to Osaka,

455
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:07,500
where I will submit to the will
of the Council before Lord Ishido.

456
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,250
He has surrendered.

457
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,000
Lord, if I may...

458
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,500
- You may not.
- But father...

459
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,917
I've decided.

460
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:23,042
Even when there's
evil in this land,

461
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:26,917
no one has the right
to tear the Realm apart.

462
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,375
Crimson Sky...

463
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,000
was a mistake.

464
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,125
Yabushige-<i>sama.</i>

465
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,708
Nagakado-<i>sama.</i>

466
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,708
Behold,
the great warlord.

467
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,625
The brilliant
master of trickery...

468
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:23,292
who tricked his own loyal vassals
into a noiseless smothering.

469
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:27,367
You're all dead.

470
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,208
Crimson
fucking horseshit.

471
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,083
We'll send word to the Council.

472
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:48,125
Tomorrow you will
leave for Osaka

473
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,208
under my escort until you've
reached the castle gates.

474
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:56,917
From this day, you
have nowhere to go...

475
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,667
and nothing left to be.

476
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:27,417
When this is over,
I'll bring you to my castle in Edo.

477
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,833
Build you a palace of your own.

478
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:35,042
My seventh consort.

479
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:39,625
Luckiest of them all.

480
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,250
Lord...

481
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:08,583
Would you allow me
to... elevate our play?

482
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:17,458
We have other tools
to enhance your pleasure.

483
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:22,458
Show me.

484
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:22,958
Trying to finally become a man?

485
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,292
Lord!

486
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:32,042
Where is the beauty in this.
