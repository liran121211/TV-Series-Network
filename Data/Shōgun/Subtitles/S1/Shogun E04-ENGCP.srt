1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,167
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun<i>.</i>

2
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:16,207
They died because
they belonged to a greater fight.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
It's your turn.

4
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,416
For his safety, I need the Anjin

5
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,458
brought to your fishing village in Ajiro.

6
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:28,167
Lord Ishido was confused
by your sudden departure.

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,542
Please remind your lord,
I keep my promises.

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,643
The <i>Black Ship
</i>will bring us out of Osaka.

9
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,417
But you must stay.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,750
Fuck this.

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,708
Anjin!

12
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:41,792
Look out!

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,708
He did it!

14
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:52,292
I would like him to train a regiment
in foreign tactics

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,833
using the weapons from his ship.

16
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:55,917
I proclaim him…

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,250
'Hatamoto'.

18
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,893
Which is a very great honor.

19
00:00:58,917 --> 00:00:59,958
Would the Anjin join me?

20
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,875
My lord would like to
race you to the shore.

21
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,500
But I warn you not to let him win.

22
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,583
My lord hates that.

23
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,375
- I wouldn't dare.
- Mmm.

24
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,792
Lord Omi!
A message from Osaka!

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Everyone!

26
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,457
Lord Yabushige is coming to this village
with a guest…

27
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:04,167
Lord of the Kantō… Yoshii Toranaga!

28
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,375
Hurry and get ready!

29
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,583
I beg you, take this sentence off my head.

30
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,707
Lord Toranaga has given the Anjin

31
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,249
- the title he felt was appropriate.
- Ridiculous!

32
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,958
As hatamoto, the Anjin needs a consort.

33
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,250
Then I beg you…

34
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,333
Allow me to leave this clan
and become a nun.

35
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,375
You will do no such thing.

36
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,583
What have I done to deserve this?

37
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,749
Is it not enough
that I must survive the death of my child,

38
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,875
only now to serve a barbarian?

39
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,250
How cruel of me.

40
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:22,875
After the loss you've just suffered.

41
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,042
Buntaro died with honor.

42
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,082
I will inherit his wishes

43
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,917
and continue serving our lord.

44
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,208
I trust Lord Toranaga.

45
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,792
One year is all he asks.

46
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,417
She'll give six months.

47
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,792
Everything in Ajiro
will be in order.

48
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,875
My nephew is handling every detail.

49
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,167
Good.

50
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,625
- There's no moment to waste.
- Mmm.

51
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,707
Our forces must be ready

52
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:09,082
before the Council finds
a replacement for my father.

53
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,500
Replacement...?

54
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,292
Had I neglected to tell you?

55
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,624
I gave Hiromatsu an order…

56
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,332
As soon as we left Osaka,

57
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,917
he was to deliver
my letter of resignation.

58
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,125
Sorry… you have resigned
from the Council of Regents?

59
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,957
It was the only thing to do.

60
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,042
But, then you've… killed yourself.

61
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,707
Destroyed your cause…
all your vassals, allies, friends.

62
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,250
We're finished!

63
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:42,958
Oh no, wait.

64
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,542
All of Izu is finished.

65
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,708
Oh.

66
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,323
I apologize for my bad manners…

67
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,250
I assume it's proper for you
to commit seppuku at once.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,166
Thank you.

69
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,167
But until a legal order arrives

70
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,125
my head will stay where it is.

71
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,625
Lord, Ajiro is approaching!

72
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,385
Whose army is that?

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,333
Yabushige-<i>sama's</i>.

74
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,250
All loyal to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

75
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,875
Let's hope so.

76
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:44,542
Should've bought better saké.

77
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,083
I've been waiting for your return, Uncle.

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,125
Is that the same barbarian?

79
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The barbarian is hatamoto now.

80
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,833
Please see that he's given a home.

81
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,333
His consort and Lady Toda
will stay there as well.

82
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,375
With the Council hamstrung,

83
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,208
your head would now be of great value.

84
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,542
An ally with ambition is no ally.

85
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,625
We are honored
by your presence, Lady Mariko.

86
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,708
<i>Anjin-sama</i>, this is Omi-<i>sama</i>.
The lord of this village.

87
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,059
Actually, we've met.

88
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,583
Pardon me.

89
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:48,292
And fuck yourself,
you sniveling little shit rag.

90
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,583
Lord!

91
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,167
Your arrival brings your men great joy!

92
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,917
Please listen!

93
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,958
Yabushige-sama!

94
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,000
Yabushige-sama!

95
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:14,917
Lord, it would be my pleasure
if you would inspect my guard.

96
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,833
Samurai of Izu

97
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:46,125
I am honored to witness

98
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:53,042
the forces of my friend and ally,
Kashigi Yabushige.

99
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,583
Dark clouds are gathering over Japan.

100
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:04,417
We must protect it against treachery.

101
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,792
To those who stain the Taikō's legacy...

102
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,917
May the gods blast you without pity!

103
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,750
And to those who fight
in the name of loyalty...

104
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,417
It is I, Yoshii Toranaga,

105
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
who humbly bows to you!

106
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,042
Toranaga-sama!

107
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,422
Toranaga-sama!

108
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,167
Uncle,

109
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,833
the whole village has prepared
for your arrival.

110
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,559
My father has to leave
on urgent business.

111
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,625
We must fully train our gun regiment
before he returns.

112
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,500
Should've bought the cheap stuff.

113
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,583
Uh. The men, from the hole.

114
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,750
You seen them?

115
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,167
They safe?

116
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,125
Muraji?

117
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,208
- Uh…
- Welcome, <i>Anjin-sama</i>.

118
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,458
Uh… My men.

119
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,583
I'd like to see them now. My...

120
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,083
Where are they?

121
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:12,000
Actually…
everyone was moved to a different place.

122
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,542
It's a safe place.

123
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,542
- I'm sorry, I-I don't, um…
- Oh.

124
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,625
Look, maybe you can help me? Here.

125
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:25,792
What are you doing?

126
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,458
He seems to want to go to his ship.

127
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,125
What now? Let go!

128
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,542
This ship is not your property…

129
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,500
entry is forbidden!

130
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,583
I am afraid you are forbidden
from boarding without permission.

131
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,333
My own ship?

132
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,239
- If there is something you need...
- Well, there is, yes.

133
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,875
My pistols and my men...
I keep asking to see them.

134
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:53,417
Your men were brought to Toranaga-<i>sama's
</i>city of Edo for their safety.

135
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,667
As for your guns,
we can fetch them if it becomes necessary.

136
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,250
Now look here, Mariko.

137
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,833
Your lord and I had an arrangement.

138
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:06,708
That ship and its crew now belong to me.

139
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,708
You're quite mistaken.

140
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,125
Your ship and crew
now belong to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

141
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,625
And he will use them as he wishes.

142
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,333
Well, thank you for the clarification.

143
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,958
<i>Anjin-sama</i>. This is Uejirou, the gardener.

144
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,708
Uh…

145
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Sorry,
we do not use "<i>sama</i>" for Uejirou.

146
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,708
It is not proper.

147
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,708
Ah.

148
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,750
Your house is ready for inspection.

149
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,625
Right this way.

150
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,208
My house?

151
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,250
Everything here has been prepared
specially by your staff.

152
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,833
My staff?

153
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,958
You will find your sleeping room,
as well as Fuji-<i>sama</i>'s room.

154
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,167
And the guest room
where I will be staying.

155
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,583
Perhaps you would like some tea
after a long journey?

156
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,042
Why have I been given all this?

157
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,750
It is only fitting for a <i>hatamoto</i>.

158
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,958
No... W-wait a minute.
How long am I expected to be here?

159
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,833
Nagakado-<i>sama</i> says
training will take at least six months.

160
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,875
Sorry. Six months?

161
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,958
You agreed to train these men,
you remember?

162
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,708
I do, yes.
For the return of my men and my ship.

163
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,958
Please be patient, <i>Anjin-sama</i>.

164
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:08,500
As <i>hatamoto,</i> you have been given a home,
a generous salary of 240 koku a year...

165
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,917
I don't want any generous cukoos.

166
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,458
And Fuji-<i>sama</i> as a consort.

167
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,542
Well, I'm sure she's very nice,
but I don't want a woman.

168
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,059
I don't wish to pillow her,
pillow on her or near her.

169
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,708
Or do any damn pillowing at all.

170
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,875
In any case, she will look
after your house and your servants,

171
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,417
and all your financial matters.

172
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,667
To refuse would be
a terrible insult to our lord.

173
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,125
Well, I do refuse.

174
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,000
I refuse all of this.

175
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,208
I came here under clear terms
with Toranaga.

176
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,875
Sorry, Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

177
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,167
Now he's bloody vanished.

178
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,042
And I'm a bloody prisoner all over again.

179
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,708
Just with better living quarters.

180
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,958
Six months.

181
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,750
Six months…

182
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,792
To not even drink this saké…

183
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,667
That Toranaga…

184
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:18,083
You saved his life in Osaka,

185
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,833
and now he spits in your face.

186
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,916
So, Omi...

187
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,333
Have you found the rodent

188
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,458
who leaked word of the barbarian ship
to Toranaga?

189
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,542
Not just yet.

190
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,375
What have you been doing all this time?

191
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,667
Huh?

192
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,583
Perfuming your <i>kosode</i>?

193
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,292
He's only a boy.

194
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,083
Too young to be in charge of this village.

195
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,183
The gods are laughing at me!

196
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,125
Ishido probably thinks I've betrayed him.

197
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,500
I look fully committed
to this losing cause.

198
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,875
To train a gun regiment

199
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,875
with a barbarian
pretending to be hatamoto.

200
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,125
What the hell am I supposed to do?

201
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,333
This gun regiment…

202
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,583
It's still your regiment.

203
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,958
Huh?

204
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,208
If I may…

205
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:17,000
For now, you have the guns and the cannon.

206
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:22,667
Until Lord Toranaga returns,
it's all yours.

207
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,875
For all we know, the Council
may still find its fifth member.

208
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:30,375
Lord Toranaga can still be impeached.

209
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,500
So what?

210
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:35,583
You'd be left
with these guns and artillery,

211
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:39,542
which could still be
offered as a gift to Lord Ishido.

212
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,458
You really don't have to be here.

213
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,875
Go away.

214
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,792
She won't let me alone.

215
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,292
Wherever I go, she is.

216
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,250
It's not customary for one's consort
to sleep while he's awake.

217
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,500
Well, it's a foolish custom.

218
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,708
You should not walk on moss.

219
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,958
It is very disrespectful.

220
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:51,792
If I may…

221
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,250
I believe Fuji-<i>sama</i> merits better.

222
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,083
She is my late husband's niece.

223
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,292
Accomplished and highborn.

224
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,667
Well, that's absolutely wonderful for her.

225
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,167
And recently her husband
and infant son were put to death.

226
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,542
Her husband had insulted Ishido-<i>sama</i>,

227
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,833
and something had to be done
in order to prevent bloodshed.

228
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,667
Shouldn't she be grieving then?

229
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:27,083
Instead of following around
marooned Englishmen?

230
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,750
We grieve those we have lost
by continuing their fight.

231
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,042
Rubbish.

232
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,292
A child has no fight.

233
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,958
The child's father served Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

234
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,583
And now, being your consort
allows Fuji-<i>sama</i> to do the same.

235
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,708
It gives her a place.

236
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,542
Well, you'd never know it to look at her.

237
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,000
Bereaved mother…

238
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,417
or widow.

239
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,250
Do you know of "The Eightfold Fence?"

240
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,458
From the time we are small,

241
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,875
it is something we are taught
to build within ourselves.

242
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:25,750
An impenetrable wall behind which
we can retreat whenever we need.

243
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:32,292
You must train yourself
to listen without hearing.

244
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:38,542
For instance, you can listen
to the sound of a blossom falling or…

245
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,292
the rocks growing.

246
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,875
If you really listen,
your present circumstance vanishes.

247
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:55,583
Do not be fooled by our politeness,
our bows, our maze of rituals.

248
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,000
Beneath it all,
we could be a great distance away.

249
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,333
Safe… and alone.

250
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,167
<i>Tell him he can go to hell!</i>

251
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,917
Omi-<i>sama</i> insists it is forbidden
to bring your weapons today.

252
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,600
Nonsense. Your people
bring swords wherever they go.

253
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,375
He says guns are different.
You must turn them over.

254
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,208
- No, understand? No!
- I'm not his prisoner anymore!

255
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:01,833
Where I come from,
you ask guests to do things.

256
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,625
Please wait! Please!

257
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,208
There is no need for this!
You are protected as <i>hatamoto</i>.

258
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,583
For some reason I just can't shake
the memory of our first meeting.

259
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,750
Give me the guns.

260
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,958
No!

261
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,750
No.

262
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,833
Mariko-<i>sama</i>.
Tell the Anjin to give his guns to me.

263
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,792
Give the guns to Fuji-<i>sama</i>.

264
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,292
She is your consort.
She will give her life to defend them.

265
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,792
- I can damned well defend myself...
- <i>Anjin-sama</i>!

266
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,708
Please give them to me.

267
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,125
Tell this milk-dribbling,
fuck smear I am ready to go.

268
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,874
With utmost respect,

269
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,675
the Anjin apologizes
for the misunderstanding.

270
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,542
The guns.

271
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,583
Please be on your way.

272
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,458
That was very good.

273
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,333
Very good.

274
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,000
Yabushige-<i>sama</i> says
his men do not need to learn basic skills

275
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,125
like loading or cleaning muskets.

276
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,500
The Portuguese brought us guns
50 years ago.

277
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,958
We are very experienced with it.

278
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:10,732
Yes, of course you are.

279
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,875
I want to start with tactics.

280
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:18,000
Foreign methods
that my enemies have not yet seen.

281
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,208
He asks about any tactics
our enemies might not yet know.

282
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:24,042
Right.

283
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,875
Tactics…

284
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,917
That was the agreement.

285
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:32,125
Lord Toranaga made this man
his great hatamoto…

286
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,000
Let's see him live up to it.

287
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,500
Well, then let me tell you about tactics.

288
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,208
I will begin by describing for you
a great battle.

289
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,458
We call it the Siege of Malta…

290
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,792
Malta… there was a siege…

291
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,250
Apparently it was a great battle.

292
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,351
Sixty thousand Islamic Turks,
the cream of the Ottoman Empire,

293
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,809
had come against 600 Christian knights

294
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,083
supported by a few thousand
Maltese auxiliaries

295
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,333
at their vast castle complex at St. Elmo.

296
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,042
Now, the knights had successfully
withstood the six-month siege,

297
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,184
and incredibly,
had forced the enemy to retreat in shame.

298
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,684
We are taught this victory saved
the whole Mediterranean seaboard,

299
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,458
- and thus christened them with the...
- Sorry. You said taught?

300
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,542
Yes.

301
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,542
When did this battle occur?

302
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:18,958
Well, it... 35, 40 years ago.

303
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,333
So you yourself
did not fight in this battle?

304
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:26,583
You were not even born
when this battle was fought.

305
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:28,708
Hey.

306
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,645
What are you asking him?

307
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,708
Sorry, I was trying to clarify something.

308
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,625
Perhaps you might start again,

309
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:43,375
except this time describe
a battle you have actually fought in.

310
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,851
Well, as I may have mentioned to your lord
on multiple occasions,

311
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,625
I am a sea pilot. Yes?

312
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,583
Not a great deal
of infantry battles at sea.

313
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,292
What's happening?

314
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,208
Mariko-<i>sama</i>,

315
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,125
please tell him that in my opinion,
gun tactics are useless

316
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,542
compared to the fine art
of English naval warfare.

317
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,125
Instead of tactics,

318
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:26,042
he wants to teach us
about English naval combat.

319
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,601
That castle in Osaka,
it's impregnable, yes?

320
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,792
With swords, even matchlocks,
to lay siege would take months.

321
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:35,417
But, anchor my ship and cannon
within a few thousand yards,

322
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,333
and your army
could breach the castle walls

323
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:41,333
without so much as an arrow's fletching
to graze their cheeks.

324
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,417
Just let me demonstrate.

325
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,860
Lift it up!

326
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Alright. Move forward!

327
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,542
How do I say, um, "back"?

328
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:57,417
- "Back."
- "<i>U-shi-ro</i>."

329
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,333
How is it possible
for a cannon to hit this target?

330
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,250
Would you mind hitting the wedge?

331
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,208
This is foolish.

332
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,875
Cannon are never accurate.

333
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,750
The Portuguese tried this years ago.

334
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,250
Pierce your charge.

335
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,083
Prime. Now clear the hubs.

336
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,250
Fire!

337
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,208
Hmm.

338
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,167
Clear the hubs and fire!

339
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,125
Well done.

340
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,958
Perhaps his cannon are better.

341
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:55,792
And prime.

342
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,625
Prime!

343
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,518
Tell the men
to force the enemy to retreat.

344
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,917
Outline your vectors.

345
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,167
No, no. It's too early for that.

346
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:56,875
Excellent work.

347
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:49,000
This is beautiful.

348
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,917
The men are learning
a decent amount at a decent pace.

349
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,667
Yes. Toranaga-<i>sama</i> will be pleased.

350
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,833
There are other ways I could help him.

351
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,875
My <i>Erasmus</i> is a single ship,

352
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,417
but a fleet would be
something else entirely.

353
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,375
My men in Edo could help me
build him a navy.

354
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:14,792
Forgive me, <i>Anjin-sama</i>,

355
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,958
but I think you should remember
your oath is to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>

356
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:21,292
and not to the orders
that brought you here.

357
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:23,958
What orders?

358
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,500
Your crimes against the Portuguese.

359
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,583
I've read them in your own words.

360
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:35,667
It will be useful for you to know our lord
will never be turned against your enemies.

361
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,958
And it will be useful for you to be
reminded that we are at war,

362
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,417
both your lord and my queen,

363
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,625
and it happens that we have
enemies in common.

364
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,628
Those were Catholics
trying to kill him in Osaka.

365
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,333
Yes, trying to kill you.

366
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,393
Because they fear what I can offer him.

367
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,750
A modern navy. Ships built for war
would be to his benefit.

368
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:57,708
You have no idea what is or is not
to my lord's benefit.

369
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,833
Well, I suppose we both have
our masters to serve, don't we?

370
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:09,833
Jesus!

371
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,583
The hell was that?

372
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,250
Just a baby earthquake.

373
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,958
A... A baby what?

374
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,708
You will most certainly
experience more while you are here.

375
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,968
There are also tsunami
that come from the sea

376
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,417
and fires that break out
in the villages and cities.

377
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:33,083
It is why our houses are built to go up
as quickly as they come down.

378
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:40,708
Because death is in our air
and sea and earth.

379
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,708
It can come for us at any moment.

380
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:51,208
Before you meddle with our politics,
just remember

381
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,708
we live and we die.

382
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,375
We control nothing beyond that.

383
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,458
Baby earthquake.

384
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,125
I love you, Kiku…

385
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:36,125
Those cannon again…

386
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,707
Since that barbarian arrived,

387
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,042
all these bad tidings.

388
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,750
Mistress Kiku,
the Bird Who Sings at Night…

389
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,125
looking out for
the welfare of her village.

390
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,667
How impressive.

391
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,083
Don't tease me.

392
00:32:56,375 --> 00:33:00,292
The whole village is uneasy
when your uncle is around.

393
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,000
My uncle is our lord.

394
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:04,875
He's a difficult man,

395
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,458
but whether or not this village prospers
is up to him.

396
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:15,125
If only you were our lord.

397
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,768
And then… Push.

398
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:29,833
Push.

399
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,792
Number four. Um... uh…

400
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:34,875
Four. Four.

401
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,292
Bring forth a chain shot.

402
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,792
Chain shot. A chain shot.

403
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,458
Push.

404
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,500
Push.

405
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,625
Yes. Yes.

406
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,875
Please. Thank you. Yes.

407
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:52,583
Now, the chain shot increases the radius
within which the damage occurs

408
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:56,042
and the nature of the damage itself.

409
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,083
You'll see, you'll see.

410
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,500
And…

411
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,417
That's it.

412
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,417
And clear.

413
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,625
And there we are.

414
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,708
Lord Ishido's men coming from the west!

415
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,125
They breached the checkpoint!

416
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,375
Nebara Jozen is leading the pack.

417
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,583
What's going on?

418
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,287
You look as if you're preparing for war.

419
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,874
Please understand…

420
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,917
That night, I had no idea
that Toranaga would escape.

421
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,208
An invitation.

422
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,791
You are to return to Osaka.

423
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:06,333
Renew your oath of loyalty to the Council

424
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,749
and accept the consequences
of your actions.

425
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,208
This is all a misunderstanding.

426
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,292
Then you refuse?

427
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,624
Kill me, and Ishido will lose
an essential ally.

428
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,250
So your mind is set.

429
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:22,792
I'll tell Lord Ishido
you've declared yourself his enemy.

430
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,416
Don't you see? There's a war coming.

431
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,083
Would you keep Ishido
from his only path to victory?

432
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,667
Huh?

433
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,458
Look.

434
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,249
The barbarian's cannon…

435
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,208
They're unlike any I've ever seen.

436
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:42,917
Enough to shrivel Christian balls.

437
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,125
I've known you for ages.

438
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,500
Please stay the night.

439
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,499
There's another practice tomorrow.

440
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,625
If you're not impressed,
I'll submit this head to Ishido myself.

441
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:56,542
Okay?

442
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,125
Fine.

443
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,792
Prepare quarters for Jozen and his men.

444
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,167
Tomorrow, they will witness
a demonstration of our artillery.

445
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:12,792
For what reason?

446
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,708
I wish for him to see
what our weapons are capable of.

447
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:23,207
Then he'll return to Osaka,
where all lords will quake

448
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,625
in the immensity of your father's power.

449
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,625
I look forward to quaking.

450
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,500
I've been summoned to Osaka.

451
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:44,333
To pledge my loyalty to the Council.

452
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,500
And you'll refuse.

453
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,083
Of course, Lord Nagakado.

454
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:56,000
That I'd betray your father…
the suspicion alone is upsetting.

455
00:36:56,833 --> 00:37:00,000
I would give my life for your father.

456
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:09,667
I can't believe
I'm giving my life for this man.

457
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,207
If you go, they'll see your belly slit.

458
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,625
There's no way out.

459
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,958
It's absurd, this being my end.

460
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,792
There may be a solution.

461
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:33,417
And so the regents in Osaka
are pressuring Yabushige?

462
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,875
He will be declared a fugitive
for refusing their order,

463
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:40,333
but if he returns to Osaka, he will
no doubt be ordered to commit <i>seppuku</i>.

464
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,500
Eat. Please.

465
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,812
What have you got there?

466
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:55,583
This may be not for you.

467
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,500
How do you mean? Let me try some.

468
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,375
The Anjin
would like to try natto.

469
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,292
He seems quite determined.

470
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,208
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, would you mind
telling Fuji something on my behalf?

471
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:20,167
I wanted to apologize for the way
I behaved when I was first brought here.

472
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,042
The Anjin wishes
to apologize for his bad manners.

473
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,708
I believe this is how you offer gifts,

474
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,792
so excuse my crude wrapping.

475
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,708
I'd like to thank her
for her excellent service to this house.

476
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:45,667
I ask that she accepts this gift
as a gesture of my gratitude.

477
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:50,333
Those are the best guns a sailor can have
and I'll miss that one greatly.

478
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,667
But if she is one to do her job well,
she'll need the best.

479
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,625
He wishes to give you this gun.

480
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,208
What could I even do with this?

481
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,333
I'll teach you how to use them.

482
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,250
She'll be the most fearsome lady
in the Japans.

483
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,483
It's so you can
protect him well in the future.

484
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:15,333
I'd sooner pull a gourd from a horse.

485
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,542
He's trying to be kind.

486
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,417
Did I offend her?

487
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,537
They belonged to my father,
who is dead.

488
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,208
Please tell him

489
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,917
I can't be consort
to a man without swords.

490
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:57,250
Fuji-<i>sama</i>, as your consort,
would like you to carry her family swords.

491
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,375
They are a symbol
of her late father's bravery.

492
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,125
I can't accept this.

493
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:18,083
Please take them.

494
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,958
Fuji-<i>sama</i> rightly points out
that, as <i>hatamoto</i>,

495
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:25,583
it is not proper for you
to have no swords to carry.

496
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:26,708
So you must accept.

497
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,792
Please.

498
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,917
Thank you so… "gozirimasuru".

499
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,167
It's "gozarimasuru".

500
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,042
I'll get it right
one of these bloody days.

501
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,917
I remind you that you are
under no obligation to try this dish.

502
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:10,625
Hmm. Hmm.

503
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,958
It's a bit like cheese.

504
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,750
Very stinky…

505
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,417
possibly spoiled, cheese.

506
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,417
But, uh, quite enjoyable.

507
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:33,417
It is unfortunate
that Jozen witnessed the cannon.

508
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:41,917
I fear he'll bring news
of our tactics to Ishido.

509
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,750
Those cocky shit-eaters!

510
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,542
Perhaps we send word to your father?

511
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,208
Ask what he would do?

512
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,417
Everyone thinks I'm useless.

513
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,292
Just a spoiled, soft-handed Minowara brat.

514
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:02,333
But someone needs to stand up
for our name.

515
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,125
Still…

516
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:09,042
Without your father's permission,
best not to start a war.

517
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,583
Now you sound like him.

518
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:14,833
"Never make the first move."

519
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,292
"Wait for your enemy to make a mistake."

520
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,292
We're in a serious predicament.

521
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,417
If only your father would understand.

522
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,083
He never listens to others.

523
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,125
Then tomorrow

524
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:42,792
we'll have no choice
but to reveal our tactics to the enemy.

525
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,458
Omi.

526
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,750
Don't send word to my father.

527
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,500
I'll handle it.

528
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,083
Beautiful.

529
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,333
Oh.

530
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,458
- Shit.
- Sorry.

531
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:32,167
Fuji-<i>sama</i> said you were off on a walk.

532
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,792
Yes, I was.

533
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,875
I am happy to see
you have changed your mind about bathing.

534
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,417
Would you care to sit?

535
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,042
I came here to thank you
for your gift to Fuji-<i>sama</i>.

536
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,667
It was very meaningful for her to receive.

537
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,792
As her gift was to me.

538
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:03,125
I also wanted you to know
you're wrong about my service in Ajiro.

539
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,417
It has nothing to do with the church.

540
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,083
Oh.

541
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,292
Go on.

542
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,958
I have not told you my family name.

543
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:40,250
But it is well-known in Japan.

544
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,333
Many years ago…

545
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,375
a great injustice
stole everything from me.

546
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:07,792
For a long time, I have been unable
to seek resolution for what happened.

547
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,083
But recently
Toranaga-<i>sama</i> offered me a way.

548
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,875
What sort of resolution?

549
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,667
You said…

550
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:32,125
your houses here are designed to be…

551
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:35,500
rebuilt as quickly as they're destroyed.

552
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:41,750
So if a house is ruined and rebuilt,
and ruined and rebuilt 50 times over,

553
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:45,375
if I see it, I-I fail to see its ruins.

554
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:47,500
I see only a house.

555
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,250
And here I see much woman.

556
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,708
And one who owes me no explanations.

557
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,917
What is the name of it again?

558
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,667
The city of your birth?

559
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:08,917
London.

560
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,333
London.

561
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,500
A city like Osaka?

562
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:15,792
Well…

563
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:20,667
A city, yes, but nothing like Osaka.

564
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,708
It's crowded, filthy.

565
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:31,917
Plenty to do though.

566
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,458
What would you do there
on a night like this?

567
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:42,292
Well, if you were with me,
all the way from the Japans,

568
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:44,458
I'd take you to see my queen.

569
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:46,333
Would she receive us?

570
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,333
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

571
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:53,625
And we'd tour
the grounds at Richmond Palace.

572
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,583
And sit down for a stuffy dinner.

573
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,583
And then to make up for it,
I'd take us all to see a play.

574
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,667
Do you have plays here?

575
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,167
Hmm, yes. They're very popular.

576
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:11,417
Though quite sad and tragic mostly.

577
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:13,226
Yes, we have tragedies.

578
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,708
Doomed lovers, cursed kings.

579
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,917
And after that?

580
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,167
I suppose we'd go for a walk.

581
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,042
Yes.

582
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:40,375
We'd <i>sanpo suru</i> along the Thames.

583
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,208
It's a big river.

584
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,851
Runs right through the city. And at night,
it's really... It's quite something,

585
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,292
and you can almost forget yourself.

586
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,625
And all your troubles and your past, and…

587
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,542
all the ways life seems to…

588
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,583
leave you wrecked.

589
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,833
They all just disappear.

590
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,167
And then you are free.

591
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,208
Yes.

592
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:14,708
I think so.

593
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:09,542
Good night, Anjin-<i>sama.</i>

594
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,917
The rain is very beautiful today.

595
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,250
Rain.

596
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,292
Good morning.

597
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,250
You seem in good spirits.

598
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,292
As I should be.

599
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,375
- After a night of good company.
- Hmm.

600
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:41,333
The courtesan was acceptable then.
I'm glad to hear it.

601
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:43,583
Fuji-<i>sama</i> and I thought
she would make a pleasing gift.

602
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,792
I don't understand. You're not, uh…

603
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,917
It was a very thoughtful gift.

604
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,960
Now he's carrying swords?

605
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,042
Talk about bad omen.

606
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:41,667
The targets for today's demonstration

607
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,333
have been coordinated by Nagakado himself.

608
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,542
Splendid!

609
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:51,375
Nagakado, maybe there's
a career for you in theater.

610
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,917
For this exercise,
the cannon will fire across the plain

611
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,500
and blast the targets
with perfect accuracy.

612
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:00,875
Nagakado.

613
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,583
Why don't you start.

614
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:14,792
Everyone, step away!

615
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,268
Step away!

616
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:18,667
- What's happening?
- I do not know.

617
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,042
- Step away!
- Yes, sir!

618
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:27,792
Nebara Jozen!

619
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,875
Your presence here is intolerable.

620
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,667
You have offended my father's name.

621
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,875
I demand compensation!

622
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,458
What is this?

623
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,917
Put away your sword.

624
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:39,375
Jozen is an official messenger
sent by the Regents!

625
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,541
Who ordered that?!

626
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:57,542
I did.

627
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,292
Son of Yoshii Toranaga…

628
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,792
Yoshii Nagakado ordered this!

629
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,500
This is a shocking act of provocation!

630
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:06,332
Your father will know of this!

631
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,333
I don't care.

632
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,417
In fact, I would like for him to know.

633
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:17,500
- Is no one going to stop him?
- Do not intervene.

634
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:21,083
This is not how samurai fight!

635
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:25,917
You're savages.

636
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:28,750
All of you...

637
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:32,917
Jozen...

638
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,583
It is war.
