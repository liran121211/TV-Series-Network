1
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,710
<i>Captain.</i>

2
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,182
I was unable to take
any celestial destinations

3
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,685
- due to...
- The clouds.

4
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,619
Yes, the clouds.

5
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,824
However, white sand

6
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,061
by the mark ten.

7
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,799
Ten fathoms.
White sand in the tallow.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,101
You see what you want to see.

9
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,803
Well, the son of a bitch
Spaniard's rutter was right

10
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,505
- about Magellan's Pass, was it not?
- Oh, give it here.

11
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,273
The cursed bastard thing

12
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,375
is to be the death of us all.

13
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,349
The time has come for you
to start making plans.

14
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,050
You have no food.

15
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,053
As of tonight, no water.

16
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,705
We'll make land.

17
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,391
We'll make land.

18
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,460
Goddamn English pilots.

19
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,162
You never know when to give up.

20
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,530
We'll reach the Japans.

21
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,201
Japans. Listen to yourself.
That is the scurvy talking.

22
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:49,636
We'll lay claim
to that dark land.

23
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,071
Then it's back to Holland, rich,

24
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,641
- having gone round the world.
- Eh.

25
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,178
No.

26
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,614
No, Pilot.

27
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,050
Not me.

28
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,122
Five ships when we began.

29
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:11,457
A crew of over 500.

30
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,527
We are now barely
a single vessel.

31
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,465
At my age, you draw your line.

32
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,011
That would be a coward's
way out.

33
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,415
The <i>Erasmus</i> remains home
to a dozen men

34
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,619
- still looking to you.
- Looking to me for what?

35
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,571
We cannot fulfill our mission.

36
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,814
Don't you see, there is nothing!

37
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:45,058
All right, there you have it.

38
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,463
Pilot.

39
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:55,236
Pilot, it's nothing to fear.

40
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:57,737
It's a blessed release.

41
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,475
It's like only a soft wind
in your face.

42
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,043
Can you feel it?

43
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,580
That is the breath
of the Almighty.

44
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,549
He's calling us. Listen.

45
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,155
He is calling us home.

46
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:50,691
Move over.
Can you see what they're doing?

47
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,143
- Come on.
- I think they're towing her in.

48
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:55,596
Can you tell what they are?
A-Are they Cathay?

49
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:57,096
Quiet!

50
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,599
It's what
I've been telling you.

51
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,433
They're Japanese.

52
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,541
Well, don't all thank
your good fortune at once.

53
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,108
We've reached it.

54
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:14,148
Portugal's secret empire
in the East.

55
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:15,815
Impossible.

56
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,084
The orders are still on.

57
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,588
- What part of this is still on?
- All I know

58
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,289
is we had Spanish ships

59
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,726
to the south and north of us

60
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,527
out of Santa Maria.

61
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:30,763
And this pilot got us through.

62
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:34,201
We can still negotiate.
We have goods to trade.

63
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:37,070
Not to mention I speak
fluent Portuguese.

64
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:41,141
As soon as the Portuguese
tell them who we are,

65
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:43,142
we'll be hanged.

66
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,445
They don't know who we are
because the rutters

67
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:48,415
are still locked in the
captain general's quarters.

68
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:53,821
And as long as they stay
that way, we are safe.

69
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:59,126
We're just merchants,

70
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:01,160
lost at sea,

71
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,212
looking for safe passage home.

72
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,265
You really think it'll work?

73
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,403
Here's what you're missing,
the lot of you.

74
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:12,573
We've been caught alee,
windless,

75
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:14,440
a speck on a current.

76
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,893
We've endured pestilence,
known starvation.

77
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:20,338
We've chewed the calfskin covers
of the ropes.

78
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,784
We should be corpses by now,
but here we are.

79
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:26,719
12 shit-smelling...

80
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,156
...but generally able-bodied

81
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,557
Protestant scoundrels

82
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,361
on a mission
against a savage horde

83
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:39,166
and the entire goddamn,
motherless,

84
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,635
shit-picking Portuguese fleet.

85
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:43,202
Aye.

86
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,438
I'd say our chances are fair.

87
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,178
This is not where we die.

88
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:30,590
Hello there.
You the leader of these men?

89
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,193
My name is John Blackthorne,

90
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:36,496
and I would very much like
to speak to you.

91
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,601
If it's agreeable,
I will come up alone.

92
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,574
You can't.
They'll kill you, Pilot.

93
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,642
Pilot, look at their swords.

94
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,578
Look out!

95
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,614
No, no, no, no,
don't fight them.

96
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,902
No! No violence!

97
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:01,421
We need him alive.

98
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,473
You fucking savages!

99
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:24,093
Now I will come up alone
and speak for my men.

100
00:27:24,094 --> 00:27:27,714
You keep hold of him
in case I don't come back.

101
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,522
Bastards!

102
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:49,852
I submit. I submit.

103
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:53,072
We are merchants.

104
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:56,559
I request we be released

105
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,047
to the safety of our ship.

106
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:02,082
We mean you no harm.

107
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:16,730
Omi-sama say, "Be good."

108
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,352
Is this the Japans?

109
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:25,204
<i>Hai.</i> Yes.

110
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:30,377
How do I say "I understand"
in your language?

111
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,385
I ask for my men to be freed.

112
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:41,188
- Not possible.
- I beg you.

113
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:42,488
In the name of decency.

114
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:46,593
Please, in Japan, must be good.

115
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:51,230
If this is how he treats guests,

116
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:55,769
tell this poxy little bastard
I piss

117
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,206
on his whole damn country!

118
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:05,332
Our <i>busho,</i> Lord of Izu, Kashigi
Yabushige, he asks to know

119
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,636
who you are and how
you came to this land.

120
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:10,203
Who are you?

121
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:12,106
A servant of God.

122
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:15,041
Your god?

123
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,044
First make that distinction,
you papist prick.

124
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:31,492
My name is John Blackthorne.

125
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,092
I'm English.

126
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:37,063
Pilot of the <i>Erasmus,</i>
a Dutch merchant vessel.

127
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,366
- We were blown off course two months ago.
- Lies!

128
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:40,768
That is a Dutch privateer.

129
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,368
And you're a pirate,

130
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,038
come to war on a peaceful
Portuguese settlement.

131
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,217
They don't know about us,
do they?

132
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,723
You told them Portugal
is the only flag in Europe.

133
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:04,391
Which means I am
the first English sailor

134
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:06,225
to reach your Catholic treasury.

135
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:09,329
And you have no intention
of translating my words.

136
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,701
I beg your king for parlay.

137
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:17,704
I humbly ask for safe passage.

138
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,748
Yabushige-sama says
your heretic ship now

139
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,515
belongs to him.

140
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:33,053
You will soon be executed,
as will your men.

141
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:39,008
I am not one of them!

142
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:41,761
And I will not be

143
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:44,230
spoken for by Catholics!

144
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:46,133
Not in Europe, and certainly not
in this dark land.

145
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,346
Well, I'm sorry, Father.

146
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,448
We'll be all over
this continent soon.

147
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:39,052
Go back in your sty,
dick up your arse.

148
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:51,345
Please, we're just merchants!

149
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,080
Please!

150
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:57,751
We're just merchants!
For the love of God!

151
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:01,755
Oh, please, no! No!

152
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:05,158
Please, no!

153
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,499
Please! Please!

154
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:23,076
Please!

155
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,427
Ah, Christ.

156
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:45,071
Good morning.

157
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,678
Where are my boots?

158
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:00,513
I heard a man screaming
last night.

159
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,283
Sounded as though
he was in terrible pain.

160
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:04,050
This is very tight.

161
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,057
Well, listen, if it's amenable
to, uh, to either of you, I'd...

162
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,795
I'd... very much like
to speak to your leader again.

163
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:19,332
With the swords.
The man with the swords.

164
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:27,674
Wonderful.

165
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:09,629
Where am I being taken?

166
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:14,100
You. You look at me.

167
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,337
You murder prisoners
without a trial.

168
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:18,438
Is that how it's done here?

169
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:26,246
You go...

170
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:28,215
- Osaka.
- I go nowhere

171
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:31,184
until I see my men!

172
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:33,787
Hey, hey, piss-eating bastards.

173
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:51,104
Bow.

174
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,640
Bow to the bastard-sama
if you wanna live.

175
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,741
The man is like a king here.

176
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:56,443
And tell him <i>"goyosha wo."</i>

177
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,780
<i>Goyosha kudasare.
Goyosha kudasare.</i>

178
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:02,716
To all the shit-eating <i>samas,</i>
huh?

179
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:04,251
Come.

180
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:08,122
You pilot of that Dutchman, eh?

181
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:09,422
Who are you?

182
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:10,690
Young little shit, aren't you?

183
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:12,326
What's the latitude
of The Lizard?

184
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:15,361
49 degrees, 56 minutes north.

185
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,530
And watch out for the reefs,
south-southwest.

186
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:20,401
Or they'll send you tits up.
By God, you are a pilot.

187
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:22,535
And <i>Inglés,</i> too. Fuck me.

188
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,153
Listen, sir, you speak Japanese.

189
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:25,772
I must know if my crew is alive.

190
00:48:34,514 --> 00:48:36,517
Well, that's good news.
Only one of your crew is dead.

191
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:38,218
And the Jappers say
they'll free the rest of them

192
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,554
- if you play nice.
- Who of my men's dead?

193
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:42,339
Here it is, <i>Inglés.</i>

194
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,123
Your crew belongs to them now.

195
00:48:44,124 --> 00:48:45,942
Maybe you'll see them
if you get back.

196
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:47,761
Maybe not, but it-it is
out of your hands.

197
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:54,100
- Where are we going?
- Osaka. Big city.

198
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:57,237
The Great Lord Yoshii Toranaga
wants to meet you.

199
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,607
- And what does he want with me?
- Play with your balls, maybe.

200
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:01,207
How should I know?

201
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,710
But he's a powerful sort,
so I might let him.

202
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,647
More powerful than those men?

203
00:49:06,648 --> 00:49:08,381
Lord of the Kanto?

204
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:10,317
A million of them fanatics
would die for the honor

205
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:11,585
of wiping his arse.

206
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:17,457
I didn't catch your name, friend.

207
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,828
Rodrigues, and I'm a Spaniard
who sails for the Portuguese.

208
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,695
I'm not your friend.

209
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:25,865
Any chance of me boarding
my ship, Rodrigues?

210
00:49:25,866 --> 00:49:29,036
Yeah, yeah.
Just as soon as you lick my jib.

211
00:49:29,037 --> 00:49:30,737
Listen, <i>Inglés,</i> no more tricks.

212
00:49:30,738 --> 00:49:33,807
I told these <i>samas</i> that
I'd be responsible for you.

213
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,343
So, do us both a favor,
blow her a kiss.

214
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,250
Be a storm by sunset.

215
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:18,785
Eh, we should head northwest.

216
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:22,590
This crew would love to keep
within sight of land.

217
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,708
You came over
with the Portuguese?

218
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:27,185
Sailed for a living, <i>hai.</i>

219
00:50:27,186 --> 00:50:29,275
How'd you get here, anyway?

220
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,365
Came by Magellan's Pass.

221
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:33,499
Merchant mission.

222
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,736
Captain-General held us
in Chile too long.

223
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:38,505
I warned him
the winds would die.

224
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:40,740
He wouldn't listen.

225
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:43,710
And now command rests on you.

226
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:46,446
That's some fate. <i>Shukumei.</i>

227
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:51,050
- What is that word?
<i>- Shukumei?</i>

228
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:54,054
<i>Shukumei,</i> it's like
an attitude out here.

229
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:55,521
It's, uh, karma.

230
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:59,627
Uh, fate. Fixed destiny.
Everything is connected.

231
00:50:59,628 --> 00:51:01,794
Part of a whole. Life, death.

232
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:05,599
You just have to accept
your-your wee place.

233
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:14,073
These people
are godless savages.

234
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,310
Or maybe they just don't
give a shit what you think,

235
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:18,729
young, scheming little pirate.

236
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,123
Why do you believe I'm a pirate?

237
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:24,155
You had 20 guns on that ship.

238
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:27,186
20 guns to defend ourselves

239
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,138
from unlawful
Portuguese galleons

240
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:31,091
piloted by Spanish dogs.

241
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:33,259
We drifted here by accident.

242
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,461
We're just merchants
hoping to once again

243
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:38,365
cast eyes on our coast of origin.

244
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:41,267
I like you, <i>Inglés,</i> I do.

245
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:44,571
In fact, given we have
a long night ahead of us,

246
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:47,641
I think I shall allow you
the honor of taking this watch.

247
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:49,642
Come.

248
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,344
Kind of you to trust me.

249
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:54,414
Why not? You are a pilot,
not a godless savage, huh?

250
00:52:01,138 --> 00:52:02,522
<i>Hai.</i>

251
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,760
<i>Hai!</i>

252
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:09,562
<i>Hai.</i>

253
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:24,511
We've got to turn ourselves
into the swell!

254
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:26,479
Where are your <i>cojones,</i> eh?

255
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,016
Where they should be, by God,
and where I'd like them to stay!

256
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:40,761
Go below, get them to row.
Can you swim?

257
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:42,996
- Can't you?
- Never learned.

258
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:45,232
Better to drown quickly, right?

259
00:52:56,777 --> 00:53:00,213
Goddamn it, <i>into</i> the swell!

260
00:53:00,214 --> 00:53:02,683
What? What are you
still doing up here,

261
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:04,350
you pirate bitch?

262
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,185
Piss on the Spaniard
who serves the Portuguese.

263
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,021
Piss on all English.
<i>Que viva España.</i>

264
00:53:13,226 --> 00:53:14,794
Pull!

265
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:23,603
Big swell coming!
Turn into it!

266
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:27,290
Row!

267
00:53:29,743 --> 00:53:33,246
Rodrigues! Rodrigues!

268
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,050
Rodrigues!

269
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:53,600
If you bastards want to live,
pull!

270
00:54:38,211 --> 00:54:39,512
Rodrigu-sama.

271
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:43,149
The pilot is somewhere here.

272
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,352
For all we know,
he could still be breathing.

273
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:47,086
<i>Naran.</i>

274
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:52,059
I don't care what sort of savage
whore-bitch turd you are,

275
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,662
where I come from,
we don't leave a man behind.

276
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,228
Rodrigues!

277
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:47,347
Move a limb!

278
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,217
I'm only trying to get a look.

279
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:01,061
I'll bring him up.

280
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:03,063
Me.

281
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,369
Oh, I see.

282
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,310
You can't turn down a challenge
in front of your men, can you?

283
00:56:20,781 --> 00:56:22,348
Go on, savage.

284
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,618
Maybe the fall will kill you
before you drown.

285
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:30,350
Sorry about your
sack-of-shit lord.

286
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,216
What the hell is he doing?

287
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:29,169
Huh?

288
01:03:11,725 --> 01:03:13,626
<i>My leg is on fire,</i>

289
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:17,665
my head is bursting
and my piss pot's full.

290
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,733
You make a foul nurse, <i>Inglés.</i>

291
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:24,538
That man was going
to kill himself

292
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:27,340
up on that cliff.

293
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:30,243
He risked his life to save you.

294
01:03:30,244 --> 01:03:32,346
And then when he was done for
in those waves, he didn't fight.

295
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:34,782
He could have tried,
but he just turned

296
01:03:34,783 --> 01:03:36,650
and drew his blade.

297
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:38,518
He chose his death.

298
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:40,453
What better end
can a man hope for?

299
01:03:42,522 --> 01:03:44,640
Will I die here?

300
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:46,759
Likely.

301
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,497
How can you just accept being
powerless to this madness?

302
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:53,066
Uh, you-you mean to this life?

303
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,370
<i>Zehi mo gozaimasen.</i>

304
01:03:57,371 --> 01:04:01,108
One cannot resist
the unseen path of nature.

305
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:03,811
All we can do is accept
our small part.

306
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:06,479
It's bollocks.

307
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,681
I fought too long
and too hard to get here.

308
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:11,584
I won't succumb to this madness.
I won't, I can't.

309
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:14,487
That's funny, I thought
you washed up by accident.

310
01:04:18,592 --> 01:04:21,728
Listen, Pilot,
I-I think it's only fair.

311
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:27,367
I found this on your ship.

312
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:31,204
It's a rutter, stolen off
a Spanish sailor, I imagine.

313
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:35,041
How you must have found your way
through Magellan's Pass.

314
01:04:37,244 --> 01:04:39,345
Which means this belongs to you.

315
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:42,448
It's a-a list of all
the Catholic bases

316
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:45,552
that you and your
so-called merchant crew

317
01:04:45,553 --> 01:04:47,220
were putting to the torch.

318
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:50,440
I mean, real savage business,
if you ask me.

319
01:04:50,441 --> 01:04:54,135
Your orders:
"Plunder any Spanish territory,

320
01:04:54,136 --> 01:04:57,831
reach the Japans,
open trade in the New World."

321
01:04:57,832 --> 01:04:59,499
Which is why I'm warning you,

322
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,302
these go to the Portuguese
as soon as I arrive.

323
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,649
This isn't the end for me.

324
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:19,753
I won't die
in this wretched land.

325
01:05:20,854 --> 01:05:23,456
<i>This</i> wretched land?

326
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:29,378
I'll tell you what, <i>Inglés.</i>
We're coming into port soon.

327
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:32,632
Why don't you go on up there?
Go up and tell me what you see.

328
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:41,074
<i>And tell me,
when you set eyes on Osaka,</i>

329
01:05:41,075 --> 01:05:45,212
<i>if you really think our world
is the hilt of civilization.</i>

330
01:05:51,385 --> 01:05:54,887
<i>And then ask yourself,
"What kind of man</i>

331
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:58,391
<i>wields power
in a land like this?"</i>

332
01:06:01,662 --> 01:06:04,231
<i>The one who schemes
in the open...</i>

333
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:08,068
<i>...or the one you never see?</i>

334
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:20,614
<i>There's a saying out here
that every man has three hearts.</i>

335
01:06:20,615 --> 01:06:25,051
<i>One in his mouth,
for the world to know...</i>

336
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:31,758
<i>...another in his chest,
just for his friends...</i>

337
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,782
<i>...and a secret heart
buried deep</i>

338
01:06:39,783 --> 01:06:42,736
<i>where no one can find it.</i>

339
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:49,610
<i>That is a heart
a man must keep hidden</i>

340
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:52,178
<i>if he wants to survive.</i>

341
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:02,589
<i>You'll understand soon,</i> Inglés.

342
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:10,463
<i>And who knows, maybe-maybe fate
brought you here for a reason.</i>

343
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:21,074
<i>Maybe you'll live long enough
to find out what it is.</i>

344
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:17,350
