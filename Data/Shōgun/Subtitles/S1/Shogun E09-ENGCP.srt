1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,208
<i>Previously on Shogun<i>..</i>

2
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,042
Your father treasures you.

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:21,083
We're prisoners to that woman.

4
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,250
You must stop these games.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,500
Promise to release the hostages.

6
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,583
I now wish to forge
allegiances benefiting this country.

7
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,500
I just need a new banner to sail under.

8
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,625
You wish to sail
on Yabushige-<i>sama</i>'s behalf?

9
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,792
Which is more important?

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,917
Survival of our clan, or Japan?

11
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,708
Do not give up on our lord.

12
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,875
Even when it appears
he has given up on himself.

13
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,125
Hiromatsu…

14
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,625
…knew his duty well.

15
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:57,833
Now are you ready to do your part?

16
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm ready.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,500
She's been caught
three times now.

18
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,500
Her father was
the treacherous Akechi Jinsai.

19
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:01,083
She's the last of his line.

20
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,833
Her husband showed her mercy,
yet still she seeks death.

21
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,250
May I sit with her alone?

22
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,333
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, is it?

23
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,125
In my culture, we would say Maria.

24
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,458
A beautiful name.

25
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,250
You are too young to be this sad.

26
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,125
I'm not much older.

27
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,500
I've known sadness and loss too.

28
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:54,833
But I believe God spared me for a purpose.

29
00:02:56,417 --> 00:03:00,250
And now he's spared you.

30
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,708
Our Father, who art in heaven,

31
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,708
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,

32
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,375
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

33
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:18,125
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil…

34
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,833
For when you have no words…

35
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:43,625
and you just need something to hold onto.

36
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,583
Well, we're making our approach.

37
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,958
Yes.

38
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,417
Why did he send you here?

39
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,292
It has nothing to do with you.

40
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,917
We are simply traveling
to Osaka at the same time.

41
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,583
Well, my life is mine and yours is yours.

42
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,309
Ah, your friends are back from Macao

43
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,750
with the overpriced silk they traded for
criminally underpriced Japanese silver.

44
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,792
True friends of the Jappos.

45
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,125
Tell him as soon as we arrive at
the castle we'll be met by Ishido's men.

46
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,833
He's to remain close.

47
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,708
You are instructed to stay close
once you are met by Ishido-<i>sama</i>'s men.

48
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,583
You translated honestly?

49
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,083
I did.

50
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,125
I hate this fucking city.

51
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,083
Lord Ohno's family.

52
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,375
Everyone in the castle is
now a hostage to Ishido-<i>sama</i>.

53
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,292
If a member from every noble family is
trapped here, none can oppose him.

54
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,208
We'll meet Lord Ishido tomorrow.

55
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,542
I want you there with me.

56
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,833
No.

57
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,833
We'll make our proposal then.

58
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,917
Understand?

59
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,667
- Uh... Lord Ishido.
- Mmm.

60
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Mmm.

61
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,250
Tomorrow. Yes.

62
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,750
Yabushige, thank you for trusting me.

63
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:45,750
When I deliver to you the Catholic gold,
you won't regret it.

64
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,958
Do you understand?

65
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,833
Certainly.

66
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,333
Mmm.

67
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,350
Well, we're together again.

68
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,542
Get some rest, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

69
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,000
It's true… you're here.

70
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,792
I apologize for the tight quarters.

71
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:25,625
We had to give up rooms
for Lord Otomo's family.

72
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,375
I'm so sorry for what you've endured.

73
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:37,958
And Lady Shizu,
welcoming a son in this cruel place.

74
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,375
I wish I could have been with you.

75
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,500
Is there word from Lord Toranaga?

76
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,542
Let's hope this works.

77
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,208
You are certain it was the heretic?

78
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:16,083
It's hard to miss the foul smell
coming off of the galley.

79
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,167
Whole escort of Jappers with him.

80
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,292
And the lady translator too.

81
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,042
- Lady Maria?
- Mmm. Your little friend.

82
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,292
Toranaga is planning something.

83
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,417
We have got to find out what it is.

84
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,083
I do not think the heretic is
here on Toranaga's behalf.

85
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,917
When I was in Edo, he had been cut loose.

86
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,458
Toranaga has given up.

87
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:46,333
Or you are blind to their trickery.

88
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,208
This felt different.

89
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,792
His most loyal vassal killed himself
right in front of him.

90
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,083
If John Blackthorne is here,

91
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,583
it is only because he is trying
to find his own way out.

92
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,292
Tempest in a bottle.

93
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,750
War is coming.

94
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,625
What a handsome gift.

95
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Show me your bow.

96
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,083
No, not like that.

97
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,583
If we're going to win over our enemies,

98
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,193
the least you can do is bow right.

99
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,000
Your back, here! That's it.

100
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,750
What are you doing?

101
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,833
You show him how.

102
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,167
Good, great! Great. That's it.

103
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,792
- Why…
- Mmm.

104
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
Now, don't speak.

105
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,792
And don't disappoint.

106
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,250
Ah, Yabushige.
I see you made good time from Edo.

107
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:16,250
How kind of you to return my prisoner.

108
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,500
My pleasure.

109
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,542
But he isn't for you.

110
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,833
He wishes to pledge himself to Ishido.

111
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:28,708
After all, no one lord should possess
all the guns in Japan…

112
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:29,958
wouldn't you agree?

113
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,708
It won't matter.

114
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:36,583
The barbarian will soon be
at the mercy of the Church.

115
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,625
Carry on with your boring
Christian squabbles.

116
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,833
But don't wrinkle him.

117
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,667
He's mine.

118
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,333
Good evening.

119
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,875
I am Kiyama Ukon Sadanaga.

120
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,167
Member of the Council of Regents.

121
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,625
Ah, yes. The most humble servant
of the Lord on high.

122
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,708
And a servant of the Portuguese.

123
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,667
Which comes first?
God or your purse strings?

124
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,583
I don't trouble myself too much
with the matters of faith.

125
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,667
I am, however, a student of trade.

126
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
And I can tell you that

127
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:22,542
we have quite enough pirate merchants
in this country already.

128
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:27,625
Your kind arrived here too late.

129
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,125
My kind?

130
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,667
But I'm not a pirate.

131
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,750
Welcome, Yabushige.

132
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,375
On Lord Toranaga's behalf,
I surrender to the Council.

133
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:23,583
And offer my condolences for the death
of the Taikō's brilliant wife.

134
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,833
Hollow words from a traitor.

135
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,583
As I once explained to Nebara Jozen,

136
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:37,083
I was deceived into leading Toranaga
out of Osaka.

137
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:42,708
Was that before or after you were deceived
into killing him?

138
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,583
If you wish for my head,
you shall have it.

139
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:52,333
But before that,
might you take a look at my gift.

140
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,000
The Anjin was once
Toranaga's prized hatamoto.

141
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,417
Now he is loyal to me.

142
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,750
He's well-trained,

143
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,167
and an excellent sea captain.

144
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,667
The Heir has no interest in a barbarian.

145
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:16,792
Dismissed.

146
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,750
Bow.

147
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,250
Move back.

148
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,292
We tried, Anjin. I don't know…

149
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,792
Welcome back to Osaka,
Lady Mariko.

150
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,083
I congratulate you and Ochiba no kata

151
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,667
on your joyous engagement.

152
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,750
I'm surprised you joined
this spineless traitor on his journey.

153
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,833
Do you bring news
of Toranaga's progress from Edo?

154
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,125
Only that my lord still mourns.

155
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,042
Naturally, he has been devastated
by the death of his son.

156
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,375
He has others.

157
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,292
It's a pleasure to see you, Mariko.

158
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,750
It's been too long.

159
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Yes.

160
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,833
Since we were girls.

161
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,292
Mariko and I spent many years
in Azuchi together.

162
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,750
Do you remember how we used to compete
in poetry competitions?

163
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,167
I remember.

164
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,208
In Daiyoin's memory,

165
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,333
there will be a poetry competition.

166
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,542
If you could choose the first line,

167
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,167
it would be a great honor.

168
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,458
I think it should be…

169
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,917
<i>While the snow remains</i>

170
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,417
<i>Veiled in the haze of cold evening</i>

171
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,167
<i>A leafless branch…</i>

172
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,792
Excellent.

173
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,542
If a bit bleak.

174
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,833
It will give us something
to look forward to

175
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,250
amidst all this death and treachery.

176
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:54,125
Unfortunately, I won't be competing.

177
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,625
What are you saying?

178
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,917
I'm sorry,

179
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,500
but I will not be here.

180
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:07,792
I'm leaving Osaka tomorrow
with Kiri no kata and Shizu no kata.

181
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,333
Leaving for where, Mariko?

182
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,542
To meet our liege lord in Edo.

183
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,792
He has requested I escort them myself.

184
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,333
He...

185
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:28,875
Toranaga will be here in a few weeks,
as you said.

186
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:33,000
It's been months since
the Lady Shizu has seen Lord Toranaga.

187
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,250
And my lord hasn't yet seen
his newest son.

188
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,333
Lady Mariko...

189
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,708
Let's find another time
to discuss this private matter.

190
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,101
Perhaps you can call on us...

191
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,708
Thank you, but no.

192
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,708
I am leaving tomorrow.

193
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,792
You forget your manners!

194
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,417
Forgive me,

195
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,125
that was the last thing I intended.

196
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:04,542
I will return with my lord on the day
we are required to be in Osaka.

197
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,667
Unless we are confined here.

198
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,250
No one is confined here.

199
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,875
But since you choose to speak
in this outrageous fashion,

200
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,250
it is my duty to ask the Regents
for a formal review.

201
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Lord Kiyama?

202
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,250
What do you think?

203
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,833
I agree.

204
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,250
Good.

205
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,208
Mariko will remain here until then.

206
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,708
I would be honored…

207
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,667
However…

208
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
my first duty is to my liege lord,
and I am ordered to leave.

209
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,875
You will be patient!

210
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,458
I cannot delay my departure,
even for a little time.

211
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,542
The matter is closed!

212
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,375
The matter is closed…

213
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,083
when you have the manners
to let me finish.

214
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,000
I am no peasant to be trodden on.

215
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,875
I am daughter of the great Lord…

216
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,500
Akechi Jinsai.

217
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,167
My line has been samurai
for a thousand years,

218
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:38,958
and I will never be captive,
or hostage, or confined.

219
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,292
I am free to go as I please…

220
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,167
as is anyone.

221
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,833
You will await the meeting of the Regents.

222
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,625
There is nothing more to discuss.

223
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,500
What in the name
of all gods possessed you?

224
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,917
Has your mind left you?

225
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,042
And is this body of yours… stupid?

226
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,292
So sorry.

227
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,417
Tonight was unexpected.

228
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,458
You knew exactly what you were doing.

229
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,750
On Toranaga's behalf.

230
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,250
I know it, Ishido knows it…

231
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,083
What are Toranaga's plans?

232
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,958
I can help him, we can do this together.

233
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,042
Tell me your orders!

234
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,667
- Yabushige.
- What is it!

235
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,542
It is not my intention
to disrupt your peace.

236
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,750
Or any peace.

237
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,125
I suppose this one's part of it.

238
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:08,292
The Anjin is here on his own business.

239
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:14,625
I'm sorry, but please excuse me.

240
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,458
I am very tired from the day.

241
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:26,625
"Leafless branch"... what a terrible poem.

242
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,917
Who writes about leafless branches
in the spring?

243
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,833
Come on, idiot!

244
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,500
Why have you done this?

245
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,583
I need rest.

246
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,750
I must leave in the morning.

247
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,250
But you can't leave.

248
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,417
They'll stop you.

249
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:56,208
Judging by the armed guards
everywhere I look, probably by force.

250
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,333
Then Ishido-<i>sama</i> would be admitting
I remain here by force.

251
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:04,083
As well as every lord and lady
being kept prisoner in this castle.

252
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:14,125
You'd walk into a sword
just to prove the blade is sharp.

253
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,583
Please, Anjin-<i>sama</i>,

254
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,292
you must not involve yourself.

255
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,083
Can you do this…

256
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,500
for the sake of everything
we have been through?

257
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,792
As your son,

258
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,750
I am concerned for our house.

259
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:50,458
I am only doing my duty.

260
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,875
To whom?

261
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,000
Your family?

262
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,750
It's difficult to explain.

263
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What about your duty to God?

264
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:05,167
Please, Lord Kiyama's a fellow Christian
of highest rank.

265
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,167
He asks you to remain in Osaka.

266
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:12,500
He says that our families are one
under the banner of God

267
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,625
which is why I am to become betrothed
to his granddaughter.

268
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,500
We serve Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

269
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,625
You will marry as our lord instructs.

270
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,708
I am tired of being in this family.

271
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,375
These things they say about your name,
I am always ashamed.

272
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,500
And for what?

273
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,583
What have I done?

274
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,667
We have nothing to be ashamed of.

275
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,250
Then stop this.

276
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,292
If you try to leave today, you'll be held.

277
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,083
And if you are disgraced…

278
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,875
…then I am no longer your son.

279
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:13,125
My Lady, are you ready?

280
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:21,875
Let's go.

281
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,542
Everyone get ready!

282
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,125
We're leaving.

283
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,958
Excuse me, Lady Mariko,

284
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,875
do you have a permit to leave?

285
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:55,042
Excuse me, but we require none.

286
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,708
Lord Ishido has instituted orders
throughout the castle.

287
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,625
You must have a permit.

288
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,833
I have been ordered by my lord
to escort his ladies to Edo.

289
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,500
Please let us pass.

290
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,167
I'm sorry, but without a permit,
no lord or his retinue

291
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,750
may leave Osaka Castle.
It is Lord Ishido's order.

292
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,583
You leave me no choice.

293
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,125
Please kill him.

294
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,833
The Lady will leave now!

295
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,000
Miyai, would you please take charge?

296
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,417
It would be an honor, my Lady.

297
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:19,958
Kill them!

298
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,625
I'm honored to have served you.

299
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,125
Lord Kiyama, Lord Ohno…

300
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,667
Please order these men out of my way.

301
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,042
They are not ours to order.

302
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,500
Those men belong to Lord Ishido.

303
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,458
We are powerless.

304
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:36,292
Then it's true we are all being kept
here against our will.

305
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,625
I will call for a meeting!

306
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:44,250
I am a vassal of Lord Toranaga
and my orders are clear.

307
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,208
I must be permitted to obey my lord.

308
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,000
Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

309
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,417
Please get out of my way.

310
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,458
Lady Mariko must not be harmed!

311
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
It is not possible
to fight through all these men.

312
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,208
We must go back.

313
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,083
However…

314
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:19,250
these men have prevented me
from doing my duty to my liege lord

315
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,500
and I cannot live with the offense.

316
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,875
I will take my life at sunset.

317
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,208
Lord Kiyama.

318
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,333
As a Christian, you understand

319
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,667
it is a mortal sin to take my own life.

320
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,083
I formally ask that you be my second.

321
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:44,625
I am obligated to her
as a fellow Christian.

322
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:49,083
Otherwise she faces eternal damnation.

323
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,000
That is her choice.

324
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,667
It's a bluff.

325
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:58,875
She won't forfeit
her eternal soul with suicide.

326
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,458
You're all wrong.

327
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:06,167
Lady Mariko will do as she says.

328
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:11,958
It is her vengeance.

329
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,083
On fate.

330
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,208
On all of us.

331
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:25,250
She will die to be free of the disgrace
that has burdened her.

332
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:32,083
And then all of Osaka will be disgraced
for letting her die.

333
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,375
A bit extreme, don't you think?

334
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,250
What is your counsel?

335
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:51,083
I have no counsel for you, Lord Ishido.

336
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,667
If you allow her to die,

337
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:01,292
there will be a revolt
from every high family in Osaka.

338
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:07,417
If you allow her to leave,

339
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,875
the hostages will also demand to leave.

340
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,583
Ishido's men began locking
all the palaces…

341
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,542
we managed to leave just in time.

342
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,417
We ask for the honor of joining you
in waiting for Lady Mariko.

343
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:32,875
We are pleased to have you.

344
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:49,125
The Anjin has been summoned
for an audience with the Heir.

345
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,958
I'm told your Japanese is decent.

346
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,000
Can you understand me?

347
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,583
Yes.

348
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,917
But I respectfully request
you use simple words.

349
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,042
A prepared phrase.

350
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,250
Smart of you.

351
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,500
I wonder if Mariko taught you that.

352
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,167
Thank you for coming.

353
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,458
The Heir requested an audience
with the Anjin.

354
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,083
As we need a translator,
I asked you to come.

355
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,917
She asks of me to translate.

356
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,750
It is a ruse to bring me before her.

357
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,208
Please let her speak.

358
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,167
It would be an honor
if I can be of use.

359
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:13,417
The Anjin thanks the Heir
for this audience.

360
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,292
These games must stop.

361
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,708
I play no games.

362
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,583
I have only my duty to uphold.

363
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,958
You can't bring nobility
to your lord's warmongering.

364
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,625
By being a worm on Toranaga's lure,

365
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,417
you will not win your freedom.

366
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,208
So sorry, but you're mistaken.

367
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:45,500
My lord wishes only to end this fight.

368
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,375
Would you translate
for the Anjin?

369
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:58,250
I want him to understand
the relationship we once had.

370
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:03,625
When we were girls,
Mariko did everything well.

371
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,458
She always knew where to stand,

372
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:09,625
when to leave the room
without being asked.

373
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:16,875
It was easy for her.

374
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,583
She talks about our childhood together.

375
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,750
She and I grew up like sisters.

376
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,707
But our fathers were
enemies, you see.

377
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,417
Their misery was ours.

378
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:37,625
Wars raged, even in our castle.

379
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,958
But I had Mariko.

380
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:50,542
She was my happiness.

381
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,500
And then she was sent away.

382
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:07,083
For years, I couldn't recognize
this woman I was told she'd become…

383
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,167
That Mariko, in her father's name,

384
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:15,375
wished to become a martyr…

385
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,000
But I see her now.

386
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,833
The girl who did everything right,

387
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,708
with anger growing in her chest.

388
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,208
All she seeks is destruction.

389
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:38,333
Aren't you tired of all this?

390
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,208
What should I do?

391
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,167
Surrender to some pointless death?

392
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,583
Wither like your "leafless branch"?

393
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:53,125
Only you can end the games
you accuse me of playing.

394
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,333
I don't have that power.

395
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,833
I don't exist, except to protect my son.

396
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:14,583
Tell me, how will piercing your heart
protect your son?

397
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,542
We should go now.

398
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:40,917
Accepting death isn't surrender.

399
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,375
Flowers are only flowers
because they fall.

400
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,042
Toranaga has thousands
of warriors at his disposal.

401
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,083
Vassals coming out of his <i>kosode</i>.

402
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,684
It's the mark of a coward
to send a woman to do his bidding.

403
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,833
You misunderstand him.

404
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:17,162
No, I understand perfectly.
He's taking advantage of your loyalty.

405
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,083
Your life is worth more than this.

406
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,250
Life and death are the same.

407
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,083
Both can have value and purpose.

408
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,917
Only one is permanent.

409
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,055
You have nothing to prove to these people.

410
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,750
You've made your point.

411
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,708
There's no need to die for it.

412
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,708
There is every need.

413
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,042
It is the very reason
my father kept me alive.

414
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,875
What I'm asking...

415
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:53,000
What I'm begging is,
if not for good sense,

416
00:41:53,875 --> 00:42:00,208
if not for God,
then will you consider living for me?

417
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,875
A message from Lord Ishido.

418
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:48,958
Your offer of service instead of death...

419
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,167
He accepts.

420
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,917
But he has a request…

421
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,338
<i>All these years,
you still have your cross with you.</i>

422
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,833
Your mind is set again.

423
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,500
Yes, it is.

424
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,292
I wish to be confessed.

425
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,542
Then speak it here.

426
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,042
<i>Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

427
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:41,875
But I can only confess
that I am not worthy to confess.

428
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:52,875
Daughter of God,
I wish I could say proper Mass for you.

429
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:59,875
<i>But here we have no altar or vestments.</i>

430
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,500
Then let us drink <i>cha</i> from an empty cup

431
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:08,667
for all the years we have known each other
and for the little time that is left.

432
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,458
I, Toda Mariko,

433
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:17,667
daughter of Akechi Jinsai,

434
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,917
leave this poem as my final statement.

435
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:45,667
Lord Kiyama,
please come forward to second me.

436
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,165
I will do it.

437
00:47:56,417 --> 00:48:00,042
Hell is no place I haven't already known.

438
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,833
Let it from your mind.

439
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,958
Please wait until I have fallen.

440
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,750
Your permits.

441
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,458
Stupid as it is
to have to come right back,

442
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:28,208
you are free to leave in the morning.

443
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:36,625
Lord Ishido!

444
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:41,208
I also ask to leave.

445
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:44,250
And me. With my family.

446
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:49,083
May we expect safe passage too?

447
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,250
Are we jailers?

448
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,042
No one is hostage in this castle.

449
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:59,875
If you wish to leave, then apply
for your permits and it will be done.

450
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,750
A mere woman, threatening her own suicide,

451
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,167
and flouting the Heir's welcome…

452
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:08,292
Disgusting.

453
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:45,750
I'm all right, Setsu.

454
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,042
Lord, if you'd like to rest,
we have the watch covered.

455
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,125
I was going to sleep,

456
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:06,583
but those hens unearthed
all the saké in the castle.

457
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:10,208
I suspect they'll be up all night.

458
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:14,708
I can understand
their desire to celebrate.

459
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,375
Go ahead, drink.

460
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,625
I insist.

461
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:21,625
Good.

462
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,083
Huh?

463
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:27,167
What is it?

464
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:45,667
Intruders!

465
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,042
Intruders!

466
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:24,167
Come quick!

467
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,625
Intruders!

468
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,042
Wake everyone!

469
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,250
Who are they?

470
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,208
Shinobi. They have come for me.

471
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,917
It's Ishido…

472
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
he'll never let us leave alive.

473
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:08,417
They've infiltrated the castle.

474
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Quiet!

475
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:14,833
Listen.

476
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,500
Tell them to move back.

477
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,000
Step aside.

478
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:41,667
Look out!

479
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:42,875
We should go to the dozo.

480
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,458
Its doors will protect us.

481
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:45,809
No, we should go to the gate!

482
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,417
I will not risk being captured.

483
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:51,000
Outside, there is a storehouse
with heavy doors.

484
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,958
Yabushige-<i>sama</i>!

485
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,167
There's nowhere for us to go.

486
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:30,750
Ready the fuses!

487
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:34,250
They're going to blow it open.

488
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,417
An explosion will kill us all!

489
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,542
Yabushige-<i>sama</i>, help me.

490
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,292
Yabushige-<i>sama</i>.

491
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:48,495
For the love of God, get over here and
help me push this against the damn door!

492
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,042
Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

493
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,292
Let it come.

494
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:05,268
For God's sake,
help me push this against the door!

495
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,768
- I, Akechi Mariko…
- Mariko-<i>sama</i>, get away from the door.

496
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:15,708
…protest
this shameful attack by Lord Ishido…

497
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,042
Lady Mariko, get over here!

498
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:18,958
And by my death…

499
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:20,042
Mariko-<i>sama</i>!
