1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,167
<i>Previously on Shogun..</i>

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,667
We've reached it.
Portugal's secret empire.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,958
- The orders are still on.
- What part of this is still on?

4
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:19,726
- I must know if my crew is alive.
- Please!

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,000
One has been executed.

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,723
The rest are prisoners of Lord Yabushige.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,582
The Lady Ochiba's sister,
my daughter-in-law, is in labor.

8
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,666
Or has Lady Ochiba been taken hostage

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,166
to guarantee your safety here?

10
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,167
Mother!

11
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,167
You are choosing the wrong ally.

12
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:41,125
We'll always be their hostages now.

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,500
I already received another offer.

14
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,458
Regent…?

15
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,250
Your formal answer, please.

16
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,416
I bow before you.

17
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,708
I will submit to Lord Ishido.

18
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,458
- He has surrendered.
- Behold, the great warlord,

19
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,000
who tricked his own loyal vassals
into a noiseless smothering.

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,268
You're all dead.

21
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,792
Cracking his head on stone.

22
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,167
Wasn't a death I'd thought of.

23
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,292
Be sure to record it in our book.

24
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,541
I'd rank it lower than boiling,

25
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,333
but higher than eaten by dogs.

26
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,875
Saeki-<i>sama</i>'s army
will camp at Edo's boundary

27
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,625
where they will wait for Toranaga-<i>sama
</i>to mourn his son.

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
For how long?

29
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,250
The customary 49 days.

30
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:22,542
And after that?

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,333
They will deliver us to Osaka.

32
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:52,667
Lord…

33
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,708
I am sorry for your loss.

34
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,708
My lord instructed me to
give these to you upon entry to the city.

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,250
For the completion of your service.

36
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,000
When we submit to the Council,
you're not required to join us

37
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,417
since you no longer choose
to stand with us anyway.

38
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,750
Fuji-<i>sama</i> will manage
the land until your return.

39
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,875
Though I cannot say how
my lord's successors may deal with you.

40
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,625
Fine strategy he has.

41
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,917
At least Nagakado-<i>sama</i> died fighting.

42
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,542
Your men are here in this city.

43
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,958
The crew from your ship.

44
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,833
You must be eager to be reunited.

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,458
And my translator, what becomes of her?

46
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,167
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, don't go to Osaka.

47
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,333
My allegiance forbids me
from doing anything else.

48
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,499
He's surrendered.

49
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,083
Your ruse was a brilliant success.

50
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:23,416
A great Minowara, meeting his end
at a humble fishing village…

51
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,167
Who would have thought.

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,583
He still has his mourning period.

53
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,374
Until his head is pressed to the floor
in submission,

54
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,750
we are not free of his threat.

55
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,416
Perhaps, to strengthen our alliance,

56
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,167
we should make our intentions public.

57
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,083
Our pact is not in doubt.

58
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,499
In the days when I stood
in the Taikō's service,

59
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,833
I was captivated by you.

60
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,666
His favored consort.

61
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,082
Peerless in strength, grace, and courage.

62
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:07,625
If you saw those things,
it was merely a reflection of our lord.

63
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,583
I revered our lord,

64
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,583
but let us stop pretending he was kind.

65
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:27,167
We didn't just survive our time,
we made our place here.

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,375
I propose we strengthen
our bond through marriage.

67
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,625
What would you say?

68
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:52,083
The offer is yours to consider.

69
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,250
What's there to be said
about Lord Nagakado…

70
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,458
He was eager to please.

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,792
Full of long stories that went nowhere.

72
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:32,083
Once, he fell from a tree
and broke his arm.

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,542
Didn't tell anyone for days.

74
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,875
So they would think he was brave.

75
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:46,417
He was truly courageous.

76
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,291
At the same time,

77
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,250
he was reckless.

78
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,083
What an embarrassment.

79
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,833
If I may…

80
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:09,792
It's hard to believe
Lord Nagakado isn't here with us tonight.

81
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:19,417
He would have enjoyed us

82
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,625
honoring him.

83
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,167
But he's not.

84
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,541
Because our lord has chosen to surrender…

85
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,000
to slice his belly
before that snake, Ishido.

86
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,000
This is something
Lord Nagakado could not accept.

87
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,333
Reckless as he may have been,

88
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:56,291
his life…

89
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,417
was given to one thing…

90
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,333
the name of his lord.

91
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,667
Lord Toranaga.

92
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,375
Absent from his own son's funeral…

93
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:31,333
I'm told Lord Toranaga has fallen
very sick from his journey.

94
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,500
So you haven't seen him either?

95
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,167
My nephew's speech last night…

96
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:42,458
he's just a boy,
but he's right about many things.

97
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:48,958
Look how his Edo generals wear
their armor in protest.

98
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,417
There are those who haven't yet given up.

99
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Why not march to Osaka
with guns and cannon?

100
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,542
You alone will head to Osaka.

101
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:07,291
As a condition of our surrender,

102
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,708
Ishido requested you return
the guns and cannons to Osaka.

103
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,916
Her grandfather must be very proud.

104
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:33,125
Yes, I hope he will be.

105
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,999
His new granddaughter…

106
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,375
Lord Toranaga hasn't come to see her yet?

107
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,792
I've heard he's been in bad health
since his return.

108
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,208
Have you heard from your sister in Osaka?

109
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,417
Only by formal letter.

110
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,041
Assuring me that
after Lord Toranaga bows to Lord Ishido

111
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:09,416
my family will be spared.

112
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,792
Beyond that, nothing.

113
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,542
You know how Lady Ochiba can be.

114
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:22,792
Each of us endures in her own way.

115
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,000
Staying hidden is hers.

116
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,542
Lord Buntaro.

117
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,208
Welcome back to Edo.

118
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,125
It's good to be home, Lady Rin.

119
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:48,042
Lord Toranaga sent word for you
to join him this afternoon.

120
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,125
I understand.

121
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,292
I will leave you.

122
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,208
Please stay.

123
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,583
I do not wish to interrupt.

124
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,624
These are hard times,
this business with Osaka.

125
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,667
I'd like to prepare tea for my wife.
What do you think?

126
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,292
I accept.

127
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,458
But we gave you
firewood yesterday.

128
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,957
Understand, but I don't need firewood.

129
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,792
Looking for, um…

130
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,041
My friend is asking for more firewood.

131
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,708
Please forgive this barbarian's
lack of manners.

132
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,976
Thank you for
your kind attempt at translation, Father.

133
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Alas, you are wrong.

134
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,500
I ask for charcoal.
It gives off better heat.

135
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,958
I must say I am impressed.

136
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,208
You have made your own way out here.

137
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,583
Thank you, Father. Ah!

138
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,250
Lotus tonight. Please.

139
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,167
Except I seem to find Catholics

140
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,917
in every sordid corner of this country.

141
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,083
Like the cacka-rooch.

142
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,292
It was not you I came to Edo for.

143
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,583
I have urgent business with Toranaga-<i>sama.</i>

144
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,875
Strange that you are living out here.

145
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:25,292
Typically a <i>hatamoto</i> is given residence
within the confines of his lord's castle.

146
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,292
What are your plans
now he has cut you loose?

147
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,042
Well, to start,
I will reunite with my crew.

148
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,792
Get back aboard my vessel.

149
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,042
Then pay a visit to that <i>Black Ship
</i>I've heard so much about.

150
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,917
Tell me, will you wear those clothes
when you see your men?

151
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,083
Ah, yes.

152
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,083
Yes, I intend to.

153
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,750
Thank you, Father.

154
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,125
Lady Maria.

155
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,042
I am so glad to see you are safe.

156
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,125
I only wish it were a happier time.

157
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,042
How is your lord?

158
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,833
I've not seen him
since we returned to the city.

159
00:16:55,875 --> 00:17:00,458
You've heard that Lord Ishido has bent
the Council to his will.

160
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,375
Of course we know this.

161
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,542
Our deal, which we made on the Black Ship…

162
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,166
Our church made its best effort,

163
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,249
but Lords Kiyama and Ohno

164
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,583
would not be swayed to your cause.

165
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,250
Things my spies have already reported…

166
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,667
Have you really come all this way
to tell me that?

167
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:28,792
Mariko.

168
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,708
From now on,
you will translate for this priest,

169
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,333
as the Church is not our ally

170
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:40,292
and cannot be trusted
to speak in our tongue.

171
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,167
Lord, if I may…

172
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,333
The Church did not send me
on this mission, Lord.

173
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,708
I have come on my own.

174
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,125
Tsuji says he is not here
on the orders of the Church…

175
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:01,667
I know these are dire times,
and many in Edo have lost hope.

176
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,833
But not me.

177
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,083
Ochiba no kata has manipulated
Ishido out of hatred for you

178
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,083
and I see no cause for her anger.

179
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:13,749
Though Ochiba has
no reason to be your enemy,

180
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,583
she controls Ishido.

181
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,167
I cannot change her hatred of me.

182
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,917
Unlike Ishido,
you love the Heir.

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,833
If you form an alliance with his mother,

184
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,083
the Heir would be free
to turn against Ishido.

185
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,667
He believes you can forge
an alliance with Ochiba.

186
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,667
And your thoughts?

187
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,375
You wish to hear my thoughts?

188
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,667
I do.

189
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:48,375
Tsuji has a point.

190
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,833
Why?

191
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,166
Osaka is not our enemy.

192
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,583
Ishido is.

193
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,624
If we align with Lady Ochiba,

194
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,500
Ishido's only path
to power will be removed,

195
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:08,042
as the Heir's army will become our ally.

196
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:15,083
You once knew her.

197
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,458
Do you believe, in a thousand years,

198
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:23,417
Ochiba would ever ally with me?

199
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:31,332
I don't think you are her enemy.

200
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,625
I think fear is her enemy.

201
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:43,625
She would sooner have
my head buried in the earth.

202
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,792
What?

203
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,250
Speak.

204
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:54,499
Your face… has the color of defeat.

205
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,375
Lord, it's not like you.

206
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,000
I…

207
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,875
This victory would come
at too high a cost,

208
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,792
so I choose a peaceful defeat.

209
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,416
Then you are giving up on those

210
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,832
who would never give up on you.

211
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,833
Quiet.

212
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,583
If I wanted your advice
I would have asked for it.

213
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,125
Call my vassals to assembly tomorrow.

214
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,667
I've heard these rumors
about their defiance of my will.

215
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,833
Wearing armor to my son's funeral.

216
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,208
Lord...

217
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,708
My son is dead.

218
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,875
I will have…

219
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,958
no further bloodshed.

220
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:48,000
I want their signed pledge

221
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,917
that they will march with me in surrender.

222
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,417
Tell the priest I am grateful
for his attempt to change my fate.

223
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,167
Since he kept his promise,

224
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,542
I will keep mine.

225
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:27,667
He may build a new church here in Edo.

226
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,537
The land has been set aside.

227
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,083
I only have one request.

228
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:39,500
That he return to Osaka
and tell them what he sees here.

229
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:46,417
All I want is a peaceful death.

230
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,208
He's going to fight.

231
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,542
How do you know?

232
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,000
Otherwise,
our lord would not send him to Osaka

233
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,333
with a message.

234
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,083
Beauty of Nature.

235
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,042
Winter is ending soon.

236
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
Yes.

237
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,541
<i>The scent of plums</i>

238
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,499
<i>detaches from the blossoms and leaves</i>

239
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,292
<i>off into the distance.</i>

240
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,667
<i>My mind is drawn to the distant haze</i>

241
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,583
<i>where the wind carries the detached scent.</i>

242
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,583
Perhaps you would take cha?

243
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,625
It would be my honor.

244
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,917
Your performance was wonderful.

245
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,958
It was only for you.

246
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,207
Despite what my father says

247
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,667
I think we're going to die in Osaka.

248
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:57,208
Perhaps that's what makes
this tea so meaningful.

249
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,333
I remember our first days together.

250
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,750
We were happy.

251
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,917
I struggle to remember clearly.

252
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:22,333
Are you still under the Anjin's spell?

253
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:40,333
Let us go to death tonight.

254
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:53,750
I wish to finally give it to you.

255
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:58,792
In protest of our lord's surrender,
and your enemies,

256
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,583
let us welcome death together.

257
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,250
Let us enter oblivion as husband and wife.

258
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,125
Even now you fail to understand.

259
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,458
What you've denied me…

260
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,542
wasn't death.

261
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,667
It was a life beyond your reach.

262
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:39,708
And I would sooner live a thousand years

263
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:45,542
than die with you like this.

264
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,707
Your men live in the funayado.

265
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:40,875
They've been drinking all the saké
in the region for months.

266
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:44,542
We'll be glad for them to leave.

267
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,583
All of them.

268
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,710
Stinks like Billingsgate at low tide.

269
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,833
Come on. What's wrong?
Come on. Beautiful.

270
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,667
You're my good doxy, you are.

271
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,042
Come back.

272
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,917
Come back. You're beautiful!

273
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:31,917
Pilot?

274
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,208
John Blackthorne! Is that you?

275
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,292
Hello, Salamon.

276
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:42,292
How are you?

277
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,500
We'd given you up for dead.

278
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:49,750
How many of us left?

279
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,292
Six. Barely hanging on.

280
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,750
Right.

281
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,083
Well, I've been given clearance…

282
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,750
for us to return to <i>Erasmus</i>.

283
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,208
I have a few friends.
Good crew we could train.

284
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:09,833
I've been training some of them
on the cannon already.

285
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,625
To do what?

286
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:12,708
To help us…

287
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:15,042
home.

288
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,667
Nah.

289
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:30,458
Whe... Where does the pilot
want to take us this time?

290
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:36,500
Maybe Africa? Or back to the Americas?

291
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:40,542
Since you're here, Pilot,
tell me something.

292
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,167
When we left Santa Maria,

293
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,500
were there really Spanish ships
to the South, to the North of us?

294
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,958
Had to come here?

295
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:57,167
I just hate to think that we spent
these months wasting away

296
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,625
because our pilot had
ambitions of his own.

297
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,458
First Englishman through the Strait
ready to make his name.

298
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,167
We had orders.

299
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,250
We could have turned home,
and you know it!

300
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:14,375
Our orders ended when the Captain-General
sent a shot out the back of his head.

301
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,792
That you come to realize that we are here.

302
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,125
What is left of us is because of you.

303
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll speak to the rest of the men.

304
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,292
First, take off those skirts.

305
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,417
And we'll, um... We'll careen her.
We'll scrape her.

306
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,583
And the extra men we need,

307
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,507
- you leave that to me.
- I said take them off!

308
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,750
You son of a bitch!

309
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,250
Let's go.

310
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,458
Here's your goddamn, filthy…

311
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:24,375
Tell him I understand we've had
our differences in the past, him and me.

312
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:29,792
But now is the time
when my choices are few.

313
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,848
While he regrets that
he has no choice in the matter,

314
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,292
he's come to you out of desperation.

315
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,458
What does he want?

316
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:47,417
I once offered to sail
for Toranaga-<i>sama</i> against his enemies.

317
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,125
Now he is determined to die.

318
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,708
Fine.

319
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,583
Fate.

320
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,083
I now wish to forge allegiances

321
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:59,167
benefiting this country
economically and strategically.

322
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,542
I still have my ship.

323
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,125
I can train a crew.

324
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,583
I just need a new banner to sail under.

325
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:07,167
You wish to sail
on Yabushige-<i>sama</i>'s behalf?

326
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,458
I don't wish it. He is a shit face.

327
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:11,667
But he is a brave shit face.
And that is the truth.

328
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,750
So, I must ask.

329
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,166
He believes our lord will soon die,

330
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:21,708
and wishes to sail for you.

331
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,249
I think he calculates, unwisely,

332
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:31,583
that you wish not to join
Lord Toranaga in Osaka.

333
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,833
This is disgraceful.

334
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,000
My nephew is right.

335
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,667
I refuse.

336
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,458
Yabushige-<i>sama
</i>politely declines your request.

337
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:52,000
The Anjin is wrong to think
Lord Toranaga has given up.

338
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,041
I don't know what the old man is up to,

339
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:57,583
but it's not surrender.

340
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,042
Even Yabushige-<i>sama</i> stands
with Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

341
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,792
- Only you waiver.
- Then let me explain again.

342
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,000
There is no explaining treachery,
especially against your sworn lord.

343
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,333
I am free of any obligations to him.
He has made that very clear.

344
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,958
If he were in my position,
he would do the same.

345
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:30,292
This weapon is not mine.

346
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,803
To tell you the truth, I feel embarrassed
wearing it most of the time.

347
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,500
Perhaps there existed
a... a moment in which

348
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:42,000
I had fooled myself into believing that
I could one day belong to this place,

349
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,417
but that moment is leagues behind me.

350
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,625
He says that he knows
he doesn't belong in Japan.

351
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,833
Having said that…

352
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,083
own people

353
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,583
seem

354
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,583
…strange.

355
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,851
I don't know where that leaves me,

356
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:08,875
but I do know that now I'm left to whittle
what fate I can for myself.

357
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:15,333
He believes he has
no choice but to make his own fate.

358
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,875
Since I first saw you near death

359
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:23,208
on that cliff many months ago,

360
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,167
I've known you were a man
who understood the importance

361
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,292
of taking fate into his own hands.

362
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:36,624
He recalls the time
you were close to death on a cliff.

363
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:40,374
He believes you also know what it means

364
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,625
to control your own fate.

365
00:35:56,125 --> 00:36:00,333
Tell him that since he is a foreigner,
I will overlook his mistake.

366
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,042
I would never betray our lord.

367
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,208
We've been called to the castle
to sign our obeisance to him,

368
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:13,083
and that is what I intend to do.

369
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,792
He refuses your offer.

370
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,833
Says it is betrayal of our lord.

371
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,708
You see, once loyalty begins,
it does not have an end.

372
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,292
Otherwise, it would not be loyalty.

373
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:33,542
But loyal turns senseless very quickly
when the order is suicide.

374
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,292
Would you like me to translate that?

375
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,333
Or was it for me?

376
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,792
The main gates. Here.

377
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,167
My tea house will be here…

378
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,167
We'll make a room for Kiku
in a separate house.

379
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,375
I see nothing here.

380
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,500
It's an idea she chased all her life.

381
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,125
It must be beautiful to finally see it.

382
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:19,458
It was your hard work
that earned this for her.

383
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,750
Serving my mistress

384
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,083
is my greatest pride.

385
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:36,125
Do you think loyalty could ever be
a disservice?

386
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,083
Or even a harm?

387
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,042
No.

388
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:50,417
I don't know
what I'm fighting for anymore.

389
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,458
If you look and see nothing…

390
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,375
you must simply look harder.

391
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:14,708
Lord Toranaga was very generous
to grant you this plot.

392
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,000
It's among the best in the city.

393
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,917
Who is that over there?

394
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,083
Your neighbors.

395
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,708
I'm told they are courtesans.

396
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,458
Courtesans…

397
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,125
Good morning, Lady Daiyoin.

398
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,667
I have tea and your favorite sawara today…

399
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,792
Someone find a doctor!

400
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,083
It was a stroke
early this morning.

401
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:18,167
All we can do is make her comfortable.

402
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:38,750
I knew it would be
this face to send me off.

403
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:45,375
All of your strength. And sadness.

404
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:49,667
You must stop these games.

405
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:54,000
Promise to release the hostages.

406
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,250
Ishido comes from nothing,
and he is nothing.

407
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:08,292
How about some medicine to ease your pain,
Lady Daiyoin?

408
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:33,250
Tell our son to look for me
in the Pure Land…

409
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,083
Look what I made…

410
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,042
Tomorrow, Yabushige will leave for Osaka.

411
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:08,083
In addition to delivering my guns
to Ishido,

412
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:13,625
he will submit the names of those
who will join me in surrender.

413
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:20,917
I now require your signatures
on this list.

414
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,250
Lord…

415
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:20,000
we are unable to accept
what must be a ploy.

416
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,667
There is no such trickery.

417
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,792
Forgive us, Lord…

418
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:29,458
we cannot follow you
on this path to defeat.

419
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,125
You refuse your duty?

420
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,749
Our duty is to advise you.

421
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,332
If you stay in Edo,
Ishido will be forced to fight us here.

422
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,250
He will destroy this city.

423
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:44,666
Let him try.

424
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:45,917
Which is more important?

425
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:50,750
Survival of our clan, or Japan?

426
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,833
My fight is decided.

427
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:05,875
Lord…

428
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:10,208
if you will not change your mind

429
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,000
then I will

430
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,458
commit seppuku at once.

431
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,458
Do you all doubt your allegiance to me?

432
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:29,750
Traitors should confess at once!

433
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,042
If you surrender to Osaka

434
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,666
it is treason against your heritage...

435
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:36,708
Quiet!

436
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:41,917
This is between me and Lord Toranaga.

437
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,083
My one and only friend.

438
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Lord…

439
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:56,708
I have

440
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:03,958
stood by your side
since you were a piss-dripping boy.

441
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:10,208
Then die by my side in Osaka.

442
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:18,125
You are throwing away
all that we have fought for.

443
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,792
I have made my decision.

444
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:39,625
Now you must make yours.

445
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:58,792
So you do believe in pointless death.

446
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:05,875
Lord!

447
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,917
Your vassal dies in vain!

448
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,417
Then die.

449
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,583
Lord!

450
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,167
Please stop this…

451
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:30,500
He has set his mind against me.

452
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,417
I will not yield.

453
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:49,583
Lord Toranaga…

454
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:59,167
Then this is farewell.

455
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:11,667
Buntaro, bring my sword and second me.

456
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,708
I'm following you into death.

457
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:36,208
No.

458
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:40,917
Father…

459
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,792
please…

460
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,292
You must live.

461
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:56,292
You will know what it is to be denied.

462
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,542
Do not give up on our lord.

463
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:09,583
Even when it appears
he has given up on himself.

464
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,625
Now second me.

465
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,750
Lord Toranaga!

466
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,250
This is madness!

467
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,292
Stop this!

468
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,000
Forgive me…

469
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:39,292
I beg your pardon.

470
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:47,917
Do you disagree
with what happened today?

471
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:51,458
Today we all suffered great loss.

472
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:55,792
I won't deepen the wound by disagreeing.

473
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:03,207
<i>The sound of rain on the leaves</i>

474
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,292
<i>can be heard.</i>

475
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,332
<i>Still more fragile</i>

476
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,625
<i>is the dew of tears on my sleeves</i>

477
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,917
<i>even in springtime.</i>

478
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,875
<i>Waiting, the pine tree</i>

479
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:24,417
<i>never withers in winter.</i>

480
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,750
<i>If I could use words</i>

481
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,458
<i>like scattering flowers
and falling leaves,</i>

482
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,125
<i>what a bonfire my poems would make.</i>

483
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:39,875
I concede victory, Mariko.

484
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:48,375
Your poetry was always superior.

485
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,042
Tell me…

486
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,375
has the Anjin gone to Yabushige yet?

487
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:58,917
Yes.

488
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,083
But Lord Yabushige refused.

489
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,625
He'll change his mind after today.

490
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:18,417
Hiromatsu made sure of it.

491
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:23,458
The Anjin and Yabushige are both goshawks.

492
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:30,375
Short-winged and predictable.

493
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:32,833
Then…

494
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,167
Lord Hiromatsu…

495
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,208
Hiromatsu…

496
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:48,417
my old friend…

497
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:56,583
knew his duty well.

498
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,625
Osaka has to believe my defeat is real.

499
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:12,708
Now are you ready to do your part?

500
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,500
I'm ready.

501
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,250
Hurry! Hurry!

502
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:11,333
Be quick.

503
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:13,667
What are you doing?

504
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,167
Hurry it up!

505
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,542
Yes…

506
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:22,958
If Lord Toranaga finds out
you've aligned with the Anjin…

507
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,708
I won't die on behalf of a crazy old man.

508
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,833
But the Anjin is dangerous.

509
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,208
Uncle!

510
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:32,667
What do you want?

511
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,417
Take care.

512
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:56,041
What you said the other day…

513
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:58,750
it meant a great deal to me.

514
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:03,625
Allies.

515
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,541
You…

516
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,542
…and me.

517
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:09,208
Allies.

518
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:10,292
Allies.

519
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:11,583
We're allies.

520
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:21,617
Someone's coming.

521
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:37,542
Lord Toranaga has requested
I accompany you to Osaka.

522
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,250
Thank you, my son.

523
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,333
You earned me some time.

524
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:40,750
I will not waste it…

525
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:49,458
Hiromatsu and you, both.

526
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:54,833
I will not waste it.
