Her memory is spotty at best and believes she was kept prisoner for about three weeks. She has no memory of the year she's away. Stahma is, to say the least, shocked at Kenya's return and doesn't quite believe it's her. She and Dalak set out to the woods to see if her grave is intact. For reasons of their own, Pottinger and Doc Yewl both want Kenya's memory erased permanently and Yewl think she has a way to do that. As a few of Kenya's memories return, Nolan begins to see a pattern and a possible explanation. Rafe's son Quentin reappears in Defiance.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3574704", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 333, "number_of_episodes": 39}
