1
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,900
Only 3 percent of the water
on our planet is fresh.

2
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,490
Yet these precious waters
are rich with surprise.

3
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,220
All life on land is ultimately
dependent upon fresh water.

4
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,630
The mysterious tepuis of Venezuela -

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,510
isolated mountain plateaus
rising high above the jungle.

6
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,360
This was the inspiration
for Arthur Conan Doyle's 'Lost World,'

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,610
an imagined prehistoric land.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,880
Here, strange towers of sandstone
have been sculptured over the millennia

9
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,250
by battering wind and torrential rain.

10
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,730
Moisture rising as water vapour
from the surface of the sea

11
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,860
is blown inland by wind.

12
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,210
On reaching mountains,
the moisture is forced upwards

13
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,760
and as it cools, it condenses
into cloud and finally rain -

14
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,090
the source of all fresh water.

15
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,610
There is a tropical downpour here
almost every day of the year.

16
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,330
Fresh water's journey starts here,
high in the mountains.

17
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,440
Growing from humble streams
to mighty rivers

18
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,270
it will travel hundreds
of miles to the sea.

19
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,190
Angel Falls,
the highest waterfall in the world.

20
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,920
Its waters drop unbroken
for almost a thousand metres.

21
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,310
Such is the height of these falls

22
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,890
that long before the water reaches
the base in the Devil's Canyon

23
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,230
it's blown away as a fine mist.

24
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,260
In their upper reaches,

25
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,850
mountain streams are full of energy.

26
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,610
Streams join to form rivers,

27
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,190
building in power,

28
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,190
creating rapids.

29
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,580
The water here is cold.

30
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,250
Low in nutrients, but high in oxygen.

31
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,380
The few creatures
that live in the torrent

32
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,260
have to hang on for dear life.

33
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,600
Invertebrates dominate
these upper reaches.

34
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,480
The hellgrammite, its body flattened
to reduce drag,

35
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,020
has bushy gills to extract
oxygen from the current.

36
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,990
Black fly larvae anchor themselves
with the ring of hooks,

37
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,410
but if these become unstuck,

38
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,210
they're still held
by a silicon safety line.

39
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,390
There are advantages to life in the fast stream -

40
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,520
bamboo shrimps can just sit
and sift out passing particles

41
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,940
with their fan-like forearms.

42
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,630
Usually, these mountain streams
only provide enough food

43
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,550
for small animals to survive.

44
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,010
But with the spring melt here in Japan

45
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,600
monsters stir in their dens.

46
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,240
Giant salamanders, world's largest amphibian,

47
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,120
almost two metres long.

48
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,750
They're the only large predator
in these icy waters.

49
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,750
They begin their hunt
at night.

50
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,400
These salamanders have
an exceptionally slow metabolism.

51
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,740
Living up to 80 years
they grow into giants.

52
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,670
The fish they hunt are scarce

53
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,970
and salamanders have poor eyesight.

54
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,770
But sensory nodes
on their head and body

55
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,640
detect the slightest changes
in water pressure.

56
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,030
Free from competition,

57
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,450
these giants can dine alone.

58
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,720
Pickings are usually thin
for the salamanders,

59
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,720
but every year some
of the world's high rivers

60
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,440
are crowded by millions of visitors.

61
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,400
The salmon have arrived.

62
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,830
This is the world's largest
fresh water fish migration.

63
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,670
Across the northern hemisphere

64
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,510
salmon, returning from the ocean
to their spawning grounds,

65
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,300
battle their way
for hundreds of miles upstream.

66
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,270
Up here, there are fewer predators
to eat their eggs and fry.

67
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,100
A grizzly bear.

68
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,220
From famine to feast -

69
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,440
he's spoilt for choice.

70
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,240
This Canadian bear is very special -

71
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,620
he's learnt to dive for his dinner.

72
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,550
But catching salmon in deep water
is not that easy

73
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,470
and the cubs have lots to learn.

74
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,970
The annual arrival
of spawning salmon

75
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,640
brings huge quantities
of food into these high rivers

76
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,850
that normally struggle
to support much life.

77
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,320
Although relatively lifeless,

78
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,700
the power of the upland rivers
to shape the landscape

79
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,830
is greater than any other stage
in a river's life.

80
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,460
Driven by gravity,

81
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,210
they're the most erosive forces
on the planet.

82
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,260
For the past 5 million years

83
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,270
Arizona's Colorado river
has eaten away at the desert's sandstone

84
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,440
to create a gigantic canyon.

85
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,530
It's over a mile deep

86
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,330
and at its widest
it's 17 miles across.

87
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,850
The Grand Canyon.

88
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,910
This river has cut
the world's longest canyon system -

89
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,210
a 1,000 mile scar
clearly visible from space.

90
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,490
As rivers leave the mountains behind,

91
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,620
they gradually warm
and begin to support more life.

92
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,430
Indian rivers are home
to the world's most social otter -

93
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,720
smooth-coated otters
form family groups up to 17 strong.

94
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,780
Group rubbing not only
refreshes their coats,

95
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,950
but strengthens social bonds.

96
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,250
When it comes to fishing

97
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,670
there is real strength in numbers.

98
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Fishing practice begins
when the cubs are four months old.

99
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:55,420
Only the adults have the speed
and agility needed to make a catch.

100
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,550
Adults share their catches
with their squabbling cubs.

101
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,900
Most otters are solitary,

102
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,280
but these rich warm waters
can support large family groups

103
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,200
and even bigger predators.

104
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,890
Mugger crocodiles, four metres long,
could easily take a single otter.

105
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,420
But, confident in their gangs,

106
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,960
the otters will actively harass
these great reptiles.

107
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,610
Team play wins the day.

108
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,080
The Mara river,

109
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,830
snaking across the plains
of East Africa.

110
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,550
As the land flattens out

111
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,380
rivers slow down
and lose their destructive power.

112
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,720
Now they are carrying
heavy loads of sediment

113
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,390
that stains their waters brown.

114
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,370
Lines of wildebeest are on their march.

115
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,670
Each year nearly two million animals
migrate across the Serengeti plains

116
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,050
in search of fresh green pastures.

117
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,880
For these thirsty herds

118
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,510
the rivers are not only
a vital source of drinking water,

119
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,760
but also dangerous obstacles.

120
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,620
This is one of the largest concentrations
of Nile crocodiles in Africa,

121
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,670
giants that grow over five metres long.

122
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,810
From memory, the wildebeest are coming

123
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,690
and gather in anticipation.

124
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,970
The crocodile's jaws
snap tight like a steel trap -

125
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,970
once they have a hold,
they never let go.

126
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,660
It took over an hour
to drown this full-grown bull.

127
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,870
To surprise their prey

128
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,170
crocodiles must strike
with lightning speed.

129
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,370
Here, only the narrowest line
separates life from death.

130
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,280
Most rivers drain into the sea,

131
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,830
but some end their journey
in vast lakes.

132
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,300
Worldwide lakes hold twenty times
more fresh water than all the rivers.

133
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,470
The East African Rift Valley
holds three of the world's largest:

134
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,980
Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria.

135
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,520
Lake Malawi, the smallest of the three,

136
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,110
is still bigger than Wales.

137
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,210
Its tropical waters teem
with more fish species

138
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,130
than any other lake.

139
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,380
There are 850 different cichlids alone,

140
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,050
all of which evolved
from just one single ancestor

141
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,560
isolated here thousands of years ago.

142
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,160
These two-metre wide craters
are fish-made.

143
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,550
Fastidiously maintained by the males,

144
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,720
these bowls are courtship arenas.

145
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,730
Cichlids are caring parents.

146
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,320
Brooding young in the mouth
is a very effective way of protecting them.

147
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,080
This lake can be a dangerous place.

148
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,970
After dark, predatory dolphin fish
emerge from their daytime lairs among the rocks.

149
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,070
Like packs of sharks,
they're on the prowl for sleeping cichlids.

150
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,910
In the darkness these electric fish hunt

151
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,790
by detecting distortions in the electric
field they create around their bodies.

152
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,020
Any cichlid that trenches out
will be snapped up.

153
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:05,050
The floor of Lake Malawi
drops 700 metres into an abyss.

154
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,480
Here, in this dead zone

155
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,150
the larvae of lake fly midges
hide out away from predators.

156
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,700
In the rainy season
they balloon up to the surface

157
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,950
and undergo a magical transformation.

158
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,670
At dawn the first adult midges
start to break out.

159
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,970
Soon, millions upon millions
of newly hatched lake flies

160
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,890
are taking to the wing.

161
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:10,160
Early explorers told tales
of lakes that smoked, as if on fire.

162
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,750
But these spiralling columns
hundreds if metres high

163
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,920
are mating flies.

164
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,100
Once the flies have mated,

165
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,600
they will all drop
to the water surface,

166
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,860
release their eggs and die.

167
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,910
Malawi may look like an inland sea,

168
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,290
but it's dwarfed
by the world's largest lake -

169
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,000
Baikal in Eastern Siberia.

170
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,600
400 miles long and over a mile deep,

171
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,100
Baikal contains one fifth
of all the fresh water

172
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,400
found in our planet's
lakes and rivers.

173
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,700
For five months of the year
it's sealed by an ice sheet over a metre thick.

174
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,430
Baikal is the oldest lake in the world

175
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:56,640
and, despite the harsh conditions,
life flourishes here in isolation.

176
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,520
80 percent of its species
are found nowhere else on Earth,

177
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,980
including the world's
only fresh water seal.

178
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,070
With this seal

179
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,950
and its marine-like forests of sponges

180
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,790
Baikal seems more like
an ocean than a lake.

181
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,650
There are shrimp-like crustaceans -
giant amphipods - as large as mice.

182
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,030
They are the key scavengers
in this lake.

183
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,370
The water here is just too cold for the bacteria
that normally decompose the dead.

184
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,640
Most rivers do not end in lakes

185
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,560
but continue their journey
to the sea.

186
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:33,200
The planet's indisputable super-river
is the Amazon.

187
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:41,410
It carries as much water
as the next top-ten biggest rivers combined.

188
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:50,750
Rising in the Peruvian Andes,
its main trunk flows eastwards across Brazil.

189
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,800
On its way the system drains
a third of South America.

190
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,810
Eventually, over 4,000 miles
from its source,

191
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,270
it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

192
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,110
The Amazon transports
a billion tonnes of sediment a year,

193
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,330
sediment clearly visible
at the mixing of the waters

194
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:26,000
where one massive tributary,
the Rio Negro, flows into the main river.

195
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,880
Its waters are wonderfully rich.

196
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,390
To date over 3,000 species
of their fish have been described -

197
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,680
more than in the whole
of the Atlantic Ocean.

198
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,630
The Amazon is so large
and rich in fish

199
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:18,010
that it can support
fresh water dolphins.

200
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,560
These botos are huge -
two and a half metres long.

201
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:31,270
In these murky waters they rely
on sonar to navigate and hunt.

202
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,040
They work together to drive
shoals of fish into the shallows.

203
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,690
Botos are highly social

204
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,660
and in the breeding season
there is stiff competition for mates.

205
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,490
The males hold court
in a unique way.

206
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,510
They pick up rocks in their jaws

207
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,840
and flaunt them
to their attending females.

208
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,850
Maybe each male is trying to show
how strong and dexterous he is

209
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,320
and that he therefore is the best father
a female could have for her young.

210
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,790
Successful displays lead to mating.

211
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,480
Even for giant rivers like the Amazon

212
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,150
the journey to the sea
is not always smooth or uninterrupted.

213
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,760
Iguassu Falls on the border
of Brazil and Argentina

214
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,930
is one of the widest waterfalls
in the world -

215
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,060
one and a half miles across.

216
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:10,620
In flood 30 million litres
of water spill over every second.

217
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,630
All the world's
great broad waterfalls:

218
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,590
Victoria, Niagara and here, Iguassu,

219
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,680
are only found
in the lower courses of their rivers.

220
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,520
In their final stages

221
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,560
rivers broaden and flow wearily
across their flat flood plains.

222
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,730
Each wet season here, in Brazil,

223
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,570
the Parana river overflows its banks

224
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,870
and floods an area
the size of England.

225
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,910
The Pantanal -

226
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,040
the world's largest wetland.

227
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,720
In these slow-flowing waters
aquatic plants flourish

228
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,060
like the Victoria giant water lily
with leaves two metres across.

229
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,790
These underwater forests
are nursery grounds for fish.

230
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,680
Over 300 species breed here,
including red-bellied piranha

231
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,810
and other predators,
like the spectacle caiman.

232
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,380
Ripening fig trees
overhanging the water's edge

233
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,140
provide welcome food
for shoals of hungry fish.

234
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,850
The commotion attracts dorado,

235
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,400
known locally as the river tiger.

236
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,490
They patrol the feeding shoals,

237
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,540
looking for a chance to strike.

238
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,580
And waiting in the wings,

239
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,540
ready to pick off any injured fish,

240
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
are the piranhas.

241
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,220
The feeding frenzy quickly develops.

242
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,700
Piranha can strip a fish
to the bone in minutes.

243
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,760
Great numbers of fish
sustain vast flocks of water birds.

244
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,310
The rose-eared spoonbill is just one of the 650
bird species found in the Pantanal.

245
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:44,120
They nest alongside wood stocks
in colonies thousands strong.

246
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,770
Spectacle caiman linger below,

247
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,940
waiting for a meal
to fall out of the sky.

248
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,840
When rivers finally reach the sea

249
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,760
they slow down, release
their sediment and build deltas.

250
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,810
In Bangladesh the Ganges
and Brahmaputra rivers join

251
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,020
to form the world's biggest.

252
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,400
Every year almost 2 thousand
million tonnes of sediment

253
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,440
eroded from the Himalayas
is delivered to the ocean.

254
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,080
At the delta's mouth -
the largest mangrove forest in the world,

255
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,000
the Sundarbans.

256
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,880
These extraordinary forests
spring up throughout the tropics

257
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,510
in these tidal zones
where rivers meet the sea.

258
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,690
Crab-eating macaques
are mangrove specials.

259
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:35,250
In Indonesia these monkeys have
adopted a unique amphibious lifestyle -

260
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,210
they fish out fallen food.

261
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:15,120
The troop also uses the waters
to cool off during the heat of the day.

262
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:25,340
But the channels are also the playground
for restless young macaques.

263
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:35,510
Some of the young have even taken
to underwater swimming.

264
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,190
They can stay down
for more than 30 seconds

265
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,400
and appear to do this
just for fun.

266
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,040
Yet these swimming skills
acquired during play

267
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,760
will certainly be useful  later in life
in these flooded mangrove forests.

268
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,190
In cooler climes, mud, laid down in estuaries,

269
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,360
is colonised by salt marsh grasses

270
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,320
and form one of the most
productive habitats on the planet.

271
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:07,060
400,000 greater snow geese flock to the estuaries
along the Atlantic coast of the United States

272
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,690
to rest and refuel
on their long migratory journeys.

273
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,530
This is the end of the river's journey.

274
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,360
Collectively they've
worn down mountains

275
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,240
and carried them to the sea.

276
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,740
And all along the way,

277
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:04,160
their fresh water has brought life
and abundance to planet Earth.

220
00:50:27,302 --> 00:50:42,302
