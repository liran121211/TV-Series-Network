1
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,460
Less than 2 percent
of the sunlight reaches the floor,

2
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,380
but even here there is
extraordinary variety.

3
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,640
In the great island of New Guinea

4
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,270
there are 42 different species
of birds of paradise,

5
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,770
each more bizarre than the last.

6
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,840
This forest is so rich

7
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,300
that nourishing food can be gathered very quickly.

8
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,470
That leaves the male
six-plumed bird of paradise

9
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,180
with time to concentrate
on other matters

10
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,650
like tidying up his display area.

11
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,450
Everything must be spick and span.
