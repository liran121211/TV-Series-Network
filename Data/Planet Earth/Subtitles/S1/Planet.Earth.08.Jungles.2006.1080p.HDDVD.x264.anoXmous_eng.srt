1
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,830
This is our planet's hothouse.
The jungle.

2
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,790
The tropical rainforest.

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,800
Forests like these occupy only three percent
of the land

4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,340
yet they're home to over half
of the world's species.

5
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,310
But how do so many different kinds of plants
and animals

6
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,390
find the space here to live
alongside one another?

7
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,580
On the dark, humid forest floor
the jungle appears to be lifeless.

8
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,790
Often the only signs of life
are what you hear.

9
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,140
A male blue bird of paradise
is advertising for a mate.

10
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,600
It's quite a performance

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,940
but he's not the only bird of paradise here
keen to make an impression.

12
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,020
There are nearly forty different kinds
on the island of New Guinea

13
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,200
each with a display
seemingly more bizarre than the rest.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,170
A riflebird of paradise.

15
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,350
Like many jungle animals,
birds of paradise avoid competing with each other

16
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,100
and these do so by living in different parts
of this jungle covered island.

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,740
The six plumed bird of paradise
displays in his special clearing, on the forest floor.

18
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,880
The magnificent bird of paradise
favors the low branches of bushes.

19
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,140
His female is modestly dressed.

20
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,320
The male has a good set of lungs

21
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,820
but he'll have to do more than
flutter his eyelids, if he wants to impress her.

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,660
It'll all depend on his performance.

23
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,710
The females may be dull looking
but they're very picky

24
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,350
and it's time for a really close inspection.

25
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,730
His right side looks fine...
but what about his left?

26
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,240
Pretty impressive,
but is he magnificent enough?

27
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,620
Oh dear. Her departure says it all.

28
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,330
Generations of choosy females
have driven the evolution

29
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,790
of these remarkable displays.

30
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,670
The more extravagant a male is,
the more likely he'll be noticed.

31
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,910
New Guinea lies in a warm tropical belt
that girdles our planet around the equator.

32
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,710
With abundant rainfall
and twelve hours of daylight

33
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:03,300
three hundred and sixty five days a year,
it's here that rainforests flourish.

34
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:14,560
Surprisingly only two percent of the sunlight
filters down to the forest floor.

35
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,610
Down here seedlings struggle to grow

36
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,070
but the gloom is not eternal.

37
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,650
The death of a forest giant
is always sading

38
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,450
but it has to happen
if the forest is to remain healthy.

39
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,250
The sudden blaze of sunlight
will bring life to the forest floor.

40
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,590
A single hectare of rainforest
may contain as many as 250 species of tree.

41
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,050
That's nearly ten times the number
that grow in Britain

42
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,720
and the thirst for light
triggers a race for a place in the sun.

43
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,160
There's no time to waste.

44
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,080
A seed that may have fallen
only a few days ago, now bursts through the leaf litter.

45
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,350
With so many competitors,
getting a good start is critical

46
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,150
but each plant has it's own particular strategy

47
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,030
for making the most of this rare opportunity.

48
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,700
The seeds of hardwoods are quick to germinate

49
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,410
but, like the fabled tortoise,
their strategy is to be slow and steady.

50
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:47,300
Vines and other climbers put all their energy
into rapid vertical growth, rather than girth

51
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,550
though they'll need to be well supported.

52
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,140
The climbers' strategy looks chaotic
but there's method in their madness.

53
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:08,190
Their growing tips circle like lassoes,
searching out anchors for their spindly stems.

54
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,830
They put coils in their tendrils

55
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,460
so that if their support moves,
they will stretch and not snap.

56
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,050
But the frontrunners at this stage,
the first to fill the clearing,

57
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,420
are pioneers like the macaranga.

58
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,890
Their immense leaves capture
huge amounts of sunlight, so fueling their growth.

59
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,480
As a result the macarangas grow
a remarkable eight meters a year

60
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,240
surging ahead of almost all their rivals.

61
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,710
In the race for the top sport
hundreds will start

62
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,720
yet few will ever reach the finishing line,
their growth cut short by the diminishing light.

63
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,140
In less than four years,
the gap will have gone

64
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,980
but that's not the end of the race.

65
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,950
The ultimate winners are the tortoises,
the slow and steady hardwoods.

66
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,000
When the short lived pioneers have fallen

67
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,960
it's the hardwoods that take their place,
and a fifty meter giant, like this one,

68
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,720
may keep it's place in the sun
for another two hundred years.

69
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,970
At the top, is the canopy,
the engine room of the jungle.

70
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,930
It's up here that most of the animal life
in the rainforest can be found

71
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:54,530
But despite the apparent abundance
of vegetable food, gathering it is seldom easy.

72
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
With no real seasons

73
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,550
each tree flowers or fruits
at a different time of the year

74
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,930
which means that food is very widely spaced.

75
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,310
Monkeys, like these tamarinds,
must search the canopy for all kinds of food

76
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,610
if they're to survive.

77
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,280
but across the world's rainforests
there's one type of fruiting tree

78
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,450
that always delivers:
the fig.

79
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:59,130
Wherever they grow, figs are a magnet
for the great diversity of animals.

80
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,100
In the Amazon, the first to appear
are the spider monkeys.

81
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,730
These large primates
are big fig eaters

82
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,320
But they won't have the tree
to themselves for long. Others will want a share.

83
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,820
like the diminutive emperor tamarinds.

84
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,410
The tamarinds love figs too, but being petite
means they're easily scared off.

85
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,720
Squirrel monkeys are also small
but they have strength in numbers.

86
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,310
Their timeshare on the tree may be short,
so their tactics are more smash and grab.

87
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,780
Capuchin monkeys are the bully boys
in these forests

88
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,500
and they want the ripe figs for themselves.

89
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,060
Figs are one of the few trees
that fruit the year round

90
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,320
so when other food is scarce, these fruits
are always available somewhere or other.

91
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,330
Even for leaf eaters, like howler monkeys
the ripe figs are just too good to miss.

92
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,380
And howlers are too big
for the capuchins to chase off.

93
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,510
Figs are so popular, that as many as 44
different kinds of bird and monkey

94
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,310
have been seen working a shift system
on a single tree.

95
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,200
Because fruiting trees are so valuable,
many monkeys are territorial

96
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,200
And if you live in the treetops

97
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,670
there's perhaps no better way
of staking your claim to a territory, than this.

98
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,800
The calls of the siamang gibbons begin
as a duet

99
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,470
between the dominant male and female.

100
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,450
The rest of their families soon join in,
and it results in a frenzy of activity.

101
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,540
The calls can carry over a mile,
and their message is clear.

102
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,850
They tell any neighboring siamangs
this is our territory. Keep out.

103
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,700
Up here the calls of siamang gibbons
seem to dominate the airwaves

104
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,620
but with the jungle's incredible diversity

105
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,080
there are countless others
trying to be heard too.

106
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,170
Every layer seems to beat to a different tune.

107
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,900
In the early morning
the forest's chorus is particularly rich.

108
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,110
Sounds travel further in the cooler air

109
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:42,040
But few calls can penetrate as far
through the dense vegetation as this one

110
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,670
the deep bass solo of a male orangutan.

111
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,810
In the middle of the day
little stirs in the jungle

112
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,570
and the hot dense air muffles the sound.

113
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:18,790
As the afternoon wears on,
a different set of players begin to warm up.

114
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:27,380
Insects work in harmony, timing their calls
to fall between the notes of others.

115
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,140
Many singers stick to precise schedules

116
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,430
and right on cue the six o'clock cicada.

117
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Night brings out a whole new orchestra.

118
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,900
The cacophony of competing calls
seems deafening to us

119
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:34,110
but frogs ears are tuned
to hear only the calls of their own kind.

120
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,620
The songs of courtship echo from all around.

121
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,180
Male gliding leaf frogs
leap from the treetops.

122
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:45,770
To slow their descent,
they use their huge webbed feet as parachutes.

123
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:55,070
These large tree frogs
spend most of their lives in the high canopy

124
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,950
and only come down when it's time to breed.

125
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,710
Once settled,
they begin to serenade their unseen females.

126
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,890
Now it's time for the females
to make their move.

127
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,400
There's no shortage of suitors,
but this female has already made her choice.

128
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,400
She's heading towards the loudest call,
because loud calls come from big frogs

129
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:49,700
and big is best, but to reach him she must run
the gauntlet of a gang of smaller suitors.

130
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,040
Their only chance of mating
is to make a sneaky interception.

131
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,050
He's scored.

132
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,350
But with more females arriving all the time,
it's not over until the fat frog stops singing.

133
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:21,320
Feet, so vital for gliding,
are now put to other uses.

134
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,830
Two's company,
three's inconvenient

135
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,750
but in any case, all male frogs
are equipped with dry thumbs

136
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,760
which enable them to get a vice like grip
on their moist partners.

137
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,510
It's a case of first come first served.

138
00:21:54,270 --> 00:22:01,030
Living in such a humid environment,
means jungle frogs are less tied to puddles and pools

139
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,820
and these even lay their eggs out of water.

140
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,210
There's little chance of them drying out

141
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,420
and up here they're safer from predators.

142
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,560
Surprisingly, it doesn't rain every day
in the rainforest

143
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,020
but more still falls here
than anywhere else on Earth.

144
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,530
On average,
over two meters a year.

145
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,710
A single tree can suck up
hundreds of tons of water each year

146
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,590
But the trees can't use all this water

147
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,430
so, much of it returns to the air as vapor,
forming mist and clouds.

148
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,520
In the Amazon, the largest unbroken stretch
of rainforest in the world,

149
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:27,030
half of all the rainwater that falls,
comes from clouds produced by the trees themselves.

150
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,980
With so much rain, it's not surprising
that many of the worlds largest rivers

151
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,940
are found in rainforests.

152
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,210
Inside the forest, the high humidity

153
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:34,350
creates the perfect conditions
for a strange world, where life is built on decay.

154
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:54,990
Amoeba like slime molds cruise the surface,
feeding on bacteria and rotting vegetation.

155
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,220
Fungi also flourish on decay.

156
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,690
These are the fruiting bodies of the fungi,
the only visible sign

157
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,150
of a vast underground network
of fungal filaments.

158
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,310
In temperate forests, the buildup of leaf litter
creates rich stores of nutrients.

159
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,440
That however, doesn't happen here.

160
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,450
Nutrients that reach the soil
are leeched out by the rain

161
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,990
but fungi are connected to tree roots
by their underground filaments

162
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,330
and by quickly consuming the dead

163
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:28,040
they help to recycle crucial minerals
straight back into the trees.

164
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,930
And this recycling happens faster here,
than anywhere else on the planet.

165
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:06,250
There are thought to be nearly a million
different types of fungi in the tropics.

166
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,840
The vast majority still unknown to science

167
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,470
But one thing's for certain

168
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,680
without fungi, rainforests could not exist.

169
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Nothing goes to waste in the rainforest.

170
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,830
The fungi become food for others
like these beetle larvae.

171
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,250
Finding the fungus isn't a problem
for the grubs

172
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,920
since their caring parents
actually show them the way.

173
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,520
Incredibly, 80% of all insects
live in jungles

174
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:21,780
fewer more successful than the ants.
There can be 8 million individuals in a single hectare.

175
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,250
but jungle ants
don't have it all their own way.

176
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,260
These bullet ants are showing
some worrying symptoms.

177
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,720
Spores from a parasitic fungus
called cordyceps

178
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,140
have infiltrated
their bodies and their minds.

179
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,400
It's infected brain
directs this ant upwards

180
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,200
then, utterly disorientated,
it grips a stem with it's mandibles.

181
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,870
Those afflicted,
that are discovered by the workers

182
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,330
are quickly taken away and dumped
far away from the colony.

183
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,800
It seems extreme,
but this is the reason why.

184
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,180
Like something out of science fiction

185
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:31,020
the fruiting body of the cordyceps
erupts from the ant's head.

186
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,080
It can take three weeks to grow

187
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,080
and when finished,
the deadly spores will burst from it's tip

188
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,800
then, any ant in the vicinity
will be in serious risk of death.

189
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,720
The fungus is so virulent,
it can wipe out whole colonies of ants

190
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,140
and it's not just ants
that fall victim to this killer.

191
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,020
There are literally thousands
of different types of cordyceps fungi

192
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:23,280
and remarkably, each specializes
on just one species

193
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,030
but these attacks do have a positive effect
on the jungle's diversity.

194
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,910
Since parasites like these stop any one group
of animal getting the upper hand.

195
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:16,920
The more numerous a species becomes,
the more likely it'll be attacked by it's nemesis

196
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,630
a cordyceps fungus.

197
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,490
With so much competition,
jungles have become the home of the specialist.

198
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,950
Now this animal, in the island of Borneo,
is one of the most unusual.

199
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,920
It's a colugo, or flying lemur,
though this is something of a misnomer

200
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,050
as it doesn't actually fly
and it certainly isn't a lemur

201
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,300
in fact nobody's quite sure
who it's closest relative is.

202
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,830
The colugo depends on a diet of young leaves

203
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,660
and to find enough of them,
it must move from tree to tree.

204
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,840
The leaves are not very nutritious, but then,
getting around doesn't use much energy.

205
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,600
In a single night, a colugo might have to
travel as far as two miles

206
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,440
but that task is made easier
by it's superior gliding skills.

207
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:40,100
The secret of success
in the competitive jungle is specializing

208
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,730
and this has led to the evolution
of some very intimate relationships

209
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,190
between plants and animals.

210
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:53,450
These are pitcher plants
also from Borneo.

211
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,580
Adapted to living in very low nutrient soils

212
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,170
the pitcher plant gets most of it's nourishment
from insects lured to nectar glands

213
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,130
on the underside of the lids.

214
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,680
Once onboard, the waxy sides of the pitcher
ensure there's little chance of escape.

215
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,770
Most slip to a watery grave.

216
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,570
At the bottom of the pitcher
glands secrete enzymes

217
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,660
which help to digest the corpses,
so feeding the plant.

218
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,830
But not all visitors have a fatal attraction
to the pitchers.

219
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,760
The red crab spider spends it's entire life
in the pitchers, hanging on with threads of silk.

220
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:11,900
Instead of building a web, it relies on
the water filled pitcher to trap it's food.

221
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,410
When an ant falls in,
the spider simply waits for it to drown

222
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:24,080
and then abseils down for a spot of fishing.

223
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,130
Alive, this ant would be far too dangerous
for the spider to tackle

224
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,390
so, using the pitchers as traps,
means it can get bigger meals

225
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,350
and the spider doesn't rob the pitcher
of everything.

226
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,360
The digested remains of it's booty
will end up in the water

227
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,030
providing instant food for the plant.

228
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,780
Other food, like mosquito larvae,
seems to be out of reach

229
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,040
but the spider has another sup rising trick.

230
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,580
By taking it's own air supply
trapped in a bubble

231
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,880
the crab spider can actually dive
to the very bottom of the pitcher.

232
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:25,140
Once the prey is captured, the spider
hauls itself back up it's silken safety line.

233
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:38,110
The pitcher is a one stop shop for this spider,
but it's not alone.

234
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:44,490
In the jungle there's competition for everything,
even a small water filled pitcher plant.

235
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,560
Such specialists create
the jungle's remarkable diversity

236
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,270
but finding enough food to survive
is so challenging

237
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,520
that most animals living here tend to be small

238
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,320
though there are exceptions.

239
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,580
This is the Congo in Africa.

240
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:32,500
It's a vast wilderness
and the least explored of all jungles.

241
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,920
From up here the forest looks similar to the ones
that grow in the Amazon or Southeast Asia.

242
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,970
but down below
there are some unexpected sights.

243
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,990
Crisscrossing this forest,
are countless miles of highways

244
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,710
and they were made by something big.

245
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:27,100
Forest elephants roam great distances
in their search for food

246
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:32,680
but to survive, they must emerge
from the gloom of the forest.

247
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:40,730
And clearings like this one,
are a magnet for elephants from far and wide.

248
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:42,300
These elephants live in much smaller groups
than their savanna cousins.

249
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,800
This might be the first time that one group
will have seen another for a month.

250
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:05,530
For the adult males it's a welcome break
in an otherwise largely solitary existence

251
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,710
and they're not the only animals
attracted to the clearing.

252
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:25,960
Forest buffaloes and red river hogs
are also regular visitors

253
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,850
as are bongos, which are very difficult to see
outside these clearings.

254
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:38,390
All these large forest animals have come here
to collect an essential element of their diet

255
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,560
that lies buried beneath the mud.

256
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,360
And the elephant's trunk
is the perfect tool for reaching it.

257
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,010
To get what they seek

258
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:12,550
the prospecting elephants must first
blow away the covering layer of silt.

259
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,620
Satisfaction at last.

260
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,670
They're collecting
a particular kind of clay

261
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,090
that contains vital minerals
scarce in their natural diet.

262
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:56,640
It may be mud, but there's just nothing
quite like it for enriching the blood.

263
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,440
The clay also helps to absorb the toxins
found in many leaves that the elephants eat.

264
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,030
There are other benefits to coming here.

265
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,120
These clearings are the only places
where the forest elephants

266
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,040
can get together in such numbers.

267
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:26,540
When they return to the forest, they will have to go
their separate ways, once more.

268
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,320
If large animals are rare in jungles

269
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,240
then groups of large animals
actually living together, are even rarer.

270
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:22,020
This posse of hunters is not only formidable,
it's also very large.

271
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,710
In their search for food
chimpanzees move effortlessly

272
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,790
between the forest floor and the canopy.

273
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,130
They're one of the few jungle animals
able to do so.

274
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,820
Figs are a vital part of a chimpanzee's diet

275
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,360
and some just can't seem to get enough of them.

276
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:30,250
But there's something special
about this stretch of forest in Uganda.

277
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,250
Fruit is actually abundant

278
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,680
and a lot of food supports lots of chimps.

279
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,370
At a hundred and fifty strong,
this community of chimps

280
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,160
is the biggest yet found in Africa.

281
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,830
Their numbers are so large, that they need
a big territory, lots of fig trees

282
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,460
and they're willing to fight for it.

283
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,060
These calls announce the start of a raid
into land controlled by their neighbors.

284
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:44,490
As they leave their core zone, the patrol
goes silent, occasionally stopping to listen.

285
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:54,580
Signs of the enemy are detected
and examined closely.

286
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,900
The chimp militia are now
at the very edge of their territory.

287
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,400
All need to be on maximum alert.

288
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,790
Then it's wait and listen.

289
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,480
An unfamiliar chimp call
raises the tension.

290
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,990
It's an uncertain time. The size
of the rival group is as yet unknown.

291
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,240
Not far away the neighbors
are feeding in a fig tree

292
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,870
oblivious to the approaching dangers.

293
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,000
The patrol moves off
with a sense of purpose.

294
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,920
They must remain silent
until they close in on their rivals.

295
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,310
The attack is on.

296
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,900
To intimidate their opponents, the aggressors
scream and drum on buttress roots.

297
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,390
Several males corner an enemy female.

298
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:13,390
It's a ferocious attack,
and she's lucky to escape with her life.

299
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,540
Others are not so fortunate.

300
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,130
The battle won,
a grizzly scene unfolds.

301
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,260
An enemy youngster
has been caught and killed.

302
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:54,100
The carcass is shared between
members of the group, and eaten.

303
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:02,650
Killing a competitor makes sense
if you want to protect your food supply

304
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,030
but exactly why they cannibalize
the dead chimp, is not fully understood.

305
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,080
It may simply be a chance
for some extra protein.

306
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,760
Teamwork has brought this
group of chimps great success

307
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,890
but they'll soon reach
the limits of their power.

308
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,820
The competition for resources ensures
that no one species dominates the jungle.

309
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,490
The rainforest's great diversity
has come at a cost.

310
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,830
It has made them the most finely balanced
ecosystems in the world

311
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,040
only too easily upset and destroyed
by that other great ape

312
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,170
the chimpanzee's closest relative

313
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,930
Ourselves.

284
