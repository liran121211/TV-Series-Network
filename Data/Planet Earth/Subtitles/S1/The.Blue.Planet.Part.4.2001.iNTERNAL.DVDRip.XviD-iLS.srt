1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,400
The frozen seas are worlds
unto themselves.

2
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,400
Beneath their ceiling of ice
they have an eerie,

3
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:55,400
almost magical stillness, cut off
from the storms that rage above.

4
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:05,401
In the winter, the feeble slanting
rays of the sun bring little warmth

5
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,402
and the temperature seldom rises
above minus fifty degrees Centigrade.

6
00:01:23,404 --> 00:01:27,403
For much of the year,
it is dark and cripplingly cold.

7
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,404
Yet, there is life here.
At both ends of the earth...

8
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:35,404
the Arctic and the Antarctic.

9
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:47,405
For most animals, whether they
live in or out of water,

10
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:51,406
the winters, when much of the sea
is frozen, bring the greatest challenge.

11
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:58,408
The Northern hemisphere.

12
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,407
It's February, and as the Earth
tilts on its axis,

13
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:04,407
the sun's rays creep
slowly northwards

14
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:08,407
and the Arctic emerges
from its harsh winter.

15
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:15,408
The Arctic is a frozen ocean
surrounded by continents

16
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,410
and when the surface of the sea
between the continents freezes

17
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:22,409
from shore to shore, land predators
walk out onto it - to hunt.

18
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:34,410
It's early March and the sea
is still covered with ice.

19
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:40,411
But there are patches of open water.
Polynyas that never freeze over.

20
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,411
Here, where tidal currents
are squeezed between islands,

21
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:48,411
the water movement is so strong
that ice cannot form.

22
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:57,412
Walruses spend the
winter in polynyas.

23
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:00,413
Here they have permanent
access to the air,

24
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:04,413
but they can also retreat to
the sea to shelter to hunt.

25
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,416
Other sea mammals overwinter
in the polynyas as well

26
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:24,415
in this one, a young bowhead whale.

27
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:37,416
Here the current is really fast
and the shifting ice is dangerous.

28
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:47,417
This whale became trapped when
ice encircled it last autumn.

29
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,419
There is no food here, but a whale
must breathe and the only place

30
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,419
that it can do so, for miles around,
is in this tiny hole.

31
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,420
It's living entirely on its reserves
of fat, but now they are dangerously low.

32
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,420
It will be some months yet,
before it can escape.

33
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:33,422
Elsewhere, other whales
have also been trapped.

34
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,422
These are belugas.

35
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:38,423
Their tiny hole in the ice
has been kept open,

36
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:42,423
not by currents but by
the belugas' continuous movements

37
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:46,423
as they rise to breathe.

38
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:53,424
Open water is now some
twenty miles away.

39
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:57,424
It will be two months yet
before the ice melts.

40
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:12,426
The belugas are extremely thin.
And most of them are horribly scarred.

41
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:26,427
But their wounds were not
inflicted by the ice.

42
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:38,428
A whale would be a huge prize for
any meat-eating hunter and these belugas,

43
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,429
trapped by the ice,
are within reach of polar bears.

44
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:00,431
Well aware of the danger, the belugas
stay submerged as long as they can.

45
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:05,431
But they can only hold their breath
for about twenty minutes.

46
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:28,433
Catching a four-metre long whale
that weighs one ton is no easy task

47
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:34,434
even if that whale is
weakened by starvation.

48
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:49,436
But a beluga is well
worth waiting for.

49
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,438
Day by day, as the hole
gets bigger,

50
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,438
it becomes increasingly difficult
for the bear to land a whale.

51
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,439
Keeping its fur in good condition and
free from salt is important for warmth

52
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,440
and the bear uses snow
like blotting paper.

53
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:45,441
These belugas have been attacked by many
bears over the last six months

54
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:49,442
and some have been caught.

55
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:54,442
It may have taken a long time and
a lot of patience, but a catch,

56
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:58,442
when it's made, brings abundant
rewards of energy rich blubber.

57
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:13,444
Gulls rely on bear-kills
at this time of the year

58
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:17,444
and the colour of blood staining the
ice attracts them from a long way away.

59
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:27,445
The remaining belugas still have
a long wait before they are released

60
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:31,446
from their prison and
the threat of slaughter.

61
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,449
Arctic foxes also rely on the
polar bears to hunt on their behalf.

62
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,449
They're the jackals of the north and
scavenge from bear kills whenever they can.

63
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:21,451
In winter and early spring,
they are wholly dependent on bears.

64
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,451
Only in the summer,
when the sea ice melts,

65
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:27,451
will they regularly
catch prey for themselves.

66
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:37,453
They are not strong enough
to tackle adult seals,

67
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:41,453
but can certainly take
new-born pups or birds.

68
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:58,455
This canny individual
is going to bury its prize

69
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:02,455
it may need it during
the uncertain times ahead.

70
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:08,456
The presence of bears
affects the behaviour of almost

71
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:12,456
all the animals here.
Big and small.

72
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:16,456
The bears tend to avoid the fringe of
fragmented ice bordering open water

73
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:19,457
where travelling can
be very laborious.

74
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,457
But that very fact makes
this area - the pack ice

75
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,457
a particularly good place
for seals to pup.

76
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,458
Harp seals breed here.

77
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,459
Their pups are born with white
coats which camouflage them

78
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,459
very effectively against the snow.

79
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,460
Harp seals have a very
short nursing period

80
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,460
a necessity on this
unstable pack ice.

81
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:54,460
But suckling is intensive.

82
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:58,460
The pup feeds for just twelve days
on milk that is 45 percent fat.

83
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:04,461
Then it is abandoned
and has to fend for itself.

84
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:11,462
A male hooded seal.

85
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:17,462
This impressive nasal display is used
to warn away other males...

86
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:28,463
...and to win a mate
Hooded seals also breed on pack ice.

87
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:33,464
Their pups suckle for only four days

88
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:36,464
the shortest nursing period
known for any mammal

89
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:39,465
and all because the
threat of polar bears

90
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,465
caused them to breed
on the unstable ice.

91
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:01,467
Another Arctic seal opts
for the solid ice further north.

92
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,467
Because it's easy for
bears to hunt here,

93
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:09,468
these ringed seals must be particularly
vigilant and have to hide their pups.

94
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,469
Ringed seals are comparatively small,
so they can give birth

95
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,469
to their pups in little caves,
or lairs, under the snow.

96
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,469
Here, a pup is out of sight
and protected from bad weather.

97
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:35,470
In late March and into April,
female bears emerge from winter

98
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:39,471
dens with their new cubs.

99
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:43,471
The mother has not eaten for at least
five months and she's hungry - very hungry.

100
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,472
If she doesn't succeed in catching
a regular supply of seals,

101
00:12:56,473 --> 00:13:00,473
her milk will fail and
her cub will die.

102
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:09,474
Bears have an extraordinarily
sensitive sense of smell

103
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:13,474
and can detect seal pups hidden in
the snow from two kilometres away.

104
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:30,476
But a female ringed seal
uses several lairs

105
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,476
and a bear will almost certainly
have to break into a number

106
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:37,476
before it finds one
that is occupied.

107
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:47,477
This is a crucial time
for the cub.

108
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:51,478
By watching its mother hunt
and by copying her actions,

109
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:55,478
it's beginning to acquire the
rudiments of its own hunting skills.

110
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,479
Play is also important for developing
muscles and improving co-ordination.

111
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,482
As the days go by,
the sun rises higher

112
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:32,482
and remains above the
horizon even at night.

113
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,483
The female bear continues to hunt

114
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:45,483
until her cub is too tired
and can't keep up.

115
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,484
She has smelt something.

116
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:20,487
The pup escapes through a hole in
its lair that leads to the sea below.

117
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,489
Only one in twenty hunts
is successful.

118
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,490
But this mother must find a seal pup soon
if her cub is not to starve to death.

119
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:12,492
As spring turns into summer, the sun's
heat begins to melt the sea ice.

120
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:21,493
Now the ocean is accessible and
the Arctic's summer visitors return.

121
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:26,493
Migrating birds arrive
from the south to nest

122
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:30,494
and feed on the seafood
that's now within their reach.

123
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:34,494
Brunnich's guillemots are the
northern equivalent of penguins.

124
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,494
But they have retained
the power of flight,

125
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,495
for they need to
reach cliff ledges

126
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:43,495
where their nests will be safe
from predatory bears and foxes.

127
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:04,497
Nonetheless, they are as at home
in the water as in the air.

128
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:10,498
They dive down to a depth of fifty
metres or more to catch fish.

129
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,399
In June, the ice begins
to fracture.

130
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,399
The cracks - or leads.
Form useful corridors

131
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,400
of open water for
air-breathing animals.

132
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,400
Belugas, migrating to
their feeding grounds,

133
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:39,401
use these leads to penetrate
the ice-covered seas

134
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:42,401
and reach areas where
their preferred food,

135
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:46,401
Arctic cod, has spent the winter.

136
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:56,402
The males regularly dive to about
five hundred metres to find fish.

137
00:17:57,403 --> 00:18:01,403
The females and young, which have
smaller lungs, only go to about 350.

138
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:19,404
In late June and July,
narwhals arrive.

139
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:24,405
The females, who usually lack tusks,
come first with their new calves.

140
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:29,405
The males follow a little later.

141
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:45,407
They also move up the leads in
search of fresh feeding grounds.

142
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:01,409
Bowheads. Up to 18 metres long
and weighing a hundred tonnes,

143
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,409
these are the only large whales
that stay in the Arctic all year round.

144
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,411
They are not after fish
They are seeking smaller prey.

145
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:32,412
Despite having the largest mouths
in the animal kingdom,

146
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:36,412
the size of a small garage,
they eat tiny crustaceans

147
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:40,413
copepods - straining them from the
water with the four-metre long strips

148
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:45,413
of baleen that hang from
their upper jaws.

149
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:56,415
In the summer they store
enough energy to last them

150
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,415
through the following winter,
when food will be less abundant.

151
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:06,415
As the ice melts away, the polar
bears are forced to head for land.

152
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,416
They are excellent swimmers
and can cover a hundred miles

153
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:17,416
of continuous open water
if need be.

154
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,420
Off east Greenland,
there is little ice left by August,

155
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,421
so walruses haul out
to rest on land.

156
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:02,421
At this time of the year
they are moulting,

157
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:06,421
getting rid of their old scarred
and parasite-ridden skin.

158
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:20,423
A bathe in the cold water brings
some relief from the itching.

159
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:43,425
But even there,
the odd scratch is irresistible.

160
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:05,427
They make daily excursions
out to deeper water.

161
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:18,428
Down at 20 metres, they root
around in the sediment,

162
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,429
using their sensitive bristles
to search out soft-shelled clams.

163
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:46,431
Once they find a clam,
they suck its flesh from the shell

164
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:50,432
with their powerful,
muscular mouths.

165
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:56,432
Walruses can feed for about
five minutes at this depth

166
00:22:56,433 --> 00:23:00,433
before they have to return
to the surface to breathe.

167
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:11,434
Elsewhere in the Arctic, belugas are
gathering in their thousands.

168
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:16,434
They congregate in just
a few large estuaries.

169
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:20,435
Belugas of all ages
and sizes come here.

170
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:24,435
There are even young calves.

171
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:39,436
Some are so young - born only a week or
so ago - that they need help.

172
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:45,437
They swim on their mothers' backs so
that they can breathe more easily.

173
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,439
As the tide moves up the estuary,
the belugas follow,

174
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,439
swimming into surprisingly
shallow water.

175
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:14,440
Like walruses,
they also need to moult.

176
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:25,441
A combination of warm fresh water
and vigorous rubbing

177
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:29,441
against the gravel does the trick.

178
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,443
They remain here for days,
or even weeks,

179
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:47,443
so it's likely that socialising
is also important to them.

180
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:56,444
After moulting, they head back
out to sea to feed.

181
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:06,445
It's now autumn and the sea
begins to freeze over, once again.

182
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:16,446
Thin sheets of ice form at
the surface and pile up,

183
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:20,447
layer upon layer, gradually
creating an impenetrable barrier.

184
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:33,448
By late November, the Arctic Ocean
is sealed once again by ice.

185
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:53,450
The lights of the aurora play
in the winter sky.

186
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:07,451
At the other end of the planet.
In the Antarctic

187
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:11,452
there is the southern aurora

188
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:27,453
Antarctica is now emerging
from winter.

189
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,454
This is the coldest,
windiest place in the world.

190
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:35,454
Temperatures are still hovering
at a numbing minus 50

191
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:39,455
and the returning sun has
virtually no warmth.

192
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:43,455
Very few animals can survive
such extreme conditions.

193
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:48,455
But emperor penguins can.

194
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:57,456
Standing on the frozen sea, they endure
the full force of the Antarctic storms.

195
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:11,458
Only by huddling together can they can
survive the appalling winter months.

196
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,459
They take it in turns to bear
the brunt of the gales.

197
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,460
They can only live here at all because
Antarctica is surrounded

198
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:33,460
by the Great Southern Ocean and no land
predators have been able to reach it,

199
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:38,460
so unlike Arctic animals,
they're not threatened by polar bears.

200
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,461
The sea is still frozen.

201
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:48,461
But one seal, nonetheless,
manages to stay here,

202
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:53,462
even throughout the winter...

203
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:58,462
...the Weddell seal.

204
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:14,464
Underwater, it's protected
from the storms above.

205
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:18,464
But it must have access to the air
all year - in order to breathe.

206
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:34,466
And they keep their breathing holes open.
With their teeth.

207
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:48,467
Only by continually scraping away at the
ice can they maintain access to the air.

208
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:53,468
But that means that their teeth
get badly worn down.

209
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,468
Then they can no longer hunt
and eat effectively.

210
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,469
Weddell seals die young.

211
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:12,470
The continent of Antarctica
is so isolated

212
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:15,470
and so high - almost five
thousand metres in places

213
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:19,470
that it's considerably colder
than the Arctic.

214
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:26,471
Ice slides slowly down from its centre
towards its rim in immense glaciers.

215
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:34,472
During winter, the continent effectively
doubles in size as the sea freezes over.

216
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:39,473
Ice forms around its shores
and extends outwards

217
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:43,473
for hundreds of miles around
the entire land mass.

218
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:53,474
Under the sea-ice live small
shrimp-like creatures - krill.

219
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:58,474
They have been here all winter.

220
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:02,475
During these dark months, they feed by
scraping algae from the ice.

221
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,475
Remarkably, they also
shrink in size

222
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:12,476
and revert to their juvenile
form to save energy.

223
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:21,477
As the temperature
rises in spring,

224
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:25,477
the ice begins to melt and little air
bubbles trapped within it are released.

225
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:31,478
Microscopic algae grow around these
bubbles and the krill now graze on them,

226
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:36,478
gathering them up with
their beating legs.

227
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:55,480
As the sun's rays grow stronger
and penetrate deeper into the water,

228
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:00,481
floating algae begin to
flourish and krill leave

229
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:04,481
the dwindling ice and gather in swarms
as they harvest this new crop.

230
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:19,483
Far to the north, beyond the
blanket of sea ice,

231
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:23,483
chinstrap penguins have been
overwintering in the open ocean.

232
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:35,484
The occasional iceberg gives
them the chance of a rest

233
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:39,484
if they can get onto it.

234
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:10,488
But at this time of year, where they
really want to be is on land.

235
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:15,488
It's just getting there
that's tricky.

236
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:37,490
It's spring and the penguins
are returning to breed.

237
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:47,491
Their need to get ashore is now
urgent and imperative.

238
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:03,493
Doing so is all a matter of timing.
And picking the right wave.

239
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:55,498
But their journey has
only just begun.

240
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:59,498
Most of them will have to walk many miles
before they can find a nest site.

241
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:19,400
This is Zavodovski Island, which has the
largest penguin colony in the world.

242
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:24,401
About two million chinstraps
breed here

243
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:28,401
and they come to this island
for a good reason.

244
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:36,402
It's an active volcano.

245
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:39,402
The heat from the crater
and the fumeroles

246
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:41,403
keeps the slopes free from
the ice and snow,

247
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:45,403
allowing these chinstraps to start
breeding earlier than those further south.

248
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:54,404
But then again, living on an active
volcano is not without its risks.

249
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:02,405
Unlike the emperors, these penguins are
able to lay their eggs on the bare ground.

250
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:05,405
Little wonder so many
of them choose to brave

251
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:09,405
the mountainous waves
in order to get here.

252
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,406
Further south, near the continent,

253
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:21,407
the blanket of sea ice
is beginning to break up.

254
00:35:24,408 --> 00:35:28,407
Icebergs are gigantic fragments
of ice that have broken away

255
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:31,408
into the sea from the
front of glaciers.

256
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,408
During the winter they
were frozen into the sea ice,

257
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:38,408
but now they are set
adrift once more.

258
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:19,412
As the bergs break up,
they form brash ice.

259
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:24,413
It litters the backwaters
of the Antarctic Peninsula.

260
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:47,415
Minke whales make their way into
these placid waters in summer.

261
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:51,416
This is the most abundant whale
in the Southern Ocean.

262
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:06,417
Minkes are one of the smallest
of all the baleen whales.

263
00:37:06,418 --> 00:37:10,417
And like all others,
they come here to feed.

264
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,419
The majestic humpback whales
are also summer visitors.

265
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,421
They have travelled thousands of miles
from their winter

266
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,421
breeding grounds in the
tropics to gather the food

267
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:45,421
that becomes available
here in summer.

268
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:02,423
In just four months,
they accumulate enough fat

269
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:06,423
to provide them with energy for
the whole of the rest of the year.

270
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:29,425
All these animals have come here
in search of one thing - the krill.

271
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:35,426
Krill is the mainstay of
the Antarctic food web.

272
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:46,427
It occurs in phenomenal quantity

273
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:48,427
billions of individuals
in a single swarm,

274
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:52,428
and swarms can stretch for miles.

275
00:38:56,429 --> 00:39:00,428
Fur seals also collect this
rich superabundant food.

276
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,429
Krill swarms are very patchy,
but once found, feeding is easy.

277
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:37,432
Humpbacks engulf hundreds of thousands of
them in a single gargantuan mouthful.

278
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:54,434
When the going is good,
the whales feed continuously,

279
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:58,434
each eating up to two tonnes
of krill in twenty-four hours.

280
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:07,435
Further south, near the continent,
the sea ice is still sound.

281
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:10,436
Here, where the ice remains
for most of the summer,

282
00:40:10,437 --> 00:40:14,436
emperor penguins make their home.

283
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:17,436
These have been feeding out
at sea and are now ready

284
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:21,437
to make their way back to the
colony to feed their chicks.

285
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:26,437
Instead of heading straight
for the ice edge,

286
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:30,437
the penguins hesitate
some distance from it.

287
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:35,438
They're nervous.

288
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,439
They dive down and
investigate the ice edge.

289
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:06,441
And for good reason
Leopard seals patrol this border.

290
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:20,443
Leopard seals are the Antarctic's
equivalent of polar bears.

291
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,443
They are the top predators.

292
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:24,443
But they hunt most successfully
in the water,

293
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:28,443
so by and large, the animals they prey
on are safer out on the ice.

294
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:41,445
They have a lazy grace that belies
their ferocious nature.

295
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,446
Confident that the coast is clear,
the emperor penguins head for the ice.

296
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:06,447
But they certainly don't linger.

297
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:49,451
Now they have a long walk
back to the colony.

298
00:42:54,453 --> 00:42:58,452
Emperor penguin colonies are some
way back from the ice edge.

299
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:02,453
In winter they may be as much as
a hundred miles from it,

300
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,453
but as the summer progresses
and the ice melts,

301
00:43:05,454 --> 00:43:08,453
the edge comes ever
closer to the colony.

302
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:12,454
So by the time the chicks are fledged
and ready to take their first swim,

303
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:16,454
the water is close by.

304
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:25,455
This colony is in the lee
of a headland

305
00:43:25,456 --> 00:43:29,455
and that prevents the ice from
being broken up by ocean currents.

306
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:35,456
The returning adults are so full
of food that they can barely walk.

307
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:40,456
But with no predator to threaten
them now, they can take their time.

308
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:53,458
Somehow, in this melee of sixty
thousand or so penguins,

309
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:57,458
a parent has to find its chick.

310
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,459
It returns to the place where it last
left its chick in the hope that

311
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,460
it might still be close by.

312
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:18,460
But chicks tend to wander,
so the adult has to call to it.

313
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:37,462
The chick responds - and they slowly
home in on one another.

314
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:41,463
The plaintive entreaties
of the chick stimulates

315
00:44:41,464 --> 00:44:45,463
the adult to regurgitate
a mouthful of fish.

316
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:56,464
With the return of one parent,

317
00:44:56,465 --> 00:45:00,464
the other is free to go
to sea to feed for itself.

318
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,466
Aware of the leopard
seal's presence,

319
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,467
the penguins press
together at the ice edge,

320
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,467
unwilling to be the
first to risk diving in.

321
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:43,469
Occasionally, the seal comes out
onto the ice and attempts to grab one.

322
00:45:59,471 --> 00:46:03,471
But its most successful strategy
by far is to lie in wait.

323
00:46:11,473 --> 00:46:15,472
It hides behind a corner of ice.

324
00:46:17,473 --> 00:46:21,473
The emperors gain confidence
and make a dash for it.

325
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:36,474
The first wave of penguins escape.

326
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:41,475
Once in open water,
they will be safe.

327
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:49,475
But the seal is alerted by the noise,
and through the mass of bubbles,

328
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:53,476
it makes its attack.

329
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:05,477
Almost invariably,
it makes a kill.

330
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:14,478
Encouraged by the absence
of the seal,

331
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:18,478
the remaining penguins
make a break for the open sea.

332
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:39,480
In time, their chicks will fledge.

333
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,481
And when the Antarctic
autumn is near its end,

334
00:47:42,482 --> 00:47:46,481
these adults will walk across
the newly formed ice,

335
00:47:46,482 --> 00:47:50,481
to endure yet another winter
on the frozen sea
