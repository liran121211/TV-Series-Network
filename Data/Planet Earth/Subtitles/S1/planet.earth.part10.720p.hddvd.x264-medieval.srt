1
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:38,262
Trees.

2
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:44,055
Surely among the most magnificent
of all living things.

3
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:49,210
Some are the largest organisms on Earth

4
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:55,217
dwarfing all others,
and these are the tallest of them all.

5
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:13,495
The deciduous and coniferous woodlands
that grow in the seasonal parts of our planet

6
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:17,236
are the most extensive forests on Earth.

7
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:29,811
Their sheer extent stuns the imagination.

8
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,125
The barren snows of the Arctic.

9
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,082
A thousand miles from the North Pole,
and heading south.

10
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,955
This is the very first place
that trees can grow.

11
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,520
To begin with the conifers are sparse

12
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:06,003
but soon they dominate the land.

13
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:17,863
This is the Taiga Forest.

14
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:25,678
There are as many trees here,
as in all the world's rainforests combined.

15
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,263
The Taiga circles the globe
and contains a third of all the trees on Earth.

16
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:39,897
It produces so much oxygen, that it
refreshes the atmosphere of the entire planet.

17
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,496
At the Taiga's northern extent

18
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:51,407
the growing season can last
for just one month a year.

19
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,973
It can take fifty years for a tree
to get bigger than a seedling.

20
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,620
It's a silent world

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,190
where little stirs

22
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:23,037
But there are occasional signs of life.
Stories written in the snow.

23
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:30,062
The prints of an Arctic fox
and the hare it might've been stalking.

24
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:39,626
A female polar bear and her two cubs.

25
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:55,183
Some animals are so difficult to glimpse
that they're like spirits.

26
00:03:55,488 --> 00:04:01,433
One could live a lifetime in these woods
and never see a lynx.

27
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:08,640
The cat must roam hundreds of miles
in search of prey

28
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:12,792
and may never visit
the same patch of forest twice.

29
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:18,054
It's the very essence of wilderness.

30
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:29,413
With so few prey animals here,
life for a hunter is particularly hard.

31
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,225
Creatures are scarce
because few can eat conifer needles.

32
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,449
The moose is an exception.

33
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,611
Growth is so difficult

34
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:51,097
that conifers protect their precious leaves
by filling them with resin.

35
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:56,496
That reduces water loss,
but it also makes them very distasteful.

36
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:11,141
At least the conifer's seeds are edible

37
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:14,639
but they're protected within armor plated cones

38
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:18,334
and it takes a specialist to reach them.

39
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,850
The crossbill's extraordinary beak

40
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:28,720
can prise apart the scales,
so that it's tongue can extract the seeds.

41
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,814
Birds are fortunate.

42
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:38,088
When the seasonal crop is gathered,
they can fly south

43
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,668
But one animal is so expert at survival
in this frozen forest

44
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:52,381
that it stays here and is active
all year long.

45
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:59,681
In local folklore,
the wolverine is a link to the spirit world

46
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:02,646
and a cross between a bear and a wolf.

47
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:06,934
In reality,
it's a huge weasel.

48
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,795
It's bulk helps to conserve body heat
and also broadens it's menu.

49
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:19,437
It's so big and powerful,
it can even bring down an adult caribou.

50
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:26,416
For it's size, it's said that the animal can eat
more in one sitting than any other

51
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:30,339
which is why it's also known as the glutton.

52
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:52,175
Being gluttonous here
is a very effective strategy.

53
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:56,433
It's wise to eat all you can,
when you can

54
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,101
and when even a glutton can't eat more

55
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:06,697
it stores what's left for later,
in the surrounding deep freeze.

56
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,398
Spring in the ice forest.

57
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:32,287
The capercaillie can also digest conifer needles

58
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,105
but feeding is not it's priority at the moment.

59
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:43,114
Like gladiators,
the males square up for a battle.

60
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:59,355
Each may have just a single chance
to impress a female.

61
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:04,724
Neither can afford a lapse in concentration.

62
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:33,329
The injured loser may not survive.

63
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:40,918
The inhabitants of this great wilderness

64
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,526
may live and die
without ever having contact with humanity.

65
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:48,703
Long may it be that way.

66
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:02,116
The northern forest may be the largest on Earth

67
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:06,357
but to see coniferous trees
that have reached their full potential

68
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:10,554
you must travel a thousand miles south of here.

69
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,918
The Pacific Coast of North America.

70
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:31,418
The land of hemlock, douglas fir
and giant redwood.

71
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:42,671
Here, water is never locked up in ice

72
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,557
and even if rains fail

73
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:50,532
the needles can extract moisture
from the fogs that roll in from the sea.

74
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,481
The Sun's energy powers these forests

75
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:07,184
not for one month as it does in the Taiga
but for half the year.

76
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:20,551
These conifers grow at ten times the rate
of those near the Arctic

77
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:24,231
and they live for thousands of years.

78
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:37,097
One grove of redwoods in California

79
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,295
contains three of the tallest trees on Earth.

80
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:52,821
This one is over a hundred meters high,
the size of a thirty story building.

81
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:26,575
These forests were growing here
long before humans walked the Earth.

82
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:30,113
They were in their prime
twenty million years ago

83
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,138
and existed before the Swiss Alps
or the Rocky Mountains were even raised.

84
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:55,318
There is more living matter in a forest
of giant conifers, than in any tropical rainforest

85
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:59,206
but it's all contained within the trees.

86
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:02,995
These are as inedible as those in the Taiga

87
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:08,703
so animals are still scarce,
but they are present.

88
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:19,568
A pine marten. It's spring,
the best time of year for a marten to find food.

89
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:42,052
Bird's eggs are a seasonal snack
and for a short time, there's plenty of them

90
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:46,374
Sometimes perhaps, too many.

91
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:55,638
But to live here permanently,
the marten needs a more reliable food source.

92
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,759
Squirrels fit the bill.

93
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:03,900
They thrive here on the pine cones
and although these are also seasonal

94
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,822
they can be stored and eaten
throughout the year.

95
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,133
The squirrels are busy mating

96
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:24,714
Good news for the hunter.
A distracted squirrel, is a vulnerable squirrel.

97
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:34,862
But, this time, the amorous couple is safe.

98
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:40,487
There is a loner stocking his larder,
who will be the easier target.

99
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:20,850
Early summer,
and great grey owl chicks are fledging.

100
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,983
Adults can only raise young here

101
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:30,907
in years when the seasonal vole crop
is big enough to support them.

102
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:39,691
The moment has arrived for their first flight.

103
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:50,936
Leaping from the world's tallest trees
is not for the faint hearted.

104
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:22,062
If you're going to fall here
it's quite a good idea to do it in stages.

105
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:44,722
The ground is no place for an owl.

106
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:51,397
If he's to climb to the top of his class
he'll need to persevere

107
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,719
So now, let's have another go.

108
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:22,964
The American conifer forests
may not be the richest in animal life

109
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:26,406
but their trees are extraordinary.

110
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:33,520
This giant sequoia, a relative of the redwood,
is the largest living thing on Earth.

111
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:39,653
Known as General Sherman,
it's the weight of ten blue whales.

112
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:57,680
Higher up in the nearby mountains, bristlecone pines,
the oldest organisms on the planet.

113
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:03,105
Some have been here
for five thousand years.

114
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,193
They were alive before the pyramids were built

115
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,014
and were already three thousand years old
when Christ was born.

116
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:24,450
Across the Equator, in the southern hemisphere
there are forests that mirror those of the north.

117
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:26,515
Here in South America

118
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:31,961
araucaria trees or monkey puzzles
are like the conifers of the Taiga.

119
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,695
They have waterproof scales,
instead of needles

120
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:41,182
and their cones look a little different
but the principles are the same.

121
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:51,843
Slender billed parakeets
rather than crossbills, extract their seeds.

122
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:06,885
Where the growing season is longerm,
there are alerce trees the redwoods of the south.

123
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:28,377
As in the frozen north, the Valdivian forests
of Chile support very few animals

124
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:32,299
but that is the end of the similarity.

125
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:40,540
This is a bizarre world of miniature creatures.

126
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:50,221
The pudu, the world's smallest deer
feeds on the giant leaves of the gunnera plant.

127
00:18:57,293 --> 00:19:01,424
The female is just thirty centimeters high
at the shoulder

128
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:05,577
and her infants are hardly bigger than kittens.

129
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:28,859
The male must stay alert.
There are hunters here who would snatch his young.

130
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:34,367
Another miniature.
The kodkod cat.

131
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:44,547
It's the smallest cat in all the Americas
and a young pudu would be a feast for it

132
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:51,223
But, with the male on guard,
the kodkod must lower his sights.

133
00:19:56,273 --> 00:20:00,153
Moths are hatching.
They're the last of the summer.

134
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:04,640
The tiny cat
should be able to score with these.

135
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:10,357
No one knows why the creatures here are so small

136
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,905
but at least they can survive on meager rations.

137
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:45,262
You might call this
a game of cat and moth.

138
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:15,764
As winter approaches in Chile
spring is arriving in the northern hemisphere.

139
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:27,948
These are the deciduous forests of Homme.

140
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,726
Dormant throughout the winter,
they now undergo

141
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,691
one of the most magical transformations
in the natural world.

142
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:53,841
By late spring
the landscape is wrapped
in a vibrant fresh green.

143
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:58,494
Here, instead of conifers,
there are broad leaved trees

144
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:03,481
and that makes the character of this forest
entirely different.

145
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:12,389
Being broad, these leaves trap
much more light than needles

146
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,041
but they're also thin, soft and edible.

147
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:39,679
And others can eat
the leaf eaters.

148
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:09,012
It's spring in the great broad leaved forests
of Eastern Europe and Asiatic Russia.

149
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,038
The mandarin ducks are courting.

150
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:29,973
The female mandarin nests in a tree hole

151
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:35,432
and when it's time for everyone to leave
she leads the way.

152
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:42,051
The ducklings are only twenty four hours old.

153
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:48,572
It's a long drop,
and a few calls of encouragement are required.

154
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,314
Two down
seven to go.

155
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:41,855
There are still two missing.

156
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:06,194
All present and correct.

157
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,964
But they won't be safe
until they reach water

158
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,041
and the forest pool
is almost a mile away.

159
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:53,170
By June the days are at their longest

160
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:58,895
and all across the northern hemisphere
the broad leaves are hard at work.

161
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:13,461
On the east coast of North America
it seems like any other summer's evening

162
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:19,116
but tonight is special.

163
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:25,931
After seventeen years underground

164
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:29,002
creatures are stirring.

165
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:40,229
The nymphs of the periodical cicada
have been biding their time.

166
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:47,519
Now they march like zombies
towards the nearest tree, and start to climb.

167
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:58,090
At first, there are merely thousands

168
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:03,326
but soon, more than a billion
swarm all over the forest.

169
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:08,294
The biggest insect emergence
on the planet is underway.

170
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:44,792
They invade the upper branches,
where they climb out of their external skeletons

171
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:48,842
and assume their adult winged form.

172
00:27:57,097 --> 00:28:03,451
At first they're white and soft, but they have
until dawn to complete their transformation.

173
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:24,798
After an absence of seventeen years,
the forest is now overrun by cicadas.

174
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,697
The adults are clumsy
and very edible.

175
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:50,002
For turtles and other inhabitants of the forest

176
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:53,963
this is a feast they're lucky to see
once in their lifetime

177
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:57,279
and they gorge themselves while they can.

178
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,094
Times have never been so good.

179
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:19,586
The cicadas have no defenses
and virtually offer themselves to their attackers.

180
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,538
The stream of insects is so relentless

181
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:37,478
that soon all the predators are full
to the point of bursting

182
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:51,443
and still the cicadas come.

183
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:57,587
With the predators overwhelmed
the survivors can achieve their purpose.

184
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:05,843
After mating, the adults lay their eggs
and then their job is done.

185
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:11,639
In just a few days they will all die
and the forest will fall silent.

186
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:18,481
The cicadas here, will not be heard again
for another seventeen years.

187
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:34,976
Having fed the predators, the cicadas
leave one final gift for the forest itself.

188
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:41,294
The nutrients in a generation of cicadas
are returned to the soil, all at once

189
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,204
and the trees enjoy a marked spurt in growth.

190
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,208
This may be the single largest dose
of fertilizer in the natural world.

191
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:15,941
In the great
broad leaf forests of Eastern Europe

192
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,598
the days are beginning to shorten,
and a primeval sound heralds the onset of autumn.

193
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:46,922
Male red deer are starting their rut.

194
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:56,521
The air is heavy with the scent of females.

195
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,735
The rules are simple.

196
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:12,440
Winner takes all.

197
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:11,768
Across the northern hemisphere
the deciduous forests are changing.

198
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:18,018
Leaves that have provided food and shelter
since the spring, are now shed.

199
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:29,082
In the broad leaf forests of Russia
winter is particularly severe

200
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:38,683
but there will always be some
who benefit from hardship.

201
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:46,399
Black vultures scavenge from the carcass
of a seeker deer

202
00:33:46,486 --> 00:33:49,297
that has died of cold or starvation.

203
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,037
These endangered birds are visitors.

204
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:57,727
They've come down from the north to escape
the even colder conditions in Siberia.

205
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:37,261
An Amur leopard.

206
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:40,263
The rarest cat on Earth.

207
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,963
Winter is a difficult time for this hunter.

208
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:48,345
There are no leaves for cover
and no young prey animals.

209
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:54,436
This female has the added pressure,
of having to provide for her one year old cub.

210
00:34:54,733 --> 00:35:00,179
It'll be another twelve months,
before he'll be able to fend for himself.

211
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,655
The bickering vultures
have abandoned the carcass.

212
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,443
It's a valuable discovery for the leopards.

213
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:30,078
But the cub doesn't share
it's mother's sense of urgency.

214
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:03,198
The vultures have left behind
plenty of good meat

215
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,963
but it's stiff with frost.

216
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:14,203
The mother works to open the hide,
and make feeding a little easier for her cub.

217
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:30,302
There are only forty Amur leopards
left in the wild

218
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,413
and that number is still falling.

219
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:41,153
The harshness of the winter here
hinders their increasing numbers.

220
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:45,622
It takes one of these females
longer to raise her young to independence

221
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,470
than it does a leopard in Africa.

222
00:36:56,304 --> 00:37:00,549
If the mother can sustain her cub
for a few more weeks

223
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:06,400
spring will bring an increase in prey
and her task will lighten.

224
00:37:11,524 --> 00:37:15,057
For all the inhabitants of this seasonal forest

225
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,743
the long, cold wait is nearly over.

226
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:35,414
Spring in a deciduous woodland
is special.

227
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,393
With no leaves overhead, the rays of the sun
strike the forest floor directly

228
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:48,778
and their warmth rouses plants
from their winter sleep.

229
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:58,581
The ground living plants are in a hurry.

230
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,719
Before long the trees above
will come into leaf and steal their light.

231
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:16,438
Their flowers decorate the forest floor

232
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:21,730
as they advertise their sweet nectar
to the newly emerged insects.

233
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:43,331
The spring blooms of the deciduous woodlands
have no equivalent

234
00:38:43,441 --> 00:38:48,091
in either the great conifer forests,
or the tropical jungles.

235
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:57,071
Within a matter of weeks
the canopy has closed

236
00:38:57,072 --> 00:39:02,278
and only a few wheeling shafts of light
penetrate the woodland.

237
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:15,446
In the treetops, the broad leaves
rapidly expand to their full size

238
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:19,384
to make the most of summer
while it lasts.

239
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,066
Then, after a few months,
the days begin to shorten again

240
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:34,660
and the trees must shut down
and shed their leaves in preparation

241
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:38,053
for the cold dark time ahead.

242
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:48,192
Great tracts of North America flush red
as the season progresses.

243
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:53,791
The effect is so spectacular
and so extensive

244
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:56,960
that it can be seen from space.

245
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:18,243
The threat of winter frost is not
the only reason for trees to shed leaves.

246
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:25,502
These forests stand in the tropics.

247
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:28,547
Here day length never changes

248
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:31,061
but the dry season is so severe

249
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:34,315
that the trees can't afford to loose
the amount of water

250
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:40,053
that would evaporate from their broad leaves,
so the leaves must be shed.

251
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:02,479
The forest resembles a European woodland
in mid winter

252
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:08,399
but the heat is overpowering,
and it's inhabitants, unfamiliar.

253
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,161
For the creatures of India's teak forests,
these are desperate times

254
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:21,735
but salvation is at hand.

255
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:25,142
The mahwa tree is about to bloom.

256
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:33,801
It's flowers are full of liquid
making them irresistible.

257
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:45,977
The mahwa is an oasis
in a hot dry desert.

258
00:41:56,367 --> 00:42:02,106
Those that fly or climb
are not the only ones to get a share.

259
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:08,389
Chital deer follow the langur monkeys

260
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,810
collecting the flowers that fall.

261
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:23,693
The monkeys welcome the deer,
for deer are unrivaled at spotting predators.

262
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:29,279
If they are relaxed,
it must be safe to come down to the ground

263
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,987
and gather the food that lies there

264
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,502
but it's not wise to travel far
from the sentinels.

265
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:43,075
Tropical Madagascar.

266
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,700
The wet season.

267
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,285
It's now that the baobab trees
regrow their leaves

268
00:43:56,481 --> 00:44:02,541
and collect water to store in their huge trunks,
ready for the dry season ahead.

269
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,606
The prehistoric shape of these trees
is rightly famous

270
00:44:27,787 --> 00:44:31,544
but few have ever witnessed
the baobab's real magic

271
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:36,376
for that happens at night
and high in the treetops.

272
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:49,103
Flush with water, the baobab prepares itself
for an unforgettable display.

273
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:11,603
Once started the foot long flowers
can open fully in less than a minute.

274
00:45:56,357 --> 00:46:01,437
As the flowers open,
the creatures of the forest wake.

275
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,354
The mouse lemurs have been hibernating
throughout the dry season.

276
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:22,137
With the return of rains
it's time to get busy.

277
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:31,370
A dozen share this tree hole,
but there's plenty of room.

278
00:46:31,387 --> 00:46:36,344
The world's smallest primate
is no bigger than your hand.

279
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:47,672
High in the branches above,
the baobab's nectar is starting to flow.

280
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:04,935
A drink of this sugary energy packed liquid

281
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:09,612
is an ideal way for the lemurs
to start their day.

282
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:18,917
Liquid oozes from the flower's center
and trickles down the petals

283
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:38,937
But the nectar is not intended for lemurs.

284
00:47:42,498 --> 00:47:48,992
These giant hawk moths
are the drinkers the tree needs to attract.

285
00:47:58,172 --> 00:48:06,306
As they sip, moving from tree to tree,
so they transfer pollen and fertilize the flowers.

286
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:24,459
Nectar was an excellent first course
for the lemurs

287
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:27,881
but moths are the main dish.

288
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:31,966
The moths are very important to the lemurs

289
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:39,088
for they will replenish the fat reserves
that the lemurs need to survive the barren dry season.

290
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:50,415
The lemurs might seem to be a pest
for the baobab.

291
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:53,993
They kill it's pollinators
and rob it of it's nectar

292
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,908
but they do give something in return.

293
00:48:57,013 --> 00:49:02,528
For, as the wrestle with the moths,
their fur inevitably becomes dusted with pollen

294
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:06,630
so they, too, become pollinators.

295
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:35,554
As the alternation of wet and dry seasons
brings change to some tropical forests

296
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:42,115
so the progression of summer to winter
dictates life in more temperate regions.

297
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:54,596
Whether trees have needles or broad leaves

298
00:49:54,735 --> 00:50:00,705
it is their ability to survive annual change,
that has enabled them to cover

299
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,393
such vast areas of the Earth

300
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,837
and made the seasonal forests

301
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:11,615
the greatest forests of all.
