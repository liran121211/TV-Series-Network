1
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,850
A third of the land
on our planet is desert.

2
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,190
These great scars
on the face of the Earth

3
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,110
appear to be lifeless,

4
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,360
but surprisingly none are.

5
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,080
In all of them life manages somehow

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,920
to keep a precarious hold.

7
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,480
Not all deserts are hot.

8
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,490
Fifty-mile-an-hour winds
blowing in from Siberia

9
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,660
bring snow to the Gobi Desert
in Mongolia.

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,060
From a summer high
of 50 degrees centigrade

11
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,270
the temperature in midwinter
can drop to minus 40,

12
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,490
making this one
of the harshest deserts of all.

13
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,540
Few animals can survive
these extreme changes.

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,390
Wild Bactrian camels,

15
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,140
one of the rarest mammals
on the planet.

16
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,970
And perhaps the hardiest.

17
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,730
Their biggest problem
is the lack of water,

18
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,560
particularly now, in winter,

19
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,110
when the little there is
is locked up as ice.

20
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,330
Surprisingly, snow here never melts.

21
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,330
The air is just too cold
and too dry for it to do so.

22
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,260
The sun's rays turn it
straight into vapour.

23
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,390
It evaporates.

24
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,520
But it is the only source
of water,

25
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,650
so Bactrian camels eat it.

26
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,990
Elsewhere in the world

27
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,700
a camel at a waterhole can drink
as much as 200 litres during a single visit.

28
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,160
Here the strategy is to take little and often.

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,710
And with good reason,

30
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,590
for filling the stomach
with snow could be fatal.

31
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,180
The camels must limit themselves

32
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,260
to the equivalent
of just 10 litres a day.

33
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,780
Winter is the time
for breeding.

34
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,830
This extraordinary performance
is a male Bactrian camel's way

35
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,420
of attracting the attention
of a passing female.

36
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,010
In summer the camels can't stray
far from waterholes.

37
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,850
But now, with mouthfuls
of snow lying everywhere

38
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,350
they can travel widely
in search of mates.

39
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,650
Today less than a thousand of these desert
specialists remain in the wild.

40
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,280
The Gobi, hostile though it is,
is their last stronghold.

41
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,920
There's no other desert
quite like the Gobi,

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,170
but why is this place a desert?

43
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,720
There is one simple
and massive cause -

44
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,350
the Himalayas.

45
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,060
Clouds blowing from the south
hit this gigantic barrier.

46
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,610
As they're forced upwards

47
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,150
so they empty their moisture
on the mountain slopes,

48
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,070
leaving little for the land
on the other side.

49
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,960
From the space
deserts are very conspicuous.

50
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,300
Dunes of sand hundreds of miles long
streak their surface.

51
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,260
With no cloak of vegetation
to conceal them

52
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,060
strange formations are exposed
in the naked rock.

53
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,650
Africa's Sahara is
the largest desert of all.

54
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,110
It's the size
of the United States

55
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,330
and the biggest source of sand
and dust in the entire world.

56
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,660
Sandstorms like these
appear without warning

57
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,790
and reduce visibility for days
over areas the size of Britain.

58
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,510
Dromedaries, single-humped camels,
take these storms in their stride.

59
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,190
The heaviest sand rises only
a few metres above the ground,

60
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,740
but the dust can be blown
5,000 metres up into the sky.

61
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,700
The ferocious wind,
armed with grains of sand,

62
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,670
is the agent that shapes all deserts.

63
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:27,770
Reptiles have armoured scaly skins
that protect them from the stinging grains.

64
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,980
For insects the bombardment
can be very severe indeed.

65
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,030
The only escape
is below the surface.

66
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,260
As the winds rise and fall, swallow and eddy

67
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,930
so they pile the sand into dunes.

68
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,770
These sand scenes can be
hundreds of miles across.

69
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,940
In Namibia the winds have built
some of the biggest dunes in the world.

70
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,910
Star dunes like these
can be 300 metres high.

71
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,840
Grains, swept up the flanks,
are blown off the crests of the ridges

72
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,670
so it's only the tops
that are moving.

73
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,890
The main body of these dunes
may not have shifted for 5,000 years.

74
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,700
Few rocks can resist the continuous
blast of the sand carrying wind.

75
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,830
These outcrops are standing
in Egypt's White Desert.

76
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,170
But they will not do so
for much longer.

77
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,170
They're being inexorably
chiseled away

78
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,340
and turned into more sand.

79
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,970
Now lumps of heavily eroded rocks
have been marooned in a sea of sand.

80
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,620
These jagged pyramids
a hundred metres tall

81
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,370
were once part
of a continuous rocky plateau.

82
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,130
The blasting sand will eventually
eliminate them altogether.

83
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:58,930
The relentless power of the wind ensures
that the face of a desert is continually changing.

84
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,440
But there is one constant presence -

85
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,160
the desert sun.

86
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,380
The sun's heat and power
to evaporate water

87
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:36,680
has had a profound effect on the bodies
and habits of everything that lives here.

88
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,980
This sun potentially is a killer.

89
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,400
And the red kangaroos
must acknowledge that.

90
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,780
Right now, while the sun is low,

91
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,160
there's no immediate cause
for concern.

92
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,950
But this situation won't last long.

93
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:07,250
Australia is the world's most arid continent
with blistering daytime temperatures.

94
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,310
Every hour the temperature rises
by five degrees centigrade.

95
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,320
Soon the heat will reach
a critical point.

96
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,000
Any kangaroo out in the open
is in serious danger of overheating.

97
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,890
In the full sun the temperature
on the ground soars to 70 degrees.

98
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,900
By midday the radiation is
so intense they must take shelter.

99
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,880
In the shade they're shielded
from much of the sun's energy

100
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,970
but their body temperature
can still rise.

101
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,350
So they lick saliva
on to their forearms

102
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,520
where there is a network of blood vessels
close to the surface of the skin

103
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,320
and, as the saliva evaporates,
their blood is cooled.

104
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,740
This thermal image shows
just how effective the process is.

105
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,950
The blue areas on the body
are the cooler parts.

106
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,550
As the saliva dries
it has to be replaced

107
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,970
and this is a real drain
on the kangaroo's body fluids.

108
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,270
Even in the shade
the earth is baking hot

109
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,400
so the kangaroos dig away
the warmed topsoil

110
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,740
to get at the cooler ground beneath.

111
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,980
By staying in the shade and licking
to control their body temperature

112
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,310
kangaroos manage to get
through the hottest part of the day

113
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,060
without heat stroke.

114
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,570
But for the majority
of desert animals

115
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,160
this strategy would not be
enough for survival.

116
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,310
The extraordinary ears
of the fennec foxes of Africa radiate heat

117
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,900
but the animals have
another way of keeping cool.

118
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,910
They spend their days underground

119
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,080
and only emerge at sunset.

120
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,510
Darkness brings huge changes.

121
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:28,560
In the Sahara the temperature can drop
as much as 30 degrees during the night,

122
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,440
so it's cool enough to allow
these desert fox cubs to play.

123
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,700
All sorts of creatures now appear

124
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,070
including some really unexpected ones.

125
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,330
Toads have permeable skins

126
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,420
and would quickly die from desiccation
out in the daytime heat.

127
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,130
It's only now that
they can leave shelter.

128
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,090
The same is true for scorpions,

129
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,850
even though their shells
are actually watertight.

130
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,900
In fact, most small desert
creatures are nocturnal.

131
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,240
so it's only now
that you can judge

132
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,620
just how much life
there can be in the desert.

133
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,330
But moisture, lost even at night,
has to be replaced sometime somehow

134
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,130
and that problem dominates
the lives of all desert dwellers.

135
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,680
The Atacama in Chile.

136
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,310
This is the driest desert
in the world.

137
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,980
Some parts may not see rain
for fifty years

138
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,440
and with such a record

139
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,360
you'd expect the place
to be completely barren.

140
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,700
These are South America's camels,
guanacos.

141
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,500
They're very good
at conserving moisture

142
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,000
but they nonetheless
need a regular supply of water.

143
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,310
They get it partly
from cactus flowers

144
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,060
but that explanation
raises another question.

145
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,900
How do the cacti
survive without rain?

146
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,040
Hot winds suck all the moisture
from the surface of the land.

147
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,550
Clearly there must be something else
that takes the place of rain.

148
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,890
The secret is a cold sea current
that runs parallel to the land.

149
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,280
The cold water cools
the moist warm air above it

150
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,450
and that produces banks of fog.

151
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,860
At the same time wind blowing
on to the shore sweeps the fog inland.

152
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,500
Before long the cacti
are dripping with dew.

153
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,010
The fog is so regular

154
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,730
that moisture loving lichens
are able to grow on the cacti

155
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,190
and they absorb liquid
like a sponge.

156
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,400
In the land of almost no rain

157
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,320
these precious drops are life-savers
for many different creatures.

158
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,880
Further inland the air remains so warm
that its moisture does not condense

159
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,630
so this slender strip of desert
is virtually the only part of the Atacama

160
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,800
where life can exist.

161
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,890
Without the fog,

162
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,850
this land, too, would be empty.

163
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,790
The guanacos make
the most of the dew

164
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,750
but it will not remain
for long.

165
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,380
In an hour or two
the sun will have burnt it off

166
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,090
and dry the surface of the cacti.

167
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,480
The Sonoran desert in Arizona
is not quite so dry as the Atacama -

168
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,810
some rain does fall.

169
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,360
But it is infrequent

170
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,940
and when it does arrive

171
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,910
animals and plants have
to be ready to make the most of it.

172
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,120
And it's coming.

173
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,960
When the summer monsoon blows in

174
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,630
the giant saguaros,
one of the biggest of all cacti,

175
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,470
are ready to take
full advantage of it.

176
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:19,380
After a rainstorm the saguaro's long shallow
root system sucks up the water

177
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,560
and the pleats on its trunk
enable it to expand rapidly.

178
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,900
When full, a saguaro stem can store
up to five tonnes of water

179
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,530
and that's enough to see it
through many months of drought.

180
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,460
The trunks of these huge plants
provide homes for the gila woodpecker.

181
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:01,180
But birds are not the only animals
to benefit from the presence of the cacti.

182
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,490
During four weeks of the summer

183
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:25,280
the saguaros bloom at night
to attract visitors.

184
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,580
The pollen and nectar
with which these flowers are loaded

185
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,000
attract long-nosed and long-tongued bats.

186
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,400
The bats left Mexico a few days earlier
to escape the heat of summer

187
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,780
and are on their way north
to the southern United States.

188
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,740
To get there, they have
to cross the Sonoran desert.

189
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,670
But the desert is so big

190
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,420
that for most of the year
they would be unable to cross it.

191
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,920
Now, with the saguaro in bloom,

192
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,840
they can refuel on the way.

193
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,690
So the saguaro's success
in developing a way to store water

194
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:45,610
is now crucial to most of the animals
that live or even travel through this land.

195
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,110
The scarcity of rain determined
the shape of this icon of the desert

196
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,280
but water, scarce thought it is,

197
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,580
has also, like the wind,
shaped the land itself.

198
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,640
In the deserts of Utah

199
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,480
ancient rivers flowing across sandstone country
steadily widen their canyons

200
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,030
until now the land between them
has been reduced to spires and pinnacles.

201
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,900
With little or no soil to retain
the water on the surface of the land

202
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,150
life here is scarce indeed.

203
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,820
And when resources are limited,

204
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,530
conflict is never far away.

205
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,880
These are Nubian ibex

206
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,800
and they are squaring up
for a duel.

207
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,510
And when trouble starts,

208
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,140
a smart ibex knows that the best thing
to do is to gain higher ground.

209
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,790
These are actually
subordinate male ibex,

210
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,420
but their fights
are nonetheless serious.

211
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,760
Losing one might mean
never getting the chance to breed ever.

212
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,660
When competitors are evenly
matched as they are here,

213
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,780
duels can last for an hour.

214
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,930
In this heat the effort
is trully exhausting.

215
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:51,280
But victory here will gain important
ranking points on a male's way to the top.

216
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,220
There's so much at stake

217
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,640
that not all play fair.

218
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,330
The battle has produced the winner,

219
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,500
but the ultimate prize
is not his yet.

220
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,260
That currently belongs
to the dominant male ibex.

221
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,510
His rank earns him the loyalty
of a harem of females

222
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,270
and they follow him closely
as he travels across this desert

223
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,560
searching for foof and water.

224
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,820
He doesn't have to waste time
looking for mates -

225
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,530
they're his for the taking,

226
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,530
so he can concentrate with them
on keeping fit and healthy.

227
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,970
Lizards are desert specialists.

228
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,890
But here, their numbers
are extraordinary.

229
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:57,570
These crevices in South Africa contain
the highest density of lizards in the world.

230
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,080
They're called flat lizards
for obvious reasons,

231
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:16,210
and they flaunt their multi-coloured
bellies in territorial disputes.

232
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,170
He's made his point,

233
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,220
and now it's time
to find some food.

234
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,600
As the day warms up,

235
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,970
the lizards move away
from their cracks

236
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,770
and head down
to the bottom of the gorge.

237
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,230
Their goal is the river.

238
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,070
There is no food at the edge,

239
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,910
but this desert river
holds a secret.

240
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,960
Each day blackfly rise
from turbulent stretches of the river.

241
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,920
This is what the lizards
have come for.

242
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,190
The black fly never land,

243
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,980
so the lizards have to leap
for their food.

244
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,670
In one day each of these acrobatic
little lizards may catch 50 flies.

245
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,180
There are plenty of flies
to go round,

246
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,770
even with hundreds of lizards
competing for them.

247
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,910
Away from these rapids flat lizard populations
are found much smaller numbers.

248
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,040
But here one unusual abundance
has produced another.

249
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,100
Deserts are created by the lack of water,

250
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,520
but what actually kills animals
here is not heat or thirst,

251
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,610
but lack of food.

252
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,170
So how on earth does
a plant-eater this size

253
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,090
survive in a place apparently
totally devoid of vegetation?

254
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,480
Elephants in Namibia
are the toughest in Africa.

255
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
And they need to be.

256
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,920
What little food exists
is so dispersed

257
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,090
that these elephants walk
up to 50 miles a day

258
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,970
as they travel up the dry river channels
searching for something to eat.

259
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,900
At times the task
looks truly helpless.

260
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:48,400
Elephants may seem out of place
in this landscape,

261
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,200
but they're not the only ones.

262
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,380
Amazingly, lions live here, too.

263
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,020
In savanah country huge herds
of games support prides

264
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,730
containing 20 lions or more.

265
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,730
But to live here
lions have had to change their habits -

266
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,570
prides are much smaller

267
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,740
and their home ranges
are very much bigger.

268
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,200
And there's an added problem -

269
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,120
their food is always on the move.

270
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,170
Like the elephants,

271
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,260
the lions must travel great distances
to find enough to live on.

272
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,280
But lions can't go everywhere -

273
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,740
they won't attempt to cross
this field of sand dunes

274
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,780
and the oryx know it.

275
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,810
The lions must wait for the oryx
to leave the safety of the dunes,

276
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,890
which eventually they must
to find food and water.

277
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,480
And then the lions
will ambush them.

278
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,670
The elephants have found
some of their favourite food.

279
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,310
Grasses are the staple diet
of all elephants,

280
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,810
but this herd concentrates
on digging up the roots,

281
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,070
which have more nutrition
and moisture than the stems.

282
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,610
It's the sort of behaviour

283
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,950
that can make all the difference
in a place of serious shortages.

284
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,450
Yet all this can change
in an instant.

285
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,390
The fortunes of many deserts
are ruled by distant rains.

286
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:34,900
This water fell as rain
in mountains more than a hundred miles away.

287
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,280
It's known as a flash flood

288
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,740
and called that because the water
may run for just a single day.

289
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,580
It's an event that only happens
once or twice a year at the most.

290
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:16,810
The sandy riverbed acts like
a giant strip of blotting paper

291
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,230
sucking up the water
as soon as it appears.

292
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,200
But every square metre of soil
moistened by this river

293
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,830
will increase the chances
of survival for those that live here.

294
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,840
Waterholes are filled
temprorarily.

295
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,020
Elsewhere in Africa
elephants drink every day,

296
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,690
but the lack of water here

297
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:03,530
means that desert elephants can only
refill their tanks once every four or five days.

298
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,950
Within a week the flash flood
has produced a flush of green,

299
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,370
more than enough to draw
the oryx out of the dunes.

300
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,330
It's a rare chance for them
to build up their food reserves.

301
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:32,510
The flood has made life easier
for the lions, too.

302
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,980
The flesh of this oryx will keep
the family going for a week at the most.

303
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,560
But for a while
the hunting will be easier,

304
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,820
now that river channel
has turned green.

305
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,620
The good times
for lions and oryx are brief,

306
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,790
but these are the short moments

307
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,040
that make it possible to live
in deserts the year round.

308
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,880
Death Valley is the hottest
place on Earth.

309
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,260
Yet even this furnace
can be transformed by water.

310
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:27,900
A single shower can enable seeds
that have lain dormant for 30 years or more

311
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,150
to burst into life.

312
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,960
And there hasn't been a bloom
like this one for a century.

313
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,850
The periods of boom
in Death Valley are short.

314
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,230
but they're just frequent enough
to keep life ticking over.

315
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,410
A sudden flush of vegetation is
what every desert dweller waits for,

316
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,830
and when it happens
they must make the most of it.

317
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,640
There is no other species
on the planet

318
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:49,730
that responds as quickly and as dramatically
to the good times as the desert locust.

319
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:55,200
Eggs that have remained in the ground
for 20 years begin to hatch.

320
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,960
The young locusts
are known as hoppers,

321
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,420
for at this stage
they're flightless.

322
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:19,260
They find new feeding grounds
by following the smell of sprouting grass.

323
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,060
Normally it takes four weeks
for hoppers to become adults,

324
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,690
but when the conditions
are right as now

325
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,570
their development switches
to the fast track.

326
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:43,790
As the vegetation in one place
begins to run out

327
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,460
the winged adults release pheromones -
scent messages,

328
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,130
which tell others in the group
that they must move on.

329
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,680
And when groups merge,

330
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:07,060
they form a swarm.

331
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,800
An adult locust eats
its entire body weight every day,

332
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,470
and a whole swarm can consume
literally hundreds of tonnes of vegetation.

333
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,310
They have to keep on moving.

334
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,980
The swarm travels
with the wind -

335
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,480
it's the most energy-saving
way of flying.

336
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,610
Following the flow of wind means that they're
always heading toward areas of low pressure,

337
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:05,120
places where wind meets rain
and vegetation starts to grow.

338
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,040
As they fly,

339
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,830
swarms join up with other swarms

340
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,920
to form gigant­­­ic plagues
several billions strong

341
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,590
and as much as 40 miles wide.

342
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:24,220
They will consume every edible thing
that lies in their path.

343
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,740
This is one of planet Earth's
greatest spectacles.

344
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,820
It's rarely seen on this scale

345
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,990
and it won't last long.

346
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,790
Once the food is gone,

347
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:53,830
the steady roar of a billion beating
locust wings will once again be replaced

348
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,630
by nothing more
than the sound of the desert wind.
