1
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:39,692
Our planet's continents are fringed
by shallow seas.

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,033
Rarely more than two hundred meters deep
they lie on the continental shelves

3
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:49,300
which may stretch sometimes
for hundreds of miles

4
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:54,092
before the sea floor drops into
deeper darker waters.

5
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:04,523
All together they constitute
a mere eight percent of the world's oceans

6
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:09,847
but they contain the vast majority
of it's marine life.

7
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:49,740
A male humpback whale sings to attract a mate.

8
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:14,999
The whales have just returned
to their breeding grounds

9
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:18,462
in the shallow seas of the tropics.

10
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:29,623
The calf is no more than a few weeks old.

11
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:39,207
Despite being three meters long
and weighing nearly a ton

12
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:42,720
he is nonetheless vulnerable.

13
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,234
but his mother watches over him

14
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,567
and, as he begins to tire,
she supports him close to the surface

15
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,441
so that he can breathe more easily.

16
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:25,323
These shallows around the equator
are excellent nurseries.

17
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:30,739
They're warm, calm, and contain
very few predators.

18
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,435
The playful calf is now drinking
five hundred liters of milk a day

19
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,242
but his mother must starve.

20
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:45,328
There is nothing for her to eat here.

21
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,077
Like many tropical shallow seas

22
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:58,508
these crystal clear waters
are virtually lifeless.

23
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,035
They receive year round sunlight

24
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:05,089
but they lack the nutrients
essential for the growth of plankton.

25
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,011
The mother will be trapped here
for the next five months

26
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:16,214
until her calf is strong enough to make
the journey to the feeding grounds, near the poles.

27
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:43,852
Coral reefs are oases in a watery desert.

28
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,791
Most tropical shallows are barren

29
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:54,322
but these coral havens contain one quarter
of all the marine life on our planet.

30
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:16,002
Reefs are the work of polyps

31
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:20,039
tiny colonial animals like minute sea anemones

32
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:26,768
yet the great barrier reef is so big
it can be seen from the Moon.

33
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,926
It's actually two thousand separate reefs

34
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:40,652
that together form a barrier
stretching for over a thousand miles

35
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,819
along Australia's northeastern coast.

36
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,546
Despite it's vast size

37
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:55,077
this reef does not contain the greatest variety
of marine life on the planet.

38
00:05:56,571 --> 00:06:01,034
For that one must travel north to Indonesia.

39
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,286
There are individual reefs in Indonesia
that contain almost as many kinds of fish

40
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,354
as live in the whole of the Caribbean.

41
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:43,279
There are also ten times the number
of coral species.

42
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:51,698
Corals thrive in these waters
with the help of microscopic plants, algae

43
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:55,490
that grow within the tissues of the polyps

44
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,764
and the polyps feed by snaring passing
morsels with their tentacles.

45
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:25,342
At night, the algae are inactive but then,
the polyps put out even more tentacles

46
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:29,510
so coral in effect feeds around the clock.

47
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:53,422
This well balanced alliance
brings benefits to both polyps and algae

48
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:59,151
and between them, they turn the barren seas
into rich gardens.

49
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,281
The Indonesian reefs
contain such a variety of life

50
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,498
because they lie at a giant crossroads.

51
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:23,161
This is the meeting place for different seas
the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.

52
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:29,397
Here everything demands a closer look.

53
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:35,010
On the surface of this sea fan,
there are two polyps that are not polyps.

54
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:42,280
They're pygmy sea horses, the world's smallest,
less than two centimeters high.

55
00:08:54,786 --> 00:09:01,154
They are males, settling a territorial dispute,
by head butting.

56
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,166
An electric flash?

57
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,565
No, the display of a file clam.

58
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,641
Perhaps this extraordinary pulsation
of the clam's fleshy mantle

59
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:33,304
is a warning to frighten away nibbling fish,
but no one really knows

60
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:52,178
And there are snakes here, too,
lots of them.

61
00:09:57,675 --> 00:10:03,353
These are banded sea crates.
They lay their eggs on land

62
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:07,013
but they hunt here in the water.

63
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,136
They're too slow to catch fish
in a straight chase

64
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:20,011
so they seek prey that is hiding
in the nooks and crannies of the coral.

65
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:27,068
Their bite is highly venomous
and paralyzes their victims.

66
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:37,014
And on this reef
the snakes do not hunt alone.

67
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:47,845
Shoals of yellow goatfish and trivali
are seeking similar prey

68
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:53,885
And they attract the snakes' attention.
As one group of hunters searches the reef

69
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:56,839
they're joined by the other.

70
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:09,280
At least thirty snakes
have now joined the caravan.

71
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:21,490
The big fish scare the prey into cracks
and there the snakes can catch them

72
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:28,071
And anything fleeing from the crates will swim
straight into the mouths of the waiting trivali.

73
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:31,453
There's nowhere to hide.

74
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,056
As the raiders scour the reef,
more and more snakes join the hunt.

75
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:10,332
This cooperation between snakes and fish,
spectacular though it is,

76
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:17,569
has only recently been observed, for it only happens
on the most remote reefs in Indonesia.

77
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:30,385
Perhaps such hunting alliances
were once a common sight

78
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:36,803
but today no more than six percent
of Indonesia's reefs are in their pristine state.

79
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:09,739
Beyond the coral
stretches a world of shifting sand.

80
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:14,466
Out there with nowhere to hide
survival is not easy

81
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,617
and camouflage can be crucial.

82
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:27,119
If this wasn't moving, you might think
it was a shell or a rock. In fact it's an octopus.

83
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:33,766
A gurnard.
It's huge pectoral fins disguise it's shape

84
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:38,804
and they can also help in clearing away sand
when searching for food.

85
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,694
The jawfish hides underground.

86
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:52,914
The wonderpus octopus on the other hand
has such a powerful bite

87
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:57,804
that it has a special warning display
to tell others to keep out of it's way.

88
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:13,478
Here and there,
plants manage to take root

89
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:17,123
and they're cropped by green turtles.

90
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:22,544
Seagrasses are the only flowering plants
that have managed to grow in the sea

91
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,472
although they put out a few ribbon like leaves

92
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:29,989
they produce very extended networks
of fleshy stems, risomes,

93
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,667
that are buried in the sand.

94
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,789
At their lushest
they can transform the sea bed

95
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,350
into an underwater meadow.

96
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:52,690
The largest expanse grows in the shallow waters
of Shark Bay, in Western Australia.

97
00:14:55,158 --> 00:15:00,856
These vast aquatic grasslands
stretch for fifteen hundred square miles

98
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:06,317
and, like terrestrial prairies,
they support herds of grazers.

99
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:08,614
Dugongs.

100
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:25,446
Dugongs are the largest herbivores in the sea.

101
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,729
They can be three meters long
and weigh half a ton

102
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,168
and they eat nothing but seagrass,
mostly the fleshy risomes,

103
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,647
which they excavate with their mobile lips.

104
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,445
A herd can clear a patch of seagrass
the size of a football pitch

105
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,493
in a single day.

106
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:27,353
Food is not evenly distributed
in the tropical shallow seas

107
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:29,466
and it can take a lot of finding

108
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:35,938
but bottlenose dolphins are inquisitive,
energetic,1 and very intelligent

109
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:39,824
and they have discovered a shoal of baitfish.

110
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:52,336
Together, they ride a wave,
using it to carry them into the shallows

111
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:56,629
and there, it will be easier to make the catch.

112
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,407
In Western Australia

113
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:29,805
these dolphins have taken on
an ever tougher challenge.

114
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:33,771
The fish have taken refuge close to the beach

115
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:37,368
where the water is only a few centimeters deep.

116
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,532
Tail slapping is a method dolphins often use
to stun their prey

117
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,433
but it doesn't seem to work here.

118
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,365
The fish are tantalizingly close

119
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:08,733
but they're still out of reach,
so the dolphins try another technique.

120
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:17,517
Vigorously pumping their tails,
they work up some speed

121
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,183
and then, they hydroplane.

122
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,159
Their momentum carries them right through
the shallowest waters, and onto the fish.

123
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,483
Now they're in real danger of being stranded

124
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:12,647
but fortune favors the brave.

125
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:24,360
Younger dolphins lie alongside, watching

126
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,773
but so far only eight individuals here

127
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:30,886
have mastered this daring technique.

128
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:27,261
Although most life in tropical waters
is concentrated around the coral reefs

129
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,073
and the seagrass meadows,

130
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:32,749
there are some spectacular exceptions.

131
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,109
The desert of Bahrain
seems a very unlikely place

132
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:46,943
to find a crowded bustling colony of seabirds

133
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,981
But every year, a hundred thousand
socotra cormorants gather here to breed.

134
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:02,462
It's swelteringly hot

135
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:07,766
and only vigorous panting can prevent the birds
from fatal overheating.

136
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:12,151
This hardly seems a good place to rear young

137
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,967
but at least, there are no
land based predators here.

138
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:21,972
The only source of trouble
is likely to be the neighbors

139
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:26,739
so each nest is built
just beyond pecking reach

140
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,450
But what about food?

141
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:49,216
There's only bare sand
and the warm shallow sea beyond.

142
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:55,571
Neither seem likely to produce enough
nourishment to support bird life on this scale.

143
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:03,394
The answer is blowing in the wind.

144
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:09,421
Sand whipped up by Shamals offshore winds

145
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,835
blows into the seas of the Arabian Gulf.

146
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:17,064
With the grains come nutrients,
which act as fertilizer

147
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,738
and they transform the shallow sea
into a rich fishing ground

148
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:33,436
So, paradoxically, it's the roasted
sands of Arabia that prevent the gulf

149
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:37,112
from being another desert in the sea.

150
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:53,630
The whale calf is now five months old.

151
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:55,886
He's almost doubled in size

152
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:59,995
and his days in his tropical nursery
are coming to an end.

153
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:03,843
It has been a warm and safe place
in which to grow up

154
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:07,426
but there's nothing to eat here
for his mother.

155
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:13,794
She has been living off her fat reserves
for the last eight months

156
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:16,367
and she's close to starving.

157
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,847
She must leave now,
while she still has enough energy

158
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:25,191
to guide and protect her calf,
on the long voyage ahead.

159
00:23:42,702 --> 00:23:47,692
All across the tropics,
humpbacks are heading away from the Equator

160
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:54,139
towards the rich temperate seas of both
the southern and the northern hemispheres.

161
00:23:57,106 --> 00:24:02,410
These are colder, rougher,
and more dangerous waters.

162
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:17,694
Mother and calf must stay close.

163
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:41,038
They can send sound signals to one another,
above the roar of the ocean

164
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,452
by slapping fins on the surface.

165
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:11,449
In winter, the temperate seas
are lashed by violent storms.

166
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,684
The turbulence stirs the water,
and draws nutrients up from the depths

167
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:47,778
but nutrients alone can not support life.

168
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:51,112
There must also be sunlight.

169
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:58,490
In the spring, as the sun
daily climbs higher in the sky

170
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,011
the algae start to grow.

171
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:07,576
Blooms the size of the Amazon Rainforest
turn the seas green.

172
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:13,340
Individually the algae are tiny

173
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,049
but together, they produce three quarters
of all the oxygen in our atmosphere.

174
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:27,664
They're eaten
by an array of bewildering creatures.

175
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,051
Salps appear in the plankton soup.

176
00:26:36,816 --> 00:26:43,485
Individuals link together to form chains
which can stretch for fifteen meters.

177
00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:00,132
Pumping water through their bodies
they strain out algae and other edible particles.

178
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:14,089
Comb jellies cruise through the water.

179
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:17,647
They too flourish in this seasonal soup

180
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:22,348
and for short periods, they appear
in astounding numbers.

181
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:25,748
Krill, shrimp like creatures.

182
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,333
By weight they're the most
abundant animals on the planet.

183
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,744
A single swarm can contain
two million tons of them

184
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:46,310
and that is a lot of fish food.

185
00:27:55,828 --> 00:28:01,107
The shallow temperate seas support
the greatest concentrations of fish on our planet.

186
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:05,716
Huge shoals migrate from their
overwintering grounds in the depths

187
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,802
to feed in these rich waters.

188
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:23,690
It's these shoals that support most
of the world's sea mammals.

189
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:29,821
Sea lions have all the agility and speed needed
to collect what they want

190
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,655
and seemingly delight in doing so.

191
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:12,963
Dusky dolphin,
often in pods two hundred strong

192
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,563
work together to reap the harvest.

193
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:24,530
They break up the shoals into smaller,
more manageable balls, and all the hunters benefit.

194
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:56,838
By midsummer, the surface nutrients
have all been absorbed.

195
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:01,853
The algae die
and the food chain collapses.

196
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,877
In a few special places, however

197
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:14,128
the temperate seas sustain these levels of life
throughout the summer.

198
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:19,298
Along the coast of California,
ocean currents carry a constant supply

199
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:23,104
of nutrients up from the depths
to the surface layers.

200
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:30,653
These upwellings fertilize forests of giant kelp,
that thrive in the summer sunshine.

201
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:41,978
The algal towers are
as high as a three story house

202
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:45,867
and they can grow by half a meter a day.

203
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:05,314
Life in the kelp is as full of drama,
as in any other forest

204
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:08,613
but the cast is less familiar.

205
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,421
An army of sea urchins is mounting an attack.

206
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:22,972
The urchin plague strikes at the kelp's holdfasts
their crucial attachments to the rock.

207
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:44,899
Holdfasts are extremely tough, but each
urchin has five teeth, which are self sharpening

208
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,737
and are replaced every few months.

209
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,865
Urchins fell vast areas of kelp forest

210
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:03,820
creating clearings know as urchin barrens

211
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:10,681
yet barrens is a poor description.

212
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:18,788
Millions of invertebrates invade the seabed.

213
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,283
The most fearsome predator here is a giant.

214
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:45,029
The sunflower starfish is a meter across,
with an appetite for brittle stars.

215
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:06,907
It uses it's feet to taste for prey.

216
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:18,279
When it's actions are speeded up, it becomes clear
that the predator's fondness for the brittle stars

217
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,811
is almost matched by the brittle stars
ability to get out of the way.

218
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:41,715
Sand dollars flat sea urchins
cluster together as a defense

219
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:52,005
But it doesn't seem to work
against the sunflower starfish.

220
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:59,390
The predator extrudes it's stomach, and wraps it
around it's victims liquefying their soft parts.

221
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,511
Nothing is left of them,
except their white skeletons.

222
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:16,212
The Californian upwellings are seasonal
and relatively small

223
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:19,313
but in Southern Africa they're so big

224
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:25,517
they create seas rich enough to support
colonies of over a million seals.

225
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:35,511
The Benguela Current sweeps along
the western coastline of Southern Africa

226
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:39,730
driving nutrient rich waters up to the surface

227
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:48,279
and then, at the southern tip of Africa it meets
the Agulhas Current, arriving from the east.

228
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:52,201
The result: even richer waters.

229
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:09,515
The seals here
thrive on a diet of fish and squid.

230
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:16,523
In temperate seas there may actually
be more squid than fish.

231
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:28,126
These are chokker squid,
and they lay their egg capsules

232
00:35:28,224 --> 00:35:33,525
in sandy shallows bathed by the warmer
Agulhas Current.

233
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:46,507
Each capsule contains a hundred tiny squid.

234
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:54,648
Within a few days
they develop spots of pigment

235
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:59,357
which, when they're adult, they will use
to communicate with one another.

236
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,030
With females continuing to lay eggs

237
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:22,136
and males still preoccupied with repelling rivals,
the squid drop their guard.

238
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,404
Stingray.

239
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:39,647
Short tailed stingray
can be up to two meters across.

240
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:51,167
They're the largest of all the stingrays,
and they have appetites to match.

241
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:23,466
Another predator is on the prowl.

242
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:29,357
The aptly named ragged tooth shark.

243
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:40,040
Raggies grow to three meters long, but they share
these waters with a shark twice their size.

244
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,111
The great white.

245
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:05,378
The largest predatory fish on the planet.

246
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:17,195
Each dawn cape fur seals leave their colony
to go fishing.

247
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:22,626
To reach the open sea,
they must cross a narrow strip of water

248
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:27,698
and that is patrolled by great whites.

249
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:40,875
Each seal is indeed swimming for it's life.

250
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:07,479
The shark relies on surprise.

251
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:13,781
The great white's turn of speed
is powered by a high metabolism.

252
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:17,130
They only thrive in cold temperate seas

253
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:23,892
for only these waters contain sufficient food
necessary to fuel such a ravenous predator.

254
00:40:56,617 --> 00:41:00,507
As you travel towards the poles
north or south

255
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,448
the colder, stormier seas
can become even richer.

256
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:10,831
Midway between South Africa
and the South Pole

257
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:14,901
lies the isolated island of Marion.

258
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:24,698
The island sits in the infamous
"roaring forties"

259
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:29,719
where incessant gale force winds
draw nutrients up from the depths

260
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,510
ensuring plenty of food for king penguins.

261
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:41,864
The kings are returning from a three day
fishing trip, with food for their chicks

262
00:41:42,094 --> 00:41:47,838
But first they must cross a crowded beach,
threading their way between gigantic

263
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:51,513
and bad tempered elephant seals.

264
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,791
The two hundred thousand penguins
breeding here

265
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,287
are testament
to the richness of the fishing.

266
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:17,149
King chicks are dependent on their mothers
for over a year

267
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:21,481
and this puts a great deal
of pressure on the parents.

268
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:42,389
Being flightless, the returning penguins
must cross the open beach on foot.

269
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:19,513
Fur seals, that have come to the beach to breed,
are waiting for them.

270
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:30,755
Fur seals normally live on krill

271
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:36,828
but these have now acquired
an unexpected taste for blubber rich penguins.

272
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:32,530
Penguins may be featherweights by comparison

273
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:36,961
but they have razor sharp bills
and a feisty character.

274
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,377
The seal could easily lose an eye.

275
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:48,745
The only safe way to grab a penguin
is from behind, and the birds are well aware of that.

276
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:14,116
Both animals are clumsy on this terrain

277
00:45:14,264 --> 00:45:17,038
but the penguin has the more to lose.

278
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,841
Made it.

279
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:35,255
Two out of three penguins
survive the seal attacks

280
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,029
and succeed in reaching
their ever hungry chicks.

281
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:14,070
The humpbacks are nearing the end
of their epic journeys.

282
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:25,180
After two months and thousands of miles,
they're entering the polar seas

283
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:28,677
both in the north and the south.

284
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:46,221
In the far north, winter is over at last
and the ice is starting to melt.

285
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:53,573
The Aleutian Island chain
running west from Alaska

286
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:56,460
is the gateway to the Bearing Sea.

287
00:46:56,707 --> 00:47:03,682
With the retreating ice, rough weather
and ferocious currents stir up these shallow seas.

288
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:08,720
Add sunshine and the mix
is spectacularly productive.

289
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:25,558
Five million shearwaters have flown almost
ten thousand miles from Australia to get here.

290
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,875
In all eighty million seabirds
come here for the summer

291
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:34,797
the greatest concentration
to be found anywhere on Earth.

292
00:47:47,894 --> 00:47:51,456
The humpbacks have finally arrived.

293
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:14,892
The giant shearwater flocks
hunt the krill swarms

294
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:19,618
sometimes diving to depths
of forty meters to reach them.

295
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:48,634
A large humpback
eats three tons of krill a day.

296
00:49:00,976 --> 00:49:05,325
The polar seas in summer
are the most productive on the planet

297
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,166
and the whales gorge themselves
round the clock.

298
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:21,689
The fat reserves they lay down now
will keep them alive during the year to come

299
00:49:23,248 --> 00:49:25,775
but it may not always be this way.

300
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:29,484
Fish and krill stocks
are declining so rapidly

301
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:34,342
that spectacles like this
may soon be part of history.

302
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,720
Once the mother and calf have reached
their feeding grounds, they will separate.

303
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,252
With luck, the calf will make
the epic journey across the oceans

304
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,405
from equator to pole another seventy times

305
00:50:02,028 --> 00:50:05,656
cruising back and forth
between the shallow seas

306
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,336
where life proliferates so abundantly
on our planet.
