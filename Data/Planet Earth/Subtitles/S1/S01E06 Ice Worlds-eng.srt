1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,253
Both poles of our planet are covered with ice.

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:38,322
They're the largest and most demanding
wildernesses of all.

3
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,538
Nowhere else on Earth
is seasonal change so extreme.

4
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,364
It causes the ice to advance
and retreat every year

5
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:55,731
and all life here is governed by that.

6
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:16,512
When the first polar explorers headed south

7
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:22,659
giant cathedrals of ice marked their entry
into uncharted territory.

8
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:33,210
Passing the towering spires they must've wondered
what unearthly sights lay in store.

9
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,238
As they battled on
the ice became increasingly dominant

10
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:48,143
but nothing could have prepared them
for the ice world that finally loomed into view.

11
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:57,914
Terra incognita - the unknown land.

12
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:14,199
At the southernmost extreme of our planet
the continent of Antarctica

13
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,709
is as large as the United States of America.

14
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,259
Ninety percent of all the world's ice
is found here.

15
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:37,802
This frozen world is largely deserted
until the start of spring.

16
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,110
Adelie penguins

17
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,908
in a hurry.

18
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,408
The clock is ticking.

19
00:02:54,637 --> 00:03:01,037
Instead of waiting for the summer melt
the new arrivals hasten south over the frozen sea.

20
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:16,772
They have come here to breed
but polar summers are so short

21
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:21,245
they must be in position
before the thaw starts.

22
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,971
As the sea ice retreats
life can journey farther south.

23
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:43,700
Antarctic waters are so rich
that visitors come from far and wide to harvest them.

24
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:56,361
Vast numbers of chinstrap penguins
come ashore to breed.

25
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:07,878
No bird will lay their eggs
directly onto ice

26
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,805
so bare rock is a vital commodity.
The best patches are worth the climb.

27
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:26,709
The clifftops are soon stained pink with the droppings
of tens of thousands of nesting penguins.

28
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:42,444
Only in a land almost entirely covered in ice
could bare rock be reckoned an oasis.

29
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:48,637
Some will travel into the heart
of the continent to find it.

30
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:59,853
These are noon attacks the exposed peaks
of vast mountain ranges buried in ice over a mile deep.

31
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:06,643
The eerie silence here
is only broken in spring.

32
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:17,331
The snow petrels have arrived
and are courting.

33
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:29,722
Antarctic petrels now join
the most southerly colony on Earth.

34
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:34,552
The birds have flown inland
for over three hundred miles

35
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:37,055
to reach this breeding site.

36
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:47,008
Once their eggs have hatched they'll be forced
repeatedly to make the 600 mile round trip

37
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,061
to gather food in the ocean.

38
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:56,980
First though valuable nesting places
must be defended from property thieves.

39
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:09,104
After laying their eggs the petrels
take time out to clean their plumage.

40
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:34,276
The south polar skua is a formidable opportunist

41
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:40,925
but the skuas have not chanced upon the petrels

42
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,033
they've been waiting for them.

43
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:52,383
These birds do not need to go to the ocean
for their food.

44
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:13,116
The skuas can survive further south
than any other predator

45
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:17,598
by exploiting the petrels' desperate need
for bare rock.

46
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:33,169
Even at the height of summer
less than 3% of Antarctica is free of ice

47
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:37,793
and nearly all of that
exposed rock is found in one place

48
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,714
the Antarctic Peninsula.

49
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:53,988
It's long arm extends further north than
the rest of the continent, so spring arrives here first.

50
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,807
The thaw unlocks sheltered bays

51
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:16,310
that provide refuge from the relentless battering
of the southern ocean.

52
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:24,280
In the depths something stirs...

53
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,284
Humpback whales.

54
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,617
They have travelled over 5000 miles
to reach these waters.

55
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,467
The whales are harvesting krill

56
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:09,185
shrimp like creatures that begin to swarm here
as soon as the ice retreats.

57
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,241
Diving into the heart of the swarm

58
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:30,529
teams of whales spiral around each other
in close coordination.

59
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:39,423
Now they turn and blasting air from their blowholes
and ascend towards their prey.

60
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:46,729
The krill becomes concentrated
as the spiralling net of bubbles draws inwards.

61
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:18,086
The team of whales work around the clock
for the bloom is short lived.

62
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:25,505
Summer is already fading and the whales
will soon be forced north as winter returns.

63
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:33,628
The sun's influence diminishes
and the ocean starts to freeze.

64
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:39,340
The greatest seasonal change
on our planet is underway.

65
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:49,493
The ice grows at an extraordinary rate
advancing two and a half miles a day.

66
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:55,110
In a matter of weeks
the continent effectively doubles in size.

67
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:01,661
Life flees from Antarctica...

68
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,539
but one creature is just arriving.

69
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:23,558
Every winter Emperor penguins leave the comfort
of their ocean home and begin a remarkable journey.

70
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:31,075
They head towards their breeding grounds
almost a hundred miles inland.

71
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:57,175
Eventually the emperor penguins reach
the place where they were hatched

72
00:11:57,357 --> 00:12:01,827
an area sheltered by icebergs
trapped in the frozen ocean.

73
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,297
Here they will raise the next generation

74
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:15,781
but first each must find a mate.

75
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,703
Males begin to serenade

76
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:31,414
and if a female replies
they pair up, posing like statues.

77
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:38,403
New couples quickly form a strong bond

78
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:42,782
they seem oblivious to the noisy crowd
around them.

79
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:49,635
To cement their relationship
the male steps out with his female.

80
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:03,634
The brief courtship complete
there isn't a moment to loose.

81
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:09,262
With so much pressure to perform
any male would struggle to stay on top.

82
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:21,651
Several weeks later and it seems
that most couplings were successful

83
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:26,485
but producing the egg
has taken it's toll.

84
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:30,507
The females no longer have the energy
to incubate.

85
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:34,115
The male takes over.

86
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:41,557
It's still minus 20 degrees centigrade, so the transfer
must be done quickly or else the egg will freeze.

87
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:46,776
With no bare rock to nest on
the male tucks the egg into a special pouch

88
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,931
where he can keep it warm.

89
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:53,175
It requires an extraordinary piece of teamwork.

90
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:02,910
Driven by hunger, the exhausted females now
return to the ocean on their own

91
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:08,718
repeating the epic journey they made
with the males only a month before.

92
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:17,907
Now the sun barely appears above the horizon.

93
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:23,762
As the day shortens, it's warmth
is withdrawn from the continent.

94
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:39,871
With the females gone
the colony undergoes a strange transformation.

95
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:46,701
The males shuffle into groups,
their eggs still tucked away above their feet.

96
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:54,507
They lock together in tightly packed huddles
as they struggle to keep warm.

97
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:03,040
Speeding up the action reveals how
these huddles constantly shift and change

98
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:08,417
as each penguin works it's way
towards the warmer interior.

99
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:14,974
Crammed into this scrum, the birds
are remarkably good natured, but they have to be.

100
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:20,489
If the huddle breaks even for a moment,
precious heat escapes.

101
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:41,863
It's imperative they reform
as quickly as possible

102
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:48,738
for only by as acting as one can the males
withstand the elements, and protect their eggs.

103
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:56,839
But their greatest test lies ahead.

104
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:02,352
As winter advances, frequent blizzards
drive the temperature down.

105
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:07,799
It's now 60 degrees below zero.

106
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,791
The birds at the edge of the huddle

107
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,605
bear the brunt of the hundred mile an hour winds

108
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:19,642
and so provide shelter
to those taking their turn in the middle.

109
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:31,851
Abandoned by the sun
the males are left alone with their eggs

110
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:36,866
to face the coldest darkest winter on Earth.

111
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:46,191
At the northern extreme of our planet

112
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:53,859
the sun rises for the first time in months,
illuminating a very different ice world.

113
00:16:56,014 --> 00:17:03,479
Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is a vast frozen sea
surrounded by land.

114
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,904
Here winter is coming to an end

115
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:13,850
but this bleak wilderness
remains locked in ice.

116
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:23,039
Eider ducks break the silence.

117
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:30,323
They have stayed here braving the northern winter,
instead of flying south to warmer climes.

118
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:39,263
Flocks forty thousand strong
sweep across the frozen wastes.

119
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:54,329
They all have the same goal

120
00:17:54,398 --> 00:18:02,363
a polinear, a permanent hole in the sea ice
kept open throughout the winter by strong ocean currents.

121
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:10,396
This unusual duck pond
provides an overnight sanctuary

122
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:14,729
and when day breaks
a rare chance to feed.

123
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:33,425
Just ten meters beneath the ice, the sea floor
is carpeted with dense mussel beds.

124
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:38,599
These can only be reached
during a brief lull in the currents.

125
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:45,157
The ducks must quickly prise the mussels free
before the tide starts to turn.

126
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,666
The window of opportunity is short.

127
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:58,976
As the current begins to build
it's up up and away.

128
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:15,813
These permanent holes in the ice
provide seafood throughout winter.

129
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:19,715
The diners attract others.

130
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:30,970
In the Arctic, any breach in the icy barrier
can be a lifeline.

131
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:37,074
Musk oxen create their own.

132
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,656
These giants have the strength
to smash through the frozen crust

133
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,697
to graze on the vegetation below.

134
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:54,568
These icebreakers create an opening
for other over winterers.

135
00:19:55,453 --> 00:20:00,535
Flocks of ptarmigan make unusual
grazing companions for the musk oxen

136
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,622
whose entourage grows throughout the day.

137
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:17,462
This odd assembly of vegetarians
doesn't go unnoticed.

138
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:19,981
An arctic fox.

139
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:28,830
The musk oxen have recently given birth.

140
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:32,960
For the fox,
it's a chance to scavenge

141
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:44,916
but half a ton of mad hairy cow
is not to be trifled with.

142
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:56,807
The calves are born well before the spring melt

143
00:20:56,808 --> 00:21:02,026
giving them a head start
when summer finally arrives.

144
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:08,470
It must get to grips with it's new ice world

145
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,870
benign one minute
life threatening the next.

146
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:22,536
Even in spring
winds chill to the bone.

147
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:31,091
The calf must stay close to it's mother
to avoid getting lost in the sudden blizzard.

148
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:42,801
Arctic wolves.

149
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,152
In the whiteout,
the threat is almost impossible to detect

150
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:54,345
but the musk oxen instinctively retreat
to higher ground.

151
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:12,661
Forming a defensive ring around their calves

152
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:16,891
the adults present a barricade
that few hunters could breach

153
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:22,972
but the wolves need not risk injury today.

154
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:28,489
A calf has been left behind in the panic.

155
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:45,298
With each passing day
the sun climbs higher in the sky

156
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:49,037
and it's rays strike the Arctic more directly.

157
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,411
It's spring and new life stirs.

158
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:02,361
The polar bear cubs emerge from the den
in which they were born.

159
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:08,224
Their mother stretches her legs
after five months under the snow.

160
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,668
They're just two months old

161
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:18,412
and instinctively follow her lead.

162
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,541
A steep slope makes the best site for a den

163
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:41,102
but it's a tricky place to take your first steps.

164
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:04,449
It may look like fun, but this
is serious training for the task ahead.

165
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:06,492
There's no food on the slopes

166
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:12,890
and the family will need to head out
across the frozen sea, before the mother's milk runs dry.

167
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,284
Two weeks later
they're ready.

168
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:27,004
Out on the sea ice
the female can hunt for seals

169
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:31,291
but it will take all her mothering skills
to keep her cubs safe

170
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:34,899
in this dangerous world of ice.

171
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,707
The annual melt has begun.

172
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:57,404
This is a challenging time
for the bear family.

173
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:03,870
One out of every two cubs do not survive
their first year out on the ice.

174
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:19,935
As the sun's influence increases, the sea ice
seems to take on a life of it's own.

175
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,668
Glacial melt waters pour from the land

176
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,844
mingling with the sea
and speeding up the thaw.

177
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:46,824
The seascape is in constant flux,
as broken ice is moved on by winds and currents.

178
00:25:55,285 --> 00:26:01,366
The ice is becoming too weak
to support a male polar bear.

179
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:10,897
He attempts to spread his weight

180
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:16,251
but the ice that has supported him all winter
is rapidly disintegrating.

181
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:22,719
Each year as the climate warms
the Arctic holds less ice.

182
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:25,940
This is a disaster for polar bears.

183
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:32,521
Without it's solid platform, they can't hunt
the seals they need in order to survive.

184
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,488
This may be a glimpse of the unstable future

185
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,755
faced by this magnificent creature.

186
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:19,625
As the ice disappears
seabirds return to the high Arctic.

187
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:31,129
Little auks arrive in their millions.

188
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:37,256
In some ways these birds
are the penguins of the north.

189
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:43,019
The seek bare rock on which to lay their eggs
and they look rather like penguins too.

190
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:54,001
Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic
can be reached by land based predators

191
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:58,245
which is why little auks have kept
the ability to fly.

192
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:09,726
They use scree slopes to protect their eggs,
burrowing up to a meter beneath the rocks.

193
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:18,893
At the height of summer the sun never sets

194
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:22,978
but just skims the horizon before rising again.

195
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:32,757
Migrants return to the Arctic
from far and wide.

196
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:36,410
They've come to make the most
of the brief flush of food

197
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,680
and to produce their young.

198
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:45,260
Sandhill cranes have travelled all the way
from New Mexico.

199
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:56,038
Their chicks join the growing band of youngsters
exploring the tundra.

200
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:08,087
For a few months each year the Arctic
becomes the land of the midnight sun

201
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:13,714
and twenty four hours of daylight
allow animals to feed around the clock.

202
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:20,885
The arctic fox finally has enough food
to raise her large family.

203
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:40,290
If you choose to nest in the open
you must be prepared for a fight.

204
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:54,653
Arctic skuas will see off any trespassers
even large vegetarians.

205
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:45,231
The male polar bear's ice world
has finally vanished beneath him.

206
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,706
While the female is still kept on land
by her dependent cubs

207
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:04,314
the male can take to the sea
in search of food.

208
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:11,734
Ducking and diving, he hopes to ambush seals
resting on the remaining fragments of ice.

209
00:31:37,306 --> 00:31:43,297
In these new surroundings
he is a surprisingly adept swimmer.

210
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:55,822
Once an extremely rare sight

211
00:31:55,823 --> 00:32:01,267
polar bears have recently been seen
over sixty miles from the shore.

212
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:18,013
There is now no turning back for this bear.

213
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:22,686
He's forced to head out into deeper water.

214
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:34,849
His giant front paws
help him to fight the ocean currents.

215
00:32:54,702 --> 00:33:00,352
He seems at home in the sea
but he cannot swim indefinitely.

216
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:09,042
He will drown if he doesn't find land
somewhere in this vast ocean.

217
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:39,606
Walruses are now gathering
on low lying islands.

218
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:42,352
They gave birth on sea ice

219
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:48,886
but with this platform now gone, they need
a new place to haul out and nurse their young.

220
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:55,694
After several days at sea
the male bear finally makes landfall

221
00:33:55,785 --> 00:34:00,709
drawn by pungent smells
emanating from the island.

222
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:12,372
By the end of summer
the bear has lost half his weight.

223
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:18,339
With the ice long gone
he is forced onto land in search of food.

224
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:30,342
There will be no easy meals on this island.

225
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:35,378
Walruses are the largest seals in the world.
They weight over a ton

226
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:38,692
and are armed with tusks a meter long.

227
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:46,723
Exhausted from his swim
the bear must regain his strength.

228
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,797
The next day a sea fog shrouds the island.

229
00:34:57,024 --> 00:35:00,406
The walruses sense that they're in danger.

230
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:07,622
Using the fog as cover
the bear approaches the herd.

231
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:18,763
The adults close ranks around their young,
presenting a wall of blubber and hide.

232
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,630
He tests the barrier but it stands firm.

233
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:36,710
It appears that the world's largest
land carnivore has met his match.

234
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,671
There must be a chink in the armor somewhere.

235
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:52,093
Not here.

236
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:06,117
This female walrus is shielding her pup,
if can just prise her off.

237
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:17,759
The bears claws and teeth can't penetrate
her thick hide.

238
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:30,533
With the herd retreating to water
the bear must move quickly.

239
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:39,291
Having failed with one
he heads straight for another.

240
00:36:56,175 --> 00:37:00,576
The chance of his first meal in months
is slipping away.

241
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:09,538
He seems increasingly desperate.

242
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:17,480
It's now or never.

243
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:22,337
He must avoid the stabbing tusks
if he's to win.

244
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:34,431
The flailing walrus is immensely powerful
and drags the bear away from the shallows

245
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,904
towards the safety of the herd.

246
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,556
It slips from his grasp.

247
00:38:02,544 --> 00:38:07,060
Only at the height of summer
when bears are on the verge of starvation

248
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:11,144
will they risk attacking such dangerous prey.

249
00:38:14,638 --> 00:38:19,063
It was a gamble that this bear took, and lost.

250
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:28,753
The stab wounds he received from the walrus
are so severe that he can barely walk.

251
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,151
The walruses are calm again

252
00:38:35,492 --> 00:38:42,117
seemingly aware that the injured bear
no longer poses a threat to them or their young.

253
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,903
Unable to feed
this bear will not survive.

254
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:16,561
If the global climate continues to warm

255
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:19,669
and the Arctic ice melts sooner each year

256
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:24,299
it's certain that more bears
will share this fate.

257
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:47,736
At the southern end of our planet

258
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:51,616
fiery ribbons are illuminating the winter skies.

259
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:55,020
<i>The aurora australis.</i>

260
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:03,098
This light brings no warmth
to the male penguins who are still huddling

261
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:07,137
defying the coldest conditions on the planet.

262
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:24,359
Their ordeal is drawing to a close.

263
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:38,155
Thirty days after it last set
the sun rises once more on Antarctica.

264
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:03,795
Their appalling trials have all been for this.

265
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:23,853
Each father has just one meal left inside him.

266
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:27,325
He's been saving it all winter.

267
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:33,247
This single feeding will sustain the chicks
for a few more days

268
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:36,810
but the males have not eaten
for nearly four months.

269
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:41,937
If they do not eat soon
they and their chicks will die.

270
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:54,531
But there is hope on the horizon.

271
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:12,139
The females are returning,
and their bellies are full with fish.

272
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:22,644
As they approach, waves of excitement
ripple through the huddle.

273
00:42:29,972 --> 00:42:37,346
Each female calls to her mate, and he,
recognizing her song, trumpets back.

274
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:42,656
Reunited, at last.

275
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,621
The mother feeds her chick for the first time.

276
00:42:52,957 --> 00:42:55,249
She's keen to start parenting

277
00:42:55,974 --> 00:43:01,897
but the father needs persuading to surrender
the chick he's been caring for all winter.

278
00:43:05,935 --> 00:43:12,357
He must now put his chick at risk.
In these temperatures it could freeze in seconds.

279
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,574
The male will have to let go.

280
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:28,944
Eventually, the transfer to the mother
is safely made.

281
00:43:43,396 --> 00:43:48,661
The chicks grow quickly
on a diet of fish and squid.

282
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:07,154
Soon they're keen to explore,
but always with mother in tow.

283
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:11,237
This chick is less fortunate.

284
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:15,390
It's mother has not returned to claim it.

285
00:44:16,548 --> 00:44:23,604
Another orphan is searching for a new family,
but this female already has a chick of her own.

286
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,355
Some orphans receive too much mothering
from penguins whose own chicks have not survived.

287
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:44,616
The urge to parent is so strong, that they will
compete with one another to adopt any chick they find.

288
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:52,057
Many of these squabbles will end in tragedy

289
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:56,073
as the poor chick is trampled to death.

290
00:45:07,101 --> 00:45:12,751
Those chicks that do have parents
quickly learn survival skills.

291
00:45:13,749 --> 00:45:16,948
Even in spring,
they must huddle together for warmth

292
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:20,442
just as their fathers did
in the depths of winter.

293
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:28,089
A group of chicks has got lost in the blizzard.

294
00:45:34,193 --> 00:45:38,459
Cold and disorientated
they search for the colony.

295
00:45:44,564 --> 00:45:49,646
It will not be long before the storm
claims it's first victims.

296
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:12,517
By early summer,
the chicks are surprisingly well developed

297
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:16,578
and now look ready to take on the world.

298
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:22,296
Those that survived their first year
have the best possible start in life

299
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:27,764
thanks to the extraordinary hardships
endured by their parents.

300
00:46:27,923 --> 00:46:34,003
Parents who battled with the Antarctic winter,
and won.

301
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:47,823
In the Arctic the two polar bear cubs
are now independent of their mother

302
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:53,178
and they briefly reunite
where their home ranges overlap.

303
00:46:59,078 --> 00:47:01,869
Their time together will be fleeting.

304
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,023
Most of their lives are now spent alone

305
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,039
wandering the vast tracts of frozen ocean.

306
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:41,374
Following their mother,
has prepared them for life at the pole

307
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:46,479
an ever changing land ruled by ice.

308
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,673
Whether they are ready for the bigger changes
that have begun to shape the ice worlds of our planet

309
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,189
remains to be seen.
