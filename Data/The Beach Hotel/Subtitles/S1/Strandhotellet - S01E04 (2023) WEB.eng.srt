1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,640
The person who
will be taking over is Sebastian.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,360
-I know you're making a mistake.
-I'll accept. We'll work together.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,040
After six months
I go back home and you take over.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,320
You're prepared to stay
in Saltsjövik for six months. Why?

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,200
I don't know what you're up to.
Just don't ruin his life again.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,560
Had you not
dragged him out that night,

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,600
he would not have been hit by a car.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,120
How about dinner?

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Like a work thing, nothing else?

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,480
Julie, hi.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,480
-You're Rebecca?
-Yeah.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,680
-Who was that?
-I hardly know her.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,760
-Egil made changes to his will.
-Here's a letter.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,680
I understand
if you never forgive me.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,600
But I have another daughter,
born outside my marriage.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,720
I have decided to leave

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,720
half of Hotel Mistral to my
other daughter, Rebecca Adolfsson.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,600
Hello.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,560
Great that you're able to come.
Have a seat.

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,560
We now have access to

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
the details of Egil's will.

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,080
That means you know now?

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Why didn't you say anything?
You and Dad knew all along.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,760
There's quite a lot to take in,
for everyone.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,240
But maybe we should
focus on the practicalities?

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,880
-In his will...
-Sorry, I can't do this.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
-Julie...
-Not just now.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,720
Julie, wait.

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,800
Egil stated in his will

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,760
that he wanted you to
have 50% of the shares in Mistral.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,760
You own half of the hotel.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,960
Are you joking?

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,760
No.

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,840
I think I'd better
go and find Julie.

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,080
THE BEACH HOTEL

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Where are my ties, darling?

37
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,440
You never wear a tie.

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Please, just help me look.

39
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,160
-Have you seen my necklace?
-No.

40
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,720
How many
client meetings have you had?

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,440
You never wear a tie.

42
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,560
I think
people would appreciate it here.

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,800
-Are you excited?
-I am.

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Don't exhaust yourself.
You're only here for six months.

45
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,920
That doesn't mean
I'll just be twiddling my thumbs.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,440
Here you go.

47
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,200
If we try,
we should get most of it unpacked.

48
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,560
I want things to be bearable
until we move back.

49
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Okay, but I think I'll be back late.

50
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Right. I love you.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,280
-Nothing from the mini bar?
-No, nothing.

52
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,000
-Thank you very much then.
-Thank you.

53
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,760
I don't understand why people can't
put things back where they belong.

54
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
There we go.

55
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,760
-Hello.
-Hi.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,520
How are you doing?

57
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,880
Oh, I'm fine. This thing with
having children happened a bit fast.

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,560
-Do you want to talk about it?
-No, thanks.

59
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,600
Do you know what? I feel fine.

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,680
It's probably all for the best.

61
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,880
You look all flushed.
Has something happened?

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,600
No.

63
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,760
Like what?

64
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll see you soon.

65
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
I'll take some pictures.
The light is good.

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,560
Hang on.

67
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,080
Tone has gone through
the purchase agreement.

68
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay. Were there any problems?

69
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,320
No, she didn't spot anything,
but I did.

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,880
You might know
what I'm talking about.

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,480
No idea.

72
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,920
Will you give me a clue?

73
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,320
-The deposit.
-What about it?

74
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,360
It was
half a million more than you said.

75
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Well, I suppose I accidentally
gave you the wrong figure.

76
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,440
What are you trying to say?

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,360
Hey? Do you think
I'm trying to trick you?

78
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,680
No. But I don't like
surprises in business.

79
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,840
Sure, but I'm not an expert.

80
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,800
-We're talking half a million.
-Okay.

81
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,600
I hear what you're saying.

82
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,760
As you can see
there's minimal wear and tear.

83
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,760
No need to redecorate for years.

84
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Not sure about curtains...

85
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,040
-And the throws.
-Werner always loved those.

86
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,000
I believe
he got a good deal on them.

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,400
I'd like to see something
a bit more personal.

88
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,520
Imagine giving each room
its own character.

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
All different?

90
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,560
That sounds a bit messy to me.

91
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Not at all. Look at The Mistral.

92
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,320
We can't copy our competitor.

93
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,120
Just for some inspiration.

94
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,840
What will Werner say about this?

95
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,040
You and Werner
have created this place.

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,680
I don't want to change things
for the sake of it.

97
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,520
I just feel it needs a fresh look.

98
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,200
Right. I will make some suggestions.

99
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,240
Thank you.

100
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,560
You're a rock.

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,200
She's never said a word
in the time she's lived here.

102
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,440
-It's insane.
-Sure.

103
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,200
Hey...

104
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Have you spoken to Petra?

105
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,840
No, not since I left.

106
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,200
She has been in touch,

107
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,640
but I don't know what to say to her.

108
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,280
If you're feeling a bit unsure,
maybe you should wait.

109
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,760
You don't think I'm being nasty?

110
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm your friend.
I'm on your side. You know that.

111
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
You can stay with me
for as long as you like.

112
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,520
Thanks.

113
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Right, back to work.

114
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
-See you this evening.
-Yeah.

115
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,040
Removals boxes...

116
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,840
-So you live here now?
-I do.

117
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
But I need to find something to do.

118
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,440
I'll go mental rattling around the
house like some little housewife.

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,280
Do you need help?

120
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,560
Have you got any experience?

121
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
Sure. Two seasons at a ski resort.

122
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,160
-Working the bar?
-No, but drinking there.

123
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,160
Of course. Okay then...

124
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,080
What's in a Manhattan?

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,040
A Manhattan... Let's see.

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,600
Two parts whisky, one part vermouth,
a little Angostura.

127
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,640
Stir, strain and a cherry on top.

128
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,080
Ask me another one.

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
Okay. Espresso martini.

130
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,800
Espresso martini, okay.
One part vodka,

131
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,280
one part coffee liqueur,
two parts espresso.

132
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,800
Shake everything
until cold and frothy,

133
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,320
sprinkle some
dark chocolate over - done.

134
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,120
Well... Okay, then.

135
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,480
You can try a shift
and see how you get on.

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
So what are we doing here?

137
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
I think we ought to cooperate.

138
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Our hotels
have different clienteles.

139
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,200
I don't see us suddenly
turning into a big happy family.

140
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,080
I just think we can work smarter.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,320
How?

142
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,000
The tourism fair
in Stockholm is coming up

143
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,520
and I suggest we go together
in order to market Saltsjövik.

144
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,360
Double exposure at half the cost.

145
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,720
-Why not think about it?
-I'll give you an answer now.

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,320
No.

147
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,640
This is a waste of time.

148
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,360
We'll think about it.

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Julie, hold on.

150
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,640
Would you mind
asking Gabrielle to call me?

151
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
She'll be in touch when she's ready.

152
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,760
-Has she said anything?
-No.

153
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
It was your idea.

154
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,160
Everyone's not always against you.

155
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,000
Gabrielle isn't well.
Don't you see that?

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,080
Just tell her... that I miss her.

157
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,840
I really believe in
doing the fair together.

158
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,800
Let's meet and discuss some figures.

159
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Enjoy your coffee.

160
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
It's on the house.

161
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,120
Just don't tell anyone. I'm going
out with the CEO and do what I like.

162
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,440
Martin needed help in the bar
and I needed a job.

163
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,600
I could have got you a job
in the marketing department.

164
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,360
Do you find it embarrassing
that I work in the bar?

165
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,960
No, of course not.

166
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
Enjoy your coffee.

167
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Hey. Hey...

168
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,960
Have you seen Sebastian?

169
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,080
I'm sure he's around somewhere
doing something revolutionary.

170
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,120
What did you want to talk about?

171
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,720
I'd rather speak to him first.

172
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,920
Don't worry.
We'll be as close as you and Dad.

173
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,680
So Sebastian has a lot of ideas?

174
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,600
Not much will come of them,

175
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
but new curtains will be nice.

176
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,520
I understand you're
disappointed you weren't chosen.

177
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
Yes, I expect you feel the same.

178
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,200
It's hard to understand
his way of thinking.

179
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,720
It'll be fine.
Sebastian won't stay for long.

180
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,760
Are you sure?

181
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,160
Six months.
After that I'll be taking over.

182
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Sebastian and I agreed that.

183
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,400
In total we save 50,000 each.

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
And we only
have to do half the work.

185
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,080
Well, that sounds great.

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
Are you alright? Are you in pain?

187
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,280
-We can carry on another day.
-No, I'm fine.

188
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,120
-It feels like it's my fault.
-What?

189
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,640
-The fact that you're in pain.
-No, stop it.

190
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,720
It's nobody's fault.

191
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
It was an accident.

192
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,160
-Well, you know...
-Julie!

193
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,560
Don't.

194
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,440
I've never blamed you.

195
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,840
Where did you get that idea?

196
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,840
Has Mum said something?

197
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,040
-I'll talk to her.
-No, please don't.

198
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,760
Let's just forget about it.

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,280
I saw Petra yesterday.

200
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,280
Maybe you should talk to her.

201
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
No.

202
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,920
Do you have to do that right now?

203
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Should I leave it
to become totally overgrown?

204
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,920
Maybe you could wait
until we've gone to work?

205
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,160
And how long
will she be staying here?

206
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,680
I'll be going now.

207
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
Gabrielle is my friend.

208
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,680
She'll be staying in my part
of the house as long as she likes.

209
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Shouldn't she be back with Petra?

210
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,400
She's distraught.

211
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,320
I'll finish my breakfast inside
and leave you in peace.

212
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Are you meeting that daughter today?

213
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,080
Yes, we have a board meeting.

214
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,200
I will never,
never see her as part of our family.

215
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,760
What family?

216
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,520
There's some omelette
on the cooker for you.

217
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm in a rush.

218
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
See you later.

219
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,360
-Vendela said I'd find you here.
-Are you on your way to the hotel?

220
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,360
Are you missing it already?

221
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,080
What's on your mind?

222
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,760
Sebastian wants
to do things his way.

223
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,080
But I'm worried that
he won't come to me

224
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,600
even regarding things that
I might be able to resolve.

225
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,960
I don't want it to sound like
I want you to spy on him...

226
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,960
-I don't want any trouble.
-Sure.

227
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,480
If ever there is trouble,
I'll deal with it.

228
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,560
Are you still happy
not to have chosen Petra?

229
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,600
The best role for Petra
is as hotel manager.

230
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,960
I think she knows that deep down.

231
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
-What about the agreement?
-What agreement?

232
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,160
Sebastian will be CEO for a year and
then Petra will take over, right?

233
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,920
You didn't know?

234
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,040
Egil left half of the shares
in Mistral Holdings to you.

235
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,600
That incorporates Mistral Spa Hotel
and Mistral Foods and Beverages.

236
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,160
Is this the value of the entire
company or is it my part of it?

237
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,960
Right, let's see. That's your share.

238
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,040
I understand if
this feels overwhelming.

239
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,240
But I'm prepared to buy you out,
here and now, if you like.

240
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,840
No.

241
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,840
Why not?

242
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Isn't this a bit of
a headache for you?

243
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you know anything about
how to run a hotel?

244
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,680
No, maybe not, but I want to learn.

245
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
Have you always known
that Egil was your dad?

246
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,040
-I've only known for a few years.
-You didn't grow up around here?

247
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,480
I really wanted to tell you,
but I didn't know how to.

248
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Instead you snuck around
here anonymously.

249
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,840
And where's your mum?

250
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,320
Julie, calm down.

251
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,000
We don't need to cross-examine her.

252
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,160
Let's just focus on the business.

253
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,760
Yesterday we met with Petra
and Sebastian from The Beach Hotel.

254
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,520
Why is it all my fault?

255
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,800
Egil knew all along,
but never got in touch with me.

256
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,320
And you never got in touch with him?

257
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,800
-You never emailed him?
-No...

258
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,560
Here are the log in details
for the business department.

259
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,080
I have set up
a mail account for you.

260
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,080
Before you log in we need to check
your phone and computer for viruses.

261
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
That's standard security procedure.

262
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,760
You want to go through
my phone and my computer?

263
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,560
Julie...

264
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
Here you go.
Check as much as you like.

265
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,520
Do you need my bank log in
and the keys for my flat as well?

266
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,760
-That's the way to the beach.
-And that's where the beach café is?

267
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,120
-Exactly.
-Thank you very much.

268
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,200
What are you up today?

269
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,080
-I can't.
-Have you got plans?

270
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,440
What happened the other night
was incredible.

271
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,320
Sure.

272
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,360
But we can't let it happen again.
I hope you understand.

273
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,320
Well, if you don't want to...

274
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,440
The Beach Hotel. Lojsan speaking.

275
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Lovely. I'll see
if we have any rooms free.

276
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,000
Is it that one?

277
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,440
Hi, Dad.

278
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,040
Sorry, did we arrange a meeting?

279
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,160
Nope.

280
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,600
We are more booked up next week.

281
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,760
Do you like it here, Sebastian?

282
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,200
Yes, all good.
I think it's all going fine.

283
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,440
And you're looking forward to
the next six months?

284
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,680
-Did you tell him?
-Bloody Tone.

285
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,480
She assumed you'd told me.

286
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,920
This is actually a good solution.

287
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,080
And Svante told me you'll be giving
all the rooms individual makeovers.

288
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,480
I can imagine he wasn't
over the moon about it,

289
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,440
but I can explain my reasoning.

290
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,760
If this isn't finished in six
months, will you carry on, Petra?

291
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,840
Oh, come on. What the hell?

292
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Not all of your ideas
are full of magic.

293
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,560
Like I don't believe in
cooperating with Mistral.

294
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,280
-Cooperating how?
-Why always compete?

295
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,280
-So my leadership was foolish?
-No, I'm not saying that.

296
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,000
But if I'm going to do this
it has to be done my way.

297
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,760
So your way is to hand over
everything after six months?

298
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,160
Do you consider that responsible?

299
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,440
You'd better forget
this little plan.

300
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,640
Sebastian is the CEO. End of.

301
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,720
-Here you go. One Sunshine.
-Thank you.

302
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,800
You're a natural.

303
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,400
-Sure.
-No, I mean it.

304
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm so happy to have you here.

305
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,680
I hope you feel the same.

306
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,240
Well, I needed something to do.

307
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,720
So what did Sebastian say
about you working here?

308
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
Nothing.

309
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,880
Martin, you need
some fresh ideas here.

310
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,360
-Get people to come.
-Really?

311
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,000
This place is so nineties.
Just look around.

312
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,040
-Isn't that back in fashion?
-Was it ever in fashion?

313
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,240
I'm sorry this place doesn't meet
your Stockholm standards.

314
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,840
But Svante and I
built this up from scratch.

315
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,920
Thank you.

316
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,200
So have you found anything?

317
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,640
No, nothing on Rebecca's computer
matches the extortion mails.

318
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,280
Maybe she wasn't behind it.

319
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Or she used another computer.

320
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,680
How the hell could he do this?

321
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,160
First he's unfaithful
and has another child

322
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,360
and then he doesn't mention it.

323
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,480
I understand he didn't want to
admit it at the time, but later?

324
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,120
Years went by.

325
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,720
Maybe he felt ashamed.

326
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,000
And who did he meet?

327
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,160
I'm sure he wanted to tell you.
We don't know the whole story.

328
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,960
No, you're right.

329
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,960
He probably thought
it was for the best.

330
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,560
He always did what was best for you,
you know that.

331
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,040
That's not how it feels.

332
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,520
Maybe this is what Egil wanted.

333
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,400
For you two to work together
and get to know each other.

334
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,320
At the end of the day
she owns half of the hotel.

335
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,200
It will make my job easier
and yours.

336
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,320
-Hey?
-Okay, I'll think about it.

337
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
Good.

338
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,840
I'll cook this evening, okay?

339
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
Thank you.

340
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,280
Carbonara?

341
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,920
What do we do now?

342
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,720
I don't know.

343
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,200
You can't pay any attention to
what Dad says.

344
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,880
You and I have an agreement.

345
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
You always do exactly
what Dad tells you to.

346
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
You can't do this to me, Sebastian.

347
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,280
Why didn't you defend my ideas?

348
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,080
You come in here
and think you can run a hotel.

349
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
You get on everybody's nerves.

350
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,600
Did you think
I'd let you run everything?

351
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,400
-Why not?
-But the hotel is in trouble.

352
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,720
I had a solution to the problems.

353
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,600
Dad just didn't want to listen
and you let me down.

354
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,640
It's always somebody else's fault.
Can you hear yourself?

355
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,920
And you sound like Julie.

356
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,120
You talk down to people. Shirin
ought to know the real reason...

357
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,840
-You have no idea.
-You play hotel director.

358
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,120
You force your girlfriend
to move here only to get Julie back.

359
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,720
-You're pathetic.
-And what about your gambling habit?

360
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,920
-Dad's right. You can't run a hotel.
-Fuck off.

361
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,640
What's this?

362
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,080
Has the money arrived?

363
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,760
I don't understand.

364
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,360
That is the deposit for the house.

365
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,080
The half million
you got so upset about.

366
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,080
What did you think? That you'd
have to pay for all of it?

367
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,840
We can sign the contract tomorrow.
There's nothing stopping us.

368
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,520
No, I agree.

369
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,800
Good.

370
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,840
Hello?

371
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,560
What's the matter?
You've hardly said a word all night.

372
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,440
-Is it Rebecca?
-No.

373
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,920
Or maybe... I don't know.

374
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,480
It will be alright.

375
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,680
Would you mind asking Marianne about
the surveillance camera Dad put up?

376
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,000
I'd like to look at the footage.

377
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,160
She'd say no if I asked.

378
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,400
Are we back there again?

379
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,240
What do you think
you're going to find?

380
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,200
Somebody was blackmailing him.

381
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,360
We need to find out who it was
and why they did it.

382
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,000
What if they come after us now?

383
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,920
Please, ask her.

384
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Sure, I promise.

385
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,160
Would you like anything
from the kitchen?

386
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,960
-No, I'm fine, thanks.
-Okay.

387
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,120
-Are you in pain?
-Just a long day.

388
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Me, too. Can I ask you something?

389
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,280
Nothing important.

390
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,880
What would you say about
updating the bar a bit?

391
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,520
One more idea from me
and I'll be shot.

392
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,960
So tell them it's my idea.

393
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,360
I'd take a bullet for you...

394
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,960
Do you realise how happy I am
that you're here with me?

395
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm happy to be here, too.

396
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,560
Darling, you stink.

397
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,600
Okay, I know. I'll have a shower.

398
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,120
Thank you.

399
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Thanks for today.
It means a lot.

400
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,960
Hello.

401
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,960
Here you go.

402
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,800
Thank you.

403
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm sorry for asking...

404
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,760
but do you know
how Egil and your mum met?

405
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,480
At the hotel.

406
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Where is she now?
I'd love to meet her.

407
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,040
My mum is dead.

408
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,240
God, sorry. I didn't realise.

409
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,400
No, how would you know?

410
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,400
It's been a while.

411
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,920
-What was her name?
-Jessica.

412
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,080
She worked at the Beach Hotel when
Egil and Werner owned it together.

413
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,400
How did she die?

414
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,640
She got ill.
It was over pretty quickly.

415
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,120
My behaviour last time
really wasn't okay.

416
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,840
No...

417
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,560
Aksel said that maybe

418
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,720
Dad did this for us two
to get to know each other.

419
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,920
Just the sort of thing he would do.

420
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,800
-Why?
-He found it easy to talk to people.

421
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,680
And find a connection. He didn't
get why others weren't like him.

422
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,160
What was he like as a father?

423
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
He worked nearly all the time.

424
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,600
When he was at home, he might not
have played with me or read to me,

425
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,680
but I always felt that
he was there for me the whole time.

426
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,280
Once, as a student in Switzerland,
when I was feeling really low,

427
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,800
I was in my dorm and just
wanted to give up and go home.

428
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,360
Suddenly, there he was.

429
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,240
He'd flown down,
just to see how I was.

430
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
We went out for a meal.

431
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,360
That's on the way back to the hotel,

432
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,840
like ten beers later.
Look at the state of us.

433
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,840
So he wanted you, but not me.

434
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,560
I don't know why
he never mentioned you.

435
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
But I'm sure he did think of you.

436
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,760
But he never showed that he did.

437
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,200
Busy day?

438
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,960
No, not too bad.

439
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,720
All that's missing
is your signature.

440
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,720
I really want this, Werner.

441
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,360
A new life together with you.

442
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,960
I know.

443
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,760
But you're not ready yet.

444
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,880
You can't bear the thought
of leaving the hotel.

445
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,960
You're so full of energy,
passion, adventure.

446
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,160
I wish I was the same, but I'm not.

447
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,120
You have your adventure here.

449
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,840
At Saltsjövik.

450
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,800
We don't need to do this now.

451
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
We can carry on as we are.

452
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,680
You're not angry?

453
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,960
No.

454
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,640
You're amazing.

455
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,440
Hang on!

456
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,160
Please, don't think
I have any regrets.

457
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,480
-But?
-I find you very... special.

458
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,600
Special? Like really hard work?

459
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,280
No, the complete opposite.

460
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,200
I can't break the rules
that I make my staff adhere to.

461
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
What would people think?

462
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,320
They'd think that
you're listening to yourself.

463
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,040
See you tomorrow. Or this evening.

464
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,600
It's up to you.

465
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,360
Conscientious.

466
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,480
What are you doing here?

467
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,960
How are you?

468
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,160
Well, what do you think?

469
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,960
You never call me back.

470
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,120
No, I'm sorry.

471
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm glad you're here.

472
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,080
I fought with Sebastian yesterday.

473
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,320
You're not surprised?

474
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,160
Why do I keep hurting
the people close to me?

475
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,640
We've hurt each other.

476
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Would you like me to come home?

477
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,200
You go back.
I'm going to Stockholm tomorrow.

478
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,160
We'll see what we do
when I get back.

479
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,280
What do you mean "we'll see"?

480
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,680
You're right.
We need some time apart.

481
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,000
So that's just your decision?

482
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,720
Do I not get a say?

483
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,880
-Look, I just want to...
-"You want to."

484
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,200
And "you're going to..."
It's all on your terms!

485
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,720
Your family
is always more important than us.

486
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,000
And your feelings
are always more important than mine.

487
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,800
Just piss off, forget about me
and focus on yourself.

488
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,480
That's what you do best, after all.

489
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,640
I asked her to come over.

490
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,840
You have to sort this out.

491
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,360
Petra.

492
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,960
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't think...

493
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,040
No, I know.

494
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,440
See you.

495
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,680
Hold on.

496
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Could you help me with something?

497
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,760
What?

498
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,200
Could you check if Jessica Adolfsson
has worked at your hotel?

499
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,240
Who's that?

500
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,200
Rebecca's mum.

501
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,360
What do you want from her?

502
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,560
Okay, I'll check.

503
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,600
I'll be in touch
if I find something.

504
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,720
Thank you.

505
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,120
No, we can forget about France.

506
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,640
That's my savings gone.

507
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,040
Unfortunately.

508
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,160
But listen,
it might all be for the best.

509
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,520
It would have taken a long time.

510
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,440
Focus on the wedding instead.

511
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,600
The sooner I get married,
the sooner I can get divorced.

512
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,880
No, I know.

513
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I miss you, too.

514
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,480
A lot.

515
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,120
But I'll see you soon.

516
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,520
Love you.

517
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,760
-Marianne?
-Hello.

518
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,800
I haven't been here since...

519
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,480
His diary.

520
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I do like this hotel.

521
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,160
I'd love to
make myself useful somehow.

522
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,200
Did you have
anything in particular in mind?

523
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,280
-No, I don't know.
-Okay.

524
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,920
You have a think
and I'll see what I can do.

525
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,280
-You promise me that?
-Sure.

526
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,760
I could use your help
with something.

527
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,320
What?

528
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,920
The surveillance camera.

529
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,560
From the days
leading up to Egil's death.

530
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,120
Hasn't Julie
forgotten about that yet?

531
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,200
Okay.

532
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,880
I will see to it.

533
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,280
For your sake.

534
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,840
Thank you.

535
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,400
There you go. Nice to see you again.

536
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,480
The nineties weren't all bad.

537
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,000
-No?
-No, that's when I was born.

538
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm sorry about the other day.

539
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
I shouldn't have dissed your bar.

540
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,640
Don't worry.

541
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,360
And maybe we could do
with a bit of a makeover.

542
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,840
-Exactly.
-I'm just not sure what it needs.

543
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,880
I'd suggest
you do something with mirrors.

544
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,160
To get some depth into the room.
It would make it so bright.

545
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,120
Blue as a base colour
is kind of safe at a coastal hotel,

546
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,880
but if you look at these stripes...

547
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,160
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you?

548
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,600
Is Sebastian still at the hotel
or has he gone home?

549
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,680
When will you realise
that Sebastian isn't yours anymore?

550
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,480
-Look where the picture is...
-See you.
