1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,160
The new CEO will be... Sebastian.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,920
So you're living here?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,320
Mm. I need to find something to do.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,040
Do you need help here?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,920
Okay, you can have a go.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,560
-I just want to...
-Okay, you want to and you will.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,840
It's always on your terms.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,280
You know what? Leave, then.
Forget me and focus on yourself.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,280
That's what you're good at.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,760
I've always regretted
not going with you.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,920
Egil left 50 per cent of the shares
to Mistral Holding to you.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,880
Do you know how
Egil and your mum met?

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,320
She worked at the hotel one summer
when Egil and Werner shared it.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
-Can you help me with something?
-What?

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Can you check if a Jessika Adolfsson
has worked at the hotel?

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
Have we had a break in?

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,920
Petra was here last yesterday.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,160
-She must have left it like this.
-That's not like her.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,280
Where is she? We were meant to have
a meeting now.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,720
-I'll take the meeting.
-I report to Petra.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,040
Can I be honest with you, Svante?

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,960
Petra and I aren't exactly
best friends right now.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,560
I think she's staying away
to punish me.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,160
I'm sure she'll calm down soon,
but...

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
We'll just have to carry on
until she decides to show up.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,560
-Are you okay with that?
-Absolutely.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,560
-Would you like help tidying this?
-Yes, please.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,400
I'll try calling her again.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,240
THE BEACH HOTEL

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,280
The garage will be perfect.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,320
-For what?
-A studio.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Oh, right. But, listen,
that can't sit outside.

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,440
No, but I can't exactly paint
in the living room, right?

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
Is this absolutely necessary
for you?

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,920
If we'd moved to Brittany,
I'd have had a whole studio.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,480
This is my job, Werner.

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
I understand.

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,440
We can convert the garage to a
workspace.

39
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,920
There's always a tax break
to claim there.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,520
-I knew you'd understand.
-Talk to Tone about it.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,880
Okay. I'll find a new place
for your little sweetheart here.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,320
-Okay?
-Okay, thank you.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
I'll find you something
more fun to do.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,960
Available dates at Town Hall.

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,080
Choose the date
you think works best.

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,280
These are soon.

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,160
That's no problem, right?

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,520
No, I just thought you'd want
a proper celebration.

49
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,800
No. Most important for me is that
we become us, that it happens.

50
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,880
-I'll take a look.
-Don't take too long.

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,480
Bye.

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,240
I need to look at this computer.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,160
You'll have to move me, then.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
Jesus, it was a joke!

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,120
Has Werner forbidden those too?

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,640
-No...
-Svante, you old fox.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,160
Welcome, Börje. How was your trip?

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,640
-The Champagne's in the room.
-Thank you.

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,440
We can always trust you guys.
Say hi to Werner.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,560
There will be more, trust me.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,400
That's our most generous guest.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,040
How often do they come here?

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,080
Börje's here
around three times a year.

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,000
His company varies.

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Keep him in a good mood
and don't ask questions.

66
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
There, ladies first.

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
-Hi.
-Hi.

68
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,160
-Sit down.
-Stop it.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,640
What? I'm a hotel director now.

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay... right, so...

71
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,480
I've thought about
our collaboration.

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,280
I don't think we should stop
at the travel expo.

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,200
No? Were you thinking of something
in particular, or...?

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,520
Aksel is right, we have
very different kinds of guests.

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
But that doesn't mean our guests
wouldn't be interested

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,720
in your spa treatments.

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Or that a guest from Mistral
wouldn't come here for a drink.

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,040
No, that's true. We could have
an offer at check-in.

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,800
-Exactly.
-Or even on our website.

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,840
Yeah, even better.

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,360
-Hi.
-Hi.

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,200
-Something to drink?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,520
We have to provide something.

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,360
How does Julie like her coffee?

85
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,240
She has a tiny splash of coffee
which she drowns in hot milk,

86
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
and has the nerve to call it coffee.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Great! I'll get it.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,200
Thank you.

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,080
What?

90
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,800
I don't know if this is
such a good idea.

91
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
But you just said the opposite.

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,840
But doing it together, you and I.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,480
I should maybe do it
with Petra instead.

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,720
To start with, she's not even here.

95
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,520
No, where is she?

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,720
Off sick due to being offended,
as far as I know.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,240
And secondly, you know it's just you
and I that I trust here.

98
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,640
There. We're out of milk,
unfortunately.

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
No problem.

100
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
Great!

101
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't, you're embarrassing me!

102
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,320
-She said yes!
-Who?

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,720
Rebecca.
We're meeting here tomorrow.

104
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,560
-It's not the first time.
-It'll be different. I know.

105
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
-How long did she take to reply?
-A day or so.

106
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
Three.

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
And you answered in three seconds
again? Right?

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
-She knows where she has you.
-She does not.

109
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,280
She doesn't know
that you and I are together.

110
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,240
Now you've totally lost it.

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,400
When we come, act like my
girlfriend, and she'll get jealous.

112
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,960
-No!
-You're a great actress!

113
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,040
-Never.
-Please.

114
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,320
-Please?
-This is the worst idea ever.

115
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,520
So you'll do it?

116
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You're the best! Thank you so much!

117
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,600
You haven't heard from her today.

118
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,600
Are you worried?

119
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,640
She wanted a break,
so I'm giving her one.

120
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,960
If you hear from her,
can you ask her to call me?

121
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,400
She said she'd help
with Rebecca's mother.

122
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
Okay, I know
this is important to you,

123
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,840
but Petra and I have enough
of our own shit to deal with.

124
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,880
I know. I'm sorry.

125
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,640
-I was thinking about Shirin...
-Yes?

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,000
she drew a line with you.

127
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,960
-Yes, you could say that.
-It was very childish.

128
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,600
-Yeah, we'll let it go.
-Did she overreact?

129
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah, truly.

130
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
A wall for stock, at least,
or I'll go mad.

131
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,080
-MEET TOMORROW AT THE HOTEL?
-YOURS OR MINE?

132
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,720
The landlady she said
we can repaint.

133
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
As long as we paint it back later.

134
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,920
Sure, we can return it to the
world's grossest house.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,840
YOURS

136
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,400
-Hello?
-Yeah, sorry.

137
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
Did you have to mess
with Julie today?

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
-It was a joke.
-She didn't think it was funny.

139
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,200
Oh, poor her.

140
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
You're not usually like this.

141
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,520
Am I being difficult?
I did move here for you.

142
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,200
Are you going to use that
every time I say anything?

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Do you have to work with Julie?

144
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,000
Of course I don't have to.
But I want to.

145
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,680
Why?

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,320
I thought you wanted to work
in the bar, not management.

147
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
Promise nothing's happened
between you?

148
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
I don't want to be humiliated.

149
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
You won't be humiliated.

150
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,640
I promise.

151
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,720
-Okay?
-Okay.

152
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,240
Now, let's see...

153
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Let's get this done.

154
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
-Yes?
-That one.

155
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
-Hey.
-Hi.

156
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,760
I really appreciate this.
I can't wait any longer for Petra.

157
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,360
You could have asked me first.

158
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,880
You know that.

159
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,520
Shirin asked yesterday if anything
had happened between us.

160
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,280
I said no.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,760
Have you told Aksel?

162
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
No. I haven't.

163
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,840
It didn't mean anything. Right?

164
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,400
No, it didn't.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,640
Wait a moment.

166
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,800
-I hope breakfast was good.
-It was perfect.

167
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,200
Great.

168
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,000
My wife might call.

169
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,600
But if she does, I'm unreachable
right now. Okay?

170
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,520
-Your wife?
-Yes.

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Of course. What's her name?

172
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Elisabeth.

173
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,040
-Do you have the same last name?
-Yes, of course.

174
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,320
-What if it's important?
-Just do as I say.

175
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,560
Save your cash.
You never know when you'll need it.

176
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,920
This is The Beach Hotel's data.
Our cloud, you could say.

177
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,160
So weird, but when I got in this
morning, the cupboard was open.

178
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,760
What? Was anything missing?

179
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,720
No, not that I could see.

180
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Okay. When would this Jessica
have worked here?

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,160
Around 2000, I think.

182
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,400
-Okay.
-There, yes.

183
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
What's going on here?

184
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,360
I didn't know you were
coming around.

185
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,680
No, I didn't think I needed
an invitation.

186
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
I've heard you two are planning
a collaboration between the hotels.

187
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,240
Yes, that's why Julie's here.

188
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,040
I can tell you that Egil would
never have agreed.

189
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,080
Nor you. Right?

190
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,280
Good. So we know
where we have one another.

191
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,200
And you understand it's unthinkable.

192
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
I haven't said that.

193
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,560
Excuse me, Sebastian.

194
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,120
This information is not
for your eyes.

195
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Regardless what Sebastian has
promised you.

196
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,680
I'm just looking for a person who
has been employed by you.

197
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,440
-Right.
-Come on, Dad.

198
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,720
-Okay, what's their name.
-She worked here quite awhile ago.

199
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,440
Jessika Adolfsson.

200
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,040
No, no one of that name
has worked here.

201
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,560
You wouldn't consider
double checking?

202
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,880
No need. I know exactly who has
worked here since the beginning.

203
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,840
Right, Sebastian?

204
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,800
It's crazy, but it's true.

205
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,840
Please, I really need to know.

206
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,840
You've got the information we have.

207
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,360
Whoever says Jessika Adolfsson has
worked here is lying.

208
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,960
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Werner said you need help.

209
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,480
What could that be?

210
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,440
I think he wanted to know
about tax breaks for the studio.

211
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,320
-Was that it?
-Yeah.

212
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,680
-That's fairly easy.
-Super! Then it won't take you long.

213
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
So you've got your own company?

214
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,040
Of course. My last yearly financial
statement is in the office.

215
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,440
But I'm a bit busy right now.
You'll find it easily.

216
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,640
We'll give her a chance
to explain. Right?

217
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,080
Sorry, I didn't know it was
a board meeting.

218
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,520
-It isn't.
-No?

219
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,280
Have you thought of more I can do
for the hotel?

220
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Why did you lie? A Jessika Adolfsson
has never worked at The Beach Hotel.

221
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,680
-Why do you say that?
-I checked with Werner.

222
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,000
Did you check up on what I said?

223
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,920
Yes. Did you trick my dad too?

224
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,240
How did you make him believe
you were his daughter?

225
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Come on, have you totally lost it?

226
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
Is there even a Jessika?

227
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,080
Of course.
Werner will have to check again.

228
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,920
It's not necessary.
He has no memory of her.

229
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,760
No memory? Didn't he check
an archive or something?

230
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
No, he remembers all his employees.

231
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
That actually sounds a bit weird.

232
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,600
-Sebastian confirmed it.
-What's he got to with it?

233
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,320
It's not me who has to explain.

234
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,880
So you'd rather believe an old man
who always hated your dad?

235
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,040
Werner didn't just inherit
half my hotel.

236
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,080
I have no reason to believe you.

237
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,120
Of course.
Because you're so superior.

238
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,680
You have no evidence!

239
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,040
Your dad lied for you,
and you're making me the villain!

240
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,240
-Why lie about your mum?
-I'm not!

241
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,640
She said she worked at the hotel,
now she's dead! What should I do?

242
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,120
Can we just calm down? Hmm?

243
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,920
Julie, I have to agree with Rebecca.

244
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,760
We can't trust what Werner
has said.

245
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,920
Okay... But we have to get
to the bottom of this.

246
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
Did you know he was married?

247
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,000
His wife's name is Elisabeth.

248
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,960
-That's private.
-That he's sleeping around?

249
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,520
Börje is a regular.
It's not our business.

250
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,560
So if his wife calls, we lie?

251
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,480
Call me old-fashioned,
but I want the guests trust us.

252
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,280
-I think it's weird too.
-You defended her.

253
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,520
No, I didn't.
You didn't have enough proof.

254
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Werner said
she'd never worked for him.

255
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,480
Why would Werner,
of all people, lie?

256
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,240
Or Sebastian, for that matter.

257
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,120
Do you think Egil would have
put Rebecca in his will

258
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
if he wasn't convinced
she was his daughter?

259
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,160
There's still too much
she's not telling us.

260
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,120
Wonderful, right?

261
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,560
I baked it for you
to say thank you for the advice.

262
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,960
-Thanks.

263
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,680
Aksel has been thoughtful enough to
ask about my plans for the future.

264
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,800
Now I know.

265
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm going to really dive into
my passion.

266
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,280
-Great.
-And that is...

267
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,400
Cooking, of course.

268
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,360
I've always dreamt
of a little cookbook.

269
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,960
How nice that you've started
giving career advice.

270
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,160
I think I'll go photograph it
outside.

271
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,440
I was just trying to help.

272
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
WELCOME. WAIT TO BE SEATED.

273
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,960
She'll be here any minute.
You have to practice!

274
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,560
Isn't it enough that I'm here?

275
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,320
Are you really going to wear
that jumper?

276
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,840
It's my favourite!

277
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,040
What will we do?
What's the plan?

278
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,800
No clue. It was your idea.

279
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,800
How do you usually act
with boyfriends?

280
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,720
-That's none of your business.
-You should act quite jealous.

281
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,720
Show that you're mine, you know.
Sit on my lap!

282
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,320
-Am I five years old?
-We have to at least touch.

283
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Like this. Give me your hand.

284
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,080
Come on.

285
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,040
REBECCA: SOMETHING'S COME UP.
LET'S MEET ANOTHER DAY.

286
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,760
You know what? Forget it.

287
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Good.

288
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,280
I did these two last spring.

289
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,160
Eh... What are they?

290
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,760
What do you think?

291
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
What do I think?

292
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,520
It wouldn't be hard to get
an exhibition together soon.

293
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,800
Have you contacted a gallery?

294
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,840
I've got a better idea.

295
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,840
The hotel.

296
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,360
-I don't understand.
-Have you ever had an exhibition?

297
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,280
No. There's already
art on the walls.

298
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,200
I don't know if I'd call it art.

299
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,120
I already know where this would
hang. It would be sold in no time.

300
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,800
Not to our guests, I don't think.

301
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,920
Why not? All big hotels collaborate
with artists.

302
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,040
-You don't like them.
-I do! If it's up to me, then sure.

303
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,280
Okay, then we'll do it.

304
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,200
But it's Sebastian
who has to make the decision.

305
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
So you'll have to ask him.

306
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,640
Okay. I'll do that.

307
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,640
Mm... Good.

308
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,160
Do you like married men?

309
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,320
The hotel will make sure your visit
isn't coloured by this.

310
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
We'll provide room service.

311
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,600
I did it in solidarity
with your poor wife.

312
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,000
Thanks, that's enough.
The whole stay is complimentary.

313
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,600
I'll never come back here.

314
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,600
I'll tell all my friends
not to set foot here again!

315
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
Good, we'll avoid even more
unfaithful swine.

316
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,520
It's time for you to go to lunch.
I'll handle this.

317
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
Börje, I'm truly sorry.

318
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,720
I like it. Beautiful composition.

319
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,080
It isn't of anything. The guests
will be confused and Vendela upset.

320
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,040
I'm sure she's had critique before.

321
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,320
Of course.
In galleries with their audiences.

322
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,480
Our guests want to swim
and have fun.

323
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,640
This will make them
scratch their heads.

324
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,840
-Okay, well...
-No, do as I say.

325
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,680
I don't want Vendela to be hurt.

326
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,840
-You need to give me something too.
-Sure. What?

327
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,360
Collaboration with Mistral.

328
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,000
-Unthinkable.
-You can choose.

329
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,680
Vendela's paintings in the lobby

330
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
or let me explore something
that could help the hotel.

331
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
Don't you see you're being used?

332
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
What will it be?

333
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Say no to Vendela,
but not too harshly.

334
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,160
Hey.

335
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,680
Why didn't you reply to me?

336
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
Something came up for me too.

337
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,640
Are you mad?

338
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,720
Okay, sorry. But it was important.

339
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,120
Okay, if you say so.

340
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,360
Come for a swim tomorrow after work?

341
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,080
-Okay.
-Good.

342
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,120
See you then.

343
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,000
-There you go.
-Thank you.

344
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,560
Werner said I should contact you.
I couldn't wait.

345
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,560
So what do you think
of my suggestion.

346
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,760
I'm sorry, Vendela, but...

347
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,920
I have to say no, unfortunately.

348
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
Why?

349
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,400
I just don't think it would be
a good look.

350
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,440
The founder's wife-to-be exhibiting
at the hotel.

351
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,800
Isn't the idea
that it's a family hotel?

352
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,400
I won't force guests
to buy anything.

353
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,600
Aren't you as tired as I am of
the coastal landscapes in the lobby?

354
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
You know what?
Come with me to the studio.

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,480
I've already seen it.

356
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,040
When?

357
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,000
With Werner?

358
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,240
Okay, I really like your art.
I mean it.

359
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,960
But I don't think
the hotel is really ready.

360
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,680
Werner isn't ready, you mean?

361
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,520
I don't think we're helping anyone
by letting him decide everything.

362
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,120
You're probably right.

363
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
It's nice you dropped by,
but I'm a bit busy.

364
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,560
I understand. See you.

365
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,360
There you go. Hope it's delicious.

366
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,000
I hope so too.

367
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,360
It's good. You know your stuff.

368
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah, maybe.

369
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,600
I guess you're good at more
than just mixing drinks.

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,080
Excuse me.

371
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
-Do you need help?
-Yes.

372
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,880
But you seem pretty busy over there.

373
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
-No.
-You sure? Seems to be going well.

374
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,120
It's cool.

375
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,240
-How kind.
-No problem.

376
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,320
Hey, can I ask you something?

377
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,600
What do you think of Julie?

378
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,160
Pretty annoying.

379
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,160
Thank you. I really needed that.

380
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,640
-Take it easy.
-I'm fine!

381
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,000
-I've got it!
-Okay...

382
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,320
-See you tomorrow.
-Hey, wait a minute.

383
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,280
-I hope you're joking.
-What do you mean?

384
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,400
You're going to fire me
over that idiot.

385
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,880
No, of course not.

386
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,440
-Is he gone?
-No, he got an extra night.

387
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,640
With his wife or lover?

388
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,800
-Alone.
-Good.

389
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,200
That suits him.

390
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,040
Why did you ring her?

391
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,400
Because I know someone like him
will never change.

392
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,800
So it's better to know now instead
of being oblivious to the signs.

393
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,440
I wish that feeling on no one.

394
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,120
So, you have...

395
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,160
I'm so sorry, Lojsan.

396
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,840
Thank you.

397
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,040
See you tomorrow.

398
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,040
Hi, you've reached Petra.

399
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,440
Leave a message after the tone
and I'll ring back as soon as I can.

400
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,880
Hey. My wife...
partner has disappeared.

401
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,480
Two days.

402
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,120
We're not really living together
right at the moment.

403
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,120
But apparently she hasn't been at
work either and isn't picking up.

404
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,440
Can't you do something right now?

405
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,800
Okay, I understand. Thanks anyway.

406
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,440
It feels a bit unusual to meet
outside the office.

407
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,520
But now it's Sebastian's domain.

408
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,680
How do you think it's going for him?

409
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,760
He's got more left to learn
than I thought.

410
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,200
It's important he understands
what the hotel is.

411
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,920
What it represents.
Just like you do.

412
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,040
That's why I want him
to turn to you.

413
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,840
So you can help him into the role.

414
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,280
You want me to train him?

415
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,720
No one can do it better than you.

416
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,160
Should I do it before or after
Vendela's bookkeeping?

417
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,240
I haven't asked you to
do her bookkeeping.

418
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,280
I meant for you to keep an eye on
tax offsets and that kind of thing.

419
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,920
Werner, I have to ask you something.

420
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,480
Yes?

421
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,960
Was I ever considered as CEO?

422
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,320
You would have been a wonderful CEO.

423
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,520
I'm not so sure
Sebastian would listen to me.

424
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,600
What are you thinking?

425
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,920
Large withdrawals
have been made this week.

426
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,720
I don't know, Sebastian might have
just made a mistake.

427
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,880
Sebastian doesn't have access
to this account.

428
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,320
Only Petra does.

429
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
Is Julie on her way?

430
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,600
She's got a bit too much to do right
now so you'll have to settle for me.

431
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,320
How much has Julie told you
about our plans?

432
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,160
What's this?

433
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,640
You'd think he might be happy to
just talk about The Beach Hotel.

434
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,120
"We've always catered to
the needs of tourists,

435
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
unlike other organisations

436
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,240
in the area,
who desperately try to mimic..."

437
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,160
This is the old CEO talking,
not the new one.

438
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,040
But you understand we can't work
with a competitor

439
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,640
who talks about us like that.

440
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
We'll look like idiots.

441
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,640
Has Julie seen this?

442
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,920
What do you think?

443
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,600
-Hey!
-Shall we go?

444
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,280
Yeah. But would you be able to
help me with something first?

445
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,560
-Of course.
-I feel so clumsy,

446
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,160
but I left something at the hotel.

447
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,720
I quit in a bit of a hurry.

448
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,640
And you don't want to ask Svante?

449
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,320
Exactly.

450
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
-Of course I'll help you.
-You're the best.

451
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,800
That was fine, wasn't it?

452
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,720
Why didn't you say anything?

453
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,320
About the interview?

454
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,800
It was so long ago.

455
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,760
It only comes out once a year.

456
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,560
You didn't think to add
a word or two about Egil's death?

457
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,280
No, I didn't.

458
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,720
Do you think it's appropriate
for your fiance to work in the bar?

459
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
It's her choice.
I support her in it.

460
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Yes, but you're CEO.
It's not really fitting.

461
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,080
-It's hard to see myself as CEO.
-What do you mean?

462
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,000
Are you ever going to let me do
this job the way I want?

463
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,960
Of course, as long as you have
the hotel's best at heart.

464
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,240
Reject Vendela's paintings,
that was for the hotel?

465
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,280
Yes, and for her.

466
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,720
I think this was a mistake.

467
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,400
You're trying to get out of this.
You accepted the job, now do it.

468
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,320
I'd love to.
But in my own way, or not at all.

469
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,720
This isn't working.

470
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,640
I don't know what to do.

471
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,320
He works against me in everything.

472
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,640
Then quit, if it doesn't feel right.

473
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,920
-You think so?
-Yes, I think so.

474
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,760
I could move back to Stockholm
tomorrow, you know that.

475
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
What are you going to do in here?

476
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,640
You didn't see me, I wasn't here,
no harm done.

477
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,840
-Someone could come.
-Then keep watch.

478
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,560
Go!

479
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,440
-Why haven't you gone home?
-I... forgot something.

480
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,360
-What are you doing?
-I just... They just fell.

481
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,160
Fell?

482
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,720
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
SALTSJÖVIKS HOTEL JESSIKA ADOLFSSON

483
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,360
-Are you almost done?
-Quiet!

484
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,120
-Thank you so much.
-Are you sure they're ok like that?

485
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,200
No problem. I'll take them
straight to the hotel.

486
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,880
I read the article.
It was... interesting.

487
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,640
-This is great.
-It is! Just say if you want more.

488
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,040
-I definitely will.
-Super.

489
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,480
Two paintings sold on one day.

490
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,800
I think that's worth celebrating.

491
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,280
To Aksel?

492
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,680
Sebastian said no.

493
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,960
But then I thought... Mistral.
They're probably a bit more open.

494
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,680
-They're going to hang in the lobby.
-Okay.

495
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Darling, can't you laugh at this?

496
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
I think we should open
some bubbly,

497
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,600
and look at dates at Town Hall.

498
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,760
I've got a bit of a headache
so I think I'll have a rest.

499
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,160
I'm really sorry.
I had no idea about this.

500
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,480
Who even reads this?
Rubbish magazine.

501
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,680
When did you know you wanted
to take over the hotel?

502
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,920
I've always known,
since I was little.

503
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,440
And how does it feel now?

504
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,040
It wasn't meant to be like this.

505
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,920
I thought Dad would be here
to help me.

506
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,960
I usually have no idea
what I'm doing.

507
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
It really doesn't seem like it.

508
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,160
Every day I have moments when
I'm angry at him for being gone.

509
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,600
Let go of it all.

510
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,480
My dad won't let go.

511
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,960
He doesn't trust me.
And I definitely can't trust him.

512
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,120
When will I learn to stop
throwing myself into things?

513
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,880
That's what I love about you.

514
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,920
Dad's angry, Petra's angry.

515
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Shirin doesn't like it here.

516
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,880
Maybe I should leave
before everything goes to hell.

517
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,640
Is there anyone who wants me here?

518
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,400
You know there is.

519
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,320
Are you talking about Mum?

520
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,440
If I stayed for you...?

521
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,200
-We weren't meant to be here again.
-But we are. All the time.

522
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
Tell me why you want me to stay.

523
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,120
I can't.

524
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,040
-It will ruin everything.
-Let it, then.

525
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,440
-No.
-Julie...
