1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,400
As you know, Vendela's mother has
been living in Brittany for awhile.

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,000
Unfortunately, it's getting hard for
Mum to look after all this alone.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,800
So we thought we'd help her
by moving there.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,120
Do you feel ready to take over?

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,560
Of course.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,640
-What are you doing?
-Hey.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,760
The autopsy is finished.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,360
We found large amounts of Tramadol
in Egil's body.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,680
-Would you say Dad had enemies?
-What do you mean?

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,920
I found really weird,
threatening emails.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
Call me Lojsan, everyone does.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,960
How do you divide the housework,
you and your wife?

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,200
-I'm single.
-Really?

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,720
The child you help us have,
you won't be their parent.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,880
I've always regretted
not going with you.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,280
The new CEO will be...

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,480
Sebastian.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you for your time.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,480
No problem.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,000
You've read the autopsy report,
right?

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,640
-Yes, I've read it.
-Good.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,040
Marianne, you know Klara Söderbom
from the police?

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Hi, Marianne,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,880
Can you and I have a little chat?

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,280
About what?

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,880
I thought you could show me
where Egil kept his medicines.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,520
Sure. Come with me.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,880
THE BEACH HOTEL

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
You said no, right?

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
I said I'd think about it.

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
But that means no, right?

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,720
Darling, you've never said

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
you wanted to take over
your dad's old hotel.

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
It's not that old.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Don't laugh this off.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,040
No, okay. I haven't.

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
-It's always been Petra's dream.
-Exactly.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,200
You can't give up everything
you've built for this.

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,760
Your last campaign went so well.

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
You'll be able to take over
any client you want, soon.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Our life is there.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,920
Not here in Saltsjövik.

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,320
I've worked here
almost my entire adult life.

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Jesus, Sebastian was lucky
to have worked here over summer.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,200
Sure, but you can't
really think about it that way.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
How can that not play a role?

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I don't want to fight,
but I think you've made a mistake.

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,280
I know you've made a mistake.

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,440
We've been plodding along too long,
we need a new perspective.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,240
Yes, it wouldn't have been
a problem for me.

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,080
Petra, you are
an excellent hotel manager.

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,520
And I'd love to see you continue.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,040
What if I don't want to?

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,880
It doesn't matter what I want
because you always prefer Sebastian.

55
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay. This isn't about that.

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,520
-No?
-When did you last gamble?

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
-Ages ago.
-How long?

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,160
If I look at your phone's search
history, apps... what will I find?

59
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
It's under control.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,600
Okay, one mistake,
after an extremely stressful day,

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,760
that can't be such a big deal.

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Who told you?

63
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,520
You weren't going to tell me,
were you?

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,920
Don't you see
this is just like last time?

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't trust you. It's that simple.

66
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,160
It's not about my gambling, is it?

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
I never really had a chance.

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,200
You've always wanted Sebastian
to take over. Jesus!

69
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,640
-Is this group bookings?
-That's up here.

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Right.
Did you do any rostering yesterday?

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,200
I did a bit of rostering, yes.
You're on it.

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,920
-Hey.
-The stairwell light's fixed.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Thanks! Well done.

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,440
-It was just a loose plug.
-I appreciate that.

75
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,240
Initiative.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,840
You're the one who asked me
to look at it.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Yes, but still. Thanks.

78
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,600
While you're at it, look at the
lobby, I think it was flickering.

79
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,920
-Okay.
-Great!

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,320
-Hey?
-Yeah?

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,080
Trying to win points with me
through my son?

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
No, that would never occur to me!

83
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,000
I wouldn't mind.

84
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,680
-Hey! Welcome to Saltsjövik!
-Thanks!

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Thank you so much for your help.

86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
So, what happens now?

87
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,040
I'll confirm a few details,
and then...

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,640
I think we're done here.

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
-Again, I'm so sorry for your loss.
-What about the high dose?

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
Dad would never have made
that mistake.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,080
It was a stressful day, Julie.
He must have mixed up his pills.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,440
But you told me
he had total control.

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Well, we'll test these.
It's a routine measure.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,400
Wait! Look at this.
Someone was trying to blackmail Dad.

95
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay. I'll take a look at this.

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,400
That's enough, Julie.

97
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,360
We won't take up any more
of your time, Klara. Thanks a lot.

98
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760
Thank you.

99
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
Isn't it enough for you
that he's gone?

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,480
Do you have to let your paranoia
cause all this unpleasantness?

101
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,120
-Hello.
-Hey.

102
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Have you had a nice morning?
Pleasant and peaceful?

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,360
I don't know what's worse,
Swedish or French bureaucracy.

104
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,800
I think I've got what we need to
register the car when we get there.

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,920
How about you?

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm trying to get hold of Sebastian.

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,760
I see.
Maybe he needs some time to think.

108
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,120
You thought he'd say yes?

109
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,720
Do you know what I think?

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,640
-No.
-It's time for your kids to grow up.

111
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Realise they have you and the hotel
to thank for their comfortable life.

112
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
Do you think he doesn't want this?

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
He probably does.

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,880
But his girlfriend might not be
as keen to live in Saltsjövik.

115
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,920
But I'm not either, actually.

116
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,200
-No?
-No.

117
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
But you know, girlfriends,
they come and go.

118
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
They do not.

119
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,160
It felt totally natural, to give
them the family they dream of.

120
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,000
It's so generous off you.

121
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,680
They've waited long enough.

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
Excuse me, can you give me a moment?

123
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Of course.

124
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
Nice to see you're still here.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Who knows?
I might be stuck here forever.

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,520
Sebastian has been offered
the CEO position.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,760
And... I don't even know
why I told you.

128
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't even know you, but...

129
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know
what's going on right now.

130
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,800
Maybe it's fate.

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,560
It's probably best not to flirt
with more than one woman at a time.

132
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
The police are taking it seriously.

133
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,480
That there's something odd
about Dad's death.

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I know how I sound, but I...

135
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,800
I really don't think Dad would have
mixed up his medication.

136
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,720
Sometimes accidents happen.
It's that simple.

137
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,560
But why didn't he say
he was being blackmailed?

138
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,160
I don't know.

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
But I don't want you to drown
in this.

140
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,080
At risk of sounding
like I'm at work,

141
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,240
I think this is part
of your grieving process.

142
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,600
You're looking for something else
to focus on,

143
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,000
other than the grief.

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,080
You need space to be sad too.

145
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,640
Hey? Don't you?

146
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
Yeah, maybe.

147
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,720
So, will you send me
an invoice later?

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,760
The first conversation is free.

149
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,960
Sorry, I'm just going on
about myself.

150
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,720
No, it's fine.

151
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,760
How are you?

152
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,160
Well... we're struggling on.

153
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Or, I guess it's mostly me.

154
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,360
I think it would be easier to be
a single mother right now.

155
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,920
I don't think so.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,880
You and Aksel will probably have
quadruplets before we even have one.

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,040
ENTRANCE

158
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,520
First-class service around here,
hey?

159
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
I thought I'd have a coffee.

160
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I think my boss has got a crush
on my mum.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,640
Gross, right?

162
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,440
What does she say?

163
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,600
We haven't really discussed it.

164
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,920
-Is he harassing her?
-No, no.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,320
It's more the way
they laugh together and...

166
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,160
No, I don't want to talk about it.

167
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,960
Do you know much about
connecting speakers?

168
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,360
A bit. Why?

169
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
I want to connect my TV
to my wireless speaker,

170
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,200
so the whole apartment is like
a cinema.

171
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,680
Nice.

172
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
I think I could try to help.

173
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,400
-Really?
-The day after tomorrow.

174
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm free in the afternoon.

175
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,680
Perfect!

176
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,640
Hey.

177
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,240
-Did you plan this all by yourself?
-Yes.

178
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,280
Why didn't you talk to me?

179
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,080
You've been so busy with the police.

180
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,200
Not too busy to plan
my own father's funeral.

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,560
This song you want played
at the end, for example.

182
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,960
Yes?

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,000
I just don't see my father
in any of this.

184
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Have you ever considered your father
might have changed when he met me?

185
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,880
If you had your way, Julie,

186
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,360
you'd erase mine and Egil's life
together.

187
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,120
-Like it never happened.
-Not everything is about you.

188
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,600
-Julie speaking.
-Hi, Julie. It's Klara.

189
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,080
Hi.

190
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,600
We found nothing out of the ordinary
in Egil's medication,

191
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,880
so we consider this case closed.

192
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,160
But what about the emails?
The blackmail?

193
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,400
We can't trace them.

194
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,480
And I'm sure if Egil had been really
worried, he'd have contacted us.

195
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,320
So you're not going to do anything?

196
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,560
We have no reason to take
this investigation further.

197
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,600
We can't even prove
there's been a crime.

198
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm sorry, Julie.

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,280
Right. Thank you.

200
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
Nice of you to come so quickly.

201
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,320
I just needed to move a meeting.

202
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Werner said you had some questions
about the house in Brittany.

203
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,840
-I wanted to see if I could help.
-So nice of you.

204
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,080
Have I understood right
that Werner will buy the house,

205
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,200
but it will be under your name?

206
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,080
Yes, that's the plan.

207
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,320
French tax laws, apparently.

208
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,920
I don't know much about
that sort of thing.

209
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
-You like helping Werner, don't you?
-It's my job.

210
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,120
And he really appreciates it,
I know he does.

211
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,960
Are you disappointed he's leaving?

212
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,400
It was a bit unexpected,
it's not like Werner.

213
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,520
Would you rather he stayed here...
with you?

214
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
No, that's not... We've never...

215
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,560
We work together.

216
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,440
Calm down, I'm just joking.

217
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,000
Something's missing.

218
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,680
I don't think so.

219
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
There's land as well, right?

220
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,880
-Yes.
-This is just building designation.

221
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
Right. I must have left it in there.

222
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Wait here, I'll be right back.

223
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,840
Hey! Hello there. Do you have time
for a little coffee?

224
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
Not here!

225
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,400
It wouldn't look good to the guests.

226
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,120
Okay, a little one.

227
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,600
It could taste better.

228
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,080
I'm used to it.

229
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,760
Come over and try my coffee.
You'll know what I mean.

230
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,200
There's a policy here at the hotel

231
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,320
that I haven't mentioned yet.

232
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,360
-It's important.
-Okay?

233
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,080
Employees aren't allowed to have
relationships with one another.

234
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,040
Who came up with that idiotic rule?

235
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,800
Werner.

236
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't think it's idiotic.

237
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,040
It's there to help avoid conflicts
at work.

238
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,480
Right. And you've always followed
that rule?

239
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Yes... It's Werner's oldest rule.

240
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,400
Werner's oldest rule,
it must be important.

241
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,440
Fun guy, that Werner.

242
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,400
I thought I'd steal some sheets
from you.

243
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,920
Sure, but you'll have to get me
some more later.

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
Yes, boss.

245
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,960
I wanted to ask you something.

246
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,360
-What's that?
-Could you take my rooms later?

247
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,360
Are you going to sneak away again?

248
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,240
-I'm going to a funeral.
-Egil's?

249
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Yeah.

250
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,920
-Did you know him?
-Please, Lukas.

251
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,840
It's important.
It would mean so much to me.

252
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,280
You'll have to ask Svante too.

253
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,240
If it's okay.

254
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,000
Of course.

255
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,560
Okay.

256
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
See you later, then.

257
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,240
Dad liked these.

258
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,200
This is wrong.
I shouldn't go to his funeral.

259
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,600
What is it?

260
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,080
The police are closing
the investigation.

261
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
Marianne claims I'm paranoid

262
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
because I don't think
Dad's death was an accident.

263
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,160
Sometimes we see patterns

264
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
because it's easier to accept.

265
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
So you don't believe me either?

266
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,280
Darling, I'll support you
no matter what.

267
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,720
Hey? You know that.

268
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,080
But right now,
it's about your father's funeral.

269
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,440
Okay?

270
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,200
Hey.

271
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,360
I had a nice time yesterday.

272
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,160
I can only agree.

273
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
-There you go.
-Thanks.

274
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,360
But today's the last day
of the conference.

275
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Of course.

276
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,680
But is it your last night
at the hotel?

277
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,760
That's very tempting.

278
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,560
-But I should go...
-To your family.

279
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
Exactly.

280
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,400
But who knows? Maybe I'll see you
again at the next conference.

281
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,400
Yeah, you know where to find me.

282
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
Have a nice evening.

283
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,800
-What are you doing here?
-Everything's ready.

284
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,160
Do you want Thai or pizza later?
My shout.

285
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
-You forgot.
-No... I just...

286
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,400
-I thought we...
-It's fine.

287
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,080
No, I have work in the afternoon.

288
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,760
-Okay.
-You don't like when I skip work.

289
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,480
No, that's true.

290
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,200
I can come by tomorrow
and do it then.

291
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,080
It's fine. I'll sort it out.

292
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,800
-Lilja...
-See you.

293
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Come on! Lilja!

294
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,240
-Where's Shirin?
-She's got a headache.

295
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,200
She didn't really know Egil so...

296
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,120
She's angry with me.

297
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,520
As well.

298
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,160
You told Dad I gambled again, right?

299
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,800
I haven't said a word.

300
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,400
-You have to believe me.
-Nobody else knows.

301
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,560
I don't know why he did this.
I didn't ask to be CEO.

302
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,200
No, of course not!

303
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,040
Everything lands in your lap,
even what you don't want.

304
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,480
What do you want me to do?

305
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
Say no, obviously.

306
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,680
Hey, listen.

307
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm accepting the job...
Look at me.

308
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,640
Then we can work together.

309
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,560
After six months, I'll move back
home and you take over.

310
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,320
Why would that make a difference?

311
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,880
If Dad sees us working together,
he'll let go more easily.

312
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,960
He'll notice you know
the hotel better than me.

313
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,560
So you're prepared to stay
in Saltsjövik half a year?

314
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
Why?

315
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,120
Stockholm will always be there.

316
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,560
I like it here.

317
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,760
Is that you're only reason to stay?

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Dad will never agree to it.

319
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,760
He doesn't have to know.

320
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,240
Until it's time.

321
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,640
Okay? Let's go.

322
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,200
Come on.

323
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,240
Would you have liked to go?

324
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,400
Maybe.

325
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
But he wouldn't have
wanted me there.

326
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,800
Would you have forgiven him?

327
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,600
For tricking you out of the land
to build Mistral?

328
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
And stealing your wife?

329
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,160
He's gone now.

330
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
It doesn't matter anymore.

331
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,760
Okay.

332
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,160
Are you okay?

333
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,680
-Don't touch me or I'll break down.
-Okay.

334
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,800
What happened the other day...

335
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,440
It was wrong.

336
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,480
Wasn't it?

337
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,600
It absolutely can't happen again.

338
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,080
I know.

339
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,920
It's probably good that
you're going back to Stockholm soon.

340
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,080
How's the headache?

341
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,600
Better.

342
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm sure you know I've asked
Sebastian to take over the hotel.

343
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,360
He mentioned it.
I don't know if this interests you,

344
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,880
but things are going really well
for Sebastian in Stockholm.

345
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
Very well.

346
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,160
When do you think he'll get
an chance like this there?

347
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,920
To run a big company?

348
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,320
In 10, 20 years, maybe?

349
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,280
You haven't thought ahead that far,
right?

350
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,800
But you should.

351
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
I see you and Sebastian are serious.

352
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,280
And this will benefit you
in the end too.

353
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,480
You won't have the struggle we did
when the kids were small.

354
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,680
You can have kids right away
and still have a comfortable life.

355
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
We certainly haven't discussed
children yet, so...

356
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,680
I'm aware that Saltsjövik can seem a
bit paltry compared with Stockholm,

357
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,440
but this is Sebastian's home.

358
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,280
I think you should understand that.

359
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
I think it would be very nice
for Sebastian

360
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,080
to feel supported by you.

361
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
You think it's a bad idea?

362
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,320
It's not up to me, but...

363
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,200
I'm going to be a father!

364
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,480
But... is that how Petra
and Gabrielle see it?

365
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,960
Not yet. But I'm sure we can
come to an understanding.

366
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,360
This is my chance
to have a family too!

367
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,840
But you've never wanted one.

368
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
-You've been satisfied with your...
-My...?

369
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,600
More temporary connections.

370
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,120
Have you never wanted children?

371
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,280
Yes, I might have wanted that but
that's not how things worked out.

372
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,160
Imagine a little kid,
running around here, "Pappa!"

373
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, it sounds pretty nice,
actually.

374
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,600
Julie, hi.

375
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,000
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

376
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
Hi. Rebecca, right?

377
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,760
Yes. I just wanted to thank you
for the lovely funeral.

378
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,160
It felt really personal.

379
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,960
How nice that you thought so.

380
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,320
And you're beautiful.
Your dress is lovely... nice dress.

381
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,760
Thank you.

382
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,320
I just wanted to ask if...

383
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
it might be okay
if we could meet sometime?

384
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,840
Yeah, I guess so.

385
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,440
Right, okay, great!

386
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,920
-Then we'll talk later!
-Sure.

387
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,680
Bye!

388
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,360
-Who was that?
-I barely know her.

389
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,840
Shall we go?
Shirin's waiting for me.

390
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,280
-I saw you were talking to Julie.
-And?

391
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,920
Nothing. That's your business.

392
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,960
Good.

393
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,160
Six months?

394
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,560
-Hey.
-Hey.

395
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,840
How was it?

396
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,640
Nice.

397
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,080
But...

398
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,760
You know.

399
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,400
-Yeah.
-How are you?

400
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,720
Better.

401
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,280
Hey, I talked to Petra.

402
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,360
About the CEO position at the hotel.

403
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
You're thinking of accepting?

404
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,640
I have to.

405
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,480
Just for six months,
then we'll go home.

406
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,960
Six months?!

407
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,240
Darling, we can do this.

408
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,960
Okay?

409
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,040
-Together.
-Okay.

410
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,720
-Right?
-Yeah.

411
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Wait a moment.

412
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,080
I don't need to ask
where you've been, do I?

413
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,800
Is it a problem?

414
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,440
Lukas covered for me.

415
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Of course it's a problem when you do
the opposite of what I tell you.

416
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,560
Right, it won't happen again.

417
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,480
It does happen, all the time.

418
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,880
Can you tell me what was
so important about this funeral?

419
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,960
-It's none of your business.
-Honestly, Rebecca.

420
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,320
I don't know what to do with you.
You've had so many chances.

421
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,480
-If showed me I can trust you.
-Chances to do what?

422
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,040
I started as a cleaner here.

423
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,640
Just like you.

424
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,280
Do you really think everyone goes
around dreaming of being like you?

425
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,680
I think they see what rewarding
workplace they have, yes.

426
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,520
It's like any other shit job.

427
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,920
Then I really don't know why
you stay.

428
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,640
No, me neither.

429
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,240
I quit.

430
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,840
Julie.

431
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,480
Everyone seemed very satisfied
with the funeral.

432
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,240
But not you.

433
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
I just wish we'd have been able
to plan it together.

434
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,880
Dad was good at keeping us friends.

435
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
He was fantastic.

436
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,600
I want to try.

437
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,720
For his sake.

438
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,640
What can I do to improve things
between us?

439
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,040
Easy. Stay away from Sebastian.

440
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,800
-What?
-I saw you outside the church.

441
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,040
I don't know what you're playing at,
Julie.

442
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,760
But I won't
let you ruin his life again.

443
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
You know what I'm talking about.

444
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,640
If you hadn't dragged him out that
night, he'd not have been run over.

445
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,560
He's still in pain, you know.
He'll probably be in pain forever.

446
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,160
It was an accident.

447
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,760
It never would have happened
if it weren't for you.

448
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,800
He didn't take risks
before he met you.

449
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,720
Leave him alone.

450
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,280
He has Shirin now.

451
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,840
Hey. You're finished working.
Come with me!

452
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,320
Let's celebrate!

453
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,840
Shouldn't we wait?

454
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
How long?

455
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
Six months?

456
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,920
In six months, I'll be
far too pregnant to drink this.

457
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,400
Hopefully.

458
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,400
What if Sebastian doesn't
do what he says?

459
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,080
Stop it. Why wouldn't he?

460
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,880
He says I should trust him
but I don't know.

461
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,280
Someone told Dad
I've started gambling again.

462
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,600
Is that true? Have you?

463
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,440
No, of course not.

464
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,120
You're unbelievable.

465
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,320
-What?
-Then I know I did the right thing.

466
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,880
-You told him?
-I saw you!

467
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,440
And I gave you a chance to explain
and you didn't.

468
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,800
And now you're doing it again!

469
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,080
I was afraid of what the stress of
this CEO position would do to you.

470
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,120
How the fuck could you?!

471
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,480
There, I've emptied my locker.

472
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,240
-Anything else?
-I've written a reference for you.

473
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,640
It might be useful.

474
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,520
I don't think so.

475
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
Tell me you don't get like this
whenever someone quits?

476
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,320
It feels like a failure of sorts.

477
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,480
My boss at my old job was afraid
of conflict.

478
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,280
She wasn't like you at all. She was
happy to leave this stuff to me.

479
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,040
If you've got advice,
I'd be happy to hear it.

480
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,440
Maybe we could talk
over dinner tonight?

481
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,600
Like a work meeting? Nothing more?

482
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,200
Yes, boss. No rule-breaking, I know.

483
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,240
-Have you got a minute?
-Of course.

484
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,240
-I'd actually wanted to call.
-We've reconsidered.

485
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,360
Good, I've also had time to think.

486
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,400
I don't think you really understand.

487
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,800
I want to be part of
this child's life.

488
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,000
It's actually one of my demands
if I'm to help out.

489
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,880
We're not going through with it.

490
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,280
-What?
-We're not having a child.

491
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,160
You can't do this!

492
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,840
You have to at least explain
what I did wrong!

493
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,880
This has never been about you.

494
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,920
What about Gabrielle?
Does she feel the same?

495
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,320
Hi.

496
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,240
How do you know
you're being ghosted?

497
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,080
After a day, something like that.

498
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,480
Who are you texting?

499
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,320
Rebecca. She quit today.

500
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

501
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,720
-What will she do now?
-That's what I'm trying to find out.

502
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,720
Do you need help with the speaker?

503
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,160
It's fine. I sorted it out.

504
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,400
It wasn't that hard.

505
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
What are you doing tonight?

506
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,760
Not going home.
Mum's taken the boss home.

507
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,560
Seriously?

508
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,760
Want to watch a movie at my place?

509
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Absolutely.

510
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,240
Good. Deal.

511
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,200
Darling, about the hotel?

512
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,520
I'm not doing a long-distance
relationship, so you know.

513
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,640
But Bea from work has just separated
from her boyfriend.

514
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,360
I think she'd rent our apartment
for six months.

515
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,080
What? Did you think
I wanted to break up?

516
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,480
No, I thought it was unimaginable
for you to live in Saltsjövik.

517
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,680
Come on, I love you, Sebastian.

518
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,520
I want to live where you live.

519
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,000
Thank you.

520
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,200
But I refuse to live here.

521
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,600
It's not going to happen.

522
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,360
-We need a place of our own.
-Okay.

523
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Good.

524
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,960
-Where are you going?
-Julies.

525
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,640
Ah, mature.

526
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,200
I can't be near you right now.

527
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,880
You're the one who betrayed me.

528
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,920
You sabotaged my chances of getting
what I've always wanted.

529
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,520
What's that? Having a child,
or a fucking CEO job?

530
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,200
You and Martin can have a kid
together if that's all you want.

531
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,960
You don't get what you've done.

532
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,160
So you're really going to leave?

533
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,280
I can't deal with this any longer.

534
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,040
My last job was like an exercise
in chaos theory.

535
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,240
A colleague thought the hotel would
work better

536
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,080
without a bunch of guests
living there all the time.

537
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,680
What do you like most
about your job?

538
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,240
The people.

539
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,360
The guests,
and those who work there.

540
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,720
You don't like surprises, do you?

541
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,680
That depends. This morning, I had no
idea we'd be having dinner together.

542
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,240
I thought this was a meeting.

543
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I'm really glad you've started
working at the hotel, Lojsan.

544
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,480
Me too.
And rules are just rules, right?

545
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Thank you for a fantastic dinner.

546
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,360
Have you forgotten something?

547
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,560
Yes.

548
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,160
-Hey.
-Hey.

549
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,560
-Are you waiting for me?
-Yes. Here.

550
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,480
Still addicted to lattes?

551
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,600
What is it?

552
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,680
I thought you'd have left by now.

553
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,200
Well... It didn't work out that way,
despite everything.

554
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,320
Dad's asked me to take over as CEO
at the hotel.

555
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,480
And you've accepted?

556
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,000
So you're staying here?

557
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,760
-Yes.
-That's...

558
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,720
Sorry, I'm... shocked.
Do you want to be here?

559
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,840
Yes... I think it could be fun.

560
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,560
-Fun?
-Yes, fun.

561
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,640
That might sound absurd to you,
but you can have fun at work.

562
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,760
You have no idea what you're doing.

563
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,400
Don't say that.

564
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,760
I know one thing, at any rate.

565
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,520
All these old conflicts
with the hotel and all that...

566
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,880
They're finished.

567
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,800
Okay? I want them gone.

568
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,240
Shall we have a breakfast meeting
right now?

569
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,640
Talk it through?

570
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,600
I don't have time.

571
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm meeting the lawyer.
Dad's will, you know.

572
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Right. I get it.

573
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,920
Another time.

574
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,360
Okay?

575
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
Hey, sorry I'm late.

576
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,880
Welcome, have a seat.

577
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,440
Thank you.

578
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,400
I'll get to the point.

579
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,240
Egil changed his will in Marianne's
favour recently,

580
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,880
since de facto laws don't give great
protection for unmarried couples.

581
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,840
That's why he left the villa
to both of you.

582
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,800
So you're saying we're to continue
sharing the house?

583
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,520
Yes, but you can always choose to
sell your share to the other party.

584
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,720
And what about the hotel?

585
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,840
I have a letter here from Egil.

586
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,400
The last paragraph.

587
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,360
Julie, I understand if you never
forgive me for not telling you this.

588
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,120
I have another daughter from a short
relationship outside my marriage.

589
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,600
A daughter I chose to have
no contact with

590
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,240
to protect you and your mother.

591
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,720
I've lived my life in debt
to this child,

592
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,840
which is why I've decided
to give half of Hotel Mistral

593
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,200
to my daughter Julie Grip,

594
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,000
and the other half to my other
daughter, Rebecca Adolfsson.
