1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Let me welcome you
to Saltsjövik's Beach Hotel.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,800
Classic Werner.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,400
Egil is here.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,840
What are you doing here, Dad?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,200
You and Werner in the same room
is not a good idea.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,080
I came here to help you.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,520
I don't need help, so you can leave.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,680
Who is that Julie, really?

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,320
Still using that old trick?

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
Sebastian said
they're childhood friends.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
So, more than friends?

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,600
And with that, I'm leaving the CEO
position at The Beach Hotel...

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,960
Dad!

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Unfortunately his heart
couldn't handle the stress.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,200
It can't be true,
I was just in there!

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,640
There, Mum.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,760
I've tried reasoning with you,
but you clearly won't give up.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,040
I'll come to the party,
this has to end.

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,840
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,240
I'm sorry, I just had to check
something, quickly.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,760
You have no right
to barge into my bedroom like this.

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,880
I know.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,440
I know that. I just have to...
Did Dad take Tramadol often?

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,240
Definitely not.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
And be careful with those.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,720
So you don't think
he could have taken too many?

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,080
Why would he do that?

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,240
The doctor thought
that might be the reason.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,760
The doctor?

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,160
The doctor should have saved him.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One moment he's fine...

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,480
the next he isn't breathing.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm going to sue them!

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,160
Would you say that...

35
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Dad had enemies?

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
What do you mean?

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
I've found really strange,
threatening emails.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
From who?

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,240
I don't know. They're from an
unknown email address.

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,360
Egil had no enemies.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
He was a bigger man than that.

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,760
You know who wished him harm.

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,920
THE BEACH HOTEL

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,200
There's coffee.
We have to leave in ten minutes.

45
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Yesterday you barely wanted
to go back.

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm just a little curious
about my colleagues.

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
Ah. Any cute girls?

48
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,240
Stop it.

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
Who's that?

50
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,000
No one important.

51
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,400
Is it Dad?

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,880
That's good, right?
That he's getting in touch.

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,040
-Isn't it?
-One text, in two weeks.

54
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,840
-Maybe it isn't easy for him.
-Why do you defend him?

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
I don't.

56
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,240
I think everything
will work out in the end.

57
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,880
You think he'll come back?

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Why are we here then?

59
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,240
Not everything
is that black and white.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,560
No, let's make the best
of this situation.

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,800
Right, honey?

62
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,240
We might even have fun today,
who knows?

63
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,560
I've tried looking up the email
addresses the blackmailer used...

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,440
but there's no way to trace them.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,640
Whoever did it
knew what they were doing.

66
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,440
It's a good thing Egil
printed everything.

67
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,360
Otherwise we never would have known.

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,400
Maybe that's what he wanted?

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,720
What...

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,080
What do you want to do now?

71
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Do you want to take this
to the police, or?

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,240
Yes, I think so.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,200
Congratulations on your engagement.

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,320
I don't think I said it
the other day.

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,120
Thanks, yes, well,
some other things happened...

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,160
"Some other things."

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah, it's so horribly tragic.

78
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,360
Do they know the cause of death yet?

79
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,600
Yeah, the doctor thinks it might
have to do with his medicine.

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
That's right,
you drove Julie to the hospital.

81
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,240
Yeah, he was nice enough
to volunteer.

82
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,880
But maybe we should talk...
about something else.

83
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,520
We didn't have time to tell you
everything at the party.

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,640
Oh my God... you're not?

85
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,800
No, no. Petra!

86
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,080
-Petra.
-You're not getting a sibling.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,760
I'm suddenly sweating.

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,680
But listen guys, as you know,
or maybe you don't,

89
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,440
Vendela's mum, Inez lives,
since a while back, in Bretagne.

90
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,280
I had no idea.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,720
An amazing house,
right by the ocean. It's so nice.

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
But, unfortunately, it's starting
to get a bit hard for Mum

93
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,200
to take care of it by herself.

94
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,280
-So...
-Yes, so we thought we'd help her.

95
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
By moving there.

96
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
We'll simply buy the big house
and she'll live in the guest house.

97
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
I don't really understand...

98
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
I think you do.

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
Guys, that sounds amazing.

100
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,040
No, it sounds insane.

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh, Petra.

102
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,520
Dad, you haven't taken a week
of vacation your whole life.

103
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,200
What are you gonna do over there?

104
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,600
I've had an art studio there
for a long time.

105
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
Right, and while she's painting,
what will you do? Pose?

106
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
Maybe I will.

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,680
No, I'll think of something, we'll
think of something, don't worry.

108
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,560
Yeah, well,
I have to propose a toast.

109
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
Vendela...

110
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,600
you've succeeded in doing something
none of us has managed...

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,600
To get Dad to want to take it easy.
That's worth toasting.

112
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,760
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

113
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,320
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

114
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,720
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

115
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,920
Does this look good?

116
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Yeah, but Svante usually goes around
and checks everything.

117
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,600
-Svante?
-Yeah, our boss.

118
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,960
He's really pedantic
so he always does the last bits.

119
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,760
And he doesn't get annoyed?

120
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,240
People are so disgusting.

121
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,880
-What is it?
-I have to get out of here.

122
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,000
Now? We have several rooms left.

123
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
Yeah but maybe we could just
grab a quick coffee?

124
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,120
No one will notice.

125
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,040
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, come on.

126
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,240
So, when are you moving?

127
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,680
As soon as possible.

128
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,960
We've already started
sending things down.

129
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,640
There's no reason to wait,

130
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,080
we can sort out
the practicalities from there.

131
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
But what about the house here?
Are you selling it?

132
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,320
No I think we'll keep it. Unless
you're interested? Or you, Petra?

133
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
So you must have already decided.

134
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,560
Who's taking over.

135
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,960
Yeah, that's true.

136
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,080
What are you waiting for?

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,440
Will you tell us at the airport?

138
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
Mum.

139
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
Hi.

140
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
Hi, can we offer you anything?

141
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm sorry for your loss, Marianne.

142
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,600
-Are you?
-Yes.

143
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,720
It's your fault.

144
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,480
Excuse me?

145
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,120
I think we should leave.

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,280
You couldn't drop it, could you?

147
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,240
You just couldn't let us be.

148
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,520
Mum, you're just being unfair.

149
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,560
Petra, he doesn't need
you to defend him.

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,440
He's never needed anyone
but himself.

151
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,200
You're in shock, Marianne, you don't
really know what you're saying.

152
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,160
You can't belittle me anymore,
Werner.

153
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,840
I want to know how it feels?

154
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
To have another life
on your conscience.

155
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,920
If you're here to spread lies
and be rude, you can leave.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,520
Come on, Mum.

157
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,400
He cannot love anyone but himself,
you'll find that out.

158
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,400
Come on.

159
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,280
Yeah, well...

160
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
Well, what can you say?

161
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,560
-Do you feel better?
-Yeah, a little.

162
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,240
That job makes me panic sometimes.

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,920
What are you doing on the weekend?

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What is there even to do
in Saltsjövik?

165
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,320
How old are you?

166
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
Eighteen.

167
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,320
-In a few weeks.
-So, 17.

168
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,680
Then you can't miss the club.

169
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
-The club?
-Yeah.

170
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,280
The youth club.

171
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,160
Julie!

172
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
-Hi!
-Hi.

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm Rebecca.

174
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for your loss.

175
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
Thank you.

176
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,640
I just wanted to say that.

177
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm so sorry.

178
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
RIght, I have to go.

179
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,760
Who was that?

180
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
Julie Grip.

181
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,520
She's the manager of Hotel Mistral.

182
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,520
So it was her dad who died?

183
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Shit. And you know her?

184
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,600
No. I probably wouldn't say
I know her, but...

185
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Everyone knows who she is.

186
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,560
You can't be suggesting Dad had
something to do with Egil's death.

187
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,200
Right?
His heart just couldn't keep going.

188
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,400
I know you admire him
and everything he does.

189
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,240
I didn't know things were
that bad between you.

190
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,160
He's sabotaged Egil all these years.

191
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,920
Yes, but wasn't it fairly...

192
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,760
mutual?

193
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,160
That old conflict.

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,480
You don't know everything
about your father.

195
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,120
And what he's capable of.

196
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,760
No, so tell me.

197
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,520
My sweet son,
you think the best of everyone.

198
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Mum, if you have something to say,
I want to know.

199
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,840
I'm so tired, Sebastian,
I can't do this.

200
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,960
That's it... Come here.

201
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,520
How much can do I have to take
during one single family gathering?

202
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Werner didn't deal with that so
well, but he's probably right.

203
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,120
Marianne is in shock.

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
And then France?

205
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,040
France?!

206
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
I mean, Dad doesn't speak
a word of French.

207
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
That will make him popular.

208
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,120
-You don't think...?
-What?

209
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,600
That she's a gold digger?

210
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,120
Maybe you should talk to him
if you're worried, Petra.

211
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,520
Yeah, I will.

212
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,240
Or I'll let Tone do it.

213
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,120
And you feel ready?

214
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,040
To take over?

215
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,640
Yes, of course.

216
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,120
It's happening.

217
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,320
Everything we've longed for.

218
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,960
Speaking of, Martin will be coming
over to us soon.

219
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
Oh, is that necessary?

220
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,520
Yes, we should talk to him
before we take his sperm, right?

221
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,840
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,640
I came home with Mum.

223
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,760
She's asleep.

224
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
How are you feeling?

225
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
Fine.

226
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,600
Julie...

227
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
Your dad has just died,
you're not fine.

228
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
No.

229
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,040
Have you even sat down
since it happened?

230
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
I will later.

231
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
When?

232
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,880
I don't know.
Maybe after the funeral.

233
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,920
There are a thousand things
that need to be done now.

234
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,280
Hey, I know you want to be strong.

235
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,640
You can't just carry on like normal.

236
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,480
You know that, right?

237
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,600
Come on, let's go for a walk.

238
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,160
Hi.

239
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,600
-Nice top.
-Thanks.

240
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,440
-Do you like Marvel?
-The latest Batman was okay.

241
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
Are you completely uneducated?

242
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,680
I saw Rebecca.

243
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,120
Are you on a date?

244
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
No, we just took a break from work.

245
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,760
I think she's a bit down.

246
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Isn't this your first day?

247
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
Yes, why?

248
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
You're already slacking off.

249
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,880
Rebecca said it was okay.

250
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,120
Is she your boss?

251
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,240
Don't worry, I'm on top of it.

252
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,680
It doesn't seem that way.

253
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,080
Knock knock,
is this where you're hiding?

254
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,920
-Where are Lukas and Rebecca?
-I have no idea.

255
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,440
I'll call them.

256
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,800
Guests will be
in this room in an hour.

257
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,040
I'll help you.

258
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,520
I can't get in touch
with Dad's doctor.

259
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,760
And I have to go to Mistral and talk
to the staff about the future.

260
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,040
Hey.

261
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,480
Can't we just forget
about all that for a moment?

262
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Shall we go down to the beach?

263
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,320
I haven't been there for ages.

264
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,040
It hasn't changed.

265
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
Nice to hear.

266
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,520
-The shortcut?
-Of course.

267
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,200
What the hell are you doing?

268
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
-That was fucking close. Idiot.
-What the hell.

269
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Okay. It's okay.

270
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,320
Maybe we shouldn't have
crossed like that.

271
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
-I wasn't thinking.
-It's okay.

272
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,360
Hey, come on.

273
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,760
It's okay.

274
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,880
You're fast.

275
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,000
This is where I started
once upon a time.

276
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,680
As a cleaner.

277
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,880
Is it just as neat and tidy
at your place?

278
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,080
-What do you mean?
-How do you divide housework?

279
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,720
You and your wife?

280
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,160
I don't have one... I'm single.

281
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Really? Are you separated too?

282
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,800
No, nothing like that.

283
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,480
It... just hasn't worked out
that way.

284
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm just surprised.

285
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,840
So, what do you do
when you're not working?

286
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,280
There are often things to do
at home too.

287
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,400
Make the rosters
and that sort of thing.

288
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,080
Fun.

289
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,120
And then I help out with the soup
lunches down at the Sailors' Home.

290
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,360
Lunch for the lonely.

291
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,680
Mostly pensioners, you know.

292
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,880
They never get out to meet people...

293
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,120
so we organise lunch
and some entertainment.

294
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,120
Something to brighten up their day.

295
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,360
It's nothing big, but it feels nice
to give something back.

296
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,880
Throw?

297
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,240
I'm just babbling on.

298
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
I haven't asked you about yourself.

299
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,200
How long have you danced bugg?

300
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,360
You wrote about it on your CV.

301
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,120
I think there's a group
down in Town Hall.

302
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
You should look them up.

303
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,760
I'll do that. Thanks for the tip.

304
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,840
It feels like I was here
just the other day.

305
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,520
Hello?

306
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Sorry. On the road back there,
it was terrifying.

307
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Hey, come on. It wasn't a big deal.

308
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,880
I feel grateful sometimes.

309
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,840
I know how fast everything can be
taken away.

310
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Might as well enjoy life
as much as possible.

311
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
What? Was that a bit too much?

312
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,720
Maybe just a bit.

313
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Are you fully recovered?

314
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,680
Yeah, well...

315
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,520
I take painkillers sometimes
when my back gives me trouble.

316
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,720
-How often is that?
-I'm okay.

317
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,080
I have to get back to the office.

318
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
I'm going back to Stockholm soon.

319
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,240
I know.

320
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,560
Maybe it's just as well.

321
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,760
You've got a lot of questions.

322
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
Do you mind us asking
about your family?

323
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,360
Of course. Both my parents are
in the restaurant industry.

324
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
So it's in my blood.

325
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,800
That's not what I meant.

326
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,680
I was thinking illnesses
and that kind of thing.

327
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Is there anything hereditary?

328
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,160
Well, my dad was crazy.

329
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,800
But not in that way.

330
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,800
I mean just that he had crazy ideas.

331
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,600
Especially during the holidays.

332
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,840
One summer,
we'd go on luxury cruise,

333
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,040
the next, we'd camp
in the middle of the forest,

334
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,720
in the driving rain, naturally.

335
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,640
So no illnesses?

336
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
No.

337
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,040
MISTRAL HOTEL AND SPA

338
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,640
-Hi.
-Hi.

339
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,120
Where have you been?

340
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,080
I've been trying to get hold of you.

341
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,000
Sorry.

342
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,640
I thought the doctor had been
in touch or something.

343
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,480
No, we just went for a walk.

344
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,240
Ah, you and Gabrielle?

345
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,560
No, by myself.

346
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,840
Oh, okay. You said "we".

347
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,760
Then I misspoke.

348
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
Where have you been?

349
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,360
-We took a break.
-For two hours?

350
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,360
This is completely unacceptable.

351
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
Don't you know how much trouble
you caused us all?

352
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,520
Was it your idea?

353
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,720
We needed a break, okay?

354
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,840
I've had a terrible day,
and I hope it never happens again.

355
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,640
Okay? I'm warning you.

356
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
-If this happens again...
-That's enough.

357
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,320
You're not responsible
for the staff here.

358
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,760
-I know that.
-And I deal with any warnings.

359
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,680
Excuse me for helping.

360
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,840
Next time,
you don't need to help at all.

361
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,120
If everything is so terrible here.

362
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,520
I promise.
This mistake will not be repeated.

363
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,520
Back to work. Now.

364
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,480
What's your problem?

365
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,040
Nothing.

366
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,880
We need to have a talk
before we take the next step.

367
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,560
There's something I want
to bring up first.

368
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,760
-It's important.
-Go on.

369
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,120
This child you'll help us have,
you won't be their parent.

370
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,360
No... But that's okay.

371
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Are you sure about that?

372
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,160
Yes... I've never wanted to
be a father.

373
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,840
Okay, then why volunteer for this?

374
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,480
Why help us?

375
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,680
There are two reasons, really.

376
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,800
The first is that I like you.

377
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
Okay, and the other reason?

378
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
I've always been carefree in life.

379
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,680
It's time to do
something meaningful.

380
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
Something significant.

381
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,840
So maybe it's worth going into that
booth with some overused magazine

382
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,600
and do the deed, so to speak,
and hand the jar over to a nurse.

383
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,720
I have to apologise
for the other night.

384
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,920
I interrupted just as
you and Vendela...

385
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,440
Right, no, gosh...

386
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,440
You couldn't have known.

387
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
And you had important news.

388
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
Marianne blames me.

389
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
What do you mean?

390
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,840
For Egil's death.

391
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,080
But that just happened. He must
have been sicker than we thought.

392
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
Yes.

393
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,760
The most important thing now
is that it doesn't look like

394
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,960
we're benefiting from this.

395
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,160
-If you get what I mean.
-Do what you think is best.

396
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
You or your successor.

397
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,640
I was actually wondering what
your thoughts were on that.

398
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,320
One thing first...

399
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
We're moving, Vendela and I.

400
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,120
Yes, to France. Petra told me.

401
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Welcome.

402
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,160
What do you think about that?

403
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,960
I don't know what to say.

404
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,240
I haven't known Vendela that long.

405
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,360
What do you want to know?
Or is it Petra who's wondering?

406
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Tone, we've known one another
for awhile now.

407
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,160
Do you think I'm someone who can be
seduced by one dazzling smile?

408
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,640
Come on.

409
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,320
She's not after anything.

410
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,240
In reality, she's the one with
money. Well, her mother, anyway.

411
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,120
Right, who you're buying
the house from.

412
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,400
Can I at least take a look
at that contract?

413
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Of course,
if that make you feel better.

414
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,800
Petra, in future,
you don't have to go through Tone

415
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,360
when it comes to family matters.

416
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Okay?

417
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,800
POKER

418
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,800
Hey, how was your bath?

419
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
What are you doing?

420
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,800
Nothing.

421
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,320
Darling... have you had a stroke?

422
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,280
Just tell me what you were doing.

423
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,600
Okay. I was just talking to Dad.

424
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,080
It wasn't pleasant.

425
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,600
I need a glass of wine.
Do you want one?

426
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,440
Where are my scissors?

427
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,080
No idea.

428
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,680
-Hey, Marianne?
-Yes?

429
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,120
Have you thought at all about...

430
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,160
about the future?

431
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,280
Where you'll live,
and that kind of thing?

432
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,760
What do you mean?

433
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,160
This is mine and Egil's home.

434
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,600
Yes, and mine.

435
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,720
I grew up in this house.

436
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,200
Aksel and I planned to start
a family here.

437
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,520
My husband has just died...
and you want to kick me out?

438
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
No, I didn't say that.

439
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,640
Just that this isn't going to work
long term.

440
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,440
You're the coldest person
I've ever met.

441
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,360
Have you no heart?

442
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Here. Can you leave, now?

443
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,320
Egil didn't want to see it,
but I saw it from the start...

444
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
how bad you are.

445
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
But I'm the one
who has to do it all

446
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,560
while you whine
about fucking scissors.

447
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,160
Can you leave now?

448
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,680
So?

449
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,120
What do you say?

450
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,800
It feels familiar.

451
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,760
That means positive,
in advertising language?

452
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
-I knew it.
-It's definitely not bad, but...

453
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,560
isn't it very similar
to previous campaigns?

454
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,760
Mm. Just how Dad wants it.

455
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,920
-And that's the main thing.
-You know how it is.

456
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,480
He's never been disappointed in you.

457
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,080
Sure he has. Many times.

458
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,560
He says if I gamble again,
I'll never take over.

459
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,040
So make sure you don't.

460
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,760
That's great!

461
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,640
There's the solution.

462
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,000
Petra...

463
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,640
I'm fucking done
if he thinks I've started again.

464
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,960
-No...
-Hey...

465
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,480
It'll be okay.

466
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,000
You make everything sound
so fucking simple.

467
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,240
I know. That's my superpower.

468
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,240
Listen.

469
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
I'll help you.

470
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,720
Okay?

471
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Okay.

472
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,040
With this too. If I may.

473
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,520
Do you want to?

474
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,320
No, don't think that way.
It's good you called to tell me.

475
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,960
So... thank you for that.

476
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,160
Great. Good. Bye.

477
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,720
I've called the removalists.

478
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,640
Already?

479
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,800
Mm. They're going to move your
things all the way to Bretagne.

480
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,520
The booking needs to be made early.

481
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,680
If you want to be helpful,
you can take these with you.

482
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm getting used to them.

483
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,200
Or I can set fire to them.

484
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
With you in them.

485
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,560
What do you think?

486
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,120
Fine.

487
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,600
Hello?

488
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,120
Where are you?

489
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,240
Sorry, Vendela. Sorry.

490
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,280
No, I'm just... thinking about
who should take over the hotel.

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,720
I thought that was decided.

492
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,480
No.

493
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,120
It's not that simple.

494
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,640
That's not how it sounded
when we made that decision.

495
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,040
Together.

496
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,640
I'm moving, Werner.

497
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm ready for this change.

498
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,360
The question is, are you stuck...

499
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,400
in that armchair?

500
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
You know what you want.

501
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,400
Yeah, should I not?

502
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,920
TONE

503
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,560
-It looks great.
-Thanks.

504
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,360
Hey, do you have a minute?

505
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm actually on my way out.

506
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,640
-What is it?
-I just talked to Mum.

507
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
She's freaking out.

508
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,160
I know, it didn't go well. But it
needs to be dealt with eventually.

509
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,120
Where we're going to live.

510
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,120
Why?

511
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,760
You've lived under the same roof
for years, it's been fine.

512
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,800
Are you kidding?

513
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,640
Marianne hates me.

514
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,680
-She always has.
-Of course she doesn't.

515
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
-She does.
-You're just different.

516
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,920
She's just lost...

517
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,560
I know.

518
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,440
You've also lost Egil.

519
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,880
But... can't you just try
to talk to one another?

520
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
Do you know how often I've tried?

521
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,080
It hasn't worked once.

522
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,080
She's never wanted anything to do
with me. That's just how it is.

523
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,520
I didn't know it was that bad.

524
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,000
How could you have missed that?

525
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,560
She sent you to Stockholm
just to separate us.

526
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,840
I don't mean you didn't go
of your own free will.

527
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,560
Maybe she's right,
that I'm cold and heartless,

528
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,320
and it's just as well that you left.

529
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Hey, Julie?

530
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,840
-I have to...
-Wait.

531
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
I've always regretted it.

532
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,800
That I didn't go with you.

533
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
I have to go.

534
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
I hope we see you again soon.

535
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,960
So...

536
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,200
I'm ready for your apology.

537
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,560
Are you serious?

538
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,560
You exceeded your authority.

539
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,120
Will you act normal again
if I say sorry?

540
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,720
I don't understand.

541
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,760
We had a really nice time yesterday,
we got quite close, right?

542
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,160
Yes.

543
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,640
Yes, but you thought it was
completely terrible.

544
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,840
That's what you told Lukas
and Rebecca.

545
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,120
How awful it was to work with me.

546
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,560
No, I said it was terrible
that you and I had to do their job.

547
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,760
Working with you was fun.

548
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
Alright.

549
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,920
So I was wrong?

550
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,400
Yeah, like 100% wrong.

551
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,120
Happens to the best of us.

552
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Even you.

553
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,440
By the way, I signed up
for bugg course. Thanks for the tip.

554
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,640
You're welcome.

555
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,320
Darling...

556
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,000
Are we celebrating something?

557
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,320
-Thank you.
-It's your favorite, right?

558
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
You're so sweet.

559
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,080
What did you do today?

560
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,480
Um... not so much.

561
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,000
I thought about trying out that yoga
in town but it didn't work out.

562
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,960
I'm just a bit stressed.

563
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,960
Saltsjövik feels so small.

564
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,520
Everyone seems so involved
with one another.

565
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,320
You're right.

566
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
It's just a lot of old shit.

567
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,400
Let's go home.

568
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,960
As soon as possible.

569
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,120
Yes, please.

570
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,040
SVANTE GAVE ME THREE EXTRA ROOMS
TOMORROW. I THINK I'LL BE "SICK".

571
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,840
Excuse me!

572
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,200
I thought you were at work.
I was going there now, actually.

573
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,720
-No, I'm done for the day.
-Oh, where are you going?

574
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,240
Home. I've got a studio apartment
around the corner.

575
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,040
Do you live alone?

576
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,320
Yes, when you work, you get paid,
and you can pay for things.

577
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,320
Like rent... Part of your education.

578
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,760
Right.

579
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,440
See you.

580
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,800
I CAN HELP YOU.

581
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,560
YOU'RE THE BEST!

582
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
As I said, the autopsy is complete.

583
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,520
We found large amounts
of Tramadol in Egil's body.

584
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,920
I have to ask, did you see
any signs that Egil was depressed?

585
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,520
No, Dad had his problems but I don't
think he wanted to kill himself.

586
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,960
No, but the Tramadol
he was prescribed

587
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,720
was 50mg for temporary pain.

588
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,240
We found signs he'd taken
at least three times that.

589
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,840
And during a short time.

590
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,000
He should have known better.

591
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,400
He did.

592
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,280
What Julie might not have
the same awareness of is that...

593
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,440
Egil was very stressed.

594
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,680
I had to help him keep control of...

595
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,400
most things, actually.

596
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
It doesn't surprise me at all
that he would miss his medication.

597
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,720
Petra came to me with a suggestion
for the hotel's marketing.

598
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,680
What did you think?

599
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Interesting.

600
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,040
Lots of new ideas.

601
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,400
I have to say,
it looked unexpectedly professional.

602
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,680
She just asked for some input,
but she did it mostly herself.

603
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,320
Do you think Petra would be
a good CEO?

604
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
Absolutely.

605
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,080
I don't want you to answer
as a loyal younger brother.

606
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,520
I mean it.

607
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,120
This job demands
everything you have.

608
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,920
If you lose focus,
it could go under.

609
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Petra couldn't be more focused
and keen for this.

610
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,960
She's dedicated her life
to the hotel.

611
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,160
Just like you.

612
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,320
She stayed here
when I went to Stockholm.

613
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,280
If she needs help, marketing
or whatever, I'll help her.

614
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,600
I'll always be there for the family
when you need me.

615
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,880
Good.

616
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,920
You were there for me.
After the accident.

617
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,240
You know I'm proud of you.

618
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,680
Hmm?

619
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,040
What are you doing?

620
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,080
First you say Dad was on top of his
medication, and now the opposite.

621
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
I don't know what
you're going on about.

622
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,320
Why did you change your story?

623
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,920
Leave me alone!

624
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,920
-Are we waiting for someone?
-One more.

625
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,120
Did you want me, Werner?

626
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,720
Absolutely. Come in. Sit down.

627
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:28,200
I know my move might seem to have
come up suddenly.

628
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,480
For some.

629
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
I know you know,
but I'll say it anyway.

630
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,840
I've dedicated my life
to this place.

631
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,560
And I can honestly say,
I never thought I'd be...

632
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,160
handing over the baton
to someone else.

633
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,360
You've decided.

634
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
This work demands loyalty...

635
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,840
devotion... clarity.

636
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,240
The decision hasn't been easy.

637
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,640
But I'm counting on you
to accept it.

638
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,120
Taking over as CEO, is...

639
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,480
Sebastian.
