1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,760
Petra was
the last one here yesterday.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,800
-She must have left this.
-Not like her.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,080
-No news from her since yesterday?
-She wanted a break.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,720
The sooner I'm married
the sooner I can divorce.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,720
Let's book the registry office.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,920
The other night mustn't be repeated.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
I've thought about
our collaboration.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,880
You realise we can't collaborate
with a competitor.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,880
You've withdrawn
substantial amounts.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,000
Sebastian doesn't have access
to this account. Only Petra does.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
-Will you help me with something?
-Sure.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,080
-Nothing's happened between you two?
-No, I promise.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm staying for your sake.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,880
-How did Egil and your mum meet?
-At the hotel.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,760
-What's her name?
-Jessika.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
The person who says

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,840
that a Jessika Adolfsson
has worked here is lying.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,080
You didn't see me.
I was never here. No damage done.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,080
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
JESSIKA ADOLFSSON

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Sorry, several days have gone by
and Petra is still missing.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,600
When will you do something about it?

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,360
It's not that simple.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,720
What do you mean?
That's what the police do, isn't it?

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,640
How was she when you last saw her?

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,320
Well, it's been
quite messy recently.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,560
In what way?

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,160
We've argued a fair bit.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Petra wanted a break,
so I moved out.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,520
So you two argued and you'd
moved out? That doesn't sound...

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,920
I don't care what it sounds like.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,880
Yes, we argued,
but she wouldn't just vanish.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,880
Or not answer messages or her phone.

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,640
But what caused her to want a break?
Tell me about the argument you had.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,600
That's not all there is to it.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,520
We argued, but she also
told me about a conflict at work

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,800
with her brother Sebastian.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,840
Do you know what that was about?

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,000
No, you'll have to ask him.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,880
Look, I'm sorry
to have to ask this question,

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,360
but considering your differences...

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,000
Is there a possibility that
Petra might want to hurt herself?

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,320
No. No, she'd never do that.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Are you sure about that?

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,000
THE BEACH HOTEL

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,560
Have you come
to have a go at me again?

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,840
The police are looking for Petra.

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,080
This is serious, Werner.
I can't get hold of her.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,600
No one has heard from her for days.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I know why she's staying away.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,200
So go to the police and tell them.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,000
I won't announce publicly that
my child has stolen from the hotel

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
in order to support
her gambling habit.

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Are you sure about that?

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Money is missing and she's missing.
What else do you need to know?

55
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,680
What are you going to do about it?

56
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,240
Nothing. This has happened before
and you know it.

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Everything always has to happen
on your terms.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,600
Marianne, you shouldn't let her
get you so agitated.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,400
She's in the wrong and there
will be consequences. Simple.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
Aren't you worried
about losing them?

61
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,080
They're your children.

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
What are you on about? What's
Sebastian got to do with this?

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,000
Is he doing well
at your beloved hotel?

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,320
Or is he about to leave it all
behind and go back to Stockholm?

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
I don't think so.

66
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
You really don't
feel any responsibility.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,240
Are you okay?

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,480
It's all a bit much at the moment.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I understand.

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,280
Why don't we just
forget about that collaboration?

71
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
What do you mean?

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,840
-What?
-Your opposition makes it difficult.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,640
Why did you meet with Sebastian
without asking me?

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,480
I don't trust him.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,960
I do and
you can't ignore me like this.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,720
Why is everything
always about Sebastian? Hey?

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,000
You've taken on
far too much since Egil died.

78
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,880
Let me look after you.

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,760
I don't need anyone
to look after me.

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,640
I don't know
if Tone has spoken to you.

81
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,560
-She did work here.
-Who?

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,880
Jessika Adolfsson.

83
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,000
You assured Julie that
she'd never set foot here.

84
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
Here's her employment certificate.

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,480
I just wanted to double check.

86
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
You don't know
everything about everyone.

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Petra has taken money
from the hotel.

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,400
You're not going to
report her to the police, are you?

89
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,880
I don't see the point in that.

90
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,320
Do you think she's gambling again?

91
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
I don't know.

92
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,960
Maybe she's ashamed of it.

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Maybe she's angry.

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,640
Let's not mention
that missing money.

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,160
It's better if we give her a chance
to come home and explain herself.

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,760
So the reason
for not reporting her missing

97
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,240
is not that you're worried
about her reputation?

98
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay, I'll leave
the decision to you.

99
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
What would you do?

100
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,000
I just want her to come back.

101
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,560
Yeah, me too.

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,680
You wanted me to help out?

103
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,840
With this? No, it's fine.

104
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,320
Only until Petra gets back,
of course.

105
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,600
I know you've said
you don't want me interfering, but

106
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
you can't do everything yourself,
yours and Petra's job.

107
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,600
That way you would have
a bit more free time as well.

108
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
To spend with Shirin.

109
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,120
Okay.

110
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Hey...

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,120
What's this? We never argue.

113
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,040
You're right. We never argue.

114
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,720
I've been thinking about
your birthday.

115
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,440
-I can't face having a party.
-No.

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,200
I know, but wouldn't it be nice
to hang out with a few friends

117
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,680
and just chill out for once?

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,440
-Would Gabrielle be up for it?
-I'll check.

119
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,240
She might enjoy the distraction

120
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,840
and having some people around.

121
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,720
Okay, just a small gathering.

122
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,560
I promise.

123
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,520
-Promise.
-Sure, sure.

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
-Okay?
-Fine.

125
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,520
So nice to see you back.

126
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,760
Thank you.
I really feel at home here.

127
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
You're a very sweet couple.

128
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,760
Thank you.

129
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,120
She always says that.

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
She's trying to
pair me with everyone.

131
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
Last year she suggested Britta
of the cold buffet.

132
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
-She's retirement age.
-Yes.

133
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,040
-Louise?
-Yes?

134
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,920
There's something
we need to talk about.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
Sure.

136
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,040
It can wait. I have to...

137
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,120
Just some stupid advertising.

138
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,240
You need to try to stay calm.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,040
-Like your dad?
-He's more worried than you think.

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,520
Julie!

141
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,960
I did find Jessika Adolfsson
in our archives.

142
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,440
Dad obviously
doesn't know everything.

143
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,160
-How long was she there for?
-About a year.

144
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
-Isn't that good news?
-I suppose so.

145
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,160
Come and sit down.

146
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
The food is getting cold.

147
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
Hi, Sebastian speaking.

148
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,960
I see. Today already?

149
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
No, I don't see a problem with that.

150
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,640
Okay, see you then.

151
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
Who was it?

152
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,400
It was the police.

153
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,160
They wanted me
to come to the police station.

154
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,440
I can't believe
how this has changed.

155
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
Any news about Petra?

156
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,680
No.

157
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,840
-Is it nearly finished?
-I think so.

158
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
Almost.

159
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,600
-Can I have a closer look?
-Sure.

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
You don't have to say anything.

161
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,040
Are you worrying about Petra?

162
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,400
You know the dates
for the registry office...

163
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, I completely forgot.

164
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,760
I just wanted to say
not to worry about that now.

165
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Let's wait for her to come home.

166
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,160
Does it bother you if I...

167
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,600
-If I stay for a bit?
-Not at all.

168
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,640
Right, one step down
and then one more.

169
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,080
Now you can look.

170
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,840
-Where are we going?
-Home.

171
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,440
At least for a few days. I've booked
a hotel, since we can't use the flat

172
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,840
and tomorrow we're going to Astoria.

173
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
Robin and Anja are coming
and a few more.

174
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
-I can't.
-You need to get away from here.

175
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,200
Me, too. We both need it.

176
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,720
-I can't. Not now.
-Why?

177
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,680
I'm going to the police station.

178
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,160
-It's about Petra.
-Talk to them and then we'll go.

179
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,520
I can't just walk away
from everything, don't you see?

180
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,000
No, I don't see that, since
you wanted to get away yesterday.

181
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm home-sick.

182
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,520
Aren't you?

183
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
Of course, but...

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,600
We don't belong in this backwater.

185
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,360
-What if I do?
-You'll give me right in six months.

186
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Regardless of when Petra gets back,

187
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,280
I'm not sure
if I should hand over the hotel.

188
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,920
-You promised me!
-Can we just leave this?

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,880
I only asked for one thing
and now you're ignoring that.

190
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm trying to manage this chaos.

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,160
Do you have to
complicate things further?

192
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,240
Here you go.

193
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,040
It looks like your mum
worked at the Beach Hotel after all.

194
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Do you have
all the proof you need now?

195
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,720
There's no need to apologise.

197
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,680
I was just worried
that she'd lied to me.

198
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,040
What would I do then? What if
she said things that weren't true?

199
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,120
There are still some things
that I need to know.

200
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,760
Sure, ask away.

201
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,320
Can I just ask you something?

202
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Sure.

203
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Being on the board
is really exciting.

204
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,280
I tend to find it really boring.

205
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,640
If there's anything else I can do
at the hotel, please let me know.

206
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,960
Did you have
anything in particular in mind?

207
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
I'm not sure.
I just want to help out.

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,240
I don't mind working my way up.

209
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,640
I need to learn the basics.

210
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,920
I'll have a think about it.

211
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,640
POLICE STATION

212
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Are you making progress?

213
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you think
she's choosing to stay away

214
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,640
or do you suspect
a crime has been committed?

215
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,400
Sebastian, I suggest
I ask the questions.

216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
Of course. Apologies.

217
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,760
Don't worry.

218
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,160
How would you describe
your relationship with Petra?

219
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,520
We have a good relationship
most of the time.

220
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,400
-Are you close?
-I'd say so.

221
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,920
Petra can be
a bit reserved sometimes.

222
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,520
I've only got one sister and want to
have a good relationship with her.

223
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Do you argue a lot?

224
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
No, certainly not.

225
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,880
Did you have an argument
before she disappeared?

226
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Who told you that?

227
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry. You ask the questions.

228
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,400
Yes, we did actually.

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And what did you argue about?

230
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,400
Petra thought that I was
about to break our agreement.

231
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,120
-What kind of agreement?
-A work thing.

232
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,240
-And were you?
-No, I don't know...

233
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,280
Maybe she perceived it that way.

234
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,960
She can be a bit highly strung.

235
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,120
I just want her to come back
so that we can sort everything out.

236
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,000
Your fight never became physical,
did it?

237
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
Most definitely not.

238
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,880
Is there anything we should know
that would help us find her?

239
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,480
No.

240
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,880
Hi, what are you doing here?

241
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,520
-I'm in a hurry.
-Hey...

242
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Why did you
need to access the office?

243
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,560
Why do you ask?

244
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,440
-I was just wondering.
-Did you mention it to anyone?

245
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,040
-No.
-Good.

246
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,840
Because if you do
you're in real trouble.

247
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
But I helped you.

248
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,200
Who's going to believe you?
You know what? Just forget it.

249
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,400
Okay, what's happened?

250
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,560
It's just that Lojsan called
to swap to work the evening shift.

251
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,080
My, Svante,
you've really fallen for her.

252
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,240
What do I do?

253
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,440
What do you want to do?

254
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Is there any point anymore?

255
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,040
I've already ruined it with all my
ranting about rules and regulations.

256
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,200
Aren't you going to Stockholm?

257
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,960
No, it didn't work out. Have you got
some dishes I can get stuck into?

258
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,560
They're waiting for you.

259
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
Okay.

260
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,920
If there's something you really
want you need to go for it now.

261
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,760
Promise you'll do that.

262
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,680
-Hi, what's up?
-Hi.

263
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,000
It's Julie's birthday and I wanted
to organise a party for her.

264
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You know the grand hall
at the town hall.

265
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,880
-You want me to stay away, yeah?
-On the contrary.

266
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,680
I really want you to come.

267
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm inviting all of her old friends.
You really should be there.

268
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,040
It's not a big party, is it?

269
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,960
-She hates that kind of thing.
-It'll be just the way she likes it.

270
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,480
And a little surprise.

271
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
-Okay, I'll see if I can make it.
-Sure.

272
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,880
-And bring your girlfriend.
-Thanks for the invite.

273
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,320
No worries.

274
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,120
Oh. I'm sorry.

275
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,280
I needed to get away for a bit.

276
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,120
I bet Svante would go insane
if he found me here.

277
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,240
I won't say anything.

278
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,320
Has someone been nasty to you?

279
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,320
No, not exactly.

280
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
But still totally inconsiderate.

281
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,120
I shouldn't burden you with this.

283
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,680
That's fine.

284
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,360
You're also new in this town, yeah?

285
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah.

286
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,080
People are so strange around here.

287
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,360
I know. Or coming here
makes them strange.

288
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,600
You're going out with Sebastian,
aren't you?

289
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,920
The guy who kind of owns this place.

290
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,040
Yeah.

291
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,840
Please,
don't tell anyone about this.

292
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,120
Okay.

293
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,280
But he mustn't be nasty to you.

294
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
He's not nasty.

295
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,160
Maybe he just doesn't love me
as much as I love him.

296
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,280
In that case he's crazy.

297
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,840
-Lunch is ready.
-Oh, great.

298
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,000
-I didn't realise the time.
-I know. I've been in meetings.

299
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,560
Is this our laid-back life?

300
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,440
Rushed lunches
and long working days?

301
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
-I like it this way.
-Me, too.

302
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,680
-I know. Get used to it.
-It might be gone by tomorrow.

303
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't know if there's time
for you to buy a new dress.

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,320
Why?

305
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,280
The registry office is booked for
tomorrow at two p.m.

306
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,960
-You haven't changed your mind?
-Are you joking?

307
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,600
You were indecisive.

308
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,080
We can postpone it if you want to
invite people and have a reception.

309
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,080
Definitely not.

310
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,960
Don't even go there!

311
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,560
Do you need help?

312
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,080
You could say that.
Werner was never like this, I bet.

313
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,920
I've seen it all.
And much worse than this.

314
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,280
This, for example.
Petra just left this.

315
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,440
I don't know who's meant to
deal with it. Maybe Gabrielle?

316
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,080
I'll look into it.

317
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,760
Have a seat.

318
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,760
We haven't had time to chat
since I took over.

319
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,720
You've been busy.

320
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,080
I need to catch up. You arrived
here when I moved to Stockholm.

321
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,560
I was fresh out of university.

322
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,200
Werner seemed to see potential in me
and I'm forever grateful for that.

323
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,880
You were very close to him,
I believe.

324
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,280
You saw that withdrawals had been
made. Why didn't you come to me?

325
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,320
Old habits simply.

326
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,880
It won't happen again.

327
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,680
Not even if Werner asks you?

328
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,240
He's not likely to do that, though.

329
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,000
Your loyalty to Dad
makes my life difficult.

330
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,600
I understand.

331
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,600
As the new CEO you want to
put your stamp on the hotel.

332
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,400
-Yeah.
-I can see that.

333
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm happy to stay
and help you with that transition.

334
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,040
Then we can see how it goes.
What do you think?

335
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,560
Well, that sounds terrific.

336
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
Super. Thank you.

337
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,720
You should know that
I know this business inside out.

338
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,760
It might sound ridiculous,
but this is my dream job.

339
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
I've always wanted to
work for a family business.

340
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm not convinced
it's the best combination.

341
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,560
Family and business, I mean.

342
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,440
I have to disagree with you.

343
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,960
If Werner is moving on,
maybe I'll do the same.

344
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,400
But until then
I'll be supporting you.

345
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,560
I would be silly to let you go.

346
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,600
But could you help me let Dad know
who's in charge now?

347
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,640
We can try.

348
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,440
Thank you.

349
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,080
I thought she liked me.

350
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,880
At least a little bit.

351
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,880
But recently she's been really off.

352
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,600
-How do you mean?
-One moment she's sweet to me.

353
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,920
-The next she asks me to piss off.
-Stay away from her.

354
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,080
-Lilja says the same.
-Who's that?

355
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,360
A friend. She's cool.

356
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,120
I just don't want any
misunderstandings between us.

357
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,440
Just be upfront with her.
That's the most important thing.

358
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,880
Should I be upfront
about being unsure?

359
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,680
Haven't you finished for today?

360
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,320
Lukas is off home to ponder whether
he's in love with his friend or not.

361
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,240
Oh, stop it.

362
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,720
Have you been baby-sitting today?

363
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,160
No, I think it was actually
the other way round.

364
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,000
It was good to have someone
who'd listen to me.

365
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,800
Why didn't you speak to me?

366
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,840
I mean, I would have
been fine with that.

367
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,800
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

368
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,760
I wish you a pleasant afternoon
in Saltsjövik.

369
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,040
Okay, now what's wrong?

370
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
Nothing at all.

371
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,960
I've been thinking.

372
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,720
And I think I might as well
be honest with you.

373
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,240
Hi, Lojsan.

374
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,800
What are you doing here?

375
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,120
-I've called, but you don't pick up.
-Leave me alone.

376
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
-But...
-Just leave.

377
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
Or I'll have Svante escort you out.

378
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,000
I've got a room booked here.

379
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
You can't stay here.

380
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,400
If he's got a booking, then...

381
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,680
Yep. Room 314 booked and paid for.

382
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,680
-Is Lukas here?
-No, he's gone home.

383
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,760
-Would he like dinner with me?
-You'll have to ask him that.

384
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,320
The lifts are over there. Floor 3.
Breakfast is served 6:30-10:00.

385
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,440
Check out is before midday.

386
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,000
Very professional.

387
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
The thing is,
he doesn't know that I'm here.

388
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,560
You want to see your son?
Sort it out yourself.

389
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,560
Will do.

390
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,040
Floor 3.

391
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,520
-Sorry. Torbjörn, Lojsan's...
-I understand.

392
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,120
Svante. Front desk manager.

393
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,080
See you.

394
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,560
Are you okay?

395
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,240
Sure. Fine.

396
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
-Sebastian wanted...
-Wait.

397
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,920
Sure, sorry.

398
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,160
It's fine.
It's just the way I want it.

399
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,120
Do you think she'll agree to it?

400
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,640
I think so.

401
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,160
Great work.

402
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,720
As usual.

403
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,320
What did you
have to say about Sebastian?

404
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,160
I want to talk about
yours and mine collaboration.

405
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,400
And about my future at the hotel.

406
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,680
Rest assured that I won't let him
get rid of you. I guarantee that.

407
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,680
I don't want any trouble
between you two or for the hotel.

408
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,560
You're not causing trouble.
On the contrary.

409
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,280
-I can talk to him, if you like.
-No need.

410
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,080
We've sorted it out.

411
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,560
Okay.

412
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,840
Did he want to discuss
anything else... regarding us?

413
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,440
I've not said anything about us.
And no one here suspects that we...

414
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,160
No.

415
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,320
That was a one off.

416
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,320
A mistake.

417
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
We both agree on that, don't we?

418
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,760
I really put a lot of trust in you.

419
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
-Good luck with your wedding.
-Thank you.

420
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,600
So Torbjörn is your...

421
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,840
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

422
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,240
No, I understand.

423
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,680
Do you want me to stay?

424
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,440
If you don't
want to deal with him I can.

425
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,760
Thank you.
That's nice, but it's not necessary.

426
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,280
What was it
you wanted to talk about before?

427
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,600
Oh, nothing.

428
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,920
It's not important.

429
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,800
Okay...

430
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,800
Is Petra back?

431
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,920
-No.
-Sebastian needs her signature.

432
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,160
I thought...
Sorry, I wasn't thinking at all.

433
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,720
-I won't bother you.
-No, I can take them.

434
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,840
Have you still not heard from her?

435
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,800
Sorry, I'll leave you in peace now.

436
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm sorry I just vanished. Please
understand I need to be alone.

437
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,000
I am so worried.
Just tell me where you are.

438
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,360
Hi, you've reached Petra. Please,
leave a message after the tone.

439
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,880
Petra, please just
tell me where you are.

440
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,600
Seeing each other before the wedding
brings bad luck.

441
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,360
You never told me
you were superstitious.

442
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
What was it you wanted?

443
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,120
If you could just
read and sign this.

444
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,520
-A prenuptial agreement.
-I cleared it with Tone.

445
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
But not with me.

446
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,720
Look at it as a means
to silence the prophets of doom.

447
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,240
I didn't realise people think that
I'm marrying you for your money.

448
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,360
Then I'll leave this
with the tax authorities.

449
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,280
I'll do it.

450
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,680
Okay.

451
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,200
-Kiss.
-You'll smear everything.

452
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,200
I'll get changed. See you outside.

453
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,520
What's that? Perfume?

454
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,160
-For the guests.
-For Dad, you mean?

455
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,560
No.

456
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,640
-What shall I do with my hair?
-Ask the guests.

457
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,320
Did you
have dinner with him yesterday?

458
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,720
No.

459
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,680
-Will you see him tonight?
-I don't have time.

460
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,920
You don't have to ignore him, Lukas.

461
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Isn't that what you're going to do?

462
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,840
This is better than
the registry office.

463
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,840
Do you wish Petra was here?

464
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,600
I do, but...

465
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,880
This is about us.

466
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,320
Marriage is built on love and trust.

467
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,280
By entering into marriage

468
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,120
you promise to respect
and support one another.

469
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,800
Do you, Vendela Kraghenberg,

470
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,760
take Werner Gyllenmark

471
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,960
as your wedded husband, to love,
for better, for worse?

472
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,480
I do.

473
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,160
Do you, Werner Gyllenmark,

474
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,080
take Vendela Kraghenberg,

475
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,160
as your wife, to love,
for better, for worse?

476
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,560
I do.

477
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,320
You are now husband and wife.

478
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,520
Congratulations, Dad!

479
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,640
She's just so cool.

480
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,560
And clever.

481
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,560
But her boyfriend
treats her like shit.

482
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,120
Is this Rebecca?

483
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,960
Have you not been listening?
I'm talking about Shirin.

484
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,480
Okay. Sorry.

485
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,600
I can't keep track of
all the ladies you fall for.

486
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,080
Do you think I fancy her?

487
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,240
It sounds like it.

488
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,320
Would you like to meet up...

489
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
later?

490
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,960
-Hang out and do something?
-Sure.

491
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,400
You decide what we're doing.
No superhero films.

492
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,200
Okay.

493
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,760
Thanks for being our witnesses
at such short notice.

494
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,320
Of course.

495
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,400
I'm sure it'll be you two next.

496
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,040
What do you make of
the message Petra sent?

497
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,520
I suppose it's good news.

498
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,400
We just need to
convince her to come home.

499
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,520
-She should have been here today.
-Yeah.

500
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,840
This was so nice,
but we need to get a move on.

501
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,040
Julie's birthday party.

502
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,840
Well, I'm not going.

503
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,120
But I promised we'd be there.

504
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,240
Go without me
if it's that important.

505
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,400
-We'll also be going now.
-Yes.

506
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,160
-Thank you.
-Once again, congratulations.

507
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,760
-It was really lovely.
-It's so nice to have you here.

508
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,800
A toast for Julie!

509
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,080
Cheers!

510
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,920
How did you have time
to organise this?

511
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,200
It wasn't that hard. You're popular.

512
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,040
Thank you, darling.

513
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,600
I'm so happy you're here.

514
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,480
Any news?

515
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,360
-Not yet.
-Are the police still involved?

516
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,120
Yes, but...

517
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,520
Happy birthday.

518
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,600
Oh, you shouldn't have.
That's so sweet of you.

519
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,120
I do hope they fit you.

520
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
Open it.

521
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,920
-Did you leave the door unlocked?
-No.

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,240
Ta-da! Here I am.

523
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,680
-Come and arrest me.
-Mum!

524
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,400
You know how I feel
about that word.

525
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,040
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just so happy.

526
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,920
-I didn't know you were coming.
-No.

527
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,800
-How did you get in.
-The cleaner dragged me in.

528
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,280
You have a beautiful home, Werner.

529
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,160
Thank you. You think so?

530
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,120
-This is really you.
-Yeah?

531
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,080
So what have you been up to today?

532
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Well, Inez...

533
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,960
Secrets? Oh!

534
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,360
You were in a rush.
You didn't want to wait? Wonderful.

535
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,040
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

536
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,280
If we'd known you were coming
we would of course have waited.

537
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,680
Why? I'm right on time to celebrate.
There's only one thing missing.

538
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,600
A chilled bottle of Champagne.
Best brand.

539
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,880
Eh... I see. Champagne.

540
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Well done.

541
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,360
I can't believe
Aksel asked you to come.

542
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,880
I can leave if you like.

543
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,240
Shall we sneak out?
Or maybe you love big parties?

544
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,160
Stop it. You know that this isn't...

545
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,640
I will now give a pining speech
and you'll be crying.

546
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,560
Stop it.

547
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,240
Could I have
everybody's attention, please?

548
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,720
Julie, would you mind coming over?

549
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,920
What are you up to?

550
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,520
First I'd like to thank you all
for being here at such short notice.

551
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,000
I really appreciate it.

552
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,960
I also have something
to say to you, Julie.

553
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,000
We've been through so much recently

554
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,920
and there's no one I'd rather
share my life with than you.

555
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,400
Julie...

556
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,960
Elisabeth Grip.

557
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,960
Will you do me the honour
and marry me?

558
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,240
He's kind of sweet, like...

559
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,800
"Get your best Champagne.
Lovely and expensive."

560
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,160
And he brings us this.

561
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,440
You should have been there
at the wedding.

562
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,720
It was truly beautiful
out there by the rocks.

563
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,320
Could you bear
staying here for a whole year?

564
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,720
Well...

565
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,000
My little sweetheart.

566
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,120
I'm going to ask him

567
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,080
to let you go to France
for a few months.

568
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,280
A bit of distance
will speed things along.

569
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,280
What do you think?

570
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,880
I'm alright.
Let's just stick to the plan.

571
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,000
If we'd stuck to the plan

572
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,760
that house in Brittany
would have been ours by now.

573
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,120
I wasn't able to
push him any further.

574
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,840
He would have grown suspicious.

575
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,080
He's not stupid.

576
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,120
He's presented me
with a prenuptial agreement.

577
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,920
Which I don't expect
you have signed?

578
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,640
-No.
-No.

579
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,240
We'll have to give it some thought.

580
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
Okay, as long as you don't sign it.

581
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,400
I hope you haven't got
any other surprises in store for me?

582
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,040
No.

583
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,400
Vanilla? Honestly.

584
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,600
What did you pick? Pistachio?
Are you 70, or what?

585
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,080
I've never had a boyfriend before.

586
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,200
Okay.

587
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,960
I'm not sure why I said that.
It probably sounded weird.

588
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,960
No, I'm just surprised.

589
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,360
What's that?

590
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,400
