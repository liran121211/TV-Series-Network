1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,320
What's that?

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,200
-It's Petra.
-We can't keep doing this.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
We'll just hurt one another.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,040
-And other people.
-I know.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
-Don't you know any jokes?
-No...

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
There's something I want to say.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,680
Okay, go.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm in love with you.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,240
Haven't you noticed?

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,680
No, go to hell!

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,760
-Did you forget something?
-Yes.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,720
-Hey, Lojsan.
-What are you doing here?

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,440
Can't you give me one more chance?
For Lukas' sake?

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,760
-I should probably go home.
-You can sleep here if you want.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,160
We should probably sleep.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,400
If you can see it's him
in the pictures,

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,920
the money will come
when I see the material.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,800
-How much did you hear?
-No idea.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,000
They're the things Petra had
when they found her.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,200
This is Sebastian's.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960
You have to see this, from security
footage, check the time.

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,120
He said he came straight
from the train to the party.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,600
He lied to you.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,240
Are you ready?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,160
We have to go to the police, now.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,120
I want to see
the security footage again.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,800
It is him.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
I understand it's hard for you.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
I know a lot points to him,
right now.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't you see this becomes more
dangerous the longer we stay silent?

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,720
Okay, I'll go to the police.

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,800
-Good.
-But I want to go alone.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
Okay.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,160
THE BEACH HOTEL

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,320
What are you looking at?

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
The papers have started writing
about Petra.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,480
What are they saying?

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
You don't want to know.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,920
Of course I do.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I want to know what you're thinking.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Shirin, I...

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
Don't say "we need to talk".

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,080
We can't be like this.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,080
How? What's happened?

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,320
Don't you think things have changed
with us?

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't put that on me.
What do you want?

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
-I love you.
-Stop it!

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
-I want to have a break.
-To do what?

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,480
Get with Julie?

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,280
No... I need to think.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,520
What about me? Should I move out?

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,080
-Where?
-I don't know, we...

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,840
-We'll have to work it out.
-You mean I'll have to.

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,880
Without a rich family who conjures
up a job and house when I want?

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,840
-Hey...
-I can't deal with this right now.

56
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,920
You've gotten strong!

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
-Did you let me win?
-Never, I'd never do that.

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,960
But seriously,
have you started working out?

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,640
No, I just work.

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Okay.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,880
How long are you staying?

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,400
I've said two nights.

63
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
Come on, Mum.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,080
-Then we'll see, okay?
-Okay.

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
I'm grateful for each second
I get with you two.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,360
You're so strong.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm so happy you're here.

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,080
I have to ask,
have you found any...

69
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,040
messages from Petra yet?

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
You can say goodbye note.

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay.

72
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,080
No, I haven't.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,440
And I don't think I will.

74
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,560
But where is this coming from?

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Doesn't Sebastian's necklace matter
anymore?

76
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,560
I'm not totally sure it is his.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,840
Okay. Do you want to see it again?

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,520
It's in the box.

79
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,920
Petra wasn't well.
Anyone could see that.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,680
Sure, maybe, but she'd never
have left me like this.

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,920
-Even if she was gambling again?
-Can you stop?

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,640
What? I'm just trying to help you
get an answer.

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,400
It feels more like you're trying to
help yourself.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,280
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

85
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,200
You say you're after the truth.

86
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,920
But whatever doesn't fit
your worldview, you remove.

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,160
Do you really think he'd hurt
his own sister?

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,960
I think it's best if you leave now.

89
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,520
Okay.

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,040
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,560
-I can come back later.
-Wait a minute.

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
-What you're doing at my house?
-I need to talk to Julie.

93
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,960
Listen to me carefully,
don't go near her again, understand?

94
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,200
-What did she say?
-She wants to be left alone, okay?

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
I know that's not true.

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,720
You're a fucking psychopath.

97
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
-Why did you come back?
-You know...

98
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
-Poser.
-Sometimes, I wonder the same thing.

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,120
If you leave now, you might be okay.

100
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,040
Julie would have come with me.

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
-Are you okay?
-Leave!

102
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,920
-Sorry!
-Get out!

103
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,640
It feels like before.

104
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,480
-Not quite.
-What do you mean?

105
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,680
The old Torbjörn wouldn't have
let his son win an arm-wrestle.

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,160
I saw it was important to him.

107
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,880
And for you.

108
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,160
He's happy you're here.

109
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
What about you?

110
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,080
Did I destroy everything between us?

111
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,080
You got very close.

112
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,360
And I'll never forgive myself
for that.

113
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
You're the best thing
that happened to me.

114
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm sorry I hurt you.

115
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,920
Damn you.

116
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,360
Do you know how long I've waited
for you to say those words?

117
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,600
Hey.

118
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,760
I thought I'd...

119
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,240
-I just wanted to...
-Yes?

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
I messed up the other night.

121
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
I shouldn't have picked
a horror movie.

122
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
I know you don't like them.

123
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,520
Good we've got that sorted.

124
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,960
I'll get a coffee at work
since I'm there anyway.

125
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
See you.

126
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,280
Right.

127
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,760
Look, a delivery of wines directly
imported from Château Neuf du Pape.

128
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,520
Look. I'd completely forgotten
I'd ordered them.

129
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,360
And to think you could be so proud
of a cardboard box of wine.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes. If you have a nice hotel,
you need nice wines.

131
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,960
But they're dear.
I'll put them away.

132
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
I like them too.

133
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,840
-New money wine.
-Behave yourself.

134
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,240
Me? Behave myself?

135
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
Him, showing those off,
"Look what I ordered."

136
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,840
What is it? Ten bottles?

137
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,760
-Come on.
-Anyone could order those.

138
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,520
Like some kind of new money habits
he wants to...

139
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,320
No, when are you going to start
talking to him?

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
About the divorce?

141
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,240
It's too soon.

142
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,120
-What are you talking about?
-It will never work.

143
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,800
Rubbish! At your age, I'd managed to
get divorced four times!

144
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,480
Angelo, he was number four,
we hadn't even moved in together.

145
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,440
-Sure...
-You can do anything.

146
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,440
-Werner has just lost his daughter.
-What does that have to do with us?

147
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,120
I can't throw it in his face now.

148
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,560
Vendela, you know
what you have to do.

149
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,000
Until then, I have nothing more
to say to you.

150
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,160
Shirin, what's wrong?

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,160
Listen to me,
you need to breathe more deeply.

152
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,520
Breathe with me, in...

153
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,960
and out.

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,280
Come on, once more, calm and still.

155
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,280
And out. Good.

156
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,520
Does that feel a bit better?

157
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,600
Can you stand up?

158
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,760
All right.

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,360
I don't know what happened.

160
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I came here
and everything went black.

161
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,400
I couldn't see anything.

162
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,200
-Want me to get Sebastian?
-No.

163
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
He wouldn't come anyway.

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,840
And I really don't want to hear,
"What did I tell you?"

165
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
I'd tear the place down.

166
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
Then maybe you should go home.

167
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,600
No, please let me stay.

168
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,600
I promise I won't lose it again.

169
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,240
Lose it as much as you like.

170
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,760
And hey, if you want to talk,
I'm happy to listen.

171
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,360
He attacked me when I asked him
to leave.

172
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,360
Mm, but you know we only have
your word to go on?

173
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,920
Do you think Sebastian's story will
sound the same?

174
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,840
No, probably not.

175
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,960
And it's not him who's here
making a police report, is it?

176
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,960
Okay...

177
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,560
So he shows up unannounced
to your place.

178
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,840
Did he say what he wanted?

179
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,640
He wanted to see Julie.

180
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,920
Well, they're old friends, right?

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,080
They were together as teenagers.

182
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
Since Sebastian came back
to Saltsjövik,

183
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,680
he's been obsessed with her.

184
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,160
He shows up at her work,
in our home...

185
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,320
Now his sister and stepfather
are dead, and I don't know,

186
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,680
I think it's strange how much
has happened...

187
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,400
Wait, stop, hello.

188
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,160
Wait a minute,
I'm not following at all.

189
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,240
What do you really want
to talk about?

190
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm here for Julie's sake.

191
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
She doesn't see how dangerous he is.

192
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,680
She's the one who should be sitting
here now.

193
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,800
Why? What do you think
she'd have to say?

194
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,600
Klara, I wish I was wrong.

195
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay?

196
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,440
But right before Egil died,
he asked me to keep Julie safe.

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,800
If I don't act
and something else were to happen...

198
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,280
I'd never be able to forgive myself.

199
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,200
I didn't notice you here.

200
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
I thought I might as well come in.

201
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,240
-But I keep thinking she'll turn up.
-Me too.

202
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,320
It might be insensitive,
but what now?

203
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,360
Will you stay in Petra's position?

204
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,760
What else would I do?

205
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,360
Tone...

206
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Sebastian. He means well, but he's
not really there yet, right?

207
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,360
You have different leadership
styles.

208
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,560
Come on, it's just us.

209
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,360
-You might be right.
-I usually am.

210
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,920
Does he trust you?

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm working on it.

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,960
Can you watch him for me?
We've discussed it.

213
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,720
What, aren't you going to
keep working here?

214
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
It's for his sake. And the hotel's.

215
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,720
We need to make sure
he makes no big mistakes.

216
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,560
-And we never had this talk?
-Which talk?

217
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm so sorry if the towels
were too soft.

218
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,560
We'll do what we can to improve.

219
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,040
Thank you.

220
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,480
Hey, what do you say?

221
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,760
Shall we go down to the harbour
and dip them in some salt water?

222
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,400
That should do the trick.

223
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,320
To think you can have so much fun
at work.

224
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,880
Hey.

225
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
What are you doing here?

226
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,520
Nothing can separate me
from you now.

227
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
I don't know if you've heard,
Lojsan and I are together again.

228
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,200
No, I didn't know. Congratulations.

229
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,880
Thank you.

230
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
So you won't be seeing much of her
for awhile.

231
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm taking her on a romantic trip.

232
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,680
Don't say anything. It's a secret.

233
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm standing right here.

234
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,520
I can't just leave work
and go on holiday.

235
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,440
Of course you can.

236
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,400
Sixten will get a replacement,
right?

237
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Sure, I'll work it out,
if that's what you want.

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'd prefer to be asked first.

239
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Would the lady like some lunch?

240
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,160
Sure.

241
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,560
See you.

242
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,120
Hey, how are you?

243
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,760
Damn, what have you done?
Have you been in a fight?

244
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,400
Don't worry about it.

245
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,840
I am worried.

246
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,520
Sorry.

247
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,080
It's okay.

248
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,800
Everything's chaos right now.

249
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,960
Is there anything I can do to help?

250
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,720
What do you want in exchange?

251
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
Nothing.

252
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,560
Unlike everyone else, you've only
been nice to me from the start.

253
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,160
I care about you.

254
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,520
It's probably best that you know
as little as possible.

255
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,160
So it's nothing to do
with that phone call?

256
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,000
Not at all, you...

257
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
You didn't tell Julie?

258
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,160
Of course not.

259
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,240
If...

260
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,680
If you see Julie and Sebastian
together, can you message me?

261
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,280
Of course. I promise.

262
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,760
Thank you.

263
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,160
Mum?

264
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
Are you really ignoring me?

265
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
Maybe it's just as well.

266
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
That you just listen quietly.

267
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,280
I really want to do all I can
so you can keep the house.

268
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,120
But I'm not getting divorced.

269
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,440
I love him.

270
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,960
It wasn't the idea, I know.

271
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,800
You found someone
who was perfect for our plans

272
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,680
but also someone
who was perfect for me.

273
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,520
You must have seen that, deep down.

274
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,280
Can't you be happy for me?

275
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,080
That was the most pathetic thing
I've ever heard.

276
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,480
Do you think it's love you feel
for him?

277
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
You don't have it in you,
little girl.

278
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,200
You don't even know what it is.

279
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,320
It'll sting a bit at the start,
sure.

280
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,440
But you're the one
complicating this.

281
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,960
Things will turn out best for you
if you do as I say.

282
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,760
And best for me.

283
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
-See this?
-No. What is it?

284
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,680
It's a prenuptial agreement.

285
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,640
Signed and sent to the tax agency.

286
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,120
What have you done?

287
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,640
I don't get a cent if we divorce.

288
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
Neither do you, obviously.

289
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,200
Hey?

290
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
I'm very happy here, with work too.

291
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay...

292
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,120
Yeah, so...

293
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,520
I don't want to move back
to Jönköping.

294
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Then we'll stay.

295
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,040
-We'll stay here.
-Are you sure?

296
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,680
Absolutely. I'm ready. For you.

297
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
What about your job?

298
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,280
I'll figure something out.
It'll work out.

299
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,520
Why is Anna-Karin calling?

300
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,040
It's best I just leave her be.

301
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,920
Why?

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,600
She didn't take it so well
when I broke up with her.

303
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,840
But hey, we're over. Okay?

304
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,400
It's over.

305
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
A toast.

306
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,040
To you, to me, to Saltsjövik.

307
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,640
And for Lukas.

308
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,280
-You're beautiful.
-Stop it.

309
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,680
You are.

310
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
How are things?

311
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,320
-You look a bit down.
-I'm good.

312
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,600
Lojsan's going back
to her ex-husband.

313
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,760
What, that jerk who hangs out
in reception all day?

314
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,600
-Does she want that?
-Lojsan can't be made to do things.

315
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,560
Listen...

316
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm so sorry I called you a coward.

317
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,640
-Sorry.
-It's true enough.

318
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,560
No, it's really not.
Not in the least.

319
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
And Lojsan knows that too.

320
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,720
Did she say she wants
to be with you?

321
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,520
-Yes.
-Then you can't give up yet. Okay?

322
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,440
Okay.

323
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,760
I thought we could have
a little talk about Sebastian.

324
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

325
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,560
As you probably know,
a report has been made against him.

326
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,960
No, I didn't know that.

327
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,600
-Suspected assault and stalking.
-What are you talking about?

328
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,840
How does your relationship
with Sebastian look?

329
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,840
Is it Aksel who's reported him?
Or Gabrielle?

330
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,480
Julie, I just want to hear this
from you.

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,200
Answer the question: have you ever
felt threatened by Sebastian?

332
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,600
No.

333
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,160
Absolutely not.

334
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,520
Why does it feel like there's
something you don't want to tell me?

335
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,400
It's not like you've listened to me
very closely before, right?

336
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,000
Do you still believe your father
died under suspicious circumstances?

337
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,160
Do you suspect anyone?

338
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm not really qualified
to do police work.

339
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,400
Am I?

340
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:02,320
Okay. You don't see grounds for the
report against Sebastian Gyllenmark?

341
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
-No, I don't.
-Okay.

342
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,960
Listen, if there's anything you want
to talk to me about, get in touch.

343
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,880
Okay. Thank you.

344
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,280
Thank you.

345
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,160
Congratulations to you and Torbjörn.

346
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,320
You already said that.

347
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,440
You can't say it too many times.

348
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Thanks so much.

349
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
Call me an idiot if you want to.

350
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,200
No, why would I want to do that?

351
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,920
Lukas is really happy,

352
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,400
and I think this is best
for the family in the long run.

353
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,360
Lukas is almost an adult
and will move out soon.

354
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,960
You're the one who has to live with
Torbjörn for the rest of your life.

355
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,640
ANNA-KARIN

356
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,480
Why hasn't she reached out?

357
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,880
Why don't you?

358
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
I don't know what to say.

359
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,640
Well, what do you want to say?

360
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,920
Pretend I'm her and tell me.

361
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,920
I'd say...

362
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,000
Sorry... for things going wrong
the other night.

363
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,440
And... you're cool and smart and...

364
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,840
I don't know why you even want
to be my friend.

365
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,960
-That's basically what I'd say.
-Good! That was great.

366
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,200
Write that.

367
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,320
Friendship can become more.

368
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
Are you Lilja or yourself right now?

369
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,480
Just write what you just said to me.

370
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,520
To lilja
Want to meet up?

371
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,960
"Want to meet up?"

372
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,320
Was that too forward?

373
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,760
It's her.

374
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,600
"Absolutely. Training a new person
at work but I can meet later."

375
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,040
You're the best!

376
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
I'm sure you'll be together forever.

377
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
Like everyone else in this town.

378
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
Thank you so much.

379
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,120
TO SEBASTIAN
I LOVE YOU, DESPITE EVERYTHING.

380
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,440
I LOVE YOU DESPITE EVERYTHING

381
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,680
How can you just leave these out?

382
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,400
They're not secret, are they?
Has Sebastian been here?

383
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,560
Why ask about that?

384
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,080
Take these with you.

385
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,400
So I won't have to be reminded
of your conspiracy theories.

386
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,800
Nothing here has anything to do
with me.

387
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,200
I didn't write it.

388
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,360
Just read it.

389
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,320
And come to your own conclusion.

390
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,560
Hey, we have to look at
these streaming services.

391
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,480
We've got no sports channels.

392
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,000
I hate sport and so does Lukas.

393
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,360
Come on! How hard can it be?

394
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,680
Anna-Karin says hi.

395
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,240
She says if you don't get your stuff
by tomorrow, it goes to the tip.

396
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,320
That woman's crazy.

397
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,520
Seriously. She scares me.

398
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,360
So it's not true that she's the one
who kicked you out?

399
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Of course she'd say that.

400
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,120
And that you were fired,
did she make that up?

401
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,880
I really wanted to believe that,
so I called your boss.

402
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
You called me boss?

403
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,200
-I can explain.
-Explain this instead:

404
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,320
Why did you come back?

405
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,200
Because you and Lukas are
the most important thing to me.

406
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,520
That's what you wanted to hear,
right?

407
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
Did you really think I'd buy that?

408
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,880
You've got this all wrong.

409
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,520
We've got a fresh start, you and I.

410
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,240
I don't need a fresh start.
I've sorted out my life on my own.

411
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,560
You won't cope without me.

412
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,680
How did you get so pathetic?

413
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,480
And you're such a catch?

414
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm the best you could hope for.

415
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,760
I'm going back to work now.
You won't be here when I get home.

416
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Were you really going to leave
without saying anything?

417
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,040
How are you getting to the airport?

418
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,440
Don't worry about it.

419
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,160
Let me know when you get there.

420
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,360
Why would I do that?

421
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,760
Because you're my mother.

422
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,880
You know what I've said
about that word.

423
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,880
You're right.

424
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,320
You hardly deserve it.

425
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,360
-Drama queen.
-What's all this?

426
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,360
Inez has decided to go home.

427
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
Already?

428
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,680
Hold on, there must be something
we can do to get her to stay.

429
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,560
Respect her decision.

430
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,200
Oh dear.

431
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,520
Just how things go sometimes.

432
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,680
Her mood can change quickly.

433
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,120
Let me drive you to the airport
at least. I'm going out anyway.

434
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,000
Never say no
to a bit of friendliness.

435
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,680
I'll take these.

436
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,080
Wow, what a lot of luggage.

437
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Seriously, aren't you going home?

438
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,960
Never. That's even worse than here.

439
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,440
Please, you have to go home
sometime, right?

440
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,800
I can't deal with it.

441
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,760
What are you going to do?

442
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,680
I don't know. It'll work out.

443
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,080
Maybe I can sort something out.

444
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
Oh? What do you have in mind?

445
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,200
Unfortunately, I can't reveal more,
but let's just say I have contacts.

446
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,280
Wow! That sound dangerous.

447
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,760
I'll sort something out.

448
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,240
It'll work out.

449
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,720
Hey.

450
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,320
I talked to the police.

451
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,040
Oh? What do you think?
Do they have enough to arrest him?

452
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,640
How can she believe anything you say
if you make up accusations?

453
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,760
Sebastian has never stalked me.

454
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,800
You might not think so,
but believe me, everyone else does.

455
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,240
This isn't like you.
You don't usually lie.

456
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,080
Neither do you.

457
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,360
See? You don't even deny it.

458
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,480
You'd never hide anything from me,
right?

459
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,720
Have you slept with Sebastian?

460
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,760
Sorry, I...

461
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,680
See this?! He did this
when I told him to stay away!

462
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,480
Tell me, what exactly did he do?

463
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,120
Are you kidding me?

464
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,920
What will make you see?
Does he need to attack you too?

465
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,160
He hurt you, but you can't
make him out to be someone he's not!

466
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,120
Wow. Let me guess.

467
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,360
You didn't tell the police
about the security footage, right?

468
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,880
-Were you ever going to?
-You already destroyed it.

469
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
No. You destroyed everything.

470
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,800
What does Torbjörn have to say
about you working night?

471
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,880
He can say what he likes.
I won't have to hear it.

472
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,600
He's gone. I threw him out.

473
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,040
Not because of what I said?

474
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,920
No. He did it all himself.

475
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh. That's nice to hear.

476
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,200
I just mean I don't want to be
involved in your decision-making.

477
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,040
-Please, Lojsan, listen to me.
-Isn't it best we just do our jobs

478
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,640
and not get involved in
one another's lives?

479
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
Lojsan, I love you.

480
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,440
I've probably loved you
from the moment you walked in.

481
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,840
Please. Can you forgive me for all
my little peculiarities?

482
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,320
Oh my God, I'm useless at this.

483
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,800
What would Werner say?

484
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,080
He can say what he likes.

485
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,120
Vendela, I have a little surprise.

486
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,400
Have you? What is it?

487
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,520
Ta-da!

488
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,200
-Did you forget something?
-I'm so sorry about all that.

489
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,160
We had a good conversation
in the car, Inez and I.

490
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
What a husband you have.

491
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,280
He won't let us part as enemies.

492
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,000
No, how would it look?

493
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,520
I convinced her to stay
awhile longer.

494
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,200
So we can become good friends again.
You and I.

495
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,720
We need to celebrate with a glass of
Château Neuf du Pape.

496
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
I'll pour.

497
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,080
What are you playing at?

498
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,920
I know you love your husband Werner
very much.

499
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,840
But are you sure his feelings
for you are the same?

500
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,080
This has been a difficult day.

501
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,680
A glass of wine will do nicely.

502
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,840
You keep chopping,
Werner and I will get a head start.

503
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,360
-What's new since the other night?
-Dad moved in.

504
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,960
And moved out again.

505
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
I want to hear all about that.

506
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,320
I don't know...

507
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,240
I think there's something
we need to talk about.

508
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,400
I... just wanted to...

509
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,120
What I want to say is...

510
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Sorry, I messed up
another cappuccino.

511
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,480
Can you show me again?

512
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,800
Lukas, this is Jens.
He's just started here.

513
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,320
-What did you want to say?
-Ah, you're Lukas!

514
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,680
I've heard so much about you.

515
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,560
Um, cappuccino, please?

516
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,000
-Yes, see you.
-Nice to meet you.

517
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,080
Really?

518
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,480
Oh, yes.

519
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,240
Just don't say anything to Svante.

520
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
He tends to get really grumpy
when staff stay at the hotel.

521
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,600
-Okay.
-To say the least.

522
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,040
How have you managed it
with all your hook-ups?

523
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,920
With my...?

524
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,880
-The thing is...
-Relax.

525
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,280
Wow, what service!

526
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,200
Yes, I thought you deserved it.

527
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,800
You're lovely.

528
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,200
Thank you.

529
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,200
I should...

530
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,200
-I should go.
-Come on.

531
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,600
I can't drink this by myself.

532
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,840
Okay.

533
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,400
Ready?

534
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,560
Well, cheers.

535
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,000
Cheers.

536
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,840
Thank you.

537
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,640
-You could have called first.
-I didn't want to.

538
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,880
-What do you want?
-Come sit.

539
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,920
You know how Julie questioned
Egil's cause of death?

540
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,920
What if Petra didn't kill herself?

541
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,280
Wait, Marianne...

542
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,720
Sure, she was angry at the world,
mostly at you.

543
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,960
But there's no note.

544
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Not even to Gabrielle.

545
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,040
What are you trying to say?

546
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,360
Who would want to kill Petra?

547
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,840
And Egil?

548
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,520
Why does it feel like
someone's after us?

549
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,320
I think it's got something to do
with Fredrik.

550
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,720
-Marianne?
-Yes?

551
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,360
Listen to me.

552
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,880
We agreed, remember?

553
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,600
This is something
we'll never talk about.

554
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,720
You're not doing well,
none of us are,

555
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
but stop torturing yourself
with these thoughts.

556
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,920
Go home
and forget this conversation, okay?

557
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,640
Don't treat me
like some hysterical woman.

558
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,640
Listen to me for once.

559
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,400
Why haven't you been in touch?

560
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,120
What do you think?

561
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,760
I know things got out of hand
with Aksel.

562
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,000
It probably sounds really stupid,
but... he attacked me.

563
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,520
Why did you never tell me
you take tramadol?

564
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,560
What's that got to do with anything?

565
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,040
Don't you think I'd want to know
that you...

566
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,800
take the same tablets...

567
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,760
that Dad died from?

568
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,720
-Jesus, Julie...
-When did you come to Saltsjövik?

569
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,400
I came straight to the party.
We saw each other.

570
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,680
-Who can back you up?
-Do you want to call Shirin?

571
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,040
-Where's your necklace?
-Can you calm down?

572
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,960
Julie, please...

573
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,760
It's me.

574
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,080
-What's going on?
-I need answers.

575
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,320
Yes, I take tramadol.

576
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,040
You knew I need painkillers.

577
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,400
And I lost the necklace weeks ago.

578
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,600
I've looked everywhere.

579
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,040
Listen, I...

580
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,760
I stayed away from Saltsjövik
far too long.

581
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,080
And I came here for Dad's birthday.

582
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,280
Mostly to see you again.

583
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,480
Is there anything else?

584
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,960
Do you really think I've got
something to do with Egil's death?

585
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,040
Please... tell me in that case.

586
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,160
I wouldn't be able to handle knowing
you suspect me.

587
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,440
Do you want to leave with me?

588
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,800
I just need to...

589
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,760
get away for awhile.

590
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,240
And think.
Figure out what to do now.

591
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,680
I can leave right now.

592
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,920
To mum:
Mistral is total chaos.

593
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,360
Aksel and Julie have big problems.
I think she's going to leave him.

594
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,720
BUT HE DEFINITELY TRUSTS ME NOW.

595
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,040
Great. You're doing so well.
The whole hotel will be yours soon!

596
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,080
Thanks mum!

597
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,680
I can't wait to see you again!

598
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,360
Are you sure about this?

599
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,000
What exit is it?

600
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,920
Wait, I just need to find my phone.

601
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,440
Are you kidding?

602
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,920
-You know nothing of this area?
-Yes!

603
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,840
You know that.

604
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,600
-Where's my phone?
-I don't know.

605
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,480
I just had it.
Can you see my phone?

606
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,120
No, it was here.

607
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,960
-Where?
-Here.

608
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,920
-I can't see it.
-I saw it down there. Here.

609
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,120
Here, down here.

610
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,640
What's that?!

611
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,360
