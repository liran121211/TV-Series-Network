00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,000
SALTSJÖVIK BEACH HOTEL

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,520
- This is so typical of Werner.
- Details were never his thing.

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,600
- It's only a party.
- It beggars belief he invited dad.

4
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,360
- And that dad accepted.
- They mustn't get into a fight.

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,000
That's why we've also been invited.

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,040
- And half the town.
- He's got such a massive ego.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
- We'll stay one hour max.
- Sure.

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,720
- Are you okay?
- I rue all the questions.

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,920
From dad and mum.
And definitely from my brother.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,360
You don't have to
answer any of them.

11
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,920
- You know what my family is like.
- Lucky you have me then.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
Cheers.

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,320
So this is where you're hiding.

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,720
Several of the guests have arrived.

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,360
- Is Sebastian here?
- No, not yet.

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,960
We'll wait a bit longer then.
There is champagne, right?

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,440
Sure, lots.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,960
Are you really sure about this?

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,000
You go, I'll be right there.

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,560
There is one more thing.

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,080
Egil is here.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Was he not invited?

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,360
We always invite him.
That doesn't mean he's welcome.

24
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,800
THE BEACH HOTEL

25
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
- Stop it.
- Come on, sister.

26
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,560
- You know I don't like it.
- Relax.

27
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,600
So you've deigned to visit
us from Stockholm.

28
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,440
Where's you chic little girlfriend?

29
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,920
She'll kill you
if you call her that.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,280
She's over there
talking to dad's chic girlfriend.

31
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,440
- She has a name.
- Right. Vanja?

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,480
- Vendela.
- Sure. I've only met her once.

33
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,200
You'll just have to
visit us a bit more often.

34
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
I never hear from you.

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,080
Dad said you were...

36
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,720
That was more like...
Thanks. More as a kind of therapy.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,440
Okay. And what about the debt?

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Gabrielle and I have
a repayment plan now.

39
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,920
We've put it behind us.

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Where is Gabrielle by the way?

41
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,760
Okay.

42
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Martin's still going strong.

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
- Amazing that he's still around.
- I know.

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,440
- Dad doesn't change anything.
- No.

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
Is working for him still...
wonderful?

46
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,000
I wanted to check something with you
before I mention it to dad.

47
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,280
Some ideas regarding hotel PR.

48
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,960
You said "dad" and "new ideas"
in the same sentence.

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
Hi.

50
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,360
You wanted to accept the invitation,

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,400
so please make an effort now.

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,400
I remember when
we had the deck made

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,000
and Werner hired some cheap,
crappy labour in Poland.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,800
We had to tear it down
and start from scratch.

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,760
Werner...

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,560
- I was there, right?
- That's right.

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,040
I still can't believe you were
married to someone like him.

58
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Don't remind me.

59
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,320
If it hadn't been
for the children...

60
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,080
I don't understand
why Sebastian stays.

61
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,640
If you see him tell him
I want to see him. Alone.

62
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

63
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,040
- Where's Julie?
- Powdering her nose, I think.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,720
- She doesn't like these gatherings.
- You're so sensitive.

65
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,440
I'll get something to drink.

66
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,720
I have to ask you a favour.

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Make sure Julie is safe.

68
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,960
What do you mean?

69
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,840
I know someone broke in.

70
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,160
Huh? When?

71
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,320
Is that why you installed
the CCTV cameras?

72
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,520
Just keep an eye on her.

73
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,040
Can I trust you?

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,240
Of course.

75
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,440
- Must you really leave?
- Yes.

76
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
There's an issue with the register
in the spa department.

77
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,280
- I can take care of it.
- No, stay here and have fun. Okay?

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
- You deserve it.
- Let me know if you can't solve it.

79
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Promise.

80
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm on my way.

81
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,920
Hi. He was in a rush to leave.

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,960
There's an issue at Mistral.
Where's Petra?

83
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,960
I better make sure
she doesn't stray.

84
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,720
You do that.

85
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,240
- Sebastian! Hi!
- Hi, mum.

86
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,960
I've missed you so much.

87
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,720
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hi.

88
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm so happy you made it.

89
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,280
Excuse me.

90
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,000
That sounds very interesting.
Please proceed.

91
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,880
Sure. Wait.
No, sorry, it's no bother.

92
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,120
That same old trick?

93
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Fake phone call.
Boring party.

94
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,200
Here you go.

95
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,880
I don't know if I should drink more.
I feel a bit tipsy already.

96
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,040
Shirin. Sebastian's girlfriend.

99
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,920
Julie.

100
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
We're childhood friends.

101
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,840
Okay. Should we go in?
They're about to start.

102
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

103
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,080
You can make money as an artist
even before you die.

104
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,080
- As long as you are enterprising.
- And have the requisite talent.

105
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,200
It's the birthday boy.

106
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Isn't it time for your speech?

107
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,240
- I'm waiting for Sebastian.
- He's here.

108
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
- Is he?
- I just saw him.

109
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,680
Tone! I'm so sorry,
I didn't see that was you.

110
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,840
Tone, we need to speak later.

111
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,520
Come, let's say hi to Sebastian.

112
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,480
So...

113
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

114
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,320
Don't you want to watch the show?

115
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,760
Why are you here, dad?

116
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,680
You and Werner in the same room
is never a good idea, right?

117
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,440
No, but I have to do this.
I've postponed it for too long.

118
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,040
What do you have to do?

119
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,600
- Can we meet tomorrow?
- Sure.

120
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,880
- Great.
- Want to have lunch?

121
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll...

122
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,840
I think I'm going to disappoint you.

123
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,200
What is it? Should I be worried?

124
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
Don't worry about it now.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

125
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,480
- Okay?
- Okay.

126
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,080
Sebastian is back.

127
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,720
Yes.

128
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,760
He's here because of the party.

129
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,680
- Hi. Do you have a moment?
- I'm busy.

130
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,240
- Let's talk in your office. Now.
- Egil...

131
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,840
- Werner, it's time for your speech.
- Don't get involved in this.

132
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,360
Egil,
you've had an eternity to apologise.

133
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,960
Apologise?
You're bloody amazing.

134
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm here to help you.
Despite everything.

135
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,640
I don't need your help,
so just leave.

136
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,640
Alright, take it easy now.
The both of you.

137
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Dear guests.

138
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,000
We're here to celebrate
Werner's 60th birthday.

139
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
I...

140
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,960
I have had the honour
of working with Werner

141
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,960
for around 20 years.
And every day has been a pleasure.

142
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,320
But I won't bore you with that.

143
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,960
I'll hand over to the man,
we're here to celebrate,

144
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,560
Werner Gyllenmark.

145
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,240
Thank you for the kind words,
Svante.

146
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,040
When we first broke ground...

147
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,880
I remember all the snide remarks.

148
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Not many believed in
a big beach hotel in Saltsjövik.

149
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,200
But I knew we'd...

150
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
That I...

151
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,880
had made the right decision.
And see where we are today.

152
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,120
This is what I call
a real beach hotel.

153
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
Thanks.

154
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,080
But I wouldn't be here
without my family.

155
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,080
Their support has been crucial.

156
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,960
Sebastian, my son...

157
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,720
You have fought harder
than anyone else I know.

158
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,520
We weren't sure if you'd be able to
walk again after the accident.

159
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,360
Look at you now.
A wonderful young man.

160
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,200
Successful advertising executive
in Stockholm.

161
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,320
That's how it is. Nobody's perfect.

162
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,440
Petra. My first born.

163
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Who works at the hotel
and does a brilliant job.

164
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,840
Without love and family
life is worth nothing.

165
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
Vendela, come up here.

166
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,560
I am very happy to announce

167
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,680
that Vendela has agreed to
become my wife.

168
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,480
That being the case I will step down
as the hotel director.

169
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,760
There are some big changes coming.

170
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,160
I'd also like...

171
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,520
Dad!

172
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
- Egil!
- Dad!

173
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,680
- Call an ambulance.
- Dad?

174
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,360
Egil!

175
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,400
Is your car here? I'll drive you.

176
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,880
Hi. My dad was rushed here
in an ambulance.

177
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,640
- What's your dad's name?
- Egil Grip.

178
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,080
- I'll handle this.
- Okay.

179
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,160
- Egil is under observation.
- Is he awake? Can I see him?

180
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,320
No. Your mum is with him right now.

181
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,160
She is not my mum,
she's my dad's partner.

182
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,560
- What's happened with him?
- Indications are it an overdose.

183
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,720
I noticed you dad has
a Tramadol prescription.

184
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,240
Do you know
if he takes that every day?

185
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,280
He has an old knee injury.
It's possible.

186
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,760
This party he was at...
Do you know how much he'd drunk?

187
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,680
One glass, possibly two.
I don't know.

188
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,520
Tramadol and alcohol can be
a dangerous combination.

189
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,920
My dad would never take something
that was dangerous.

190
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,400
Has he been stressed lately?

191
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,560
He runs a hotel.
Being stressed comes with the job.

192
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,560
Wait here. I'll come and get you.

193
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,040
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Would you like me to stay?

194
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,560
I'LL STAY FOR A BIT

195
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
Here by yourself?

196
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,800
It's on the house.

197
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,200
Thanks. I should hope so.
It's my father-in-law's party.

198
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,840
Of course.
Sebastian's girlfriend. Wow!

199
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,000
- Where's Sebastian now?
- He gave Julie a lift to hospital.

200
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,680
Right. That was scary.

201
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
I hope it works out.

202
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,920
Who is this Julie?

203
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Sebastian said
they're childhood friends.

204
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,840
- Okay. More than friends, then.
- Perhaps. But it's a long time ago.

205
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,320
Thanks for the wine. It was nice.

206
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,040
I must eat something
before I get dizzy.

207
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
It'll work out, right?

208
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
Of course.

209
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,480
- You still have it.
- I can't take it off.

210
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,360
- I lost mine.
- Really?

211
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,200
In Switzerland.
I tried to find it in the snow.

212
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,720
My friends had to drag me away.
I almost got frostbite.

213
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,640
Okay. Wow.

214
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,240
Was it good there?

215
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,360
It wasn't what I expected,
but it worked out in the end.

216
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,440
I wanted to visit, but it didn't
seem like you wanted that.

217
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,840
You never asked.

218
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,520
You got so angry when I
didn't move there with you.

219
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,120
- Let's not talk about this now.
- Right.

220
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,760
But I want you to know
that I really wanted to.

221
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,520
It was difficult since mum got me
both a flat and a job in Stockholm.

222
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,240
- Have you seen Sebastian?
- He went to the hospital with Julie.

223
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,400
So, "big changes", huh?

224
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,520
I love her, Petra.

225
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,160
I know it might seem odd
hearing that from your old dad.

226
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,560
I was referring to the other thing.

227
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,320
Of course you did.

228
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,680
I think you're absolutely right.

229
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,240
The hotel needs a new direction.

230
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,560
What was the problem
with the old one?

231
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,880
I didn't mean it that way.

232
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,080
Have you decided
who will take over from you?

233
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,200
You'll be told the same time
as everyone else affected.

234
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,800
Tone will be told first, I presume.

235
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,680
Petra.

236
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,080
I know you'll be happy
with my decision.

237
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Two glasses. Thanks.

238
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,240
Cheers.

239
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,680
He'll be fine. You know that, right?

240
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm very sorry, but...

241
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,560
Egil developed difficulty breathing.
We did what we could, but...

242
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,400
Unfortunately...

243
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,080
his heart couldn't
cope with the strain.

244
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,360
This can't be true.
I was in there just now.

245
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,080
Do you hear me? It can't be true!
I was in there just now.

246
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,520
I was in there just now.
He was fine.

247
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Calm down.

248
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
- I just saw him.
- Mum...

249
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,000
Good thing you only turn 60 once.

250
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,200
- I thought you'd packed my things.
- I packed what I wanted to bring.

251
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
You can't be serious that you
care about any of these things.

252
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,840
- Maybe I do.
- Only how much they are.

253
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,000
In a week, Werner,
we've left all this behind us.

254
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,360
Sure. Maybe I should
have told them in my speech.

255
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't spring too many surprises
all at once. Talk to the family.

256
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,400
In private.

257
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,280
You know I love you, right?

258
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,480
So... how tired are you?

259
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,760
How tired am I?

260
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,080
Does the old man need his 10 hours
of sleep or...

261
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,680
- ...is there a bit of wiggle room?
- That depends.

262
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,920
- I'm so sorry.
- How did you get in?

263
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
- You don't answer your phone.
- What do you want?

264
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,160
Egil is dead.

265
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,560
What? What are you saying?

266
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,720
Werner?

267
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,000
The office. Now!

268
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,280
What's going on?

269
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,560
Here you go. They'll help you sleep.

270
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,400
Okay.

271
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
I can't believe Egil is dead.

272
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,640
- You must be Sebastian.
- I'm sorry. Remind me of your name.

273
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,040
Aksel. Didn't Julie mention that?

274
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Great that you could help
this evening.

275
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,120
I just wanted to say hi to Julie
before I leave.

276
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,480
She... She's sleeping.

277
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,560
Okay.

278
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,320
Morning. Did you sleep well?

279
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,800
I'd fallen asleep
when you finally came to bed.

280
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm sorry, but...

281
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,880
Egil's death changes things.

282
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,960
What things?

283
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,760
Julie is very likely
going to take over at Mistral,

284
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
but she's not ready yet.

285
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,880
That gives us a bit of wiggle room
which we should take advantage of.

286
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,600
Okay.

287
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
But what difference
does it make for us?

288
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,800
We're leaving everything behind.

289
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,440
Julie.

290
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,840
I'm so sorry.

291
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
I really am.

292
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,000
I didn't know he was that ill.
That it was so serious.

293
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
Why are you here?

294
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,880
I'll make breakfast for mum.

295
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,520
She can't handle getting out of bed.

296
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,320
I'll come along. I have to ask her
about dad's medicine.

297
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Can't that wait?
She's not doing well.

298
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,680
Neither are you.

299
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
Going somewhere?

300
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,120
I'm going back to Mistral

301
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,440
to talk to the staff
about what's happened.

302
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,200
Hello?

303
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,720
What are you thinking about?

304
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm sorry. I...

305
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,080
Yesterday was all about
handling the chaos.

306
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,560
It's beginning to sink in.

307
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
Of course.

308
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,400
He'd been in your life
for a long time.

309
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,040
I was so angry with him
when he and mum became a couple.

310
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,720
I blamed him for the divorce.

311
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,080
I just took dad's side.

312
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,560
- That's understandable.
- But...

313
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,800
Egil and dad were best friends.

314
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,040
They opened the beach hotel together
when we were children.

315
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,880
When they fell out Egil took over
some of the land and built Mistral.

316
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,120
What do you mean by "took over"?

317
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,400
I try to stay out of it,
but dad claimed he'd been cheated.

318
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,080
Nobody wants to dig deeper.

319
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,440
Okay.

320
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,360
I'm sorry, but I have to ask...

321
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,080
So Julie is Egil's daughter?

322
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,120
- Your half-sister?
- No.

323
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,000
Mum and Egil got together
when we were teenagers.

324
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,160
When you and Julie were together?

325
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,040
- Okay.
- Sorry. I should have told you.

326
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,680
She'd probably agree with that.

327
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,080
SALTSJÖVIK BEACH HOTEL

328
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,080
- Please don't touch.
- Okay. It's valuable. I understand.

329
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,160
- Is it the hotel's founder?
- Yes, on the right it's...

330
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,520
Werner Gyllenmark,
who ran the hotel for 20 years.

331
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,920
The other one is Egil Grip.
He's sadly no longer with us.

332
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,160
So... Welcome to
Saltsjövik Beach Hotel.

333
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,600
Are you the receptionist?

334
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,040
No, I've been the front desk manager
for many years.

335
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,760
- Where's the receptionist then?
- Mum, stop it.

336
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,560
I'll check you in.
No problem at all.

337
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,080
Shouldn't the receptionist
be here on her first day?

338
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm sure there's
a very good reason for that.

339
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,800
Louise Wickström.
Everybody calls me Lojsan.

340
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,520
Svante Jakobsson.
Front desk manager.

341
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,720
- You're really fond of that title.
- Right. Then you must be Lukas.

342
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Our new cleaner. Welcome.

343
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I suppose I might as well
give you a tour of the place.

344
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,160
You show the way, Svante!

345
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,640
How is Marianne?

346
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
- I got her to eat a little bit.
- That's good.

347
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,480
You know... I thought...
Do you have to...

348
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,000
It might be work.

349
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,040
- When you become the new CEO...
- He hasn't promised anything.

350
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,560
Who else would it be?
It's always been your goal.

351
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,720
No one knows the hotel better.
He can't choose anyone else.

352
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,960
Thank you. For always supporting me.

353
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,520
We support each other.

354
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,040
We're family. And now we should
become a family for real, I think.

355
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,280
If we want this to happen
we need to start now.

356
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,480
- You do want this, right?
- Sure, absolutely.

357
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,360
The whole process is just so...

358
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,160
It involves so many people.

359
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,640
It feels too private for that.

360
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Then we'll just have to find
a donor we know.

361
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,600
- You've found someone, right?
- I have.

362
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
MISTRAL

363
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,440
When check-out is completed
you list the room for cleaning.

364
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,280
Welcome to Saltsjövik.
Is this your first visit?

365
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,760
- Yes.
- Same here. I just moved here.

366
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,920
I hope you'll like it here
as much as I do. Your name?

367
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,840
- Henriksson.
- That's my maiden name.

368
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,640
Maybe we're related.
Where are you from?

369
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,720
- Gothenburg.
- The diamond of the west coast.

370
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Unfortunately, I have no relatives
there as far as I'm aware.

371
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,680
- Room 219.
- Thanks.

372
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,240
The lift is right there.

373
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,360
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

374
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,600
Did I do well?

375
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,960
Don't be too personal
with the guests.

376
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,760
So... the check-out process.

377
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,720
Hi, Petra.

378
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,600
- Am I disturbing?
- Yes, a bit, actually.

379
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,680
I just wanted to tell you I spoke
with Gabrielle at the party.

380
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,880
I'd be honoured to help you.

381
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,800
As your donor.

382
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,040
Considering how long
we've worked together...

383
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,520
Absolutely. Let's go through
the details in due course.

384
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,880
- I'm a little busy right now.
- Sure. Of course.

385
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,560
See you.

386
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,360
MOVING BOX

387
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,640
Life takes some unexpected turns.

388
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,520
Six months ago I'd have
never thought we'd end up here.

389
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,440
You didn't know dad was
sleeping with your best friend then.

390
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,360
Svante is just too funny.
What a character.

391
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,160
I'll go crazy if I have to clean up
after everyone every day.

392
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
- Then it's back to school.
- Forget it.

393
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Make up your mind!
You can't loaf around at home.

394
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,800
This is not my home!

395
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,520
- Where are you going?
- Out!

396
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,880
A coffee for sir!

397
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,960
You seem happy.
Have you met someone new?

398
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,320
No, I haven't met someone.
Quite the opposite, actually.

399
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,600
What do you think of the new one?
Lojsan, right?

400
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,000
"Lojsan". She wanted her nickname
on her name tag.

401
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,360
- Totally unacceptable.
- She sounds like fun.

402
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,240
She is fun.
Happy and nice towards everyone.

403
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,400
- That's terrible!
- She's just a bit... too much.

404
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,720
- She likes you.
- What do you mean?

405
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,720
I saw you showing her around.
The way she looked at you.

406
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,680
I've been a bartender long enough
to know that look.

407
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,320
No... She's just good at listening.

408
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,200
And that's important.

409
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,120
It's important.

410
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,240
Hi.

411
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,560
You can have an awesome sandwich
that I've made myself.

412
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,160
- Or you can have a roll.
- I'll take the roll, thanks.

413
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,480
- Roll. Great. And a coffee as well?
- Sure.

414
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,480
- You're not from here, right?
- No. Thank God!

415
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,120
- Staying long?
- I hope not.

416
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,560
This is actually a fun place.
Just last night...

417
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,600
...Werner Gyllenmark's biggest
competitor died at his party.

418
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,480
Are you almost done?

419
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,280
- His name's Egil.
- What's that?

420
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,840
The man you were blabbering on about
who died.

421
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,440
- He had a name.
- I'm sorry.

422
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,080
Her name is Rebecka.
Cleaner at The Beach Hotel.

423
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,200
MISTRAL

424
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

425
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,480
What are you doing?

426
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,400
Why didn't dad say anything
if his heart was that weak?

427
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,880
What is it?

428
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,840
Read it.

429
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,680
What is this?

430
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,720
"I have tried to reason with you,
but it's obvious you won't yield

431
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,560
until you've ruined it for us all.
I'm coming to the party.

432
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,920
I'm going to tell the truth.
This has to stop."

433
