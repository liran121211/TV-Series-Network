1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,120
It's been days. Petra's still gone.
She wouldn't just disappear.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,160
Do you take Werner Gyllenmark
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,880
I do.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,960
-Well done.
-Why did you meet with Sebastian,

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,680
without checking with me first?

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,880
Does everything have to be
about Sebastian?

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,680
Stop it.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,920
-Hey, Lojsan.
-What are you doing here?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
-Where are we going?
-Home!

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,040
I can't just leave everything,
you know that!

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,520
You promised me!

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,400
-Don't let him be mean.
-He's not mean.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,480
He might just not be as in love
with me as I am with him.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,960
If really want something,
you need to go for it, now.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,440
It's Julie's birthday and I thought
I'd throw her a bit of a party.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,160
I'd really like you to come.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,160
Julie Elisabeth Grip, will you do me
the honour of marrying me?

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
What's that?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
Where is she?

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
We said ten o'clock.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,200
I'll call and check with her.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,760
Do that.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,840
What's wrong?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,800
Nothing.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm not blind,
I can see something's wrong.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
Are you having second thoughts?

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,520
Did you consider my feelings when
you proposed in front of everyone?

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,120
Right... So you don't want to get
married anymore, or what?

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,720
-That's not it.
-No?

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,680
What else could I say
while everyone was staring at me?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Well, I didn't mean for you
to feel like this, at any rate.

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,360
I just wanted to share
with everyone.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,160
I know.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm just saying I'd rather have been
part of the decision.

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,440
It was wrong of me. Okay?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,560
But you and I want to be together,
and...

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
that's all that matters, right?

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,160
I'll call her.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,440
-Yes, hello?
-Hi, Rebecca.

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Why aren't you
at the board meeting?

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,920
Oh, sorry. I just thought
you'd want to cancel it.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,320
Why?

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,840
Because of Petra.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,520
What do you mean?

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,680
They found her.

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry, Julie. But she's dead.

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,560
What is it?

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,080
THE BEACH HOTEL

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,520
It's Petra.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,080
No...

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,280
I'll be back in a moment.

52
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,280
My little darling.

53
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,640
Well...

54
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,520
We've lost someone who meant a lot
to this hotel.

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,880
As you all do.

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,200
I see the Beach Hotel
a bit like a family.

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,200
We work together,
we laugh together...

58
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,960
Sometimes, we cry together.

59
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,480
Because we care about one another.

60
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
All of us.

61
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
How are you?

62
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,160
I don't know...

63
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,800
It's hard to take in.

64
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,280
I'm so sorry.

65
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,200
The police are here.

66
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Do you think you can talk to her?

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Hey...

68
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,000
-Stop. Leave me alone.
-Do you want something?

69
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
-No.
-You didn't eat breakfast.

70
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,680
-I don't want breakfast.
-What can I do then?

71
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,680
You can leave me alone.

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
Ding-dong.

73
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,600
Hey, what's your name again?

74
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,920
Svante, Front Desk Manager.

75
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,240
It's on your badge. Smart.
Could you arrange a towel for me?

76
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,880
The hotel towels are so small.

77
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
I'll send someone.

78
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Maybe you could send Lojsan.

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,480
Maybe you can ask her yourself.

80
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,240
Hey!

81
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,880
I heard. How awful.

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,200
How's Lukas?

83
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,960
-He's okay, I think.
-Are you sure?

84
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,800
He could be in shock. It's not
always obvious from the outside.

85
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,080
-Right?
-I don't know anything about it.

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,840
What he needs now is comfort
and peace around him, okay?

87
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,360
Are you giving me parenting advice?

88
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,240
No, it's not that.
I just want to see him.

89
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,560
Then do it,
that's why you're here, right?

90
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,760
He gives me excuses all the time.

91
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,640
This Lilja, do you know her?
Is she his girlfriend?

92
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
She's a friend.

93
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,440
I can't force him.

94
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,440
No...

95
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,240
I think the best way would be
to invite me over.

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Think about it.

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
So, what happens now?

98
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
We wait for the autopsy.

99
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,960
Do you have any idea
where she might have been?

100
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,560
Where she stayed the night?

101
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,160
What do you think you'll find?

102
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,040
She might have left something there,
a message, perhaps.

103
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,040
Petra wasn't suicidal.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, she was angry
and disappointed...

105
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,920
in me and her family,
but she'd never have done that.

106
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,160
Have you found her phone? She might
have messaged other people.

107
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,080
Um... I'll contact you
as soon as I hear anything.

108
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,040
She's not even listening to me.

109
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,280
Try to trust she's doing her job.

110
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,000
Just like with Egil?

111
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Because it's the same thing here.

112
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,000
Something doesn't add up.

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,520
Try not to think that way.

114
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
But why not?
Don't you believe me either?

115
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,080
What do you think
might have happened.

116
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Someone might have...

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
I can't bear even thinking about it.

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,880
I think you should try
to get some sleep.

119
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,040
You haven't stopped
since she disappeared.

120
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
I can't.
It would feel like giving up.

121
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,960
Like I didn't care anymore.

122
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,960
That's not true.

123
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
And you know it.

124
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Please, Marianne,
do you have to do that now?

125
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,600
I have to do something
or I'll lose my mind.

126
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,720
I understand, but you have to eat.

127
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,920
But not with you two.

128
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,160
I thought it might be good for you
so you don't have to be alone.

129
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,640
It's just as well I get used to it.

130
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,280
I think Werner would appreciate it.

131
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,240
Has he said that?

132
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
He's not talking to me much
right now.

133
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,520
That's how Werner is.

134
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,400
He never says anything
unless it's criticism.

135
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
I thought you two
might be able to talk.

136
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,240
He pushed Petra so hard.

137
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,160
Nothing she did was...

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
enough in his eyes.

139
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,760
Never good enough.

140
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,480
Don't you think
you need one another now?

141
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,320
Can't you come with me
to our place now?

142
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,880
You look after Werner,
I'll look after myself.

143
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to help.

144
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Go home to your studio, sweetheart.

145
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,240
I don't think you're cut out
for real life.

146
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,640
Sebastian?

147
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,120
Where are you going?

148
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,280
Work, I guess.

149
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,360
How... How are you?

150
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
I don't know.

151
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,240
I can't believe she's gone.

152
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm sorry, I need to go to work,
but can we talk later?

153
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,200
I guess I should congratulate you.

154
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
On what?

155
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh, thanks.

156
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,200
Were you surprised?

157
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,600
A bit.

158
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,000
I thought you hated that.

159
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,280
Popping the question
in front of everyone like that.

160
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
You hate that.

161
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
You don't know me
as well as you think.

162
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
Okay. I know now
why Aksel invited me anyway.

163
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
I thought you wanted to come.

164
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,000
He wanted me to witness it,
can't you see that?

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,800
So he only proposed to me
to get at you?

166
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,640
He just wants to fuck with me!

167
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,040
Did my saying yes have something to
do with you as well?

168
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
Not everything is about you
all the time!

169
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,200
Wait, Sebastian!

170
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,040
Room 305, first room to the right
after you get out of the lift.

171
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,960
Okay, thanks a lot.

172
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,280
What is it?

173
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Look what Torbjörn has written here.

174
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,240
"Petra, you were a great person
who touched people's hearts."

175
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,080
Well, wasn't she?

176
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,840
He couldn't know that.

177
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,680
No, Torbjörn can be
quite spontaneous.

178
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,080
Yes, you can tell.

179
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,320
Is that a bad thing? That he doesn't
take himself too seriously?

180
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,000
It didn't work out so well.

181
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,080
I just mean it wasn't so hard
to fall for him.

182
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,920
He's confident,
he jokes with people,

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,560
he's interested in sports and stuff,
not just his job.

184
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,160
Then we saw it was... her.

185
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,040
Jesus, how scary.

186
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,680
I've never seen
a dead person before.

187
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,840
Have you?

188
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,240
No, I hope I don't have to.

189
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,280
I have to go work.

190
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,560
Okay. Tell me if you need to talk.

191
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,200
I promise.

192
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Poor thing. That can't be easy.

193
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,480
What?

194
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
Have I spilt something on myself?

195
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
No.

196
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,520
Okay...

197
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,560
Can you really guarantee that?

198
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,360
I need to know
it won't look manipulated.

199
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,800
You don't need to worry about that,
I'll deal with the consequences.

200
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,600
If you can tell it's him
in the images,

201
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,200
you'll be paid
when I see the material.

202
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,200
No, I'll be in touch.

203
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,960
Yes, bye.

204
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,000
-How much did you hear?
-No idea.

205
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,680
Don't play dumb.

206
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,280
If I said anything,
no one would believe me anyway.

207
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,920
Especially not Julie.

208
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,880
I'd be very grateful.

209
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,680
So grateful you'd help me?

210
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,080
-With...?
-Julie.

211
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,040
Get her to like me a bit more.
She's still suspicious, I can tell.

212
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,360
-Sure.
-Thanks.

213
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
-Can I trust you then?
-What choice do I have?

214
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm sure you'll get inspired
down in France, don't you think?

215
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,600
I've actually sold several
paintings lately.

216
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,040
Wouldn't it be nice to get away
for a bit?

217
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,880
From this house?
It's like a tomb here.

218
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,840
I know it's a tragedy, boo hoo,
I know that.

219
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,080
But, Vendela,
it really has nothing to do with us.

220
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,200
Nothing I do helps anyway.

221
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,360
No, exactly.

222
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,360
He'll pick himself up, you'll see.

223
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,320
Out of his grieving.

224
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,440
Hey, a few weeks on the Riviera.

225
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,560
That would be so good for you,
don't you think?

226
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah, but I can't
just leave him now.

227
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,680
Why drag it out?

228
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,120
-Name?
-Fredrika Karlsson.

229
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,920
-Fredrika Karlsson, welcome!
-Thank you!

230
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Hey! Welcome, everyone.

231
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,080
You'll be in Conference Room Two,
it's through the doors to the left.

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,840
-Thank you.
-No need to thank me.

233
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,200
Mi casa es su casa!

234
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,560
If you get sick of talking about
work with each other,

235
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,720
there's a TV in the conference room
and the match is on channel 47.

236
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,360
You've got to have some fun too,
right?

237
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,200
But not too much fun,
or you'll get a hangover!

238
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,680
Welcome!

239
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,920
What are you doing?

240
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
What?

241
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
Can't I be a bit spontaneous
and fun?

242
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,760
"Mi casa es su casa"?

243
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,400
Yes, of course.

244
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,280
Hi, there!

245
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
Hello, there!

246
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,360
Vendela says
you've been here all day.

247
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,000
We have to start talking
about the funeral.

248
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,720
With Mum and Gabrielle.

249
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,360
Do you think I pushed her too hard?

250
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,960
-We don't have to talk about it now.
-Why not?

251
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,000
If you think so,
I'd like you to say.

252
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,320
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?

253
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,880
No, you think so, or no, you don't
want to talk and tell me the truth?

254
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,600
The money Petra took,
the bank has asked me several times,

255
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,200
and I have to tell them
what happened.

256
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
Maybe we should tell the police.

257
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,720
-That's not an option.
-We have to do something.

258
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,040
-It won't look good if it comes out.
-I won't drag Petra through the mud!

259
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
Do you understand?

260
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
-There you go.
-Thank you.

261
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,760
There you go!

262
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,080
When's Shirin's break?

263
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
She's working all evening.

264
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,160
-Anything in particular?
-No, I want to tell her something.

265
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,840
Why don't you just give up?

266
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,640
I get it, she's beautiful and smart,
funny, wonderful, but...

267
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
there will never be anything
between you.

268
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
She's nice to you
because that's who she is.

269
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,800
But she's with your boss.

270
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,520
I'm not interested in Shirin.

271
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Are you trying to convince me
you're not in love with her?

272
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,720
Okay, I'll tell her another day.

273
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,520
Have you had an okay night?

274
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,160
As good as it could be.

275
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,080
I know this is a bit of
an uncomfortable question, but...

276
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,680
How were yours and Petra's finances?

277
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,720
We got by.

278
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,480
We're saving again.

279
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Or, we were, I mean.

280
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,440
Do you have joint accounts
and all that?

281
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,880
I look after most of it, why?

282
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
A large withdrawal was made
from the hotel.

283
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,760
Right before Petra disappeared.

284
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,600
Are you sure it was her?

285
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,520
She told me she was gambling again.

286
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,920
We need to find out
what happened, right?

288
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,920
Okay, here are last year's books,
balance sheet.

289
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,880
-And revPAR month for month...
-Sorry, revPAR?

290
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,120
Average revenue per room,
you could say.

291
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
-Okay.
-Try to read it by tomorrow.

292
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,600
Tomorrow?

293
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,360
Running a hotel involves a bit more
than smiling at guests.

294
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,760
-Right. No problem.
-Good.

295
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,960
-There.
-Thanks.

296
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,440
Just call if you have any questions.

297
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,760
I really want this to work.

298
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,360
Me too.

299
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,400
Aksel says hi.

300
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,560
Right, well... tell him hi back.

301
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,760
Breakfast was really good.

302
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
Nothing beats your scrambled eggs.

303
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,840
So, what can I do in Saltsjövik
now I just have one afternoon left?

304
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,960
Okay.

305
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,120
-Okay?
-You can come for dinner.

306
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
Lovely. I can cook.

307
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,760
Steak, just how you like it.
Do you have a barbecue?

308
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,480
No, and you'll come at seven
and leave at nine.

309
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,720
Okay, can I bring a bottle of wine?

310
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,920
No, because we won't drink it.

311
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,440
A real family dinner.

312
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,720
Hey, don't call it that.

313
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm grateful.

314
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,080
Truly.

315
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,400
I thought you'd stopped
with that nonsense.

316
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,480
Never.

317
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,880
Check out the steam boat harbour,
it's worth seeing.

318
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,120
Okay. I'll do that.

319
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,280
See you.

320
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,880
Ah, there you are.
Nice to see you up.

321
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,400
So sweet.

322
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,720
-Yeah.
-Was it taken here?

323
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,280
No, down by the dock.
Petra was ten.

324
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,200
Whenever I made the hotel's order at
the fishmonger, Petra came with me.

325
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,040
And when we were done,
she'd nag me until I bought two...

326
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,400
prawn sandwiches and we sat
by the dock and...

327
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,520
It was our thing.

328
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,520
Hey, bartender?

329
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,760
Can't you be sweet
and pour me a glass of wine?

330
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,920
-No.
-Um, yes.

331
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,440
What?

332
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm not going to let you get drunk
now before an evening shift!

333
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm kidding.

334
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm going to go eat. See you later.

335
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,720
Yes.

336
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,320
Will that work out?

337
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
Shirin's temporary,
will she get to stay?

338
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,400
She's fantastic. She works hard,
she's lovely with the guests...

339
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,880
Great.

340
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,280
-Considering who she's with.
-Sebastian...

341
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,920
Have you seen how he pines
after Julie Grip?

342
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,160
Huh? It's ridiculous.

343
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,440
I almost caught them
in the office once.

344
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,640
Are you sure about that?

345
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,040
-Shirin deserves something better.
-Oh, like what?

346
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,880
Remember what you promised me
you'd never become?

347
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,600
Probably a lot of things.

348
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,360
You said you'd never be one of those
pathetic men hitting on young girls.

349
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,680
-You've misunderstood.
-Have I?

350
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,880
Yes, and I don't need your advice.

351
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Take care of your own
sorry situation instead.

352
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,200
I don't understand.

353
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,560
Svante, do you know why
you'll never get Lojsan?

354
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,880
Because you're a coward.

355
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Who's never dared to risk
a single thing your whole life.

356
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,800
I'll skip the coffee today.

357
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,440
I went by the hotel.

358
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,080
I couldn't face it today.

359
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,000
I was a jerk to you yesterday.

360
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,640
I don't know how
I could say those things. I...

361
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,160
-I'm sorry.
-You've just lost your sister.

362
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,560
It's no excuse.

363
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
I hate fighting with you.

364
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,440
If you want to be with Aksel,
I have to accept it.

365
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,480
Why did you come?

366
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,400
This, between us...

367
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,120
We can't keep this up.

368
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,800
We're hurting each other,
and other people.

369
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,960
I know.

370
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,040
So this is the hole you hang out in,
these days?

371
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
I like it.

372
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm usually tired after work so
I like taking it easy here.

373
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Right, but is cleaning really a job?

374
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,800
I'm kidding.

375
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,840
Mum looks good.

376
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Maybe...

377
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Do you know if she's met someone?

378
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,400
It's fine, you can tell me.

379
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,480
I don't know.

380
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,640
It's a shame for her to live alone
in that house.

381
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,840
-It can't be easy.
-Are you and Mum...?

382
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,520
We'll see. I'm working on it.

383
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,080
That's what you want too, I guess?
To be a family again?

384
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,320
I was thinking about this dinner...

385
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
It might not be much fun for her.

386
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,800
It's fine with me if you skip it.

387
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,880
Mum and I have some important stuff
to talk about.

388
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,480
You'd rather hang out with your...
friend, right?

389
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,000
What's her name?

390
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
-Lilja.
-Lilja...

391
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,240
Cute.

392
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,120
What are we doing now?

393
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
I don't know.

394
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,200
Do you think this was wrong?

395
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,960
No.

396
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,440
I'm just so...
scared to hurt anyone.

397
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,520
Me too.

398
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,200
But I don't regret this.

399
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,760
-I have to go.
-Why?

400
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,480
What if Shirin turns up?

401
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
She's working late.

402
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,680
I know, but it feels...

403
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,200
I know, but...

404
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,600
You're here now
and I don't want to let you go.

405
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,520
I'll...

406
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,200
-I'll call you.
-Okay...

407
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,280
Julie?

408
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,120
Are you sure everything's fine?

409
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,560
Yeah.

410
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,160
My God, what a boring evening.

411
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,760
Yeah, it's really dead here.
It hasn't been this dead for ages.

412
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,880
You have to cheer me up.

413
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,880
Say something funny.
Don't you know any jokes?

414
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,120
No...

415
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
But there's something
I'd like to say.

416
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,920
Okay, go.

417
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,160
I'm in love with you.

418
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,200
Okay...

419
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,040
That was actually quite good.

420
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,120
It wasn't a joke.

421
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,480
What are you doing?

422
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,000
-I had to tell you...
-Stop talking now!

423
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,600
Shirin... haven't you noticed?

424
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,600
No, go to hell!

425
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,640
My dad is so embarrassing.

426
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,000
I bet your parents are really cool.

427
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,440
Not really.

428
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,800
-Do they live in Saltsjövik?
-Yep.

429
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,760
We don't have much contact.

430
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,200
It's better that way.

431
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,600
Well, I should go home now.

432
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,760
I'm sure they're done eating.

433
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,800
You can sleep here if you like.

434
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,200
We can watch a movie.

435
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,760
Let me.

436
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,680
That was delicious.

437
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,200
As usual.

438
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,680
I don't know why Lukas didn't come.

439
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,760
You're doing a great job with him.

440
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,520
But I think he needs his father.

441
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,640
Someone to set boundaries.

442
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,480
He misses me.

443
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
He misses being a family.

444
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,360
-He said so.
-Did he?

445
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,440
I know I made a mistake, but...

446
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,680
Forgetting the washing,
that's a mistake.

447
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,960
Sleeping with my best friend,
that's something else.

448
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,040
I really want to show you I'm sorry.

449
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,560
But it's a bit hard
now that we live so far apart.

450
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm not moving back to Jönköping,
you can forget that.

451
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,840
No, I see that you like it here.

452
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,640
I'd love to stay a few more days.

453
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
But it's so expensive at the hotel.

454
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,960
Can't you give me one more chance?

455
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,320
For Lukas' sake.

456
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,360
Please.

457
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,000
Two nights. On the sofa.

458
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll take it.

459
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:50,400
CAUSE OF DEATH: EGIL GRIP
TRAMADOL OVERDOSE

460
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,360
Aren't you coming to bed soon?

461
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,960
I'll be right there.

462
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
You can't sit up all night.

463
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,040
What are you even working on?

464
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,200
Nothing.

465
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,600
I just wanted to check something.

466
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,320
Okay.

467
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:36,440
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU.
WHEN CAN I SEE YOU?

468
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,800
Now she'll be murdered.

469
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,360
Don't go down there.

470
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,320
Of course she'll go down there.

471
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,160
Ha! See? She didn't die.

472
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,960
-Shit, did you see that?
-Yes.

473
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Tell me when it's over!

474
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,640
Now.

475
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,240
Damn you!

476
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,080
-Should I do that to you?
-No!

477
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,280
No, Lukas! It's not funny!

478
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,720
We should probably go to sleep now.

479
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,560
Sebastian was here.

480
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,520
He said Petra had taken money
from the hotel.

481
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,760
What?

482
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,960
Do you think it's true?

483
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,120
I don't know.
But it wouldn't surprise me.

484
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,840
No... it wouldn't be the first time.

485
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,560
How could she disappear
with so many questions?

486
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,160
Do you think she...?

487
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
I don't know anymore.

488
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,160
Is that..?

489
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,160
They're Petra's things.

490
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,680
She had them when they found her.

491
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,000
Don't you want to open it?

492
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know if I can.

493
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,080
We'll do it together.

494
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,680
God... Okay.

495
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,640
That's not hers.

496
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,480
No.

497
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,280
It's Sebastian's.

498
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,960
What did you want?

499
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,520
I went down to the fishmonger.

500
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,560
I know this is your memory of Petra.

501
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,200
I didn't get to know her that well,
but...

502
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,320
I thought we could
sit here together.

503
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, Vendela.

504
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,600
It's horrible you never got to know
one another.

505
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,960
Yes, though I did a little.

506
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,560
I think you two were alike.

507
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,080
You think she was like me?

508
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,320
A bit sharp...

509
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,880
with a big heart.

510
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,400
You didn't think you'd be here
with an old crying man

511
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,200
when you married me.

512
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,600
An old crying man whom I love.

513
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,840
WHY DON'T YOU REPLY?
HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

514
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,000
WHEN CAN I SEE YOU TODAY?

515
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,160
WHENEVER!

516
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,520
-Yes?
-Can you come to Mistral right away?

517
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,920
-You have to see something.
-Well, I...

518
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,760
-I...
-It's important.

519
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,840
Okay, I'm on my way.

520
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,480
I know you're angry.

521
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,240
So just stay away.

522
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,680
Listen, nothing needs to change,
I won't...

523
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,520
Are you going to quit
because of this?

524
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,840
Should I quit every time
a colleague tries to pick me up?

525
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,440
I wouldn't be able to keep a job.

526
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,400
That's not what I did.

527
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,240
No, right. You're in love with me.

528
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,560
Why did you think
I even needed to know?

529
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,400
Are you going to tell Sebastian?

530
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,200
Have you lost it? He'd go crazy!

531
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,480
-You don't know him.
-It's just that I...

532
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,440
Yeah, I know you've seen him
grow up here and all that.

533
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,720
But you know nothing
about he and I, okay?

534
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,880
Shirin, I'd do anything for you.

535
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,280
You shouldn't settle for less.

536
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,640
-What is it?
-You have to see this.

537
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,640
It's from a security camera.

538
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,960
-When did you get these?
-From Marianne.

539
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,120
But they didn't seem to work
for some reason.

540
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,520
So I asked the security company
to email them directly to me.

541
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,920
Right, okay.

542
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,800
-That could be anyone.
-Don't you recognise the jacket?

543
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,360
It's the same one he had on
at Werner's party.

544
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,200
I can zoom in a bit.

545
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,960
Here, look at the time.

546
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,880
He said he came straight
from the train to the party?

547
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,600
How could he have been here then?

548
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,920
And why would lie
about not having been here?

549
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,680
Look, there.

550
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,680
See? It's him.

551
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,000
He lied to you, Julie.

552
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,440
