With a furious Monroe by their side, Nick and Hank race against the clock to find Rosalee.", "When the body of a woman who went missing a few years ago turns up, they try to find where she's been and who took her. What they don't know is that she was taken by four orphan kids who want a mother. And when they meet Rosalee they choose her to be their next mother.\u2014rcs0411@yahoo.com", "Having accepted his role as father, Nick moves with Adalind and their baby son into a remote private 'fortress' home, without 'marital' relationship, yet accepts even to move into a single bedroom 'for now'. Meisner tells Renard about king Frederick's fatal helicopter 'accident' and Viktor's succession with tactical Resistance-support 'for now', not that he's keeping Trubel captive.
