Only apparently dead, they arise as extremely violent zombies. Their feral creator in Portland, a voodoo 'baron', is in league with captain Renard's rogue brother Eric, who visits from Vienna to discuss dynastic matters. It concerns a royal bastard child, equally dangerous and valuable, born by Hexenbiest Adalind, who is torn between conflicting advice and tricked into 'signing' a gypsy-style contract. Meanwhile Monroe, Rosalee and Bud oblige Juliet's stubborn demand to see what Nick intended to reveal before her affliction.
