As Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby), Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) work to stop the killings, Capt. Renard (Sasha Roiz) considers an offer that will bring him closer to claiming his destiny. Meanwhile, Eve's (Bitsie Tulloch) further investigation of a recent incident raises new questions.", "When ambitious young \"luchador\" (Mexican costumed wrestler) Goyo is tired of playing the staged loser, old mask artist Benito makes and gives him a winner's mask. Goyo ignores the warning never to wear it outside the ring, and comes under its murderous influence, and it sort of fuses with his skin.
