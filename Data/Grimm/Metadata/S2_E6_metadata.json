But he's called away urgently by Monroe, who has a feral visitor: a ruthless killer, yet also a friend of his, who only pretended to take a contract for Monroe's death to warn him after 'accidentally' killing the initial hit man. Nick, who wants her for at least two earlier murders, grudgingly cooperates, going so far as to allow her to pretend to be his partner. To get to the royal presumed to have hired the killer, Monroe must fake his death with a potentially lethal potion, instructed over the phone by Rosalee, who visits a very ill relative, after a dream date with Monroe. The royal is in awkward league with Renard.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2336276", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 1370, "number_of_episodes": 123}
