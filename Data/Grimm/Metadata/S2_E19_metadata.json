Besides Nick, the case seems to be followed only by an 'ufologist' or alien-hunter, who in fact chases the very feral species. Monroe recognizes the print Nick made from his key as part of a medieval map as Swabia, Renard explains the keys combine into a map to a terrible treasure hidden by seven crusader Grimms. Juliette swears Monroe to secrecy, being insecure about her reemerging love memories.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2850170", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1140, "number_of_episodes": 123}
