1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
[music playing]

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,240
[birds chirping and wings flapping]

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
[sheep bleating]

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,440
[Jeremy] On my farm,
most of the land is used to grow crops.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,880
But not all of it.

6
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,039
Nearly 300 acres is like this, natural,

7
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,679
wild,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,360
and teeming with rare grasses,
with flowers,

9
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,199
and bees.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,920
This part of the farm
is so ecological and diverse

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,080
and sustainable
and good for global warming.

12
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,679
DEFRA, which is the Department of...

13
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,519
something...

14
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,639
Food and Rural Affairs,

15
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,959
gives me actual cash money

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,720
to not grow crops on it.

17
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,999
All I have to do in return
is mow it once a year.

18
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,759
And that gave me an idea.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,400
Instead of using a machine to mow it,

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,160
why not use sheep?

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,159
Sheep keep everything nice and tidy,

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,720
and they fertilize the soil,

23
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,039
and I can sell their babies for profit.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
It's a genius business plan.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm basically Alan Sugar in wellies.

26
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,039
Having decided to be a sheep farmer,

27
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,879
I went to a nearby market to buy stock,

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,640
and immediately there was a problem.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, I mean
I'm just completely at a loss.

30
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,359
I'm at a loss. I don't know...

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
Are they the same as them?

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,320
I know how my mum felt
when she was trying to buy a car.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,960
They all look exactly the same.

34
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,079
Or my dad,

35
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,239
when he was listening to pop music.

36
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,959
Spice Girls, Led Zeppelin,
all the same to him.

37
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,999
To guide me
through this woolly labyrinth

38
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,159
I spoke to Kevin
from the National Sheep Association,

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,320
which hilariously is known as the NSA.

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,600
Is there like, a Freesian Bull Institute?

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,440
Like FBI and CIA and NSA?

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,120
I can't say too much about it.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,600
The NSA, that's just brilliant.

44
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,119
Have you looked after sheep before?

45
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,879
No?

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
So you want something
that's gonna look after you

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
as well as you looking after them.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,800
Right, so, but these are all lady sheep,
aren't they?

49
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,719
Yes.

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
So, if I buy 80 sheeps...

51
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,719
Yeah.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
How many man sheeps do I need?

53
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,839
-Uh...
-Eighty?

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
Well, you could get away with one,

55
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,239
but then you might have a risk
if there was a problem with that ram.

56
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,799
But he's got to... mmm...

57
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,199
Yeah, so I would go over... probably
err on the side of caution and go for two.

58
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,999
What? So each man sheep
will impregnate 40 lady sheeps.

59
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,239
Yeah, easily, yeah.

60
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,679
Not a bad job.

61
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,079
In a very short space of time as well.

62
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,240
[Jeremy] We then had to decide
what sort of lady sheep would be best.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Well, what you can see here,

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,760
you've got a lot of north country mules.

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,440
North country mules is a good sheep
that will look after you as well.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,560
Um, it creates a really good mum.

67
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,799
She gets plenty of milk,

68
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,839
plenty of lambs.

69
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,960
They lamb quite easily and nicely,

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
and it wouldn't be a bad shout
as a sort of start off...

71
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,079
North, right, so a north country,

72
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,079
north face, north-kin.

73
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,479
North country mule.

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,480
Right.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,400
[Jeremy] We then had to decide
which north country mules would be best.

76
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,439
[Kevin] So you got yourself a catalogue?

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
Um, yeah, no.

78
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,999
No, right.

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
So you need to get a catalogue,

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,600
and that will give you a list,

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,120
so you can see who they are,
where they are.

82
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,279
[Jeremy] This one's
electric fence trained.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
[Kevin] Well, have you got fences?

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
Not really.

85
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,639
No? How are you going to keep them in?

86
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,559
Walls.

87
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,879
They could jump the walls.

88
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,239
They can't jump a wall.

89
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,079
-Well, how big's your wall?
-About that big.

90
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,120
[Kevin] Well, it's hardly Mexico, is it?

91
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,359
[Jeremy] Kevin had assured me

92
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,920
that north country mules
are very calm sheep,

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,360
but when they came into the auction ring

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,600
there was some evidence
to suggest that they're not.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh!

96
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,519
Ohh!

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,640
Still, at least the auctioneer
was easy to understand.

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,600
[auctioneer speaking indistinctly]

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,240
[Jeremy] By nodding occasionally,
I seem to be buying stuff.

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
133. 134. 134.5.

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,440
[Jeremy] And I was.

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Yes.

103
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,679
[Jeremy] At the end of the sale,
I had spent a whopping £11,000.

104
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,919
But on the upside,
I was now a sheep farmer.

105
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,240
Thirty, 40, 50. 60, 78.

106
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,239
Seventy eight sheep. We're there.

107
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,079
[Jeremy] Because Kevin had told me
that sheep can jump over walls,

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I then had to spend another £2,700

109
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,559
on a self-assembly electric fence.

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,959
Now what they want me to do

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,880
is walk around the field
with this three times.

112
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,039
Well, I'm not going to.

113
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,559
God, I'm clever.

114
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,399
Rightio. Is this what it's like?

115
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,680
Green. That's the earth, good.

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Red,

117
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,599
onto the fence.

118
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,159
And then these go onto the battery.

119
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
Here we go.

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,080
Uh, could be.

121
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,520
Ow! [exclaims]

122
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,879
Ah!

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,440
Ah!

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,400
You bastard!

125
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Stupid.

126
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,799
Right. Now, that.

127
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,320
RIght, here we go, here we go.

128
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,999
This time the zoo
is going to be operational.

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,920
With this feat of engineering completed,

130
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,200
I was ready for the arrival
of my new flock.

131
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,320
Oh, what the hell,

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
here they come.

133
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
Look at that.

134
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
And straight into my hotel.

135
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,159
Yeah!

136
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
-So that's it?
-[man] That's it.

137
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,679
-Are they going to be happy?
-They look very happy.

138
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,919
I'm sure they will be.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
[Jeremy] And what have we got to do
first of all? Worm them?

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
[man 1] Worm them first. Yeah.

141
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
[man 2] And look after them.

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
[Jeremy] You know
they're gonna get looked after.

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,560
-Well, thanks very much.
-[man 2] Yep.

144
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,559
Take, take care of yourselves.
Thank you. Safe trip.

145
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,799
-Enjoy them.
-Yeah, I'm going to actually.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
It's quite a nice thing, really.

147
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,760
A very nice thing
to be leaning on the gate,

148
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,319
looking at my new sheeps.

149
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,800
[sheep bleating]

150
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,039
[country rock music playing]

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,080
[Jeremy] After a few days of tractoring,

152
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,359
I return to the sheep
for my first big job.

153
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,359
Hello sheeps.

154
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,799
Right, this field,

155
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,320
with the sheeps in it,
is now full of diseased feces.

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,240
Because the sheeps have been wormed,

157
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,879
the worms have come out,

158
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,879
and now I've got to take
all that electric fence up again

159
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,919
and re-build it somewhere else

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,160
and then move the sheeps into that field.

161
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,999
To move sheep around,
you normally use a sheep dog.

162
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,959
But I didn't have one of those,
so I came up with another solution.

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
[automated voice] Take off.

164
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,719
Up,

165
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,160
down,

166
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,319
swivel, swivel.

167
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Clever thing about this drone.

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,280
It was designed for
work in search and rescue,

169
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,880
so it's got a speaker on it, just here,

170
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,120
which can transmit messages
to stranded climbers and hikers.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,640
But, I've modified the message,
as I'm using it as a sheep drone.

172
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,839
So, ready.

173
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,760
[drone barking]

174
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,279
It flies around,
herds the sheep, barking at them.

175
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,320
They think it's an airborne dog.

176
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,879
Right.

177
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
Let's go round up some sheep.

178
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,239
So, you know,
a really good sheep dog these days

179
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
will set you back £20,000,

180
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
and you won't be able to use it
for six months till it gets used to you.

181
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,239
This only cost £2,500.

182
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,879
And it was money well spent.

183
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,280
Look, it is working.

184
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,959
Look at it!

185
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,639
Yes, come on, through the gate,
through the gate, through the gate.

186
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,760
They're heading for the gate,
heading for the gate.

187
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,199
With no help from my girlfriend Lisa.

188
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,999
[Lisa] They can jump.

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,600
[Jeremy] I got them going
in the right direction.

190
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,719
[Lisa] Go on, off you go.

191
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,319
[Jeremy] Yes, lovely. Look.

192
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,959
[drone continues barking]

193
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,319
In just 25 minutes,
I've completely mastered sheeping.

194
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,719
[Lisa] Jeremy, you're going too fast,
I can't stop them going into the village.

195
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,399
[Jeremy] Oh, darn. Shit.

196
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
[Lisa] Jesus, calm down.

197
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,759
[Jeremy] For heaven's... please stop.

198
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,239
[man] Get up there.

199
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,840
[Jeremy] Then, with no help
from the film crew...

200
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,080
[man] Quickly.

201
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,959
[Jeremy] I finally got them
into their new field.

202
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,439
Phew. I'm gonna have a coronary...

203
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,839
How fast do they move?
I mean, this thing is good.

204
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,879
I mean, as you know,
I'm an incredible athlete,

205
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,240
and can run at phenomenal speeds,
but I can't keep up with the sheep.

206
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,200
[laughing] I was too surprised.
I did not expect that.

207
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,639
Is that fence on?

208
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
I don't... I'm not gonna check it, am I?

209
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,959
Just grab it. Grab a long piece of grass.

210
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,079
Okay, okay, okay.

211
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,520
-And if you touch the end...
-Yep.

212
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,640
...you'll... you'll feel
something very gentle.

213
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,119
Ooh, oh, yeah. It's on.

214
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,599
-Just...
-Ha-ha.

215
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,239
-That's on, then.
-Your fault, right?

216
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,240
-Ooh, am I gonna get you back. Ha-ha.
-[laughs]

217
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,080
Oh, it's properly hard work.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,160
Despite my exhaustion,
I had to get back to tractoring

219
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,400
and didn't see the sheep again
for two days.

220
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh, no, there's a lame one.

221
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,919
Oh, no. There, look.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,600
Yeah, front left leg won't go down.

223
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,519
Oh, there's two that are lame.
There are two lame ones.

224
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,080
How have they done that?

225
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,360
The least dangerous field in Christendom.
Why have they...

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
Very worried,
I went back to the farm office

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,240
and tried to diagnose the problem myself.

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,280
-[sighs]
-Which was revolting.

229
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
Oh, no.

230
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,880
Prolapsed vagina. Cervical prolapse.

231
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,360
An erupting udder with severe mastitis.

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
Oh, no, I don't want
to have to deal with that.

233
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
But I want to know
why they're limping, not...

234
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,439
They're not limping because their vagina
has exploded, which...

235
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,719
That book's obsessed with sheep's vaginas.

236
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,880
Ah. Common foot problems. CODD.

237
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,800
"Ulcerated area appears
at the top of the hoof,

238
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,039
infection spreads under the horn
and down to the toe.

239
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,640
The horn detaches
and falls off and there's...

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,040
Oh, hair loss stretching."

241
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,159
Why can't sheep
just get ordinary diseases?

242
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,439
I was out of my depth,

243
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,159
so despite the cost,
I had to call in Delwyn the vet.

244
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
-Hi there.
-Yep.

245
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,800
-Thanks for coming out.
-That's okay.

246
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,999
-Are there four broken ones?
-Yes. Yes.

247
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,600
I thought there were only two.

248
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,759
No, they've got
quite a bit of swelling there.

249
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,880
-You can see where it's bleeding.
-Oh, no, it's blood.

250
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,320
[Delwyn] Yeah. So, I think what we'll do
is we'll put an antibiotic spray on them

251
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,079
and we'll also give them an injection
just to kill the pain.

252
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,439
[Jeremy] So, erm, I've only got 78
and I've broken four of them.

253
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,959
Don't be hard on yourself,
I mean... [laughs]

254
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,599
I don't think you need to worry
a huge amount on that front.

255
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,839
Okay, well,
I'll let you administer antibiotics.

256
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,959
-Yep.
-How much are they? How much is this?

257
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,839
Just so I've got a vague idea.

258
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,199
I'll think of a number and double it,
really, and go from there, really.

259
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,840
[soothing music playing]

260
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,119
[Jeremy] A few days later, having eaten
everything in their new field,

261
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,960
the sheeps needed to be moved again.

262
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,759
[drone barking]

263
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,480
And this time, I discovered

264
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,039
that sheep are not only
the most sickly animals in the world,

265
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,880
they're also the most disobedient.

266
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,560
[drone continues barking]

267
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,479
They're just ignoring it now, look.

268
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,920
Look at the... look right above you.
Dog, grr! Fierce dog.

269
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,600
And then, for no reason I could fathom...

270
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,839
No! Don't do that.
Oh, shit, you bolly.

271
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,959
Doie!

272
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,119
The honeymoon was clearly over.

273
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
No, this way, come on.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,840
Oi! You're going the wrong way again now.

275
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,719
It's like they could sense
I was a new boy.

276
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,079
Oh, no. No, they're going back!
They just...

277
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,079
Oh, for fucking hell.

278
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,479
And they were going
to make the most of it.

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
Oh, shit. For heaven's... please stop.

280
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
-Right.
-[man] Good?

281
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,520
Here we are in the middle of the night,

282
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,439
erm, sorting the sheep out, again.

283
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,959
-[sheep bleating]
-[food rattling in bucket]

284
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,119
Sheep!

285
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Sheep!

286
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
For fucks sake.

287
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,359
No, no, no, no, no.

288
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,519
Need help.

289
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
No, no, no, no, no.

290
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Fuck it, go live in that field,
get run over. See if I care.

291
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,479
Oh, fucking hate sheep.
I fucking hate them.

292
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,239
I cannot wait to eat them. I cannot wait.

293
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,159
Along with the gum chewing insolence,

294
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,640
the sheep were also extremely destructive.

295
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
This is stupid.

296
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,840
Still, this relentless vandalism
does provide work

297
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,719
for a wonderful local chap called Gerald.

298
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,560
Hi, Gerald.

299
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,839
I love chatting with him,
even though most of the time,

300
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,879
I'm never entirely sure
what we're chatting about.

301
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
So, how's this coming along?

302
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,959
Well, know what that one.
I mean, no quite done deed.

303
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,999
I mean, if this is if animals or a horse,
so you'll, yeah, push it

304
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,480
and you'll pull a fat load now.

305
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,799
I'll tell you what, there was a quarry,
you know, that field's called a quarry.

306
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,719
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,319
[Gerald] And then, then you...
[speaking indistinctly]

308
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
See what I mean?

309
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,639
Oh, yeah, yeah.

310
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,760
[speaking indistinctly]

311
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,440
They put masks on, it's always sort of...

312
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,399
[speaking indistinctly]

313
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,400
[laughing]

314
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,879
[Jeremy] As Gerald has 40 miles of walls
to maintain on my farm, I left him to it.

315
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,440
Take care, see you soon.

316
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,479
And got back to the job of sheeping.

317
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,440
So far, the sheeps have been getting
their water from a temporary supply,

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,680
but now, I wanted to reactivate
all the abandoned troughs

319
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,519
that were scattered around the farm.

320
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,599
Now...

321
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,800
However, when I opened
any of the stopcocks...

322
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,080
no water was coming through.

323
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,440
Shit.

324
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,320
Feeling like Jean de Florette,
I set about investigating the problem.

325
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,959
Right. The good news is my mate Alex
who farms over here

326
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,480
has given me this map from 1922,

327
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,959
of where all the water pipes
are on what was the Sarsden estate,

328
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,039
and this is a part of what was it.

329
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,480
It comes down from that one.

330
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,559
So there is an entire network
of very, very old pipes

331
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,279
crisscrossing this farm.

332
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,400
Clearly, the first job was finding out
if those pipes still existed,

333
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,640
and the crew photographer
and part-time druid, Ellis,

334
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,320
suggested I try water divining.

335
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,560
Thumbs at the top,

336
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,960
and then you just let it loose
and then basically just do that.

337
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,239
[Jeremy] To humor him, I said
I'd wander about with his coat hangers,

338
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,919
but when I passed
a trough full of rain water...

339
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,240
Look at that. [gasps]

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
That is bizarre.

341
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,999
Look at... look at that.

342
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,080
[laughs] That's astonishing.

343
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,520
The druid also said
that when the wires crossed,

344
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,279
I'd be directly above a pipe.

345
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
Ooh.

346
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
Ooh, hello.

347
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,999
Look at... look at this.

348
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,919
Yep, this is exactly where it says
on the map that the pipe would be.

349
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,080
Having used witchcraft
to establish the pipes still exist,

350
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,280
I reckoned that somewhere,
there must be a tank that fed them all.

351
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,559
And that, logically, it would be
located on high ground.

352
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,319
Make sense that it would be up here

353
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,560
because this is
just about the highest point of the farm.

354
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,040
So you'd pump the water up from a stream,

355
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,199
to here, and then let gravity
take it back down to all the troughs.

356
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
And it also isn't... ooh, hang on.

357
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,399
Hang on.

358
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,959
Okay, that smells pretty bad.

359
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,280
[grunts]

360
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,439
Okay, what we have here is a tank,
maybe 4,000 gallons.

361
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,799
What we've got is a pipe coming in,

362
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,720
and then about two feet higher,
a pipe going out.

363
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,999
[grunts]

364
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,199
[coughs]

365
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,639
To find out if the tank fed
the pipes and the troughs,

366
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,400
I needed to send some water through it,

367
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,760
so I called in some locals with a bowser.

368
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,160
[man] Les. [laughs]

369
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,559
[chuckles]

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,320
He's always amusing himself down there
with those diviners.

371
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,280
[Jeremy] Having connected the bowser to
what looked like the tank's outlet pipe,

372
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,799
we started pumping.

373
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,279
[motor starts]

374
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,319
Run away,
quickly let's leap into our cars.

375
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,479
And then I rushed downhill to see
if the water was getting to the troughs.

376
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,320
Right, we are now in a race with gravity.

377
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,519
Someone should do a TV show
where cars race unusual things.

378
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,639
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, it works.

379
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,560
I then went back to report
the good news to the chaps.

380
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,160
So, gravity works... basically.

381
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,960
-[both] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-We know gravity works...

382
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,319
And your pipe's good as well.

383
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,680
And the pipes are good.

384
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,799
So the underground machine
is working, and gravity is working.

385
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,160
-Yeah.
-The main problem I can see now is grades,

386
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,040
but this not a permanent solution.

387
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,399
So someone, we've got to fill that tank up

388
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,800
without using a bowser
on the back of a trolley van.

389
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,640
[Les] Yeah.

390
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,399
[Jeremy]
Sadly, that job would have to wait.

391
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
Because it was time
for the girl sheep to make some babies.

392
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,679
And the man with the boy sheep
had arrived.

393
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,040
That is... Whoa, there's the rams.

394
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,919
The rams.

395
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,719
[Porksman] Hello, boys, how are you doing?

396
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,320
His job is to impregnate sheep
and he's called Porksman.

397
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,760
[laughing]

398
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,039
That's it. That will do.

399
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,039
These are pedigree Suffolks.

400
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,119
[Jeremy] Are they violent attack rams?

401
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,640
[Porksman] No, they're not.
They are as quiet as mice.

402
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
Come on, boys, out you come, don't be shy.

403
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,159
Jeez, I've just seen the back bit.

404
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,119
[Porksman] Do you like them?

405
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,800
[Jeremy] Ooh, they are pendulous,
aren't they?

406
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,040
[Porksman] Yes. This is gonna be
their first breeding season.

407
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,479
-So they... they're virgins.
-They are virgins.

408
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,759
[Jeremy] Are they?
'Cause, really, to be...

409
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,519
I don't want to be lavatorial

410
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:55,519
but rams are just STDs,
scrotal transportation devices.

411
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,319
Really, what I've bought are two scrotums.

412
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,560
Yeah, they...
it's a fertility machine, isn't it?

413
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,120
-[Jeremy] Yeah, exactly.
-Every one of these is gonna produce

414
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,120
-absolutely thousands of sperms a day.
-[Jeremy] Yeah.

415
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,720
They would mate
three or four a day very happily.

416
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,879
[Jeremy] Mr. Porksman then suggested
I test the fire power of my new purchases.

417
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm gonna have to get under there
and to get round.

418
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,999
Yeah. Do you want...
do you want to measure its circumference?

419
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,079
Exactly. Okay, this is not something
I thought I'd be doing this morning.

420
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,880
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.

421
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,360
Okay. Gotta hold
the scrotal sac at the top.

422
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,240
[Porksman] Yes, is it nice and free?
Is it moving nice?

423
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,319
-Are the testes nice and free in the sac?
-I'm not sure.

424
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,560
I've got nothing to compare it to.

425
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,720
I've never really fondled
anything this size before.

426
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,999
Okay, that is 38-centimeter scrotal sac.

427
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,519
-[Porksman] 35 is...
-It says between...

428
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,199
Most rams measure
between 30 and 40 centimeters.

429
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,879
-So 38 is good, isn't it?
-38 is good. Top end.

430
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,400
Right, we're going to measure you,
mate, I'm sorry.

431
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,760
I knew public school education
would come in handy.

432
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,559
Okay, now this is... we've got...

433
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,000
-[whispers] Okay, listen...
-How many centimeters is this?

434
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,159
[whispering] I don't wanna
embarrass one of them.

435
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,880
-Okay. Bigger?
-So this one's a centimeter bigger.

436
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
-A centimeter bigger.
-Shh.

437
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:06,959
Oh, you don't wanna tell him.

438
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,159
Well, come on, if we got measured
and then somebody went,

439
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,320
"You've got the bigger pair,"
you'd be mortified.

440
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
Well, I'd be mortified.

441
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,039
Well, you're going back
to your public school days.

442
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,079
-Yeah, exactly.
-[laughing]

443
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,679
[atmospheric music playing]

444
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,680
[Jeremy] I left the rams to settle in,

445
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,720
did a bit more tractoring...

446
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,960
and then, a couple of days later,
it was time for some sex.

447
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,759
[Kevin] Wee, wee, that'll do, pig.

448
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,879
That'll do, pig.

449
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,440
[Jeremy] Kevin from the NSA
and a noisy vet called Jenny

450
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,839
prepared the lady sheep,

451
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,040
and whilst doing so, they spotted
a problem with three of them.

452
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,760
[Jenny] Yeah, so it looks like
we've got an abscess there.

453
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,999
[Kevin] Yeah.

454
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,039
[Jenny] So, basically,
the udders are shot.

455
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,479
At least one of them each, um,

456
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,519
so not really something
we want to send for breeding.

457
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,639
Well, can they still get pregnant?

458
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,400
Yes, but for welfare reasons
once they lamb

459
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
then you've got
the limited amount of milk.

460
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,039
Cause we're about to bring old Leonardo
and Wayne, as I've called them.

461
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,520
Wayne's going to go
after the slightly older ones.

462
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,520
[Jenny chuckles]

463
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,799
Leonardo's taking the younger ones.

464
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
But we've got to get these three
broken ones out, haven't we?

465
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,279
'Cause they can't get pregnant.

466
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,239
[Jenny] Yeah,
we don't want them with the rams.

467
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,080
[groovy music playing]

468
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,160
[Jeremy] Before Wayne
and Leonardo could be let loose,

469
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,160
we had to get them
into some bondage gear.

470
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,040
[Jeremy] What we've got here

471
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,399
is a harness
we're going to put onto the sheep...

472
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,079
[sheep bleating]

473
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,320
...around here like this.

474
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,920
So as it mounts the lady sheep,

475
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,960
this rubs a blue mark
on the lady sheep's back

476
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,639
and then we know she's been impregnated
and by which one.

477
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
'Cause the other one...

478
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,520
has got yellow.

479
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,879
Do you want to catch the one,
I'll catch the other.

480
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,039
[rattling]

481
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,519
Mr. Porksman said
if I just did this, they'd come.

482
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,480
Come on.

483
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,640
Come on.

484
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,999
[Kevin] They know that you're after them.

485
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,800
That you're acting differently to
when you normally come here and feed them.

486
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,120
A lot of this job is sheep psychology.

487
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,399
You have to think how they think.

488
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,520
What they think is, "I must have sex,
I must eat some grass."

489
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,359
No, they think, um,
"These people are after me.

490
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,079
Where's the best way to get out of here?"

491
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,200
and we've got them a bit riled, and...

492
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,600
how, how strong are your wooden gates?

493
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,200
Well, let's find out.

494
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,439
-[Kevin groans]
-That's sheep wrestling.

495
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,519
[Kevin] Right, you've got to help me now.

496
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,159
[Jeremy] I know. Well, tell me what to do
and I'm right there.

497
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,679
-[straining]
-Good.

498
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,240
-Right, which one's this?
-Leonardo.

499
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,079
-Right, so Leonardo's yellow.
-Yeah, Leonardo's yellow.

500
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,719
[Kevin] Have you ever thought about
getting a bloody shepherd or something

501
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,359
that will do it for you?

502
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,479
Better than you ringing me up
all the time. [groans]

503
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,040
I reckon they can
smell them now Jeremy.

504
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,280
[Jeremy] Good,
we'll get that gate open.

505
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,319
[Kevin] That wind's blowing that way.
They'll follow their noses now.

506
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,760
[Jeremy] Watch this.

507
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,399
Put two boys who've never had sex before

508
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,840
and 75 active cougars
on the other side of that wall.

509
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,999
[Kevin] I think the penny's
starting to drop now.

510
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,999
You see, they're starting to swagger.

511
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,640
[Jeremy laughs] Oh, yeah.

512
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,119
[Kevin] Look, look,
they're excited already.

513
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,840
I know, look at that.
Look at them go. Look at them.

514
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,839
[laughs]

515
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,360
The thing is though, when they run
they knee their own bollocks.

516
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,720
[sheep bleating]

517
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,479
Oh. look at the cougars.

518
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,639
[continuous bleating]

519
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,439
[Jeremy] Hey, who wants a drink?

520
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,639
Espresso martini, anyone?

521
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
Oh yeah, they've got it.

522
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,479
Right.

523
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,999
God, the cougars are desperate.

524
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,879
They're actually chasing the men.

525
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,760
This is #MeToo gone mental.

526
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,839
-[Kevin] There you go, he's on.
-[Jeremy] He's on.

527
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,320
-[Kevin] Oh, he's off.
-[Jeremy] No, he's off.

528
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
It was a false start.

529
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
Oh, he's kicked her.
He must be from Rotherham.

530
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,719
[Jenny laughs]

531
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,920
-There he goes.
-[Jeremy] Oh, there he is look.

532
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
Why is she walking about?

533
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,440
You haven't seen that one
in the Kamasutra?

534
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,719
[chuckles] No. Wheelbarrowing.

535
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,439
How long, how long does the...
the act take as a general rule?

536
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,600
[Jenny] Not long. No, a couple of minutes,

537
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,600
-not much more.
-Oh, a couple of minutes?

538
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,160
In my mind,
we could now dim the lights,

539
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,120
put on some Barry White
and leave them to it.

540
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,960
But Jenny warned me that
some major responsibilities lay ahead.

541
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,800
[Jenny] A lot of problems come just before
they start lambing, when they...

542
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,360
[Jeremy] What problems?

543
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,120
So, they can get problems
with getting enough food

544
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,040
and the right amount of food,
the right amount of energy.

545
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,919
Because as the lambs grow,
they're pushing on the stomach,

546
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,119
um, so they're reducing
the amount of food that they can get in,

547
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,680
and they're using too much energy.

548
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,119
[Kevin] It's a serious thing,

549
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,000
that you have to know
when they've got enough grass.

550
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,119
They've got to stay in the right
body condition from now until lambing.

551
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
-Which I don't know.
-It's very important, Jeremy.

552
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,880
It is really important.

553
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,560
'Cause if you end up with thin ewes
and, and they got lambs,

554
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,160
then you're going to end up
with all sorts of trouble.

555
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,639
[Jeremy] All this meant only one thing.

556
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,160
I am going to need a shepherd, aren't I?

557
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,520
I think you should, yeah.

558
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,559
So there we are. I brought a tractor
and then I had to get a tractor driver.

559
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,760
-Got sheep, and now I need a shepherd.
-Yeah.

560
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,240
Eventually I'm going to find
something I can do.

561
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,159
With that decision taken,
it was time to make another.

562
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,439
What should I do
with the three unproductive ewes?

563
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,479
What are we going to do
with you three?

564
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,359
'Cause you can't get pregnant.

565
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,120
-'Cause if you get pregnant...
-[sheep bleats]

566
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,600
I know. You've got mastitis
or something of that nature

567
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
and your udders are broken.

568
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,760
[groans] So, what do we do?

569
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,920
Seeking inspiration,
I consulted the Ozzie.

570
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,079
So they can't just stay here
and just be three young...

571
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,640
I'll put them somewhere else.

572
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,279
[Jenny] Well, they're flock animals, so
ideally they want to be living in a flock

573
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:38,359
and three sheep don't make a flock.

574
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,840
They want to be running
with a large number of themselves.

575
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,280
Well, why can't they stay
in a little pallet somewhere

576
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,639
with doves and rabbits?

577
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,000
That's not the...

578
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,839
-uh, relevant to...
-[Jenny] Not quite Snow White.

579
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,360
...relative sheep farming.

580
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,520
There's only one thing for them really
and you know, they...

581
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,999
they will need to be, um, culled.

582
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,919
[atmospheric music playing]

583
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,839
[Jeremy] After facing that hard choice,

584
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,200
I spent three weeks battling the weather

585
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,079
and trying desperately
to get my crops in the ground.

586
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,360
And then it was time to see
if the sheep sex had been successful.

587
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
[whistling]

588
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,479
That was the job
of my new shepherd, Ellen.

589
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,999
[Ellen whistling]

590
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,519
Look at how she's doing that,
just whistling.

591
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,760
[Ellen whistling rhythmically]

592
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,679
That was just breathtaking.

593
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,720
[continues whistling]

594
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
Hello.

595
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,959
That is one of the most
majestic spectacles.

596
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,999
-[dog barking]
-Hey you.

597
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,639
Yes, good dog.

598
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,399
So, are they all now up the duff?

599
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,960
[Ellen] Well there's 74 have been topped.

600
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,039
[Jeremy] Have they?

601
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,839
So, it's only possibly one or two.

602
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,240
-Yeah.
-It's not many.

603
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,879
Blue mark has done
twice as many as yellow mark.

604
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,880
-Wayne?
-Yeah.

605
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,160
He's a bigger shagger
than Leonardo DiCaprio.

606
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Yeah.

607
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
[Jeremy] Good old Wayne.

608
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,439
-Oh, they're in there look.
-Yeah.

609
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,199
[Jeremy] You randy little bastards, you.

610
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,159
Look at them,
they've got sort of proud looks

611
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,600
-on their faces now.
-[Ellen laughing]

612
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,599
[Jeremy] Next we had to separate
Wayne and Leo from their woolly harem.

613
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,879
If you go that way a bit,

614
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,840
and we'll spread out,
and then put your arms out.

615
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,160
Hold on, where's the...

616
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,839
-Whose, where is he?
-Would you grab that gate?

617
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,639
-What?
-Would you grab that gate

618
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
and swing it round towards me.

619
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,200
-That's it.
-Oh we've got.

620
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,959
Well, that's good.
Oh, we've got both of them.

621
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,919
-Yep.
-How did you do that?

622
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,319
[Jeremy] There was absolutely
no doubting Ellen's shepherding skills.

623
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,359
I just wish I could say the same
about her driving.

624
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,199
[sheep bleating]

625
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,280
Everybody, now calm down.

626
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,199
Calm down.

627
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,280
You know, I'm becoming
really fond of them.

628
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,559
[Ellen] Have you been talking to them?

629
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,600
You know the three that have been

630
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,640
-scheduled for assassination?
-Yeah.

631
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,120
[Jeremy] I really like them.

632
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,040
They come galloping up now.
You go and feed the horses.

633
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
[Ellen] Yeah.

634
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,399
We ought to get these rams out then
before it goes dark.

635
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,519
Yep. We'll put them in the trailer
and then move them.

636
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,959
Shall I,
shall I bring it around, because

637
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,199
I have just reversed that
in a tight spot

638
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,199
-and didn't hit anything.
-Well done.

639
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,200
-Unlike some people.
-[laughing]

640
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,120
[Jeremy] The next issue was food.

641
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,560
Ellen was worried my fields
didn't have enough grass

642
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,480
for 74 pregnant ewes.

643
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,360
[Ellen] By looking at it,
that all looks the same,

644
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,640
there's nothing in here.

645
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,920
[Jeremy] But both are green.

646
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,880
[Ellen] Yeah,
but that don't mean it's grass.

647
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,560
What about that field?

648
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,920
[Jeremy] Right, here there's grass, see?

649
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,959
[Ellen] But there's still not a lot of it.

650
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,799
So we're going to have to
supplement feed the ewes so...

651
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,520
-With the hay?
-With the hay.

652
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,279
But how much do they need?

653
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,599
We've got a big, big bale of hay.

654
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,559
Yeah, they'll get through,
probably a couple of those a day.

655
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,600
-If they're hungry.
-Shit.

656
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,319
-Yeah.
-I haven't got that much.

657
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,680
How much is hay?
It's quite expensive isn't it?

658
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
It is.

659
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,400
[Jeremy] The hay
was yet another addition

660
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,160
to the rapidly rising sheep costs.

661
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,119
And the next day,
when Cheerful Charlie dropped by,

662
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,760
he brought the money situation
into sharp focus.

663
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,639
[Charlie] How are the sheep?

664
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,160
I've taken on a shepherd.

665
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,800
-A shepherd?
-Yeah.

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,360
She's going to come every day
and check on them.

667
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,679
-So, you've got 75 sheep?
-Yeah, left.

668
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,280
-Left. Ewes?
-Yeah.

669
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,880
-And a shepherd.
-And two rams, yeah.

670
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,839
-Wayne and Leonardo.
-So we're going to have

671
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,480
-130 saleable lambs?
-Yeah.

672
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,399
-So, we've got 130 sheep with lambs.
-Yeah, yeah.

673
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
They're £65 to £70 a lamb.

674
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,160
-So that's £7,800.
-7,800.

675
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,639
So if...

676
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,320
Is that all we're going to get?

677
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,960
That's all you're going to get.

678
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,319
But I'm paying her more than that.

679
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,080
The sheep enterprise
is not looking very profitable.

680
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,120
And I had to buy the sheep, and the rams.

681
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,279
-And you have to fence them--
-And the sheep handling--

682
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,120
And you've got the sheep handling stuff
and you've got vets bills.

683
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:54,279
So, the sheep are going to cost me
between just...

684
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,920
£7,000 and £10,000 a year.

685
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,120
-To have them?
-Yeah. To cut the grass.

686
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,120
That was a bad business choice.

687
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,320
-Thanks for dropping by.
-You're very welcome.

688
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,399
With your gloominess.

689
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,600
Reality.

690
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,400
[Jeremy] Alarmingly the sheep
were about to get even more expensive,

691
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,000
because I still had to finish off
their water supply.

692
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,200
What I needed was source of water
that could be used to fill the tank

693
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
at the top of the hill.

694
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,880
That's coming along Gerald?

695
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,320
[Jeremy] So for advice
I went to see Gerald,

696
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,840
who's lived in the village for 72 years.

697
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,880
No, it's something, not I, not obviously
within water on the pump

698
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,360
that you got now,
in the water from up here.

699
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,160
Now he took out, right.

700
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,479
-Now right mains water.
-Hmm.

701
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,479
I'll tell you what. I didn't know...
in the corner of our stables,

702
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,119
I don't know if that
never worked or anything.

703
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,479
[Gerald speaking indistinctly]

704
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,839
I'm not into that.

705
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,920
If you might translate it,
get no water so far in that one trough.

706
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,840
She's had the pump bearing took out.

707
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,000
I'd two of them glass
nearly every day I've done.

708
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
[Jeremy] With all that cleared up,

709
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,559
I did a bit more searching,

710
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,319
and soon,
in one of the woods, I found a spring.

711
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:26,319
Kaleb and I then ran a pipe
from the spring

712
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,640
up to a pump near the farm buildings.

713
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,160
So, in theory,
when I turn that pump on in that box...

714
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,520
[Kaleb] Yeah.

715
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,119
It will bring water up from the spring,

716
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,199
-the stream at the bottom of the hill...
-Yeah.

717
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,080
To here,
and then we can attach it to a pipe,

718
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,519
and then we can run it up
to the sheep troughs.

719
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,200
-Got it.
-This is the moment of truth.

720
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,159
-Ready?
-[Kaleb] Yeah.

721
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,800
Well we haven't done a lot.

722
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,160
-[Jeremy chuckles]
-Oh, there we go.

723
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,639
[Jeremy] Hello!

724
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,439
Look at that.

725
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,359
We had our water.

726
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
And now what we needed was to get it
to the tank at the top of the hill.

727
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,999
This meant using a special
tractor attachment called a Mole,

728
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,999
which lays a pipe underground.

729
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,760
The tank, the aquifer is up on that...

730
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
-you see that row of trees?
-Yeah.

731
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,639
You see there's a gap.
The far trees on the far horizon.

732
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,080
[Kaleb] How long is that?

733
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,519
-It's more than a mile.
-A mile?

734
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,559
-More than a mile.
-And how much are you paying a meter?

735
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,919
It's a pound a meter.

736
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,760
Once you put this in,
it will last 1,000 years.

737
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,639
It's true, you can't... you can't
treat this as a cost for one year's sheep.

738
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,120
I don't want you driving
over my rape as well.

739
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,639
That rape is going to earn you more money
than these pocksy sheep.

740
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,120
-What?
-Without a doubt.

741
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:54,159
[Jeremy] With the sun getting low
in the sky, we stopped talking,

742
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,400
joined everything up and got cracking.

743
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,200
Right. Come on, LOL.
let's see if this works.

744
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,480
[engine whirring]

745
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,799
[Jeremy] It did.

746
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,640
Yeah!

747
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,519
Look at that,
you see it peels the ground open,

748
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,439
puts the pipe in and then
puts the ground back together again

749
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,479
after I've passed.

750
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,359
It's so clever.

751
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,199
This is a very good bit of kit.

752
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,760
-[Kaleb] It's wicked isn't it?
-It's really good.

753
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,160
-You could watch it all day as well.
-No.

754
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,479
[Jeremy] Even though my tractor
was extremely nimble

755
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,359
and just the right size,

756
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,960
the cross country route to the water tank
was extremely hazardous.

757
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,399
[Kaleb] Oh, you're all right,
keep going, keep going.

758
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,200
Keep going. You're all right.

759
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,159
[Jeremy] Dear God.

760
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,919
I've never been through this gate
without having to do a three point turn.

761
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,159
Come on.

762
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,439
Go on, you're all right.

763
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,999
[Jeremy] This meant that when
we needed to change the pipe reel

764
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,079
I was too tired to get out of the cab.

765
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
It's all right, you just sit there.

766
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,759
I'm going to.

767
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,880
-At the end of this series, yeah?
-Yeah.

768
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,200
It's going to be "Man watches farmer...

769
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,680
-Mmm.
-Watching his farm worker."

770
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,400
-Mmm-hmm.
-That's what it's going to be.

771
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,680
That's what it's called.

772
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,080
-You could be watching me...
-I'm watching you.

773
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,359
rather then get hit on the head so
we'd have to put it in the accident book.

774
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,480
What accident book?

775
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,079
[Kaleb] Every farm has an accident book.

776
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,479
[Jeremy] You don't read books.

777
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,519
I know, but I would read that one,
cause it would be mostly me.

778
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,880
Has every farm got an accident book?

779
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,360
Yeah, if you cut your finger on a knife,

780
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,560
you've got to put it in the accident book.

781
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,679
[Jeremy] Who looks at it?

782
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,320
The health and safety,
and stuff like that.

783
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Why don't you just say
there's not been any accidents?

784
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,880
'Cause no one believes that.

785
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,560
Think about it. On a farm,
how many accidents happen on a farm?

786
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,919
[Jeremy] Well, all the time.
But we haven't had one yet.

787
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
Yeah, we have, I cut my finger today.
I need to go in the accident book.

788
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,599
And I've probably got
a bruise on my elbow.

789
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,679
[Jeremy]
Does that go in the accident book?

790
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,880
That's going in the accident book as well.

791
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,040
[Jeremy] So it's a woke accident book?

792
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,760
Eventually we started to climb.

793
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,399
This is the steepest bank
on the farm.

794
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,159
[Kaleb] Go on, go on, girl. Get up
that hill. Go on, go on, go on.

795
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,199
Kaleb is actually talking to the tractor.

796
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,479
[Kaleb] Come on, come on girl.
She's a machine.

797
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,040
-Yee hah!
-[Jeremy laughs]

798
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,679
Get in there.

799
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,520
[Jeremy] So this tractor is planting
150 meters of pipe,

800
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,879
a meter under the surface of the Earth.

801
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,599
Ha ha, too big my ass.

802
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,359
With the hardest climb over,

803
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
we stopped for a breather.

804
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,479
[thunder rumbling]

805
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,559
It's good up here,

806
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:43,159
-the air is clear up here.
-Yeah.

807
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,120
-Look at the view.
-I know, the views,

808
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,399
-the air, everything.
-Look just that way. Look.

809
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,600
-The reason I like farming here...
-Hmm.

810
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,439
Is I'm sat on that tractor
on a summer's day.

811
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,999
It's nine o'clock at night.

812
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,279
The lights starting to come on.
Like, I see every single farmer

813
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,760
working around the place.

814
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,360
I know I can't speak to them,

815
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,080
but it make you feel good.

816
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,959
I know he's waving back at me,
and I'm like a mile and a half away.

817
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,559
-And you know who it is?
-I know exactly who it is.

818
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,839
Yeah, I know what tractor he's driving,
and what horse power it is,

819
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,800
I know what machinery
he's got on the back.

820
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,760
[chuckles]

821
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,760
[thunder rumbling]

822
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,360
Is that rain going to come where we are?

823
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,680
Yes, it is.

824
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,439
It's like one of those shots in Oklahoma.

825
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,759
-Where's that?
-America.

826
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Ah.

827
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,999
[engine starts]

828
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,160
[Jeremy] We worked into the night
to get the pipe to the tank.

829
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,559
And the next morning
went off to see if it had worked.

830
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,519
[straining]

831
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,479
[laughing]

832
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,279
[laughs heartily]

833
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,320
Now, that's good news.

834
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,159
[Jeremy] And so finally
the underground Victorian water engine

835
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,280
was once again fully functional.

836
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,440
I was thrilled.

837
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,120
And as for the sheep...

838
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,879
Not interested.

839
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,999
[sheep bleating in a distance]

840
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,999
Now that might be because
they get all the moisture they need

841
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,519
by licking the Earth.

842
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,839
It is absolutely soaking.

843
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:26,879
Or, it could be because
that electric fence is on.

844
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,440
Which means the entire trough is live.

845
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:35,079
God, farming's complicated.

846
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,999
[soft music playing]

847
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,159
It was about
to become upsetting too.

848
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,480
Because the time had come to say goodbye
to my three woolly mates.

849
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,439
Look at that one over there
having his last breakfast.

850
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:02,679
Come on.

851
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,560
There you go, there you go.

852
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,239
Go on, up you go, go on.

853
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,320
Go on.

854
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:11,559
Come on.

855
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,999
[sighs]

856
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,200
[engine whirring]

857
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,600
Uh... I don't know
what to say, or think

858
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,639
about this mission this morning.

859
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:39,959
Hmm.

860
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:43,879
But I'm a sheep farmer.
This is what sheep farmers do.

861
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,200
They take their animals to market.

862
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:48,999
They take them to the abattoir.

863
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,720
Eugh!

864
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,280
[breathes deeply]

865
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,039
Eventually, I arrived at the abattoir.

866
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,040
[metal clanging]

867
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,519
[man] Three cull ewes yeah?

868
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,039
-Three ewes yeah.
-Yeah.

869
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,040
[Jeremy] What I really needed
were a few soothing words,

870
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,399
telling me that
what I was doing was the right thing.

871
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,640
[man] It's a shame,
cause they're nice sheep aren't they?

872
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,199
[man exclaims]

873
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,920
Lovely.

874
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,199
[Jeremy] Is this all mutton then?

875
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,320
[man] Yeah, they're all culls
as well, yes. Uh-huh.

876
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,319
The farmers that we bought them from
have obviously checked their backs.

877
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,040
They've either got bad backs
or lack of teeth so they can't feed.

878
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:41,919
[Jeremy] And where does mutton mostly go?

879
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,960
Indian restaurants, and Pakistanis
and Bangladeshis.

880
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,679
There's massive communities
in East London.

881
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,279
Good.

882
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,080
Look, that one looks so sad.

883
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:57,679
[man] At the end of the day,
the ones that don't fit the bill

884
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,680
-have to go here. They've got to.
-They have...

885
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,600
I can't, they can't breed,
they can't be with a... a flock.

886
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,759
[man] And they're not pets.

887
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,720
[Jeremy] No.

888
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,800
I deliberately haven't given them names.
Not out loud anyway.

889
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
No, no, no, no.

890
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,240
[Jeremy] In the office we went through
the endless government paperwork.

891
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,560
So that's it, we've done one form,
now these another form.

892
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,279
This is your movement license,
it's all complete.

893
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,080
We keep a copy and send that
back off to Deptford for you.

894
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,239
This is just the same...

895
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,280
[Jeremy] Easier to get into America
than to fill one of these in.

896
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,080
[man] It is, you're right, yeah.

897
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,919
[Jeremy] ...painfully generated.

898
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,240
[Jeremy] Then there was one last job.

899
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm just going
to say goodbye to them.

900
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:38,599
[man] Might be a bit late.

901
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:41,479
-What? Why, have they gone?
-I think they might be dead.

902
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:45,239
-They're dead already?
-Yes.

903
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,400
Are they really, they've gone?
They're dead?

904
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,560
[man] Yeah, they form a line now yeah.

905
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,239
Sorry.

906
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:55,959
-Lovely. Well thanks again.
-Well, thank you.

907
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,520
Okay.

908
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:06,759
[gate opens]

909
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:11,999
[sniffling]

910
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,799
[serene music playing]

911
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,399
[Jeremy] The sheep had been
on my farm now for three months.

912
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,600
For most of that time,
they had been a nightmare.

913
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,840
No, no, no, no, no. Oi!

914
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,280
And for all of it,
they've been ruinously expensive.

915
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,560
Uh, I'll think of a number
and double it really.

916
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:46,759
-I am going to need a shepherd, aren't I?
-I think you should, yeah.

917
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,160
That was a bad business choice.

918
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:54,479
But these belligerent
sex mad illness machines

919
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,479
have brought a lot of joy to the farm.

920
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,160
[Jeremy] That's a great sight.

921
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:02,119
Hello, sheepy.

922
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,799
[Jeremy] I've grown to love
having them around.

923
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:08,679
You're all eating for two now,
aren't you all? Or three, hopefully.

924
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,440
They're actually learning to trust me,

925
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,999
[laughs]

926
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,480
And there was
one more surprise in store.

927
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,919
I actually thought
I wouldn't be able to eat them, but

928
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,279
it turns out I can.

929
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,920
They're delicious.

930
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,199
Farm shop.

931
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,240
Why would I not do that?

932
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,800
It's like Fortnum and Mason's in my mind.

933
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,760
[man] It's what?

934
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,679
[Jeremy] All right, here we go.

935
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,440
[folk music playing]
