00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
[opening theme music playing]

2
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,999
[dramatic music playing]

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,359
[Jeremy] With the
all-hands-on-deck

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,879
harvest frenzy nearly upon us,

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,640
I had to work fast to complete
all the other projects

6
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,079
I'd started earlier in the
farming year.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,760
And so, with the sun continuing

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,439
to blaze down from a cloudless
sky,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
I decided to begin with what I
thought

10
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,559
would be the coolest job of
them all.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,960
Seven hundred glass bottles.

12
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,959
Helping to set up

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,320
our newly-finished water
bottling plant.

14
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,879
This is a speed James May
would call supersonic.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,720
Like your hat.

16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,119
[Lisa] Groovy, right?

17
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,759
[Jeremy] I then discovered
that housing the bottling plant

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,680
in a metal shipping container

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,080
hadn't been my best idea.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,519
It's too hot for words.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,160
Okay. Hang on.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
Let me just show you how it
finishes off.

23
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,919
48.6 degrees at that, at head
height.

24
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,719
-Okay, and then...
-48.6 degrees.

25
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,119
Okay, look, I'm gonna show you
how it kinda works.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,240
There we go. There's two going.

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,319
The weight is a little under.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,440
Okay, that one is perfect.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,000
Then you take a cap, Jeremy,
okay?

30
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,279
Screw that on,
keeping an eye on over yonder.

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,119
And then you go to the hot box

32
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,919
and go like that

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
and then you're just
a quick second in here.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,480
-Ooh, is that the labelling?
-Yeah, but I haven't--

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,800
There's a bit of--

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Oh, look, there we go. That
worked.

37
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,639
-No, it didn't. You've made a
mess.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
-I didn't. No, it's perfect.

39
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,199
-[Jeremy] It's not perfect.
-[Lisa] No--

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,520
[Jeremy] And then I take it off.

41
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,199
[Lisa] Any more bottles?

42
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,519
Okay, I need some more.

43
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,159
Okay, and then, oh...
oh, okay, that's not good.

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,160
Um, and then, sorry. Je--

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,720
[sighs]

46
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,799
In your own time.

47
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,039
There, a bottle.

48
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,719
[Jeremy chuckles]

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,320
-49.7 degrees.
-[Lisa] It's really hot.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
[Jeremy] If it reaches 50
degrees,

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,360
we're allowed to go on strike.

52
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,799
-It's hot.
-Holy shit!

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,880
[pleasant music playing]

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,000
[Jeremy] Finally, though,
England reverted to type.

55
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,879
[thunder rumbling]

56
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,639
[piano music playing]

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,400
The end of the drought

58
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,879
was all anyone in the area
could talk about...

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
I think.

60
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,959
[heavy accent] I don't have to
hear about

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,640
your one with a bigger...
[indistinct]

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,160
What have I put me head into
here? [chuckling]

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Well, you know, I mean, I've
done... [indistinct] Yeah.

64
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,999
Excellent. All right, thanks,
Gerald.

65
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,239
I went down the side of old
Green Wood

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,320
on the old electric fence.

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,440
I mean, that was, like,
you know, for horses.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Okay.

69
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,559
So up there, the guinea pig,
two of them there was

70
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,239
and they tried to get out
before I could get in the gate

71
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,879
and I thought, "Oh, my God,
they will be acting the goat."

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Yeah.

73
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,279
[Gerald] Well, not at your age
now you wouldn't. [laughs]

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,480
[Jeremy] Brilliant. All right.
We'll let you get on.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,440
[Gerald] Okey-dokey.

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
[pleasant music playing]

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,600
[Jeremy] I then headed for the
farm shop

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,480
where Lisa had been hard at work
and finding new things to sell.

79
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,799
It's an actual shop.

80
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,999
I know. Smell the strawberries.
Aren't they delicious?

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,200
No, no, no. Don't eat them.

82
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,879
-Oh, they're so good.
-Unless you want to buy them.

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,039
And cakes.

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
[Lisa] Loads of cakes.

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,080
Holy cow! It's a proper shop.

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,360
Piccalilli, I love piccalilli.

87
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,599
Fruity chutney.
God, we've got everything.

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,039
Yes. The milkshakes, I've sold,

89
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,879
and they apparently are
delicious.

90
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,560
-So, we've got cheese,
milkshake...

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,360
-[Lisa] Cream.

92
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,239
What's in here? [vocalizing]
Oh, my word!

93
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,359
We've had a run on the sausages.

94
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,200
-[Jeremy] Sausages, bacon.
-Yeah, yeah. Sausage rolls.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
-[Jeremy] Rump steak.
-Yep.

96
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,159
[Jeremy] Burgers.
God, wait until the camp site.

97
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,000
-You know they're reopening on
the fourth?

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,640
-Yes.

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,920
Can I... Can I just ask?

100
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,599
Simple question.

101
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,320
You know the planning permission

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
says everything has to come
from within 30 miles?

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,919
Yes.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,760
That it has to be a local shop
for local people?

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Yes.

106
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,440
Is this a Cotswold pineapple?

107
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,639
No. No, but I was low on stock.

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,880
-Oh, and these avocados.
-Yes.

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,800
Again, not that local.

110
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,479
No. Well, they came
from one of the shires.

111
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,120
-I'm not sure which one.
-You know, eating two of these--

112
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,119
They don't come from a shire,
they come from South America.

113
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,039
Shire.

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,600
Eating two of these
does more environmental damage

115
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,960
than driving a Volkswagen Polo
for a year.

116
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
[Lisa] No way!

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,760
That's bad. I'm not gonna
stock avocado anymore.

118
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
So, apart from those eggs,

119
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,359
okay, there's nothing in here

120
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,839
that I can see which is from
our farm.

121
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,319
[Lisa] Well, meet me halfway.
Give me anything.

122
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,079
-Grow something, make something.
-I am growing things.

123
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,519
Do something.
I've nothing in here from you.

124
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
[Jeremy] At that moment,
His Cheerfulness arrived.

125
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,720
-[Charlie] Hello.
-Hey, Charlie.

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,240
Charlie.

127
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,719
Wow! This looks absolutely
fantastic.

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
It's good, isn't it?

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Well, just 'cause Lisa's done
something, you like it?

130
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,520
-[laughs] No.
-That's what it is.

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,720
It looks... genuinely looks
smart, doesn't it?

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Uh, how local are the
pineapples?

133
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,319
Cotswold pineapples.

134
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,479
Are they really? Avocados?

135
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Cotswold.

136
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,719
[Charlie] And... and what about
margins? Have we--

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,920
We haven't really done a
budget, have we?

138
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,599
I like budget.

139
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,839
-You know how I like--
-[Jeremy] I know.

140
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,960
I like to know that the bottom
figure doesn't have...

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,400
-I'm working on about 40%.
-Okay.

142
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
It's 40% on everything?

143
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,159
-[Lisa] More or less.
-Okay.

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,280
[guitar music playing]

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,760
[Jeremy] Ever the gentleman,

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,320
Charlie then had a quiet word
with me out of Lisa's earshot.

147
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,399
So, just on pricing,

148
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,679
-with a 40% markup...
-Yeah.

149
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,119
Wholesale price of strawberries
£2.80,

150
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,399
sold for £3.50, 70p.

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
It's 25%.

152
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,639
That's Lisa's maths.

153
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,880
So we ought to just-- I'm not
blaming--

154
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,839
I didn't know.

155
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
No, I'm just saying

156
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,999
that they learn differently in
Dublin.

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
-[both chuckle]
-Maths.

158
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
Well, we just need to check
that we've got

159
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,719
appropriate prices for
everything.

160
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,599
Okay.

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,040
[guitar music playing]

162
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,960
[Jeremy] On the subject of
Lisa's plea

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,560
for more farm produce,

164
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,240
there was something I could do,

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,160
because my quarter of a million
bees

166
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,239
had had enough time to make
some honey.

167
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,839
Burn, baby, burn!

168
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,920
[coughs]

169
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,279
I'll have no biting from you
today.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,040
Here we go.

171
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,119
When I got stung last time I
was here,

172
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,279
my foot throbbed for four days.

173
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,559
I mean, really throbbed.

174
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
And then itched so violently

175
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,080
I wanted to saw it off, my
whole foot.

176
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,560
Here we go. Look at all that
bee juice.

177
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,999
Holy Mother of God, that's a
lot of honey.

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
Excellent.

179
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
Oh! So exciting.

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,080
I've just thought.

181
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,159
[laughs] I'm going to be
driving back

182
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,000
and all the loose bees
are going to go in the car.

183
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah, not much I can do about
that.

184
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,719
Oh, shit!

185
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,560
Oh, Christ!

186
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,639
I've got one in my suit.

187
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,600
How the fucking hell's that
happened?

188
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Argh!

189
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,200
And it's stung me
right in the arse cheeks.

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,079
Oh, this really, this is bad.

191
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,119
Agh!

192
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,400
[thrilling music playing]

193
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,720
Having taken a brave pill,

194
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,519
I stacked up the remaining trays

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,280
and set off with my unwanted
passengers.

196
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, I can hear them. Listen.

197
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,360
How can it be legal to drive

198
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,159
with a beehive in the back of
your car?

199
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,639
Agh, I can feel that buttock
growing a third buttock.

200
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,159
Worst journey of my life.

201
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,759
Talk among yourselves.

202
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,040
I am just applying Wasp-Eze
to my own arse crack,

203
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
'cause the crew won't do it.

204
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,200
I just don't believe this.

205
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,759
A lot of bees there.

206
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,200
[banjo music playing]

207
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,759
With my third buttock now
numbed,

208
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,439
I started to sort out my bee
juice.

209
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,760
Look at this. Look at that.

210
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,599
A slab of beeswax, which could
be used

211
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,999
as furniture polish, floor
polish.

212
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,039
Percussionists use it to make

214
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,439
It's used in accordions.

215
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,160
Madame Tussauds, they made

216
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,240
all their waxwork models out of
beeswax.

217
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,599
The wax, in the olden days,

218
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,319
used to sell for 14 times more
money than the honey did.

219
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,159
[blues music playing]

220
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,080
My next task was to extract the
honey

221
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,320
using something called a
spinner.

222
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,359
Look at this.

223
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,119
The important thing here is to
be gentle,

224
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
so you get the honey
without damaging the honeycombs.

225
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,320
This is all honey down in here.
All honey.

226
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Um...

227
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,399
Oh, God, look what's happened
here.

228
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,519
But, despite the damage...

229
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,399
Look, look, look, look, look,
look!

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,240
My first jar of bee juice.

[country music playing]

232
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,199
The next day,
with the honey all packaged up,

233
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,519
I picked some of my vegetables.

234
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Look at this.

235
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Whoa! That is vivid.

236
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,959
And then, laden down

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
with actual produce from my own
farm,

238
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,999
I proudly headed to the shop.

239
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
[Lisa] Oh, wow!

240
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,639
Right, so that's the first
batch of honey.

241
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,680
I've got more coming later. And
then...

242
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,079
Oh, wow, how did you do this?

243
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,199
Chard?

244
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,399
Oh, you've brought it in a bag
from our closest competition.

245
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, God, I have.

246
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
[chuckling] It's a very fine
food shop

247

half a mile down the road.

248
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,839
The honey is fantastic.

249
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,439
How much do you want to sell it
for?

250
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,760
Well, I saw in Daylesford the
other day,

251
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,839
half that was £20.

252
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,759
Half that?

253
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,600
And it was £20.
I think you can easily go...

254
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,639
-£7?
-For those-- No, more.

255
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,920
-Really?
-Yeah, more.

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
I've worked bloody hard for
that.

257
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,799
I've been stung twice.

258
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
I'm not selling it for £7.

259
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,640
£10.

260
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,800
-£8.50.
-They stung--

261
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,879
No.

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
Sorry, are we holding you up?

Sorry, there's a customer.

00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,399
Then the price issue got even
worse.

A lady's just come in.

266
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:54,999
She said,

00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,039
"Well, I'll give you £6.50
for it,"

268
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,320
and Lisa said "Fine."

She just happened to capitalize
on an argument

271
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,479
and now she's getting
that honey for £6.50.

272
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,439
Yeah. They arrived in this
morning.

It's just, this isn't how Asda
is run.

274

They don't ask the customers
how much they'd like to pay.

-Yep.
-[woman] Do you take cards?

-[Lisa] Yes. Um, if you'd
like...

sulk,

Oh, look at this.

That's actually very cool

284
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,280
and I just heard you go by
earlier.

285
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,240
Did you? [laughs]

286
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
-It does make a good sound.
-It's nice, isn't it?

287
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,479
Nice.

288
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,599
So, this was your styling then,
the black bonnet, black roof?

289
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,559
Yeah, black bonnet,
black roof, black spoiler.

290
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,559
I bought the new spoiler for it.

291
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,559
-I had the windows tinted as
well.

292
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,560
-Of course you did.

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,120
So, basically, when I bought it,
two days after having it,

294
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,640
driving out of Long Com
at 60 miles an hour,

295
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,960
this comes up like that, folds
over that.

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
That bit here was bent in.

297
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,079
What, the roof?

298
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,279
Yeah, the roof was about that
far from my head in the cab.

299
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,560
-What, just from the bonnet?
-From the bonnet.

300
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,319
Why did the bonnet catch give
up?

301
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,199
Because apparently it's a thing

302
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,480
you've got to look out for on
these.

303
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,359
They rust away.

304
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
And this is your first
proper car, isn't it?

305
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,320
It's my proper dream.
This is my dream car, this,

306
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,399
ever since I was a kid.

307
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,880
-What, you wanted a 350?
-A 350.

308
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,200
My only slight concern
is this is a GT car.

309
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,839
-A Grand Tourer.
-Yeah.

310
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,279
A long-distance car.

311
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,680
But since you never go
further than three miles

312
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,359
from where we're standing now...

313
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,400
Yeah.

314
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,960
-Where's the furthest you've
been in it?

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
-Um, Banbury.

316
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
-Ooh, 12 miles.
-Twelve miles. That's it.

317
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,840
What, and then you got scared?

318
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,919
Then come home.

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Also. Are you wearing a
hairband?

320
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,640
Yeah. A hairband to keep my hair
out of my face.

321
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
[Jeremy] Is that because

322
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,480
-you haven't had a haircut for--
-Yeah, for ages.

323
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,759
On the 27th, though,
I'm getting it permed.

324
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,200
You're going to drive around in
this car with a perm?

325
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,199
Yep.

326
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,799

329
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,920
[Jeremy] After Vidal Sassoon
had left,

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,640
I went into the woods
to see my wasabi plants,

331
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,640
which I'd decided were now ready
to be turned into cash.

332
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,199
Sadly, though, the recent
heatwave had taken its toll.

333
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,479
Um, as you can see,

334
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,039
everything I've planted
at this end of the bed

335
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,520
has not just died,
but totally disappeared.

336
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,040
It's got 27 plants,

337
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,040
which means 73 have died.

338
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,320
This end, where there's still

339
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,640
quite a lot of water coming
through,

340
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,919
things aren't too bad, though.

341
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,120
Oh, yes!

342
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,440
Look at him.

343
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,839
Hello, look at the size of him!

344
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,559
The good thing is,

345
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,320
all the restaurants recently
re-opened

346
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,480
and the chancellor is even
paying people

347
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,559
to go and eat in them,

348
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,560
so I can get that down to
London,

349
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,319
get it into some Japanese
restaurant

350
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,319
and they'll be amazed.

351
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,759
[whimsical music playing]

352
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,680
Because I was so busy,

353
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,799
obviously I couldn't spare the
time to go to London.

354
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,879
But, luckily, I knew just the
man for the job.

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,320
He'd only been to the capital
once, on a school art trip,

356
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,959
and he'd been so scared

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,080
he hadn't dared get off the
coach.

358
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,800
But he's all grown up now and,
at the very least,

359
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,159
I figured the trip would give
him

360
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,160
an opportunity to drive his new
car.

361
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,080
But no.

362
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,159
A few things you're gonna need
to know.

363
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,040
Have you got your ULEV?

364
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,960
What's that?

365
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,319
Ultra-low emission.

366
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,559
That diesel engine
was made before 2015, yeah?

367
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,479
Yeah.

368
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,919
So, you're gonna need to pay
that congestion charge.

369
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,240
You're gonna need at least 15
apps for your parking,

370
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
for all the different companies.

371
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,839
And every single thing
you can do in the countryside

372
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,199
you can't do in London.

373
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,919
If you get stabbed, right,
they won't have that on CCTV.

374
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,720
You make a cheeky left, they
will.

375
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,159
How the fuck do I pay

376
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,640
an ingestion charge and stuff
like that?

377
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,239
-What is that about?
-You make a call.

378
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,160
I can't just-- Why can't I...

379
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,440
But don't make a call
while you're driving.

380
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,559
Why would you do that, then?

381
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,119
Or you can do it on an app,

382
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,759
and the ULEV as well. Don't
forget that.

383
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,039
It's about 28 quid
to drive into London in this.

384
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
Well, it's free round here.

385
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes, I know everything's free
around here.

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,640
Every single thing

387
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,159
you can do around here,
everything,

388
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,440
you can't do in London.

389
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,919
I think we've got the jobs
a little bit wrong today.

390
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,480
Go to London, sell wasabi.

391
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,759
Don't take less than £300

392
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,279
and I'll see you back here
tonight.

393
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,680
-£300 per kg?
-Yeah.

394
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,679
-All right.
-It's valuable.

395
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,159
See you tonight.

396
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,320
Yeah.

397
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,720

This route avoids congestion
on A40 in London.

You are on the fastest route.
You will arrive at 9:29 a.m.

All right, here we go.

408
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,559
I am officially leaving
Chadlington.

409
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,639
My palms are really sweaty.

410
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,040
Like, really sweaty.

411
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,199
Going on the motorway? Eh?

412
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,879

00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,159
Jeez!

417
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,960
[Jeremy] If Kaleb thought
things were

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
bad for him, they were worse
for me...

419
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
[country music playing]

420
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,960
...as this is the time of year

421
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,560
when farmers apply for their
grants.

422
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,879
This meant I had to tell the
government

423
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,880
exactly what I was growing.

424
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,720
That meant paperwork.

425
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,079
I've been looking forward to
today,

426
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,719
'cause I love form-filling.

427
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,719
Yeah, yeah, it's quite

428
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,199

um...

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,280

431
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,879
Yeah.

long...

I've got better things to do
with my time than this.

435

-But it's... We've got--
-How much do they pay?

436
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,760
Because whatever it is,

437
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
I'd rather pay it myself
than fill in a form.

438
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,319
Really?

-Yeah.

440
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,920
...and they'll pay you £220.
So that's £82,000.

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,480
Right, I'll fill in the form.

442
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,159
So, the first thing we'll need

443
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,760
is a farm map. So, there's the
map.

444
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,159
And there are certain codes.

445
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,640
So, you see that that there
says...

446
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,000
-[Jeremy] AC66.
-So that's wheat.

447
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,959
Why is it wheat?

448
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,279
Because that's the code for
wheat, Jeremy.

449
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,279
-What's AC17?
-Maize.

-Burma, for example.
-No.

456
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
And you know when you fill this
in, which takes an hour...

457
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,199
or Cambodia... they put it in
the bin.

This is developing world

So...

461
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
[Jeremy] Right, so there's how
many fields

462
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,079
on the farm? I've forgotten.

463
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,280
Uh, there's about 42.
So, there's Dead Man.

464
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,399
-Yeah.
-So...

465
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,760
-So, we have to go...
-That's got wheat in it.

466
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,559
Yes, but it's got last year's
crop in it at the moment,

467
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,920
which was oil seed rape.
So, we have to go through this.

468
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,920
But it's got wheat in it.

469
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,880
Yes, but as far as the
government are concerned...

470
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,640
Well, it hasn't. It's got--

471
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,720
I know it's got wheat in it.
I've seen it.

472
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,199
They don't know that yet.

I haven't got any gloves and
it's London.

How are you doing? Are you all
right?

545
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,559
I've got some wasabi for you...

546

-Oh, la, la, la, la, la.

Yep.

-[Kaleb] Jesus!

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,680
-[chef] Have you tried your
wasabi?

551
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,920
-To eat?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice.

552
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,280
I like it. I didn't have it
on any fish, mind.

553
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,039
I had it on, like, a ready
salted crisp.

00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,239
Yeah.

00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,239
I'm more like a roast dinner

00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,119
-Mm-hmm.
-A proper roast dinner.

557
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,280
Well, we try, yeah, your wasabi.

558
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,359
Nice, like, creamy. I can smell.

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,600
Not too much. Not too much.

563
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,360
If you look at it, though,

564
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,240
it's top-quality Chadlington
wasabi, that.

565
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,079
Quality good, right.

566
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
But the wastage, there's so

567
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,920
much wastage
because of the size.

568
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
[Kaleb] Yeah.

569
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160

-Too much waste?
-[chef] Yeah.

Ah, right. Okey-dokey.

573
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,680

everything.

bigger one.

hadn't made,

584
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,680
I was busy regretting planting
so many different vegetables.

585
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,519

588
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,559
Yeah. Now, the government has a
code,

589
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,359
obviously, for all of those.

590
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,680
-Yeah.
-Broad beans has got a code?

591
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,079
Broad beans has a code.

592
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,400
-I have to look those codes up.
-Yeah, look them up.

593
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,760
And then tell them exactly how
much.

594
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,279
What do they want it, in
centimeters?

595
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,479
-Square meters will be fine.
-Square meters.

596
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,399
You've got to do it
to four decimal places.

597
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,080
If you see, we've got four
decimal places.

598
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,600
They want it to with--
They want it that tight?

599
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,600
Yeah, it's very accurate now.

600
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,360
Can't you just write vegetables?
Can we guess?

601
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
There isn't just--

602
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,080
Uh, you could, but then if
you're wrong,

603
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,159
they might implement a penalty,

604
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,560
and, you know,

it down

[gospel music playing]

696
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,440
[Jeremy] After Kaleb's failure
to sell the wasabi in London,

697
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,039
we put it in the farm shop...

698
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,800
where it rotted.

699
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,199
And that wasn't the end of the
bad news.

700
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
God above!

701
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,520
Because Lisa's definition of
local produce

702
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,399
had come to the attention
of the authorities.

703
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,200
I've had an annoying email
from the council

704
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,799
which says that, um,

705
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,679
the stuff we sell in the farm
shop

706
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,120
has to be from a producer

707
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,360
based solely within

708
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,040
West Oxfordshire's district
boundaries

709
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,559
and they're saying that some of
the pâté

710
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,119
and cheese and what-have-you

711
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,360
is from Gloucestershire.

712
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,520
I mean, there's a pandemic
going on.

713
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,159
Millions of people are
unemployed.

714
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,760
We have a little business that

715
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,319
now has five people on
the payroll,

716
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,799
we're supporting local farms
and local businesses

717
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,960
and now we have to have

718
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,280
an enforcement case
opened on us.

719
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,320
I mean, God, give me strength!

720
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,440
[country music playing]

721
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,999
Fortunately, I had already
had a genius idea

722
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,199
for making the produce very
local.

723
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:10,479
All right. I put the bee
honeycomb stuff.

724
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,319
I'd decided to turn my spare
beeswax into scented candles.

725
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,600
Oh!

726
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,040
Taking my inspiration for the
scent from a Hollywood A-lister.

727
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,599
What do you think of that?

728
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
[gasps]

729
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,479
And not just lavender.

730
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,599
A spring onion.

731
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,439
Just a hint of broad bean.

732
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
And there we are.

733
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,759
Let that set.

734
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,000
At the shop, Lisa was delighted
with the results.

735
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:56,559
You cannot label that
"This smells like my bollocks."

736
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,679
You just can't.

737
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,279
Gwyneth Paltrow has made a
fortune

738
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,439
from her candles which smell
like her...

739
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,999
[mouthing] vagina.

740
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,199
Do you think these will sell
more

741
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
because it smells like your
bollocks?

742
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,239
[Jeremy] I've also-- Look,
"These beeswax scented candles

743
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,719
were handmade by Jeremy
Clarkson.

744
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,359
You'd never know it, but it's
true,"

745
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,560
and I've signed it to prove I
made them.

746
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,279
[country music playing]

747
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:21,119
Meanwhile, down at the trout
pond,

748
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,560
Kaleb, now safely back
in his natural habitat,

749
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,720
was busy protecting
another source of revenue.

750
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,760
[Kaleb] I am putting a fence up.
An electric fence up.

751
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,359
We've seen a couple of dead fish
on the side.

752
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,759
Oh, poor fishy. It's got some
puncture wounds on it.

753
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,399
So, Jeremy put a trap camera
down here

754
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,240
to see what was causing the
fish to die.

755
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,200
Turned out there was an otter.

756
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,360
So, I'm putting up an electric
fence

757
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,000
around the outside of the pond
where the fish are,

758
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,639
to try and stop that otter
getting in.

759
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,840
But we've also had to put this
up because

760
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,120
the heron keeps
coming in.

761
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,120
That's another thing
that will take a fish.

762
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,920
So, I've had to put this fence
up,

763
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,800
put the owl up to try and scare
the heron away...

764
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,280
[grunts]

765
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,560
and put a metal man up

766
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
to try and deter him as well.

767
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,599
There's a lot of work in fish.

768
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,279
[country music playing]

769
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,279
[Jeremy] A week later, my local
pub

770
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,759
agreed to put our trout on its
menu.

771
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,680
So, I went down to the pond
with a net,

772
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,200
feeling weirdly conflicted.

773
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,040
-The only reason this fence is
here...

774
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,679
-Yeah.

775
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,760
...is to stop the otter eating
the fish,

776
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,839
so we can sell them
to rich people in the pub.

777
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,760
[Lisa] Yeah.

778
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,879
The whole point of this was
wilding.

779
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,560
[Jeremy] I then decided
I didn't really care about that,

780
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,160
so we got to work.

781
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,080
[whispering] You throw some
food in.

782
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,280
-[whispering] Put the food in
first?

783
00:32:59,319 --> 00:32:59,959
-Yeah.

784
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,080
Yeah.

785
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,320
Then I'll be ready to pounce
with the net.

786
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,520
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

787
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,719
You can't call them.
They're not like dogs.

788
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,839
Well, I do normally.

789
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,880
[Jeremy] Right. You can see
where my net's gonna go in?

790
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,080
-Yeah.

791
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,639
-That's where you've got to
chuck it.

792
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,440
I need to get them food first.
Fish, fish.

793
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,559
No. Fish, please, please.

794
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,160
-Will you just put it where the
net is?

795
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
-Okay, fine. There.

796
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,040
-Thank you.
-See, they know you're there.

797
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,639
They don't-- They're not
Stephen Hawking.

798
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,240
Shit!

799
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,480
[sighs]

800
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,999
-Ready?
-No.

801
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,399
Steady and go.

802
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,120
-[Lisa] Oh, dear, I think I've
got some.

803
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,200
-Oh, well done.

804
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,120
[Lisa] Oh, my God! Yeah, I've
got like...

805
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,840
[Jeremy] Quickly, in the bucket,
before they do dying.

806
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
[Lisa] ...eight. Oh!

807
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,919
[country music playing]

808
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
[Jeremy] Thanks to my accuracy
with the fish food,

809
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,079
Lisa had landed a good catch.

810
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,920
[Lisa] That's awesome. My God,
they just look delicious.

811
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,560
Now we've got to get them to
the pub.

812
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
Come on, because it's
lunchtime in a minute.

813
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Okay.

814
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,520
They've got to go in there
and then, hilariously,

815
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,319
the law of England says
they have to be oxygenated.

816
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,840
So, I have to have an oxygen
tank

817
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,520
to keep the water oxygenated

818
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,759
for the, what is it, six-minute
journey,

819
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,160
seven-minute journey to the pub

820
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,919
where they're going to be
killed.

821
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,080
Right.

822
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,400
[country music playing]

823
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Very steep. Sorry about this,
fishes.

824
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Come on, car. You know you can
do it.

825
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,679
You know you want to do it.

826
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,479
Delivered fish before, of
course, in, um, Mozambique.

827
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,800
That went well.

828
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
All right, it's heavy.

829
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,000
Vincent, look what I've got.

830
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,159
Wow!

831
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,399
[Jeremy] Just caught them a
minute ago.

832
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,880
-Trout.
-Baby trout?

833
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Well, you say that. Succulent.

834
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,480
That's the one. That's got the--

835
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:02,119
you can just turn him over.

836
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,679
That's where the heron's beak
nearly got him,

837
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
so he's a lucky fish.

838
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
[man laughs] Not for long, not
for long.

839
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,279
[Jeremy] And they're two quid
each.

840
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,960
-Let's get them inside then.
All right.

841
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,440
-All right, you do that.

842
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,320
-Yeah.
-All right, chaps. Bye, fish.

843
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,520
Yeah, take care.

844
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,639
[banjo music playing]

845
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,360
[Jeremy] As June ended,
my new farm projects

846
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,759
were starting to tick over
quite nicely.

847
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,080
-Hello. How are you?
-Hello. I'm good. You?

848
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,159
Good, good. Fine, thanks.

849
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,399
Super. I've got some bags here.

850
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,760
[Jeremy] Thanks to a brief
respite from lockdown,

851
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,440
more people were visiting the
farm shop.

852
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,399
[Lisa] It's really good
to be finally open.

853
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,439
[Jeremy] And the pub had more
customers for our trout.

854
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,679
[dramatic music playing]

855
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,040
However, these ventures were
all sideshows

856
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,519
compared to the main event.

857
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,639
The engine room of the farm.

858
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
The crops.

859
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,399
Which had been in the ground now
for eight months.

860
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,200
[dramatic music playing]

861
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,279
For most of that time,

862
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,960
nature had been a vindictive
bastard.

863
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,480
But somehow, the barley wasn't
all completely ruined.

864
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,280
[Charlie] Actually, it looks
okay. It looks pretty good.

865
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,800
Given the year it's had,
you know, it was late drilled.

866
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,640
-Very late.
-Really wet.

867
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,039
Very wet.

868
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,399
Really dry.

869
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
Then it was very hot.

870
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,600
And actually, you know, it's a
perfectly good crop of barley.

871
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
[Jeremy] Charlie then announced
that harvesting was imminent.

872
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,320
Probably four or five,
five or six days away.

873
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,040
-There's a bit of green on the
stem.

874
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,119
-Oh, really?

875
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,959
Yeah. This is the worst bit.
The middle.

876
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,840
The rest of it is pretty ready.

877
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,080
-Really?
-Yeah.

878
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,159
[country music playing]

879
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,479
[Jeremy] We then moved onto the
next crop.

880
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,319
[Charlie] So, this is oil seed
rape, as you well know.

881
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,320
[Jeremy] Yes.

882
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,360
[Charlie] And these are the oil
seed. They come out of the pods

883
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,800
and they should be
nice and black all over.

884
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,360
Mmm, it's a few days.

885
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,640
It's probably a good ten days
away yet.

886
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,759
-Ten days?
-Ten days.

887
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,640
-And then we can harvest it?
-Then we can harvest it.

888
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,879
Excellent. So, is there

889
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,120
anything else left
to do with this?

890
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,879
Kill it, to make sure it's dead.

891
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,159
I'm sorry?

892
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,599
Well, I know it sounds a little
bizarre.

893
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,759
The rape is dying naturally
and the top is ready,

894
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,880
but the bottom is still very
much alive.

895
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
But you're saying you want to
kill off

896
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,640
the living bit of the oil seed
rape?

897
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,799
-The living bit of the oil seed
rape.

898
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,200
-Why?

899
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,160
Because it will,

900
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,199
it just makes it easier to cut
the crop.

901
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,480
So, what does a combine do?
It comes on, cuts it there.

902
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,319
It cuts that,
so that'll, you know, the knife.

903
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Right, which could do that.

904
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,040
Or do you want it--
Is it easier when it's dead?

905
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,159
-It's easier, much easier when
it's dead.

906
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:20,839
-Okay.

907
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,200
[Charlie] Much, much easier
when it's dead.

908
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,680
And we're not killing the seeds,
because the seed's encapsulated.

909
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,760
[Jeremy] So we just drive
a harvester through it?

910
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah. Have you got one?

911
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,439
-No. We're gonna rent one.
-Very good.

912
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,639
-So, you've got a contractor
coming in?

913
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,079
-Yep.

914
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,399
-A few things to be wary.
-Yeah.

915
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,880
Moisture.

916
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,280
-Moisture?
-Moisture.

917
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,440
It needs to be between
six and nine percent.

918
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,960
So, moisture is the main thing

919
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,559
and the contractor
will possibly want to just say,

920
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,959
"Oh, it's only ten and a half
percent,

921
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,160
we'll come and combine,"

922
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,839
and you say "No."

923
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,280
I said you say...

924
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,280
You say?

925
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
-I won't be here.
-Can you imagine-- Can you--

926
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,000
What do you mean, you won't be
here?

927
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,799
-I'm going on holiday.
-What?

928
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,400
Well, you'll be fine.

929
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,000
You don't need me by then.
You'll be fine.

930
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,359
-I do need you.
-You'll be fine.

931
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,160
Hold on a minute.

932
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,279
All this and then it comes to
harvest...

933
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,160
[laughs]

934
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,840
I'm no use. Like, what do you
want me for?

935
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,040
Well, how am I gonna be able to
tell

936
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,759
whether that's got three

937
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,960
percent moisture
or 17 percent?

938
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Well, you put it in your
moisture meter.

939
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,919
Is there a moisture-o-meter for
that?

940
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,560
-Have you not got a moisture
meter?

941
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,959
-No.

942
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,160
Ah.

943
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,039
Oh, God!

944
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,879
[dramatic music playing]

945
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,800
[Jeremy] My first harvest.

946
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
This is so much harder.

947
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,160
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit!

948
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,520
Wait, wait! Whoa!

949
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,359
[indistinct]

950
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
[Jeremy] I have no idea.

951
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,159
Twenty lorries you should have
organized.

952
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Twenty lorries?

953
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,080
Twenty lorries.
And it's gonna rain tonight.

954
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,519
You've fucked up.

955
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
