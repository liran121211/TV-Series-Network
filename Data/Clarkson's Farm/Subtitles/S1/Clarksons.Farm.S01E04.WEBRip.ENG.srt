00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
[opening theme music playing]

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
[upbeat music playing]

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,280
If I'd driven along here at this time
of year when I first started driving

4
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,319
30 or 40 years ago,
after about five miles,

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,440
I wouldn't have been able to see
where I was going.

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,520
My windscreen would be
an opaque smorgasbord of dead insects.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,280
But look at it now.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,760
There's nothing.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,680
You get more flies
on the front of a submarine.

10
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,959
The fact is that in just 30 years,

11
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,119
insect numbers have dropped by 25%
and they're still falling.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,120
We are heading for an insect annihilation.

13
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,559
You can forget about global warming
or plastic in the ocean,

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,680
because without insects,
all life on Earth ends.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,680
Everything.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,880
And that's me talking.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm not some hairy-armpitted
environmentalist on a rally, it's me.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,000
Sadly, farming is seen by many

19
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,399
as one of the main reasons
for this insect decline.

20
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,359
The problem is that as farm equipment
has got bigger and more efficient,

21
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,839
fields have had to get bigger
and more efficient.

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,000
Which means that, since the war,

23
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,759
Britain has lost
140,000 miles of hedgerows.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,040
It's lost 40% of its ancient woodlands.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,760
It's lost 97%
of all its wild flower meadows.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Everywhere where insects like to live
is disappearing.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,320
And I've decided
to do something about that.

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
[music continues]

29
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,879
My plan is to make my hedgerows,

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,040
my valleys, my woods, and my streams

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,320
more attractive to creepy crawlies.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
In essence, I am going to leave
chunks of the farm completely alone.

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm going to put Mother Nature
in the driving seat.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,400
It's a process called wilding.

35
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,039
And I'm going to begin
in a rather boggy and sad place

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,040
at the bottom of a valley, which I want
to look, eventually, like this.

37
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,159
I think maybe the storks are
a bit ambitious, but everything else...

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,480
That's what I'm aiming for.

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,360
[music continues]

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Obviously, before I could
start work on my wetlands project,

41
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,279
there were government rules to consider.

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,160
So I had to employ a team of inspectors.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,160
So if you both do the HSI calculations
then I'll have a wander over here.

44
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,639
[Jeremy] These Miami CSI people
needed to make sure

45
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,199
my plans wouldn't harm
what was already living there.

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,120
This is all mostly rough grassland.
Looks pretty good for newts, doesn't it?

47
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,119
[Jeremy] And after they'd spent a while
doing forensic examinations,

48
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,679
I went down to see
how many red flags they'd found.

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,920
Whoa.

50
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,639
-[inspector] Afternoon, Jeremy.
-[Jeremy] Greetings. How are you?

51
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,079
-[inspector] I'm all right. You?
-Erm... Well... Well.

52
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,399
Those red flags there
are right where the pond's going.

53
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,679
That is correct, yeah.

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,719
But the red flags are where
we can't build anything.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,720
[inspector] Unfortunately,
while we were doing the surveys,

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,720
we have found potential signs of a mammal.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,560
-[Jeremy] Dog?
-Nope.

58
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,439
There's a likelihood
it could be water vole.

59
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,319
-Very unlikely to be a water vole.
-Interesting.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,560
There were eight million 20 years ago,

61
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:12,639
there's now 220,000
and they mostly live in Glasgow.

62
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,639
And they're noted to be in the Cotswolds.

63
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,959
-Really?
-Indeed.

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,520
Come down here, have a look.
Can you see these droppings here?

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,560
And these are a kind of a Tic Tac shape?

66
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,319
-[Jeremy] That is feces, is it?
-[inspector] Indeed, yeah.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,760
Now there's a high likelihood
that this is water vole droppings.

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Highly protected species.

69
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,679
If you kill them, you'd be seen to be
recklessly destroying that population.

70
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,079
Then you'd be prosecuted and
you could potentially have a prison term.

71
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,239
How long do I go to prison for?

72
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,000
Um... Potentially six months,
to start with.

73
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,879
Potentially a £5,000 fine.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,680
So what I've recommended at this stage
is all work stop here.

75
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,199
Until we've confirmed what is here.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,520
What if that great big digger I've got,
if we just scooped the whole area up,

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
the water vole wouldn't know
and then go and put it over there?

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,680
-No Jeremy, no, no.
-Why not? Why wouldn't that work?

79
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,519
-If you got the whole area--
-You'd be in prison, Jeremy.

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
-I'm being nice to it.
-[inspector] No, no.

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
I could move it to high ground.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
My professional advice would be
do not do that.

83
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,199
[Jeremy]
To see if it really was a water vole,

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
I came up with a plan.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,720
-We've got some trap cameras.
-Mm-mm.

86
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,920
We could put a trap camera on this.

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,640
-Yeah, that's a good shout, yep.
-Then we'll know.

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,360
Need to do it over a number of days
to make sure what the movements are.

89
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,719
-I just want to see if it's a water vole.
-Yeah, that's true, yep.

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,600
[Jeremy]
So the cameraman set up his cameras.

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,480
And a few days later,
I examined the results.

92
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,519
No vole.

93
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,479
No vole.

94
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,480
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,640
I've seen more wildlife
in Paul McCartney's fridge.

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
I mean, something made that hole.

97
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,279
There we are, look, that's what made it.
Is it a mouse?

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,760
No, it's got a pointy nose, it's a shrew.
Not a water vole.

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,040
Right, I think
what we can deduce from this is,

100
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
we are in business.

101
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,719
My important environmental work
therefore could finally begin.

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
[whirring]

103
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,799
The speed.

104
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,399
That is very steep, that bit.

105
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,599
Yeah, that's not gonna be much fun that.
Um, right.

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,120
Come on. Ooh, that one's not even turning.

107
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,599
It's move... I'm not touching anything
and I'm just moving down.

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
Oh, shit.

109
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,039
I'm just skidding, I'm just skidding.
Shit, shit.

110
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,919
[rattling]

111
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,439
I've done it.

112
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,999
I've slithered down the steep bit
and I'm at the bottom.

113
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,879
Look at the ecological work
I'm doing here.

114
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,999
On my way to create

115
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,879
what I'd like to describe
as a biological supermarket,

116
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,919
full of many different species.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,960
Once in position...

118
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,359
I began to excavate.

119
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,320
[Jeremy] Ah!

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,560
I wanna make it absolutely plain,

121
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,799
this is not gonna be
like Ed Sheeran's pond,

122
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,279
which is turquoise
and has a diving board and a swim-up bar.

123
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,240
Look at that, what a machine you are.

124
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,599
That's about six or seven feet deep
and that's clay at the bottom,

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,560
which is good because clay holds water,
but what I'm looking for is blue clay,

126
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,199
which is deeper
because that holds water really well

127
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,079
and I need it to line the sides.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,720
Oh, yeah, look at that.

129
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,839
That is blue clay.

130
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,559
Save it, precious.

131
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,599
By lunchtime, I was making good progress.

132
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,079
Right, that's about...
It must be 10 feet deep.

133
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,840
So I went off for a bite to eat,

134
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,599
not realizing that while I was gone...

135
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,600
nature would throw one of its curve balls.

136
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
It's filled up with water.

137
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,359
A lot of water. And that's
happened in an hour.

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
Shit.

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,720
The water would need pumping out
before I could carry on.

140
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,400
So to make use of the digger,
which I'd rented for a whole day,

141
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,280
I decided to dig another pond.

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
Right.

143
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,280
Let me talk you through my plan.

144
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,520
Got a couple of springs
100 meters up there.

145
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,479
They've created this stream,
so I'm thinking of damming it about here

146
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,119
and then as the water level rises
against my dam,

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,040
it will fill this.

148
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,599
'Cause if you slow the water down,
you've got more chance

149
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,119
for otters and herons and insects
to come and live in it.

150
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,959
I set about my new project with gusto.

151
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
Come on, dig. Dig, digger.

152
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,520
Yes. Juicy top soil.

153
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,080
And when Lisa arrived,

154
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,639
I suspected she'd be thrilled
by my achievements.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm sorry, Jeremy, what is this?
We're building down there.

156
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
-What is going on here?
-[Jeremy] No, no, come and look

157
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
and I'll show you,
I'll show you how brilliant it is.

158
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
[sighs] Fuck's sake.

159
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,039
-That piece of string is the dam.
-[Lisa] What?

160
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,080
Sorry, where is our pond?
This is not what we discussed.

161
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,879
The pond's down there. It's already
a pond, but it shouldn't be just yet.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,600
So I can't work on that,
so I'm working on this wetland now.

163
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,319
I have no idea what this means.
What the fuck are you doing up here?

164
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,839
-This is just a...
-[Jeremy] It's a wetland area.

165
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,639
It'll flood onto this bit
and create a wetland area for insects.

166
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,519
[Lisa] Holy shit, Jeremy.
What are you gonna do with all this soil?

167
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,199
Nothing's gonna come and live here.

168
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,479
[gasps]

169
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,639
Well, you know the movie 1917? They wanted
to see if this would do as a follow up.

170
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,120
Is that not good enough for you,

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,080
that mess you've done there?
You had to do another mess there?

172
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,599
Sam Mendes called.
He's thinking of doing 1918.

173
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,919
What was wrong with that mess?
Why did you have to do a new mess?

174
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,639
[Jeremy] Why does everybody shout at me
all the time?

175
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,000
Literally, I get up in the morning
and people shout at me.

176
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,840
Kaleb shouts at me,
Charlie shouts at me...

177
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,079
Once Mrs. Angry had gone,
I set about building my dam.

178
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,159
[groans]

179
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,479
It's now so cold, I'm having to wear...

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,080
It's not actually a hat, this,
it's Elton John's first hairpiece.

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,680
Okay, here's the situation.

182
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,759
I've, um...
I've plugged the leaks on this side.

183
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,160
I mean, not in a way
that a submarine commander would say,

184
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,200
"Well done, Clarkson,"
but they're plugged a bit.

185
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,879
And the water level
is now rising on that side.

186
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,880
This meant I could now fill Pond Two.

187
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,079
Yes!

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,640
Look at it go. Yes.

189
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,000
This is...
I'm just staggered I've done this.

190
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,000
I was very pleased.

191
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,280
-[thunder rumbling]
-So with the rain and darkness falling,

192
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,520
I packed up and headed home
to sit by the fire and drink warm soup.

193
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,759
[sighs]

194
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,559
[engine revving]

195
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,759
Oh, shit!

196
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,199
I was stuck
in a quagmire of my own making.

197
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,759
Um... I can't...

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,280
So, I had to ask Kaleb to put
his girlfriend down and come out to help.

199
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,239
[Kaleb] Fucking hell.

200
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,080
Fucking muddy down here.

201
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,279
That's it, strap them through.

202
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,640
Let me just try and get straight
and get to there,

203
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,960
and try and pull you up.

204
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,240
-All right?
-[Jeremy] Okay, fire away.

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,800
[engine revving]

206
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Even though we had Lamborghini power
and 10-wheel drive,

207
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,840
we weren't going anywhere.

208
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
[Kaleb] Come on. Come on.

209
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,440
Oh, no.

210
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
[Jeremy] So, Kaleb decided
to undo the tow rope and save himself.

211
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,919
[Kaleb] I'll see you later.

212
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,800
[Jeremy] Which went well.

213
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,399
[Kaleb] Oh, come on. Come on.

214
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,760
[engine revving]

215
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,919
Fucking rain. [sighs]

216
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,079
[Jeremy]
Right, this is a complete cock job.

217
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,679
Everything is stuck.

218
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,719
Naturally, this made Kaleb
very happy with me.

219
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,919
Fucking idiot. If you didn't get
the fucking thing stuck,

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
I wouldn't have come down here.

221
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,839
Now I'm probably gonna fucking fall over.
Fucking hell...

222
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,239
[Jeremy] The next morning,

223
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
we reconvened at my stranded tractor
with a rescue plan.

224
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
[groans]

225
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,320
Kaleb would pull me out with his tractor

226
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,639
while he was being pulled
by his brother, in his tractor.

227
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,800
[engines running]

228
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,840
[Kaleb]
Right, just take the slack up gently.

229
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,120
[on radio] Really slowly, that's it,
keep that tight, okay?

230
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah, I've never driven anything before,
so keep the advice coming.

231
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,399
Oh, shit, I'm not in four-wheel drive.
He's gonna kill me.

232
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Come on, come on,
the power of the Claas, come on.

233
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
[Jeremy] This is just...

234
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,120
Remember, we're doing this
for the sake of the environment.

235
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,599
-[Kaleb] Oh, the power.
-[Jeremy] Oh, yes.

236
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,160
We only took a thousand gallons
to do that, but we're moving now.

237
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,720
[Kaleb on radio] We are away.

238
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,879
[laughing]

239
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,399
I reckon this is probably
me doing it under my own steam.

240
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,480
[on radio] Okay, stop, stop, stop.

241
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,680
After we'd finished
pulling the Supacat free,

242
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,039
girl-about-town Lisa arrived

243
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,880
in the present
I'd bought her for Christmas.

244
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,279
-Hello.
-You've seen this before?

245
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,680
-I haven't, no.
-She's a proper tractor.

246
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,919
[Kaleb chuckling] Proper tractor.

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, that one has tractoritis,
that's not good.

248
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
-[Kaleb laughs]
-Here you go.

249
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
-Thank you very much.
-You did really well, Kieran as well.

250
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

251
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,719
Well done, thanks for that.

252
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,599
It was very impressive
watching the three of you come up.

253
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,199
I did actually say,
coming up the hill, I went,

254
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,319
"I'm telling you now,
Kaleb's nursing a semi in his Claas."

255
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,879
[all laughing]

256
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,000
Our celebratory moment
was then interrupted

257
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,560
by the arrival of cheerful Charlie,
who was even less cheerful than usual.

258
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,559
-What are we gonna do here?
-Where?

259
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,359
Well, I've just wandered across the field
and we've made a bit of a mess and...

260
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,880
[Jeremy] Oh, no, there's a few
wheel marks, I admit.

261
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,840
And I haven't mended the hole I've dug.

262
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,639
That was to dig the water hole
for the pump for the sheep troughs.

263
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
-[Charlie] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-And there's this.

264
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,960
-Yeah.
-Um, I admit it's messy, but, you know,

265
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,759
we're making an omelette
and some eggs have been broken.

266
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,000
They've dropped on the floor.
And it goes all the way up there.

267
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,360
-[Jeremy] Yeah, it does.
-Okay.

268
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,560
-There's soil damage that's created.
-What damage?

269
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,119
-Well, okay, this is...
-I've aerated it.

270
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,640
You haven't aerated it,
you've compacted it down.

271
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,440
Water will not run away from there.

272
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,839
We are nervously in sort of breach

273
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,839
of some of the soil compaction
requirements, which I know...

274
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,599
Sorry, say that again. Soil compaction
requirements from the government?

275
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,599
They got Brexit to worry about
and they're going...

276
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,039
Get an inspector around, and we could
lose 5% of our basic payment scheme,

277
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,279
which is the subsidy you get
from the government.

278
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,799
-This is my wilding project, so--
-This is not wilding. That's damage.

279
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,760
You know, you've gotta stop doing it.

280
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,919
[Jeremy] I hoped that was the end
of the telling off.

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,520
But then, Charlie went
to look at my new ponds.

282
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
[Charlie] Again, here, look.

283
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,720
You know, all this
is just damage to the soil.

284
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,719
But how do you get a bulldozer down there
without damaging the soil?

285
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,159
Do it when it's not really wet?

286
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,680
Well, when? When's it...
Sorry, Charlie, honestly, seriously.

287
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,319
Yeah, no, no. but...

288
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,960
It's rained since September
every single day, pretty much.

289
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,159
-You know this, every day.
-I know, I know.

290
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Coming onto wet land with heavy machinery
is creating a hell of a mess.

291
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,439
But imagine this. Come down here
and use your imagination, okay?

292
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,079
What you're seeing now is just the Somme.

293
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
-Yeah?
-Yeah, no, no, I can see that.

294
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,879
But now, thin your eyes.
A kingfisher on that branch there.

295
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,880
-A family of otters gamboling here.
-[laughing]

296
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,440
Down there, perhaps a heron
waiting for a tasty morsel.

297
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,160
This all banked, grass, wildflowers.

298
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,760
I mean, ecoists get their cocks out
for this kind of thing, don't they?

299
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,559
[Charlie] Look...
This is great. But what you've done,

300
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,760
your actions will potentially cause,
you know, loss of payment.

301
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,919
And that could be £10,000 to £15,000.
And it's not just here.

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,800
-It's further up.
-If that happens, I will be jolly cross.

303
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,200
-I'm doing it for the sake of the nature.
-Correct.

304
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,239
I'm not gonna have somebody
with an O level in biology coming along,

305
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,159
telling me,
"Oh, well, you've ruined the habitat."

306
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,880
It's only a few anthills got knocked over.

307
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,080
The truth is, though,
that I had made a mess.

308
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
So there was only one thing for it.

309
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,159
Get Kaleb to tidy everything up.

310
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,000
[Kaleb] Jesus.

311
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,640
[Jeremy] Then it was time to start some
more environmental work...in the woods.

312
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,680
[whirring]

313
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,239
This might look like rampant vandalism,
but actually, it isn't.

314
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,999
You drive the machine up to a tree,
tell it what sort of tree it is.

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,040
It grabs the bottom, measures the diameter

316
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,919
and then thinks,
"Right if the diameter is that there,

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,520
"it's likely to be that much there."

318
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,159
So it can work out
how long the log should be.

319
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:59,079
This is an eight-wheel drive, articulated,
half-million-pound maths machine.

320
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,159
And when the machine
finally fell silent for the night,

321
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,920
the results were spectacular.

322
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
This is a map of the wood.

323
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,880
This is the bit that was thinned,
just about an eighth of it.

324
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,800
And that's the timber that resulted.

325
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,320
[birds chirping]

326
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,239
[birds chirping]

327
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,279
Needless to say, this has not
gone down well on social media.

328
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,759
I posted a picture of the big machine

329
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,719
doing all the rampant vandalism
on Instagram

330
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,799
and people have replied accusing me
of being a one-man McDonalds.

331
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,080
"Why are you doing deforestation?"

332
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,680
"Why are you always destroying
green things, Jeremy?"

333
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,240
Let's go into the wood and then you'll see
just how moronic these people are.

334
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
[panting]

335
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,920
This is the bit of the wood
where I got all the trees from.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,320
I got 200 tons of timber
out of here and...

337
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,320
You can't tell.

338
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,760
It looks exactly the same
as it did before.

339
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,560
It's virtually unchanged.

340
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,280
Nature, however, can tell.

341
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,239
By removing trees from here
and here and here for example,

342
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,879
it means more sunlight can reach
the forest floor.

343
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,200
You can see puddles of it everywhere.
And that will stimulate growth.

344
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,959
Younger trees, flowers,
bluebells, hopefully.

345
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,439
And that's good for beetles
and birds, bees. It's good for everything.

346
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,120
As a bit of a twitcher,

347
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,640
I was especially keen
to do things for the birds.

348
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,360
So I asked wildlife expert
Roy Dennis for advice.

349
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,559
[Jeremy] Can I just say, Roy, two things?

350
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
One, I thought Ron Dennis was coming,

351
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,960
-and he's a very different sort of man.
-[laughing]

352
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,119
[Jeremy] And secondly,
I'm very jealous of your binoculars.

353
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
I had a pair identical to that.

354
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,639
They're in a Porsche
at a police station in Argentina.

355
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,560
To my delight, Roy was impressed
from the off with what I had.

356
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,959
-This is very, very good.
-Really?

357
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,639
When you look along a hedge like that,

358
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,640
what fantastic food
all the way along for wildlife.

359
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,400
Bramble, fantastic for the warblers

360
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,280
to put on fat
for their migration to Africa.

361
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,159
Hawberries ready for the fieldfares
and redwings. It's really good.

362
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,319
-[Jeremy] What are they?
-They're goldfinches. Yeah.

363
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,320
Little flock, see them?
And they landed in the knapweed.

364
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
-You can just see them there.
-Were they actually...

365
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,240
-That was a flock of goldfinch?
-Yeah, five of them, I think.

366
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,799
You see them feeding on the top there?

367
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,840
-I think that's a little family.
-Really?

368
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,639
Yeah, there's a lovely one there.

369
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,360
That actually makes me really happy.

370
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,240
There was one bird, however,
that I did think I could do more to help.

371
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,039
[gasps softly]

372
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,119
[whispering]
He's on the floor. He's on the floor.

373
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,919
Oh, look at him. That's a baby,
he's just losing his tail, he can't fly.

374
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,799
Okay, let's just pull back shall we?

375
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Because we don't want to disturb it.

376
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,560
There goes the parent, there,
against the woods.

377
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,720
To attract more owls,

378
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,239
I decided that I should carpet bomb
the whole farm with owl boxes,

379
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,919
where they could live.

380
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
[sawing]

381
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,239
Perfect.

382
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,399
Yep.

383
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
[groans]

384
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,599
Perfect.

385
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,240
Right.

386
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Oh, for...

387
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,680
With the boxes all sorted,

388
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,879
I commandeered some poles
that had been left on the verge

389
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,720
by the electricity company

390
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,959
and Operation Owl was underway.

391
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,279
[rattling]

392
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,559
Oh! Jeez.

393
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,960
When I arrived at the spot I'd chosen,
Kaleb was on hand to help out.

394
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,239
You want it close to the hedge or not?

395
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,039
Well, yeah, there.

396
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,160
As he dug the hole,
I went through the checklist.

397
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,280
Cement, rope, power drill
and some owl boxes that I made.

398
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,320
That I didn't order from Amazon at all,
not at all.

399
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,719
-[Kaleb] Deep enough?
-[Jeremy] That'll do.

400
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,079
-Right, here's my plan.
-Yeah.

401
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,400
I drive this forwards
so that end is over your hole.

402
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,239
Then we're gonna rope it from the top

403
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,279
to the back of the Supacat
and pull it upright.

404
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,799
-You're mad.
-Well, what would you do?

405
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,200
Get the loader, go to that end of the
pole, lift it till it goes into the hole,

406
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,079
get the strap that I've put
in the back of the Supacat

407
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,400
and then just drive back and stand it up.

408
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,600
But I still think you're going to need
to tie a rope around the top

409
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,320
and anchor it off the Supacat...

410
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,720
It's on an angle,
with one tine underneath it...

411
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,999
-It starts going up...
-I drive up like this...

412
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,279
No, come at an angle...
Between your tines at this stage...

413
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,239
-I literally don't think that can be done.
-I can do it.

414
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,679
Here, drive it in like this, lay it down.
Around that, around the...

415
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,160
Don't forget,
you got nine meters of boom as well,

416
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,280
so if you boom out now a little bit...

417
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,159
That's it, whoa, whoa, do that again.
Do that. That will work, I think.

418
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,960
-[Jeremy] I don't think it will.
-Other way, other way, oh, no, no.

419
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,399
[Jeremy] Oh, no, no, no. You stupid idiot!

420
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
That was your fault! I told you!

421
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,960
You went too far! I said stop!

422
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,279
-It wasn't in the bloody hole!
-It was.

423
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,399
You've put a load of dirt
on top of it again, look.

424
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
-Is that fence smashed?
-Yes.

425
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,560
[Jeremy]
Fucking hell. That's a fence gone.

426
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,320
Well, you do it then,
and I'll just stand doing this,

427
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,480
which is what you do, like André Previn.

428
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,159
No, every single hand signal
was perfectly fine,

429
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
but you just wasn't looking at me...

430
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,800
[Jeremy] Eventually, we did manage
to get the pole into the ground.

431
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,520
[Kaleb] Right, now we're cooking.

432
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,400
[Jeremy] And once the concrete base
had set,

433
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,080
we stood back to survey our handiwork.

434
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,480
-Oh-ho-ho-ho! That is brilliant.
-[door closes]

435
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,359
Oh, no, wait a minute.

436
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
-Mate.
-[Kaleb] Yeah.

437
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,200
-[Jeremy] That is nowhere near straight.
-[Kaleb] It's really not.

438
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,759
[Jeremy] But, on the upside, we did forget
to put the owl box on the top of it.

439
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,519
Shit.

440
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,080
[Jeremy] Having made a mess of that,

441
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,600
I went off to check on my wetlands area
where things were even worse.

442
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,839
Built the dam
with all this clay along the front of it,

443
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,120
but God has looked at my endeavors
and said,

444
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,560
"Yes, but I've made this hole here."
You can see the whirlpool, look.

445
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,400
"And all the water shall go through that
and go under your dam."

446
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,679
That night,
God did a full Guy Gibson number.

447
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,239
[water flowing]

448
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,239
Which meant that I had to forget
about the owls and do some repair work.

449
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,560
Right, stop there. Perfect.

450
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,879
Oh, thanks.

451
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,240
-Oh, no. Oh, no.
-I got it, I got it.

452
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,999
-Oh, no, I got it.
-Oh, no.

453
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,880
Ooh. [chuckling] Yes. Perfect.

454
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,400
With all that sorted out,
I wanted to get back to the owl boxes,

455
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,520
but I couldn't because Victor
the Ukrainian bee man had turned up.

456
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,640
That's actually commercial size, yeah.

457
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,520
[Jeremy]
And the most important wilding operation

458
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,199
of the lot was about to begin.

459
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,680
-Those are the full hives then are they?
-[Victor] Yeah.

460
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,359
[Jeremy] They're very smart.

461
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,000
The plan was simple.

462
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:04,719
The bees would make honey and money
for the farm shop when it finally reopened

463
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,279
and they'd also help pollinate my crops.

464
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,439
That's why I'd bought
a quarter of a million of them.

465
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,640
[bee buzzing]

466
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,160
Look at this. It's a space suit.

467
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,839
Whilst I got dressed,
Victor prepared the smoking machine.

468
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,280
What does the smoke do?

469
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,799
It's like you and me,
we're afraid fire and water.

470
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,960
I can't use water in the hives,
so fire much easier.

471
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,279
[Jeremy]
But it's not fire, it's just the smoke.

472
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,359
Smoke, yeah. So, they know
smoke coming and they get scared.

473
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,120
So what they doing,
they go back in the hive,

474
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
fill up their stomachs with honey
and actually because of that,

475
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
they're less aggressive.

476
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,520
[Jeremy] So, they're sort of like sleepy
after a big lunch.

477
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,679
-Yeah. You know feeling. [laughs]
-Yeah.

478
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,919
-How many times do you get stung?
-[Victor] About ten in a day.

479
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,400
-Oh. What?
-[Victor laughs]

480
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
But a bee can only sting you one time.

481
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,399
Once, and they pull out stings
out of the belly, yeah.

482
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,200
-Does it die?
-Eventually, yeah.

483
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,759
So if a man bee stings you, it dies.

484
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,479
And if a man bee has sex,
its penis comes off. Is that true?

485
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,479
Yeah.

486
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,199
-That would be annoying.
-[laughing]

487
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,279
[Jeremy] Oh, listen, you can hear them.

488
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,879
[bees buzzing]

489
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,599
Welcome to your new home, bees.

490
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,119
-[Victor] Good, very good.
-Uh, you're not wearing gloves.

491
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,560
[Victor] Yeah, it's okay.

492
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,720
[Jeremy]
Ooh, look, is that making honey already?

493
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,919
[Victor] Yeah, this is honey.

494
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,720
How long does a bee live?

495
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,639
[Victor] In summer, about one month.

496
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,280
In winter, six months.

497
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,439
But Queen could live much longer,
could live three or four years.

498
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,079
Will there be a queen in here?

499
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,360
[Victor] There should be one,
at least one queen here, yes.

500
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,000
[Jeremy] So how many eggs is she laying?

501
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,959
[Victor]
This time of the year she's laying

502
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,919
about 2,000 eggs per day and night.

503
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,080
-[Jeremy] Jesus.
-Yeah. She's productive.

504
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,920
[Jeremy] Do people steal beehives?

505
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,160
Yes. My friend lost 40 hives last year.

506
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,360
A horse box come at night
and just takes 40 hives from one side.

507
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,480
[Jeremy] Okay.

508
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:09,599
God, look at them coming out.
That is a horror film right there.

509
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,119
Ah! Ow! I've been stung.

510
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,680
[Victor]
Ah, in the socks. Wait, wait, wait.

511
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,239
Well, I think you better go in the bushes.
Go, go inside wood, inside wood.

512
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,279
[Jeremy] Why?

513
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,359
[Victor] Because they release poison,
they gonna go like pack.

514
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,160
One after another. Keep smoking.

515
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,680
-[Jeremy] Once you've been stung?
-[Victor] Yeah.

516
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,280
You'll be fine.

517
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,439
No, I won't be fine,
my foot's going to have to be amputated.

518
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,039
Fucking bees.

519
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,679
That's what I doing every day.
I'm in pain constantly.

520
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,879
So, as soon as the big burly
Ukrainian has turned his back,

521
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,280
I'm going to roll around
on the ground going, "I've been stung."

522
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,279
[Victor laughing]

523
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,400
[Jeremy]
With Operation Bee now running itself,

524
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,520
I had to repair the dam... again.

525
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,879
God, water's annoying.

526
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,560
Now we get some big rocks...

527
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,600
And with that done,
I got back to Operation Owl.

528
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,120
Where I'd had a stroke of luck.

529
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,799
After the mess Kaleb made
putting up the pole...

530
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,160
Cheers, Dave.

531
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,800
...I found this chap and he sinks
telegraph poles for British Telecom

532
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,920
and has very kindly offered
to make the holes needed for me.

533
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,239
As it turned out, I wasn't the first
to dig holes in this part of the farm.

534
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,800
This is a badger city here, look.

535
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,360
Everywhere you look, holes.

536
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,999
Look at this.

537
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,999
That one's only just been dug

538
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,879
and look at the amount of earth
they've kicked out of it.

539
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,880
Once again, we broke out the trap cameras
and that night, this is what we saw.

540
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,399
[whispering] I hate badgers.

541
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Apart from the fact they've eaten
just about every hedgehog in Britain,

542
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,199
they're like teenagers.

543
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,799
They lie in bed all day,
get up at night, transmit diseases,

544
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,040
knock walls over
and then when the sun comes up,

545
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,879
they go back to bed again.

546
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,279
[in normal voice] Today, however,
they wouldn't be getting any sleep at all.

547
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,839
[loud whirring]

548
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,760
Right.

549
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,279
Oh, look at that.

550
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,400
Oh, yeah.

551
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,599
Now the last time we did this,

552
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,920
I was working with an idiot,
and it's all cockeyed,

553
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,960
-but this'll be straight, yeah?
-Yeah.

554
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,919
With the work done and Dave gone,
I couldn't wait to show Kaleb.

555
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,719
Look at this. This is what I can achieve

556
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,159
when I'm left on my own
to just get on with it.

557
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,080
-[Kaleb] Wondered where you'd been.
-Well, there you go, look at that.

558
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,920
And then over there, look.

559
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,960
[Kaleb] Oh, yeah.
Did you cut the posts down?

560
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,359
Yeah. Cut them down to 21 feet.
They're five feet buried in the hole.

561
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,760
-How did you really do it then? Come on.
-I got a spade,

562
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,760
and then twisted the spade round,
made a hole. Got the telehandler--

563
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, wait, hang on a minute, hang on
a minute. [sniffs] Can you smell that?

564
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,479
[Jeremy laughs]

565
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,079
So far then, my plan to rewild
parts of the farm was going very well.

566
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,159
[machinery whirring]

567
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,880
It wasn't all environmental work though.

568
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,679
There was still actual farming to be done.

569
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,200
In February, for instance, I needed
to know how many lambs were on the way.

570
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
-Right, stick your hand down there.
-Yeah.

571
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,279
-Can you feel its backbone?
-Yeah.

572
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,640
So, I met up with Kevin and Ellen
at the mobile sheep scanner.

573
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,400
-They your driving gloves?
-[Jeremy] No.

574
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,320
I've never seen a sheep farmer
wearing gloves like that.

575
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,360
Come on, sheep, in you go, there you go.

576
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,080
Once we'd dealt with the usual
sheep disobedience...

577
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,160
Oh!

578
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,679
-Oh, Christ.
-[sheep bleating]

579
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,560
Ever single one of them is a horse.

580
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,039
...it was time
to break out the gel and get scanning.

581
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,639
[Kevin] There you are, there's a lamb.

582
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:45,199
Can you see its ribs? Its neck?

583
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
You're just the same as one of those
ultrasound nurses in a hospital.

584
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Pointing... "Oh, it's got a penis,"
And you think, "Well, how do you know?"

585
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,160
-Is that the spine then, the black thing?
-No, that's the probe that's in my hand.

586
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Oh, right. [laughing]

587
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,160
One lamb. So she gets a red dot.

588
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,639
Just got one,
so that's not been very productive.

589
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,639
[Ellen] But one's better than nothing.

590
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,519
-[Jeremy] How many's that one got?
-[Kevin] She's got none.

591
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,839
-[Jeremy] None?
-I'm afraid so.

592
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,960
None?

593
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,519
If you want a nice bit of mutton,
that's it.

594
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,279
[sheep bleating]

595
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,640
-[Kevin] So this one's got two.
-Two? Good sheep.

596
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,400
With the scanning complete...

597
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,160
That's it, you're all done.

598
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,359
...it was time to put the scores
on the doors.

599
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,160
So how many have we got of each then, Bob?

600
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,080
-[Bob] One empty.
-[Kevin] Yeah.

601
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,039
-[Bob] Fifteen singles.
-[Kevin] Yeah.

602
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,679
[Bob] Three triplets
and the rest are twins.

603
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,600
-[Kevin] You've got plenty of lambs.
-[Jeremy] Oh, good.

604
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,479
Bob, many thanks for that.
For being the bearer of good news.

605
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,959
Along with getting the sheep scans done,
I'd found a new toy

606
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:56,559
for my dry stone waller
and head of security, Gerald.

607
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,199
-Motion sensor.
-Yeah.

608
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,040
Cable tie this to something...
Everyone stand still, yeah?

609
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,600
-[sensor barking]
-[Gerald laughing]

610
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,960
[barking continues]

611
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,000
[Gerald laughing]

612
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:14,279
[indistinct chatter]

613
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,800
[barking continues]

614
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,359
-Yeah, but I sleep just over there.
-Oh, well.

615
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,360
-Every fox, badger.
-Yeah, but you'll be out here, won't you?

616
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,760
Be like that now, so you probably
won't be arguing about it.

617
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,640
[both laughing]

618
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,159
[mellow music playing]

619
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,000
[Jeremy] And of course,
whenever the weather permitted,

620
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,879
Kaleb and I had to rush off
to tractor the crop fields.

621
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,360
[music continues]

622
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,640
Which this year would not just be filled
with wheat, barley and rape...

623
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,040
because they too would be part
of my wilding project.

624
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,120
-[music continues]
-[birds chirping]

625
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,999
Around about this time of year,

626
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,199
all the spiders and the insects
that have spent the winter

627
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,640
living in the grass margins
at the side of the fields,

628
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,999
will be heading out into the fields

629
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,319
to eat all the little bugs that
are out there now destroying my crops.

630
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,960
I like these spiders and insects.
They are my friends.

631
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,399
Trouble is, this is a big field.
It's so big,

632
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,400
that it would take a spider
five or six weeks to get across it.

633
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,159
So, I've come up with a plan.

634
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,119
[buzzing]

635
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,279
What I'm doing
is sacrificing some of my crops

636
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,600
to make superhighways
that would allow the insects

637
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,879
to get into the middle of the field
more quickly.

638
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,200
And once Kaleb had created the highway,

639
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,920
it was then a case
of hand-sowing some seeds.

640
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,920
-Turns out I'm really good at this.
-I don't know anything about that.

641
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:23,999
So, the lost revenue from this,
which is what, three quarters of an acre?

642
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,399
-[Kaleb] Yeah.
-Is about 350 quid?

643
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,080
Yeah, about that, yeah, yeah.

644
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,399
That, I mean, don't add up to me.

645
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,080
Yeah, it does though,
'cause the environmentalists are gonna go,

646
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,919
"Wow, aren't they brilliant."

647
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,920
If it works, we've revolutionized farming,

648
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
saved the planet, Nobel prizes.

649
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,479
Greta Thunberg comes around.

650
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,639
[Kaleb] To be honest,
I just think of it, you lost 370 quid.

651
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
Congrats.

652
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
[instrumental music playing]

653
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:57,039
[Jeremy] Despite Kaleb's naked realism,
I was loving my wilding project.

654
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,279
And the best was still to come,

655
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,960
because finally,
the centerpiece of my wetland area...

656
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,160
was ready to be filled...

657
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,799
again.

658
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,760
Today's the day when I create a channel,

659
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,040
let's call it the Suez,

660
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,399
between the stream
and the open-cast mine that I've dug

661
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,080
using nothing more than
Kaleb's miserable little digger.

662
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,559
Here we go.

663
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,960
Okay, the moment of truth.

664
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,919
Here it is. Oh-ho-ho! Look at this!

665
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,880
It's the Victoria Falls!

666
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,160
Jay? Just be careful.

667
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,999
You should be wearing
a life jacket, really.

668
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,759
As I reveled in this historic moment,
Kaleb arrived.

669
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,880
Behold what I have created.

670
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,640
I am... I am Moses.

671
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,439
Who's Moses?

672
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,640
-Have you read the Bible?
-No.

673
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,800
In the Bible,
there's this man called Moses.

674
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,680
Yeah.

675
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,080
[Jeremy] And he was leading someone
out of a troubled area

676
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:18,559
into a much better area
and they got to the Red Sea

677
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,759
and they were stuck
and then the waters parted

678
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,640
and they were able to walk
across the sea bed

679
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,519
and get to the Promised Land.

680
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,880
That's bullshit.

681
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,919
[Jeremy] In just one day,
the pond was full.

682
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,439
And immediately,
I decided to fill it with lunch.

683
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,600
I got 250 lovely
brown trout about that size.

684
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,079
My favorite fish. I mean, not to look at.

685
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,159
[whispers] To eat.

686
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,559
Back. Back.

687
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,039
See, now, that's good, stop, stop, stop.

688
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:02,599
Then I'm gonna put the back down
and we're going to attach this chute

689
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,799
and we are going to chute them in.

690
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,840
Right. How can I help?

691
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,880
That sounds like I'm on Countryfile.

692
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,800
-[chuckling]
-[Jeremy] That does.

693
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,800
Oh, let me...
Let me see if I can help. Oh!

694
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,600
Oh, wow, there they all are, look.

695
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:20,319
Are they gonna be all right
falling from that height?

696
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,800
That's the way to do it. I'm sure
you've seen the photos of the Herculeses

697
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,640
dropping trout
into the Great Lakes in Canada,

698
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,160
-which they do from airplanes.
-No.

699
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,320
The splash of them going in there
is absolutely fine.

700
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,680
And that wakes them up
and we'll let them go away.

701
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,640
If you just gently net them in,

702
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,280
the fish will lie on the side
and drown at the bottom.

703
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,400
What? So they're like sheep,

704
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,200
-but with fins.
-Yes.

705
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,960
Right, I declare
the Chipping Norton Water Park open.

706
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,639
Look at that.

707
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,800
That is hilarious.

708
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,760
Look at them, they're jumping...
Look at them. Happy fishes.

709
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,960
[man] They are.

710
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,359
[Jeremy] All I had to do now
was make sure the fish stayed alive

711
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,360
which, given my track record,
was not a certainty.

712
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,680
Many, many years ago,
my dad had a fish pond

713
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,160
and he used to love
going out in the evening

714
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,599
and sprinkling food in it
and watching his carp.

715
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,359
And I thought one Christmas,
"Brilliant present,

716
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,480
"I'm gonna buy him some
more carp for his pond."

717
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:24,479
So I bought him
these things called Ghost Carp.

718
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,359
Amazing looking things.

719
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,440
And he was dead chuffed

720
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,999
and we put them in his pond

721
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,759
and then realized immediately
why they were called Ghost Carp,

722
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,800
'cause they're completely invisible
when they're underwater,

723
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,360
so he couldn't see these fish
that I'd bought him.

724
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,640
And a week later,
all of his other carp had disappeared.

725
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,280
And we, um, we looked up
the Ghost Carp in a book,

726
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,160
'cause there was no Internet then,

727
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:52,839
and it turned out that Ghost Carp
eat other sorts of carp.

728
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,920
So I'd bought him some invisible fish
that killed his visible fish.

729
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,719
But this was no time for pessimism,

730
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,600
as the pond was now looking tremendous

731
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,200
and that's not all.

732
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,600
Finally, some good news
on the dam front. It's holding water.

733
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,839
It's taken me three weeks.

734
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,280
I've ruined two shirts,
four pairs of jeans,

735
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,680
and broken two
of Kaleb's battery-operated power drills,

736
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,320
but I've done it.

737
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,079
Look at this.

738
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,800
[yelling in frustration]

739
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,159
The truth is though,
that the leaky dam was the only pimple

740
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:57,959
in what was becoming
quite a successful wilding project.

741
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,919
Over the past few weeks,
I'd made homes for owls and kestrels.

742
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,119
I'd let the sun shine on the forest floor.

743
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,600
I'd introduced more wild flowers

744
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,479
and given some of my crop fields
back to nature.

745
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,280
And there was no doubt

746
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,360
that all of this had resulted
in a better environment for insects.

747
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,520
Which was the whole point.

748
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:35,999
Even though it had cost thousands,
I'd loved it.

749
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,080
And now what I really needed

750
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:42,279
was a pat on the back from Charlie.

751
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,560
[birds chirping]

752
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:46,079
-Oh, here he is.
-Hello, how are you?

753
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,399
[Jeremy] Well, I'm very well.
I'm just waiting to hear

754
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,920
what I've done wrong
with my important work.

755
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,080
It's looking great. Looking good.

756
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,240
You just said that?

757
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,320
You said I've done...
You said I've done a good job?

758
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,600
[Charlie] Yeah.

759
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,079
[Jeremy] And actually,
when I thought about it,

760
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,559
there was more to celebrate
than just that.

761
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,719
Can I just say, if I may,

762
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,480
we had the wettest planting season
in history, yes? You would agree.

763
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,399
-That I can remember.
-Yes.

764
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,240
We had Brexit

765
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,760
and despite all that, I, in my first year,
complete novice,

766
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,040
with a little bit of help
from you and Kaleb,

767
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,439
managed to get all the seeds we need to
in the ground.

768
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,439
[Charlie]
Yeah. The winter wheat looks good.

769
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,399
The winter barley looks good.
The rape hasn't been eaten by pigeons.

770
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,400
-This is Teacher giving me a good report.
-You know, it's really good.

771
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,440
[Jeremy] We've got this wilding,
landscaping thing, sorted out.

772
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,079
Everything, for once, is all going well.

773
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,679
And, so long as nothing else goes wrong,

774
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
-we're gonna be quids in.
-Everything's going

775
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,720
-in the right direction.
-Exactly.

776
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,520
[Boris] It's now a global pandemic.

777
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,999
Now is the time for everyone
to stop non-essential contact with others.

778
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,840
How are you?

779
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,040
Well, I'm scared shitless.

780
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,279
I'm pushing 60, I've smoked
three quarters of a million cigarettes.

781
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,040
I've had pneumonia,
so my lungs are scarred.

782
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,879
-If I get it--
-Yeah, there's not a lot of hope.

783
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,960
[music playing]
