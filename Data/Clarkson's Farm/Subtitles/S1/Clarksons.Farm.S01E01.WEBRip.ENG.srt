[tires screech]

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,960
[Jeremy] For many years,
this has been my day job.

-[tires screech]

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,959
Going in hard and hot!

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,519
[Jeremy] But when
the important work was over...

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,440
[tires screeching]

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,719
I've lost one of my nose tampons!

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,959
[Jeremy] ...I came home to this.

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,519
It's my farm in the Cotswolds.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,760
Nestling among the ancient
stone villages,

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,879
it's a peaceful, 1,000-acre haven
of wide open fields,

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,200
brooks,

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,400
waterfalls,

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,039
woods,

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,239
and wild flower meadows.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,680
It stretches from those trees
over there on the far horizon,

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,040
then it goes behind that big wood,

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,760
down into the valley
and then up past here

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,880
to a point a couple of miles over there.

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,039
And ever since I bought it back in 2008,

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,280
it's been run by a chap from the village.

24
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,679
However, he told me a couple
of months ago that he is retiring,

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,640
so I've come up with a plan.

26
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,839
I shall farm it myself.

00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,439

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,440
I've never done this.

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
Ooh! Farming happening.

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,839
That's as straight as a roundabout!

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
Oh, that sign of me going up there
is not happening.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,440
We're gonna have a sign saying,
"Guess who drilled this?

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Jeremy, Kaleb?"

36
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,119
[automated voice] Take off!

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
[Jeremy] Right.

38
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,079
Let's go round up some sheep.

39
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,879
[woman] Jeremy, you're going
too fast.

40
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,519
[Jeremy] Oh, shit. Please stop.

41
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,439
Come on, don't rain. Don't rain.

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
This is global warming.

43
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,159
And you racing about all your life
in vehicles.

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,160
Just unbelievable horseshit.

45
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,719
[man] See them? They're goldfinches.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,720
Really? It actually makes me really happy.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Behold! I am Moses.

48
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
[gasps] And what the fuck
are you doing up here?

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,840
Who's Moses?

50
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,599
It's a baby.

51
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,719
Ooh. Jeez.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
Have you looked after sheep before?

53
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,959
-[sheep bleating]
-[Jeremy] I think I've got in its anus.

54
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,999
No.

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,840
[engine revving]

56
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,799
[Jeremy] Oh, yes!

57
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,039
This is my wilding project.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,160
-[man] Oh, my God!
-[Jeremy] Oh, no, no, no.

59
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,520
This is not wilding.
That's damage.

60
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,559
It's like Fortnum & Masons.

61
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,479
It's what?

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,040
[engine whirring]

63
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,240
Oh, my God. What have I done?

64
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,159
Whoa!

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,960
-[chuckles]
-[Jeremy sighs]

66
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,639
Stay in your vehicle please.
Stay in your vehicle.

67
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,599
I'm pushing 60. I've smoked three
quarters of a million cigarettes.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,040
I've had pneumonia. If I get it...

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,800
Yeah, there's not a lot of hope.

70
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,479
[Jeremy whistling]

71
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,839
[Jeremy] Oh, shit.

72
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,240
Shit, shit.

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,640
Wayne Rooney's dead.

74
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,839
And this is the moment.

75
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,879
You missed a bit.

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,560
-Where?
-In the mirror.

77
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,919
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
-I didn't.
-You did.

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,320
[Jeremy] All that is to come,
but right now,

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,680
it's time to start my first job.

81
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,439
The biggest, most important
job of them all.

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,080
Planting wheat and barley
in all the big fields like this one.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,880
And how do you do that?

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,160
No idea. Literally, honestly,
I have absolutely no clue.

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,680
All I do know is it's going
to involve some tractoring.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
[theme music playing]

87
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,600
[Jeremy] Obviously,
to do tractoring I need a tractor.

88
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,320
So, on day one,
I set off to my local dealership.

89
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,599
Quite like this one.
Look, the Super Major.

90
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,359
There are worse names.

91
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,760
As I'm familiar with stuff that has
four wheels and an engine,

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,880
I should have been at home here,
but I wasn't.

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,520
So I sought advice from
the dealership's owner, Patrick Edwards.

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
How much is this?

95
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,560
7,500. That is what we specialize in.

96
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,239
-You've got an engine at the front.
-[Jeremy] Yeah.

97
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,719
You've got a gear box, and a back axle.
No suspension. No fancy electronics.

98
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,640
There's nothing to go wrong
that we can't mend.

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,440
-What horsepower has that got?
-[Patrick] 45 horsepower.

100
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,919
[Jeremy] It's a bit feeble.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,040
Well, it fed the country.

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
I know but people didn't
eat very much in those days.

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
-[Patrick laughs]
-Um...

104
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,519
What's the most power,
what's that got horsepower-wise?

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,960
[Patrick] Well, that would be
about 65 horsepower.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,960
And is that the most
powerful one here?

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
Yes, yeah.

108
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,559
-65 Horse-power?
-Yes.

109
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,879
[Jeremy] I then took one of his
restored tractors for a test drive.

110
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,799
Oh, it begins.

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,560
Let's open it up.

112
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,559
Oh.

113
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,399
[Jeremy] Having finished
my test drive, I made a decision,

114
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
and bought this.

115
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,440
[engine whirring]

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,720
This is a Lamborghini R8.

117
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,599
Oh, my God, this thing is enormous!

118
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,479
Everything about it is just large.

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Weighs ten tons.

120
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,519
I have 40 forwards gears,
and 40 reverse gears.

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,080
And I know that little Massey Ferguson
was very sweet, but come on!

122
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,279
Okay, and here we are
at the farm.

123
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,599
Ooh, hello.

124
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

125
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,280
Oh, shit.

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
Right.

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,280
[Jeremy] First up with
an opinion was my girlfriend, Lisa.

128
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,479
That is, that's too big. [laughs]

129
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,240
[Jeremy] It isn't. It isn't,
the shed's too...

130
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,999
Enormous.

131
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,839
Little.

132
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
-[car honks]
-Ah!

133
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,000
Here's someone who does
know about farming.

134
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,599
It's Charlie Ireland.
Now he's my, sort of, land agent.

135
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,200
He knows what's needed
and when it's needed.

136
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,959
He'll be guiding me over the coming year.

137
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,719
-Jeremy, hello.
-Charlie, how are you?

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
Very well thanks.
How are you?

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,000
-[grunts]
-It's quite large.

140
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,199
Um...

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,240
Come on, it's a good tractor.

142
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,120
It's got the wrong hitch on.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
What?

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
[Charlie] That's a European hitch.

145
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,519
[Jeremy] What's...
I got it from Germany.

146
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,120
[Charlie] You may well have done.

147
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,159
So I can't attach anything
to the back of this?

148
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,200
Not at the moment.

149
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,880
But it is a big tractor.

150
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,280
I think it's a vast tractor up here.

151
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,079
-Uh...
-Too big?

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
Yes.

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,640
[car door closes]

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,240
[Jeremy] Charlie then sat me down
to explain just how expensive

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,480
it would be to get my crops in the ground.

156
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,199
So you've got a tractor.

157
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,719
-Yeah.
-Albeit too big.

158
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,359
You then need some
implements to go on the back of it.

159
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
So the tractor at 40.
What else do you need?

160
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,639
A cultivator, 20-25,000.

161
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,039
A new drill, probably 40-50,000.

162
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,760
60,000 for a sprayer.

163
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,399
And you haven't got a trailer.

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
10,000.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Blades are 62,000.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,720
About 35,000.

167
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,199
Same in fertilizer.

168
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,359
[Jeremy] So we're about two...
we're a quarter of a million.

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
[Charlie] Quarter of a million pounds.

170
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,360
And that's just the, you know, sort of
the backbone of the equipment you want.

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm just going
to say it again.

172
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,599
-Quarter of a million pounds.
-A quarter of a million pounds.

173
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,879
So we can either do it two ways.
Either get some new equipment,

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,160
or we can probably do it
the sensible way

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,840
and get some good secondhand
machinery that's lower value.

176
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,439
-Yeah.
-There's a couple of farm sales coming up.

177
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,239
Okay, so we'll go to a farm sale.

178
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,879
Yeah.

179
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,959
[western music playing]

180
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,999
[Jeremy]
So, a few days later,

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,360
on a beautiful Cotswolds' morning,

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,760
I fired up the checkbook
and went shopping.

183
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,519
Charlie had provided me
with a list of what to buy,

184
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,519
but it might as well have been in Arabic.

185
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,519
No idea what that is.

186
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,599
[Jeremy] No idea.

187
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,600
What the hell is that? I mean,
what is everything?

188
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,080
Like a medieval funfair, this.

189
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,199
Hundreds of different ways
of killing yourself.

190
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,080
There are apparently 20 times
more deaths among people

191
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,879
working in agriculture

192
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,120
than there are in all
the other sectors combined.

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,880
20 times more.

194
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,599
And when you see equipment like this,
you can see why.

195
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,399
You're alone, you're in a field,
you fall in there...

196
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,640
and then you're just sort of
fed into your own field.

197
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,000
I see, right,
I think I've worked this one out.

198
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,000
You attach it to the tractor here,

199
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,760
and then you slip

200
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,359
and that scrapes your arm off,

201
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
and then the other one scrapes
your arm into the ground.

202
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,319
Greetings. Are you a farmer?

203
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,279
[man] No, no, I'm a forester.

204
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,679
[Jeremy] Really good way of chopping
your arm off in forestry.

205
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,679
Oh...

206
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,079
You actually haven't got any fingers.

207
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,519
Unbelievable. Have you
seen this?

208
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
-Works in forestry.
-Yeah.

209
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,799
This is a thing of beauty.

210
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,600
Button-back Dralon three-piece suite.

211
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,239
Oh, yes.

212
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
[Jeremy] Soon, the fields
started to fill up.

213
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,799
And the auction buzz was building.

214
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,839
He's just showing off. Look at me,
still got an arm.

215
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,200
Amazon have said they want
as much diversity in this show

216
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,959
as we can possibly manage,
and I think we're doing well

217
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,199
because if you look,

218
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,079
there's every different type
of white 60-year-old man here.

219
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,519
Right, we have a great line-up
of arable kit, and grassland kit.

220
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,560
[Jeremy] To make sure
I didn't rip myself off,

221
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,239
Charlie had also provided
a handy price guide for each bit of kit.

222
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
I need lot three here.

223
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,879
Good price would be six and a half.
Bad price would be 13.

224
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,520
[auctioneer] Vernon C&M cultivator.
At £1,000 just to your left.

225
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,760
At £1,000 I'm bid.
At £1,000. At £1,000.

226
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,200
[Jeremy] Under the watchful gaze
of a man who seemed to have had

227
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,039
an argument with a threshing machine,

228
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,400
I started bidding.

229
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,680
14. 16. 1800, I'm bid.

230
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,679
2,000 I'm bid. Two-two. Two-four.

231
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,679
At two-six. Three-two.

232
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,559
At three-three. At three-eight.

233
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,999
3850.

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Your bid, sir. Six-double one.

235
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,879
-Six double one. Thank you.
-[Auctioneer] Thank you.

236
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,080
That was good.

237
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,479
[Jeremy] See, we were told six
and a half thousand was a good price.

238
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,839
We've just got that for 3950.

239
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,159
Yes!

240
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,680
[auctioneer] On we go, lot 33.

241
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,079
It's a Bomford double-seven hedge cutter.

242
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,279
2,000 I'm bid.

243
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,439
[Jeremy] I did go a bit over
on some of my other purchases.

244
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,239
-Your bid, sir.
-Oh, dear.

245
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,640
So, I was told not to go above
3,600 and I've gone to 5,100.

246
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,399
[auctioneer] Here we go then.
Bid's on there.

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,000
[Jeremy] But, at the end
of the sale...

248
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,760
[auctioneer] At four-two I'm bid.

249
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,079
At 2006.

250
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,719
[Jeremy]
...I had everything I needed.

251
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,559
Your bid, sir. Six-eleven. The buyer.

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,520
[Jeremy] Having spent
£82,000 on equipment,

253
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,519
and £2 on office furniture,

254
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,080
my next job, according to Charlie,
was to go through the timetable

255
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,039
for getting the crops in the ground.

256
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,280
So I've worked out a cropping plan.

257
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,920
[Jeremy] And this is what we're putting
in this year then.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,520
This is what I think we should put in.

259
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,440
This is, we've got to get
the winter barley in...

260
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,359
So the winter barley,
that's all the way along here.

261
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,040
[Jeremy] Well, that's got to be
done now and the wheat here,

262
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,080
-it's got to be done now.
-[Charlie] Yeah.

263
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,679
So it's 235 acres.
We've got all this to...

264
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,959
And then we've got the 200 acres
of spring barley to prepare for.

265
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,039
So we've got to get cultivation, get
spraying off, cultivations and drilling.

266
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,080
-In...
-In under two weeks.

267
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,999
Okay.

268
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,400
Yeah, the problem is if we don't
drill the winter barley then,

269
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
the yield will start dropping off.

270
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,479
We need lots of seeds in the ground
to get those going,

271
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,039
so we've got quite a lot to do.

272
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,760
[stammers] Okay.

273
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,919
And then there's the biggest challenge
is you've got, we've got to learn how to,

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
you know, you've got
to learn how to do it.

275
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,320
-Yeah, I know, but, I mean--
-'Cause, you know, there's an old saying,

276
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,039
that I've got, you know,
"Well sown is half grown."

277
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,520
So if the crop is planted well,
then actually you're halfway there.

278
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,640
So the biggest risk factor is--

279
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,440
-Not planting properly.
-Not planting it properly.

280
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,519
Right.

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
And we haven't mentioned the other factor.

282
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,360
We all get weather.

283
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,320
If the weather is rubbish,
we just have to sit there.

284
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,519
So the soil needs to be dry.

285
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,440
[Charlie] The soil needs to be,
you know, in good condition.

286
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,600
-[Jeremy] Lorry.
-There's a lorry arrived.

287
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,840
-[Jeremy] What have we got?
-We've got fertilizer...

288
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,159
-Yeah.
-Coming here.

289
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,400
And seed in this one. So...

290
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,520
-So I need to--
-We need to move the tractor.

291
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,960
-Yeah.
-Then the forklift's in here.

292
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,519
-Yeah.
-So we'll get that going.

293
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,559
[tractor beeping]

294
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,559
[Charlie] Should have got
a smaller tractor.

295
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,359
I reckon these guys are gonna get
itchy in a minute.

296
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,240
[Jeremy] Just as I was about
to get started,

297
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,280
cheerful Charlie delivered
a little bundle of government red tape.

298
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,839
-We've got some hay in there.
-Yeah.

299
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,279
So we need to move the hay, so you can't
store a combustible such as hay,

300
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,560
straw, or anything like that
with fertilizer.

301
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,519
The two mix quite well,
so you've got an oxidizing agent.

302
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,160
-Why not, why not?
-[Charlie] Well because...

303
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,080
Hay doesn't spontaneously combust.

304
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,799
[Charlie] Well, it might do
in the presence of fertilizer.

305
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,199
-Why might... really?
-Just... we're not allowed to.

306
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,559
It's breaching the fertilizer industry
assurance standard rules.

307
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,799
So the government has an opinion
on what I store my fertilizer next to?

308
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,439
In fairness, it's quite a sensible one.

309
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,639
Within our working week,
we've got to build in, you know,

310
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,160
the regulations and rules
that we have to comply by.

311
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,159
Some of those rules
are a little bit challenging

312
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,480
but, you know, they're there for a reason.

313
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,519
Farming's a patient game,

314
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,080
and given that he's, you know,
not the world's most patient man...

315
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,160
[Jeremy sighs] Fucking useless.

316
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,440
You know, that will be a real test.

317
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,559
[Jeremy] Up, up, up, up, up,
up, up, up, up.

318
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
[sighs]

319
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,559
Fuck's sake.

320
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,680
[Jeremy] Eventually, the hay,

321
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,719
and everything else
that might suddenly explode,

322
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,439
was taken out of the shed.

323
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,439
And much to the relief
of the delivery drivers,

324
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,999
I could finally start unloading.

325
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Oh, look at this. Look at this.

326
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,560
Ah-ha-ha.

327
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
Backwards.

328
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,639
Excellent. [sighs]

329
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,799
Cheers, mate. That's brilliant.

330
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,440
Do you want to pull forwards
so I can get the seed off?

331
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,199
There's, uh, 46 more bags
on here for you.

332
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,080
[Jeremy] What?

333
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,559
Yeah. It's all for you.

334
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,800
All the way back.

335
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,079
[Jeremy] You're kidding!

336
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
This is all for you.

337
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,240
[Jeremy] I know, he just said.

338
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,680
Despite a couple of small accidents...

339
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
Oh, shit.

340
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,679
...I had all the fertilizer and the seed
unloaded in just five hours.

341
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,719
[sighs]

342
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,879
-[driver] This was it?
-Yeah.

343
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,320
[driver] One of those,
and one of those.

344
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,760
-Sixteen and a half tons.
-[driver] That's right.

345
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,519
There you go, and many thanks
for your patience.

346
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,079
-No problem.
-It was my first day,

347
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,440
so I wasn't quite as quick as
I perhaps will be one day.

348
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,080
Now, I had the seed and fertilizer,

349
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,560
I was finally ready to start farming.

350
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,559
And with Charlie's tight timetable
looming over me,

351
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,280
I had to learn my way around
the equipment quickly.

352
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,160
So once the correct hitch
had been fitted to the tractor,

353
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
I sprang into action.

354
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,559
I assumed the answer to the question
of how I join everything together

355
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,680
lay in the cab. However...

356
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,559
Three buttons there. I don't know
what they do.

357
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,080
No, no, don't know.

358
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,519
No.

359
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,679
No.

360
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,879
Buttons here, don't know.

361
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,479
No.

362
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,919
And then... Oh, God, look.

363
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,759
There was only one thing for it.

364
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,039
Call my local branch
of the National Farmers' Union

365
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,679
and ask for help.

366
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,159
No, that would be prefect. Thanks.

367
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,920
That's good. My union representative's
coming over to give me some help.

368
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll go and light the brazier.

369
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,640
Instead of Arthur Scargill, however...

370
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,279
they sent Georgia Craig.

371
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,919
[Jeremy] I'll be honest, I'm not
the most practical man.

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,280
-Are you good with tractors?
-Yeah.

373
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,519
But this is the only tractor
you've got?

374
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

375
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,800
-Okay.
-Well, what's wrong with it?

376
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,400
It's just a bit... it's quite big
for what you've got.

377
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,800
Everyone keeps saying it's too...
everyone says it's too big.

378
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,480
-[Georgia] What made you choose it?
-[Jeremy] It's a Lamborghini.

379
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,159
-I'll get it done more quickly.
-Right, okay.

380
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,440
So what's the problem?

381
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,159
[Jeremy] Honestly, truthfully, I don't
really know how the tractor works.

382
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,640
I can drive it but I can't operate it.

383
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,560
-But it's got three gear levers.
-Yeah.

384
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,160
Two brake pedals and 8,000 buttons.

385
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,560
-Okay.
-Some of which are in German.

386
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
Okey-doke.

387
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,239
Lesson one
was learning how to attach the tractor

388
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,799
to something called a cultivator.

389
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,079
[Georgia] That's it. Hold it there.

390
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,999
[groaning]

391
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,319
Who put a door catch there?

392
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,240
It's the last time I'm coming out
of there forwards.

393
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,999
[Georgia] The first thing I've noticed
is that pin is down,

394
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,679
so you want to have
both pins up.

395
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,080
Can I go in there?

396
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,640
I would turn the engine off,
and then pull the pin up,

397
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,800
-to be safe, as it's your first time.
-Back up the ladder?

398
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
[Georgia] Yeah.

399
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,840
[exhales]

400
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,800
-Right.
-Right so--

401
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,920
[Georgia] Pull that pin up.

402
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,680
So what we're gonna do is,
lift the link arms up.

403
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,360
-Right, so I start the engine?
-Yeah.

404
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Back up the ladder.

405
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,520
-[beeping]
-Don't do that. Sit in it.

406
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,719
[grunts]

407
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,600
[engine starts]

408
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,480
[grunts]

409
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,679
-[Georgia] Right.
-[Jeremy] No, can I kick that one?

410
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,599
It's just slight-- look.

411
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,240
[Georgia] No. no, no. Don't kick it.
Do it inside.

412
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,240
[Jeremy] Back up the ladder.

413
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,679
[Georgia] That's it. Hold it there.

414
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,280
Can I operate it from in here
and see if that works?

415
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,439
No, because they might come flying up.

416
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,280
For Christ's sake.

417
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay, so you're nearly on.

418
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,920
You just need to come back
a tiny little bit and then they'll go on.

419
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
[Jeremy] Yeah,
but it's literally a millimeter.

420
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
Yeah. You only need a little bit.

421
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,520
[Jeremy] Back up the ladder again.

422
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,719
[grunts]

423
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,759
Fucking hell.

424
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,799
[beeping]

425
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,120
[Georgia] That's it. Right.

426
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
Turn the engine off
and then we'll do it from out here.

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,280
I'm going to operate it from in here.
I don't care what she says.

428
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,959
Ha, ha!

429
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,159
[Georgia] No. Oh, shit.

430
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,800
[Jeremy] Yes! I did it.

431
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,759
I just couldn't be bothered
to come down the ladder again.

432
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,159
With the cultivator attached,

433
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,280
we headed out to a nearby field

434
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,599
so Georgia could teach me how to use it,
and what it did.

435
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,319
[Georgia] The idea is
that we're just loosening the top,

436
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,360
the sort of friable surface of the soil.

437
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,879
So we loosen it up now,
jiggle it up a bit.

438
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,920
-[Georgia] Yeah.
-So when we put the seeds in

439
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
-using the driller...
-Yeah.

440
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,639
-...they're into good, loosened-up soil.
-Yeah.

441
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,960
And so began my first driving lesson
for 42 years.

442
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,079
-First gear?
-Yeah.

443
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,520
-Low?
-Yeah.

444
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,359
[Jeremy] Let's farm.

445
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
Look at that, I'm farming.

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,040
I'm doing it!

447
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,439
[Georgia] Look at the difference already.

448
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,999
You can see where you've cultivated.

449
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,359
Right, let's go a little bit faster
'cause we always want to get that soil

450
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
to bubble up. Speed up a bit.

451
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,000
And that soil is, like, boiling, isn't it?
Like a soil boil.

452
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,560
It's amazing.

453
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
[Georgia] So before you turn,

454
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,239
lift up, then we're gonna do
a three-point turn.

455
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
[Jeremy] Lifting.

456
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,399
[Georgia] Little turn.

457
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,840
[Jeremy] Going down.

458
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,759
[Georgia] Do you like cruising
in your Lambo?

459
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,040
[Jeremy] Oh, come on,
it's a pretty good tractor.

460
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,480
[Georgia] Too big.

461
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,559
[Jeremy] Isn't too big.

462
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,480
[Georgia] It is.

463
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,400
[Jeremy] I was very much
enjoying farming,

464
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,920
so I decided to pull over
and enjoy it some more with a ploughman's.

465
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
-[Georgia] What cheese is this?
-Cheddar.

466
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
-Do you want some piccalilli?
-[Georgia] Mmm.

467
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,519
I think you're ready to go on your own.

468
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,439
Cultivating.

469
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,439
Really?

470
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,319
Yeah,
'cause you'll get your own feel for it.

471
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,800
Flying solo on day one.

472
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,720
[Georgia] Hmm.

473
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,279
I'm actually doing farming.

474
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,600
-Which is what I--
-That's what you wanted to do.

475
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,520
I've never... I know.

476
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,479
And Howard, the previous farmer, said...

477
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,959
I'm jacking it in
and I just thought I'll do it.

478
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
And everybody said you're stupid,

479
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,880
you're literally...
that's the stupidest thing ever.

480
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
You'll never be able to do it.

481
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,479
-[Georgia] And now you are.
-[Jeremy] I'm actually doing farming.

482
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,920
Look at that now.

483
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,800
That's beautiful, isn't it?

484
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,120
[Georgia] Perfect.

485
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,200
I like that tractor.

486
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,519
Hmm. I like that tractor.

487
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,479
I shouldn't have been mean
about it to start with.

488
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,639
-[Jeremy] No.
-I was probably just jealous.

489
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,000
[Jeremy chuckles]

490
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,519
[soft music playing]

491
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,719
The next morning, I was up early.

492
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,880
Excited about going solo.

493
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,880
This is not a bad commute,
you know, this isn't.

494
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,880
Forging a path through the dew
on a beautiful, beautiful autumn morning.

495
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,360
Look at that view.

496
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,359
[gasps]

497
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,080
Lower cultivator. Cultivator lowered.

498
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,600
Farming happening.

499
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,799
Look at my seagulls.

500
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,960
There are thousands of 'em.

501
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Ha.

502
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,120
I wonder if seagulls can hear tractors
from 70 miles away.

503
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,280
They must be able to.

504
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,080
It was a wonderful happy day.

505
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,800
Third gear.

506
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,120
Nice.

507
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,720
In fact, the only irritation
was having to faff about

508
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,199
turning round at the end of every run.

509
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,879
[engine revving]

510
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,080
So I came up with a better idea.

511
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Right, here's my plan, it's a good one.

512
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,920
I'm not gonna one of those
three point turns, then come back

513
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
alongside the bit I've just done.

514
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,919
I'm gonna do
a series of U-turns like that,

515
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,480
and then

516
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,400
come back on the bits I haven't done
and it'll all fit together.

517
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,479
All right, ready?
Up she comes.

518
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,999
Go on full lock.

519
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,120
And then drop it back down.

520
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Oh, yeah.

521
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,120
I just have to stay parallel with that bit
I've already done over there

522
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,760
and then I'll, yes.

523
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,880
Sadly, though, this turned out
to be harder than I thought.

524
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Oh, God, I've not done this right.

525
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,959
Yeah, look what I've done.

526
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,120
I've made a mess.

527
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,519
I'm gonna have to come up it again.

528
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,839
[chuckling]

529
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,840
Jeremy Clarkson,
he can't even drive in a straight line.

530
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,880
[Jeremy] There's a bit over there
as well. Jesus wept.

531
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,280
I was wasting a lot of fuel
doing unnecessary runs,

532
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,439
and time. Time which I couldn't afford.

533
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,160
I had to get this field done,

534
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
and all the others.

535
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,639
That's 435 acres

536
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,240
in less than 14 days.

537
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,599
And all I'd managed to do on the first day
was ten acres.

538
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,360
Now I've made a total Horlicks of this.

539
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,040
I realized that I needed help.

540
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,319
-Kaleb, nice to meet you.
-How are you--

541
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,640
So I called Kaleb Cooper.

542
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,400
The tractor driver who'd worked
for the previous farmer.

543
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm in a muddle.

544
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,120
[chuckles]

545
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm in a proper, proper muddle because,

546
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,400
well, I mean you've farmed this farm,
haven't you for--

547
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,400
Yeah, I've farmed this farm
for three years.

548
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,600
-Three years is it?
-Yeah.

549
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,480
Well I've been nearly 24 hours

550
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,239
and all I've managed to do is cultivate
ten acres of,

551
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,839
is that Bury Hill South?

552
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,800
Ten acres?

553
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,240
Hmm.

554
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,679
And some of it went a bit wrong.

555
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Um...

556
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,119
When you've done it in the past,
how long did it take to cultivate?

557
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,880
So that would probably take me

558
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
a good week,

559
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,719
but that's long hours
to do the whole farm.

560
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,759
Never mind long hours, but a week?

561
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,839
Yeah. A week.

562
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,440
[Jeremy]
And that was just the cultivating.

563
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,759
We'd then have to plant the seeds
using something called a drill.

564
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,599
And how long would that take?

565
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,879
A bit longer because, A...
what drill have you got?

566
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,239
A... a red one.

567
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,679
A red one?

568
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,959
It's colored red. It's re...
or is it orange?

569
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,879
It's reddy-orange.

570
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,880
Reddy orange?

571
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
So what else do you do apart from this?

572
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,520
So I've got my own contracting business
on the side,

573
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,239
Kaleb Cooper Contracting Services.

574
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,919
I've also got a 1.5-ton digger.

575
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,880
I do general digger work, such as burying
pipes, water pipes, digging footings.

576
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,120
So you're quite practical.

577
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
-Yeah. I've also--
-Animals?

578
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,920
I've also got 50 head of sheep.

579
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,720
I normally try and do five pigs a year
to fatten up for sausages, pork chops.

580
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,719
I've also got about 120 chickens
at the minute on the farm.

581
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,119
I sell the eggs locally.

582
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
How old are you?

583
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,879
I'm 21.

584
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,120
-What?
-This year. 21.

585
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,040
You're making me feel pathetic.

586
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,799
I'm 59. I haven't done any of that.

587
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,000
So what's your plan? So we've got--

588
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,719
This has been drawn up by Charlie Ireland.

589
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,679
-[Kaleb] Yeah.
-We've got winter wheat

590
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,119
in Bury Hill South and--

591
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,440
-Yes.
-Do you know what that one's called?

592
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,479
Laus. You do. What's this one called then?

593
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,639
Near Brossola.

594
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,520
-Yeah. This one.
-Deadman.

595
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:49,639
-Do you know the names of all the fields?
-Yeah, I know the names of all the fields.

596
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,480
Heredrone,

597
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,839
coming down is Downs Ground.

598
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,679
Coming down after that is Big Ground,

599
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,919
coming after that is Banks,

600
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,760
and then Spittaway, Taylor's.

601
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,119
Down on the road here is Near Bossola.

602
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
-[Jeremy] Mmm-hmm.
-Far Brossola.

603
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,400
How do you know this?

604
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,280
Well I spent three years in each field

605
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,519
spraying, drilling, cultivating.

606
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,719
-You're a local man then?
-Yeah.

607
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,919
Chippy born and bred.

608
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,240
-Chipping Norton School?
-Never left the place.

609
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,239
You've never left it?

610
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,759
-No.
-Been to London?

611
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,039
No. Oh, once on an art trip.

612
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,159
I stayed in the coach.

613
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,119
-Didn't like it.
-[Jeremy] What you--

614
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Too many people.

615
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,759
Banbury?

616
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,439
Banbury at a push.

617
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,560
That's if I need something desperately.

618
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,280
But otherwise you're happy,
Chipping Norton.

619
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,959
Chippy Norton, Chadlington, Heythrop.

620
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,639
That's pretty much, yeah, that's me.

621
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,520
You sound like just the saving grace.

622
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,719
It's almost as though God himself
has beamed you down.

623
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,599
Good. Let's go see the tractor.

624
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,719
Wow. Lamborghini!

625
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,799
I know.

626
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,800
[Kaleb chuckles]

627
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,040
[dramatic music playing]

628
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,280
[Jeremy] With Kaleb and I
operating in shifts, the pace picked up.

629
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,560
And it needed to because,
as Charlie kept reminding me,

630
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,000
time was money.

631
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,039
If I can get all my winter barley
planted by October the 7th,

632
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,319
I can expect next year
a yield of around about

633
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,920
three and a half tons an acre.

634
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
But if it rains,

635
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,760
or the tractor breaks down and I'm late,

636
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,039
even by so much as a few days,

637
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,279
that yield would drop
to perhaps two tons an acre.

638
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:35,519
Ton and a half down per acre,

639
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,919
and each ton is £120.
So over a hundred acres,

640
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,959
I'd be losing £18,000.

641
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,760
Kaleb reckoned however,
that if we kept up this pace,

642
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,599
we could have all 435 acres planted

643
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,280
by the deadline of October the 7th.

644
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,959
Bottom field is complete.

645
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,559
Yes, you mighty tractor.

646
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,160
However, just three days
into our labors...

647
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,559
[thunder rumbling]

648
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
[rain pattering]

649
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,959
When the rain did eventually slacken
48 frustrating hours later,

650
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,639
I ventured out again.

651
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,960
But I didn't get far.

652
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,920
Right. The bolt has come out of there

653
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,880
and that bolt's come out
and turned the other way round,

654
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,960
which means these discs
aren't turning, which means,

655
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,559
look, I'm just creating
a little mud mountain.

656
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,879
[tools clattering]

657
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,560
[under breath] Fucking hell.

658
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,960
Come on.

659
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,200
That's just jammed.

660
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,320
-Good.
-Got the new bolt?

661
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,279
Right, so the leg's done.

662
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,160
That's done, that's...
so this is working again now.

663
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,279
[Kaleb] Yeah, it's all back up together.

664
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,320
But it's raining.

665
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,560
The roller on the back here
will pack up with mud

666
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,959
and then you'd just be skimming on the top
and hard work to get it unblocked.

667
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,159
[Jeremy]
Of the 400 acres we needed to tackle,

668
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,639
we'd only managed 150.

669
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,640
Right, well that's alarming because

670
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,600
I now have...

671
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,399
I've got nine days.

672
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,999
I've got nine days
to do all those fields down there,

673
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,640
and that means I've got to cultivate them,

674
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,000
and drill it,

675
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,760
and I've got nine days

676
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,320
and the weather forecast says it's going
to be raining for the next seven of them.

677
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,360
Why don't farmers all have coronaries?

678
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,079
As predicted, the rain continued to fall
for the rest of the week.

679
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,600
But eventually the sun did come out.

680
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,160
So, finally, we can start
cultivating again.

681
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,479
Map of where I'm going.

682
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,519
[beeping]

683
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,680
Not going.

684
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,160
Why am I not moving? Come on.

685
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
I've got no drive.

686
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,399
Right. What have I forgotten?

687
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,279
Let's have a look.

688
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,160
[alarm beeping]

689
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,840
[Kaleb] What's going on?

690
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,040
All in fucking German.

691
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,519
Got no book with that, have we?

692
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,319
It's all right. Google translate.

693
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,040
Page not found.

694
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,159
Ah!

695
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Is there anyone we can call?

696
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,479
I'm trying to find our dealer,
the nearest one, to call them.

697
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,319
[ringing]

698
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,040
-[Peter] Hello.
-Hi, Peter.

699
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,279
[Peter] Hello.

700
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Hi, it's Jeremy Clarkson
over in Chipping Norton.

701
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,879
Starts, put it in gear
and then let the clutch in and...

702
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,359
[Peter] I would start
with your brake fluid reservoir

703
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,280
so it's either low or having
a hissy fit with the level sensor.

704
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,400
[grunts]

705
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,359
Right, reservoirs.

706
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,919
This is now Italian.

707
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,840
Now, wait, wait, wait.
Good news, this is in French.

708
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,520
[Kaleb] Never been to France.

709
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,639
[Jeremy] That can't be brakes.

710
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,280
No, that's all to do
with the hydraulics on this.

711
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,560
[Kaleb] No. We need a book, don't we?

712
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,679
Yes, but we haven't got one.

713
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,160
I mean I've got thousands of books,
have you got a book?

714
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,160
[Kaleb] No.

715
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,640
-[laughs] Any books?
-No.

716
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,160
-Have you not got a book?
-[Kaleb] No.

717
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,920
I've got hundreds and hundreds
of books but--

718
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,080
[Kaleb] Yeah, but how do you read hundreds
and hundreds of books?

719
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,439
-What?
-[Kaleb] How do you read them all?

720
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,279
If you've got hundreds of them,
you can't read all of them surely?

721
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,640
-Yes, no, I've read thousands of books.
-Oh, I don't do that.

722
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
Have you had a haircut?

723
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Yeah, I have. Trying 'em all.

724
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,159
-What?
-I'm trying all different haircuts.

725
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,839
-Why?
-Until I get older,

726
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,640
you know, 'cause I'm going
to lose all my hair.

727
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,560
-Are you?
-The next thing I'm gonna perm it.

728
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,399
[laughing]

729
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,640
Good luck with that.

730
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,080
How many hairstyles have you had?

731
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,679
Went from long,

732
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,800
top and side,

733
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,600
top, about five in the last,
what, probably--

734
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,159
Have you had a Phil Oakey?

735
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,120
What's that?

736
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,119
Human League. Long on one side,
short on the other.

737
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,599
No, no, not about that.

738
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,399
-Okay. Anyway, could we just get back...
-Yeah.

739
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,800
Can we just stop talking
about your hairdressing?

740
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,120
-[Kaleb] You brought it up!
-Concentrate...

741
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,559
I just wanted to know
'cause I was making conversation

742
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,599
-while you found the brake reservoir.
-Why?

743
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
Fucking buy a tractor in the UK,
not in Germany, you'd be all right.

744
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,600
Despite much ferreting, we couldn't find
the source of the problem.

745
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,959
-[beeping]
-Fuck!

746
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,839
Right. That's it.

747
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,080
-Cup of tea then.
-Yet another day of no farming.

748
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,199
Yeah.

749
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:13,879
We could grease up.

750
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,120
-Oh.
-[both laugh]

751
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,920
Don't look at me like that.

752
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,199
You mean grease all the nipples.

753
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Grease the nipples.

754
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,399
[Jeremy] Right. We've got an hour,
we can grease nipples.

755
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,120
The following day, mercifully,
we were able to get back to work.

756
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,120
I am slightly embarrassed this morning

757
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,799
because the tractor
wasn't actually broken.

758
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
There's a lever down here

759
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,039
which had got knocked somehow
into neutral,

760
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,799
which is why it wouldn't set off,

761
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,960
and that means I lost
an entire afternoon's farming

762
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,319
because this tractor is...

763
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,479
complicated.

764
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,280
As a result of everything,

765
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,040
there was now no hope
of hitting Charlie's deadlines.

766
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,600
We were miles behind with the cultivating,

767
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:22,319
and we hadn't even started planting
the seeds.

768
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,320
The situation now, I'd call it desperate.

769
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Please don't rain.

770
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,280
Please don't rain.

771
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,880
And back at base,
an even bigger issue was developing.

772
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,000
Shit,
that is a really big problem isn't it?

773
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:50,919
[Kaleb] Yeah.

774
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,920
See what's happened is,
it's the bag of seed.

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,320
We've had it for such a long time now,

776
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,680
not being able to get it in the ground
because of the rain,

777
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,120
which has been going underneath the...

778
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,159
well, the wall of the barn

779
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,759
and the seed has actually started to grow

780
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,960
in the bag

781
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,639
so you can't feed that
into the drill, can we?

782
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,520
[Kaleb] No. If you look underneath,
it's just a carpet of roots.

783
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,640
[Jeremy] Fuck.

784
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,919
We needed to get the remaining seeds
in the ground as quickly as possible.

785
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,160
[Kaleb] Right, ho!

786
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,599
[Jeremy] Even if that meant

787
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:27,039
planting them in fields
that hadn't been cultivated.

788
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,599
First, though, I had to get to grips with
the fearsomely complicated seed drill,

789
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,199
which turned out
to be neither red nor orange.

790
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,640
So as we go along,
there are nine of these on the--

791
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,840
-Yeah.
-That splits, it creates a little mound.

792
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,400
-That's it, yeah. Creates--
-And then the seed

793
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,760
comes down here, two seeds,
one goes to the left-hand side.

794
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,000
-That's it.
-And one goes to the right,

795
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,639
and it's planted...

796
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
-Like that.
-A couple of inches down.

797
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,080
Yeah, apart, yeah.

798
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:59,599
-It's machine gunning the ground.
-Yeah. [laughs]

799
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,079
With goodness and nutrients.

800
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:05,919
A lot to take in, so are you listening?
Are you ready?

801
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Main menu.

802
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,640
Yeah.

803
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,920
Rate. Yeah, so our rate,

804
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,080
we're going on at 220 per kg per hectare.

805
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,199
This is your fan speed, all right.

806
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,640
So in a minute when I turn the fan on,

807
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,639
that's gonna come with a number.
You want it running about 4,000.

808
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:24,919
This is your tram.
So every eighth time you pick it up,

809
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,200
it's going to put a tram line in.
So we're off the tram line.

810
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,640
-What do you mean, off the tram line?
-We're starting a field.

811
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,599
From the last field, we're set
at eight, so this field--

812
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,479
-Eight what?
-Eighth tram line.

813
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,880
-So what that means--
-Kaleb, I've lost complete...

814
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,080
I don't know what you were doing
30 seconds ago.

815
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,839
-[Kaleb] All right.
-I reckon you could drop a cruise missile

816
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,159
on Damascus more easily

817
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,479
than you could get that drill
to plant some seeds along there.

818
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,040
After baffling me for a bit longer,

819
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,399
Kaleb and I switched seats
and we got cracking.

820
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,000
Here we go, and drilling.

821
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,760
Drilling an uncultivated field like this
would mean less yield and,

822
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,640
therefore, less profit
at the end of the year.

823
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,519
But, for complicated reasons
to do with carbon in the soil,

824
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,999
it is kinder to the environment.

825
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,199
Greta Thunberg likes this.

826
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,760
[Kaleb] Yeah.
I don't know who that is, but yeah.

827
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,919
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

828
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,040
Got to be dead straight
because when they start growing,

829
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,199
you're going to have lines
like this if you're not careful.

830
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,800
And people driving up and down
the main road will see it and think--

831
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,119
Exactly.

832
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,640
I'm gonna have a big sign at the end
saying: "Kaleb did this."

833
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,679
Whoa. [laughing]

834
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:44,639
You missed a bit.

835
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,800
-Where?
-In the mirror.

836
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:48,879
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

837
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,200
[Jeremy] They're not gonna see that
from the main road, are they?

838
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,400
Most probably.
Everyone will pick up on everything.

839
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,359
Guaranteed. If you make a cock-up
in the middle of nowhere,

840
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,640
someone's gonna see it.

841
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,840
They'll go into the pub and go,
"Did you see that bit he missed

842
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,400
over in coordinates of this, this, this?"

843
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,600
They will, they'll get the coordinates
of that place

844
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:09,359
and they'll tell everyone. I do it.

845
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,680
[Jeremy] Once he thought
I'd got the hang of it,

846
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,879
Kaleb went off to look after his own
farming stuff, leaving me all alone.

847
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,240
I'm solo, solo drilling.

848
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:32,719
So Jeremy's out drilling,
which is actually one of the most

849
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,320
complicated parts
of getting crops established.

850
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:39,999
So what he's doing
is going up and down the field,

851
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,400
so the seed is being planted
in rows behind the seed drill.

852
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,960
And then the drill will shut off.

853
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,200
It will leave two un-drilled sections
which are called tram lines.

854
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,000
We use those tram lines

855
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,719
as a guide so that when the sprayer goes
up between them,

856
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,720
we're putting on
the right amount of spray,

857
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
putting on the right amount of fertilizer

858
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,680
and hence it's all mathematically laid out

859
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,719
so it's a pretty critical part
of the operation.

860
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,599
[beeping]

861
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,079
Oh, shit. Oh, wrong button.
That's the problem.

862
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,239
There it is and there we are.

863
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,360
A lot more complicated than cultivating,
this is. A lot more.

864
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:35,479
Soon I wanted to sit in the sun
having another picnic,

865
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,480
but I was beginning to understand
that in farming

866
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,600
you really do have to make hay
while the sun shines.

867
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,560
How many more ups and downs
have I got to do in this field,

868
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:50,519
and will I get it done before the sunset?

869
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,720
What have we got?
One, two...about 30 more, perhaps.

870
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:59,719
Yeah. If I've got to do 30 more
ups and downs,

871
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,839
but it's now quarter to five,

872
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,680
I'm gonna be doing this
with my headlights on.

873
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:08,719
In order to speed things up I, once again,

874
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,600
decided to replace
the annoying three point turns

875
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,199
with my much faster sweeping manoeuvre.

876
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,520
And here we go.

877
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:22,959
Yes, look at that.

878
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,520
It's just me and my drill
and my Lamborghini.

879
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,200
Dropping, and seeding.

880
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:42,599
What a beautiful evening,

881
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,120
in the Cotswolds.

882
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,040
However, when Kaleb came back,
the evening mood took a bit of a downturn.

883
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,319
[Kaleb] What have you been doing?

884
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,560
What? What do you mean?

885
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,240
What have you been doing?

886
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,280
Going up and down.

887
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,600
Going up and down like this?

888
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:01,519
No.

889
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
I went up and then went across like that.

890
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,960
What did I say at the start?

891
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:07,239
You said don't do that
but I couldn't see why.

892
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,599
Oh, that sign of me going up there
is not happening.

893
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,959
We're gonna have a sign saying,
"Guess who drilled this? Jeremy, Kaleb?"

894
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,960
Well, what's the matter with that?

895
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,599
I said every eighth time
you're putting a tram line in.

896
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,679
Your tram lines are gonna be everywhere.

897
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,680
Down here you're gonna have tram line,
tram line, tram line,

898
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,600
tram line, every three meters.

899
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,039
On this bit here,
you're gonna have no tram lines.

900
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,839
When I come to spray it and fertilize it,
how do I know where to drive?

901
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:36,079
Guess.

902
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,880
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing in there.

903
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,999
I'll do it properly now or is it too late?

904
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:43,119
Oh, it's too late.
You're pretty much screwed.

905
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,160
And you haven't even drilled it straight.

906
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,399
What do you mean
I haven't drilled it straight?

907
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,640
That's as straight as a roundabout.

908
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,800
Well it's 'cause it started off
bent there by the hedge

909
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,960
so it's still bent here.

910
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:59,359
It wasn't that bent though, was it?

911
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,600
I didn't know about the eighth thing,

912
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,119
you didn't say you must do that
because if you don't--

913
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,239
I did tell you that.

914
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,520
I couldn't understand
what you were on about.

915
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:07,719
It was country speak.

916
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,120
[chuckles] Everyone is gonna see this.

917
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,000
That's a main road there.

918
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,960
[Jeremy] Yes, I know, but I've learned
my lesson now and I won't do it again.

919
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,160
Have you not seen TV episodes
on stuff like that,

920
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:19,759
on people drilling,
oh, he's going up and down.

921
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,200
No. no, I didn't watch that.

922
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:26,399
I'll buy you a drink later
and you'll feel better.

923
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,719
I'm in so much trouble.

924
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,880
The next day, there was even more trouble.

925
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,600
Most of the oilseed rape fields
planted earlier

926
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:49,199
by the previous farmer were fine.

927
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,439
[Charlie] So we've got nice rows of rape,
which has come up really well.

928
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:53,439
[Jeremy] Yeah.

929
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,679
But in one...

930
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,159
Why isn't it growing?

931
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,079
[Charlie]
The flea beetle got hold of it, so--

932
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,199
-What?
-Whereas the... further up there...

933
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,679
I'm sorry,

934
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:06,759
this has been planted?

935
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,760
[Charlie] This has been planted.

936
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,760
-Where's the rape gone?
-Well, it's failed.

937
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,640
It's gone.
We might find the odd plant in the middle,

938
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:14,079
but I'll show you what's happened.

939
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,519
The whole field's failed?

940
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,079
[Charlie] Yeah. Just the little
black beetle have come in

941
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,719
and they've just foraged it.

942
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,359
-[Jeremy] The whole bloody lot?
-[Charlie] Yeah.

943
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,280
All four hectares. Ten acres of it.

944
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,839
You know, there comes a point that,
you know--

945
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,720
There is no... There's... I just...

946
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,879
Because of a beetle?

947
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,920
[Charlie] Yeah.

948
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,960
[Jeremy] Well, why can't we kill it?

949
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,399
Well, neonicotinoids are...

950
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,640
you know, the seed coatings
were banned in Europe.

951
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,160
-What, so we can't use them?
-We can't use them.

952
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,599
[Jeremy] I mean this is...
What's the typical yield?

953
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:51,079
So there's about 12 tons,
so there's about £4,000 worth of loss.

954
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,080
-£4,000 just gone because of the beetle.
-Just gone, yeah.

955
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,799
And the EU won't let me kill the beetle.

956
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,960
Well, you know,
we've just got to work within the rules.

957
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,639
We are working within the rules
and an entire field is dead.

958
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:06,359
Yeah.

959
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,479
[Jeremy] I figured,
as I climbed back on my tractor,

960
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:15,999
that things couldn't get any worse,

961
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,480
but I was wrong. Very wrong.

962
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,360
The next day it started to rain again,

963
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,320
and this time it didn't really stop
for the next six weeks.

964
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,560
[thunder rumbling]

965
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,600
[newsreader] Across the country, warnings
remain in place for severe weather.

966
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,520
[newsreader 2] Risk of flooding,
risk of transport disruption.

967
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:47,559
[newsreader 3] Torrential rain,
a month's worth in a day.

968
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:50,759
[newsreader 4] The Wye here
at its highest level since records began,

969
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,880
clearly unprecedented.

970
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,800
[newsreader 5] The Met office says
"presents a danger to life."

971
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,200
[newsreader 6] ...has caused havoc
not seen for almost a century.

972
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,320
[Jeremy] For British farmers,
the autumn of 2019 was Armageddon.

973
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,040
My farm is 700 feet above sea level,

974
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,640
and the brashy soil drains well,

975
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:17,359
but even it had become a quagmire.

976
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,239
And planting seeds in ground like this
is impossible.

977
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:34,279
I used to while away my evening hours
reading car magazines,

978
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,680
but not anymore.
Nowadays it's Farmer's Weekly

979
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,520
and it's Farmer's Guardian
and all they're talking about is the rain.

980
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:44,159
The unbelievable levels of rain
that we've been having.

981
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,919
Look, "Deluge Disaster," "Biblical,"

982
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,040
and inside that's the only topic
of conversation as far as I can work out.

983
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,279
That's all there is, just rain, rain,
rain, rain, rain, rain, rain.

984
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,280
"Farms sacrificed to protect homes
from rising floodwater."

985
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,720
"Worst autumn
leaves winter crops un-drilled."

986
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,600
This poor guy hasn't planted
a single thing,

987
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,360
can't plant anything, it's too wet.

988
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,760
Look at that poor sod.

989
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,639
Look at that for a farm.
What's he gonna do?

990
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:17,759
Everyone is saying to me
you couldn't have picked

991
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,080
a worse year to start farming.

992
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:23,479
You couldn't.
This is unbelievable weather.

993
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:24,559
Unbelievable.

994
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:29,799
Oh, God.

995
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,240
[sniffs]

996
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:40,799
Oh, you--

997
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,320
[man]
So have you looked after sheep before?

998
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,440
No.

999
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:45,479
[man] Here they come.

1000
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:47,839
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1001
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,160
[western music playing]
