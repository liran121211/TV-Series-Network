00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,800
[Jeremy] It's peak summer

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,200
and a normal day on the farm
now looks like this.

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,680
[rock music playing]

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,920
I get up at 6:30
and after a hit of coffee,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,960
set off to let the hens
out of their houses.

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,039
Morning.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,840
On the way back, I pick some
mushrooms for my lunch.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,440
And then it's off to feed the
fish.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,959
Back at home, I start work on
the tomato sauce recipe

11
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,359
I'm working on for the farm
shop.

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,919
I add a few chilies
and some fresh coriander

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and leave it on a low heat to
simmer...

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,719
while I mend a fence that the
hunt says

15
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,799
it didn't knock over back in
the winter.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
I then mow the
wildflowers I sowed

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,360
because that's what all
gardeners do,

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,519
wait till the plants
are looking at their best

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,880
and then prune them, so they
don't look so good anymore.

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,999
After this, I pick some
vegetables for Lisa to sell

21
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,919
to some customers we have in
Atlanta,

22
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,919
and I've even found a patch of
rhubarb, so I pick that, too.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,280
And I rush it to the shop.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
This is the rhubarb that needs
washing.

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,919
Where I throw away all the stuff
I'd picked the day before,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
because it doesn't sell,
because no one

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
likes vegetables these days.

[horn honks]

30
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,479
I then stir the tomato sauce

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
before heading out to check on
the bees.

32
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,279
Come on, off you go.

33
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,119
And the sheep, and the lambs.

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,640
And then I begin the big job of
the day.

35
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,439
There's always one.

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,280
Today, I've gotta clear all the
straw

37
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,919
and the sheep feces out of the
barn.

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,000
But as I don't have a bucket
for the front of the tractor,

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,319
I have to ask Kaleb to get the
snowplow out of the other barn.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Why can't you do it?

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,920
Because the Lamborghini won't
fit in here.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,320
Right away, I could tell he
wasn't happy,

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
because he thinks
my tractor's too complicated.

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,959
Your tractor's crap.

45
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,079
And then, when I'm having the
mushrooms,

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
which I'd picked earlier

47
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,519
and cooked in a cream sauce
and served on sourdough toast,

48
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,119
with some parsley from the
garden...

49
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,159
[cell phone rings]

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,600
...I get a call from my
associates

51
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,999
who say that the sheep have
escaped and are on the road.

52
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,439
[rock music playing]

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,400
So, I drive over there to find
the sheep haven't escaped.

54
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,559
But at least the plow is now
fitted

55
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,439
to the front of the
tractor,

56
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,799
so I head to the lambing barn
and straightaway,

57
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,439
I discovered
it wouldn't fit in there either.

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
-[thud]
-Oh, shit.

59
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,599
I then fit an 80-year-old
deathtrap

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,880
to the back of Lisa's tractor
and use that instead.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
It's getting late now, so I
rush home

62
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,639
to add some seasoning to the
tomato sauce,

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,160
before heading out to feed the
fish again,

64
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,439
and collect the eggs.

65
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,839
And then I hit the sack,
knowing that soon...

66
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,719
things are gonna get really
busy.

67
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,839
[country music playing]

68
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,759
One of the extra jobs
in our new busier lives

69
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,200
was doing a daily moisture test
of the crops.

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,400
And with Charlie on holiday,
that task fell to Kaleb and me.

71
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,079
-Now, a seasoned old farmer...
-[Kaleb] Yeah.

72
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,959
...can tell how moisture is in
the pod

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,640
just by biting it, can't they?

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,960
Yeah, they go like this.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,080
They open it up, I've seen them
do it.

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,800
They open it up, they're very
serious when they do it.

77
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,399
Go like that and they go...

78
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,559
"That's 12."

79
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,199
-And they're right. I mean,
they know?

80
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,760
-Yeah, absolutely.

81
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,760
But I can't do that, 'cause I'm
not a seasoned old farmer.

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:06,960
-No.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,280
-And you can't, 'cause you're a
fetus.

84
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,759
So, we've got the machine.

85
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
[Kaleb] You ever used one of
these?

86
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,559
Uh... let me think.

87
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,119
[Kaleb] See that bit there,
look,

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,240
we wanna fill that with
rape.

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,760
[Jeremy] Fill it?

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,360
Can we have a caption now,
saying, "Several hours later"?

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
You got a bit more?

92
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,599
And you do that, look. And
then...

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,800
[Jeremy] So, if this says less
than six,

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,120
we're in deep trouble,
we can't harvest it.

95
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,759
-Yeah.
-If it's more than...

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
-Nine.
-...nine.

97
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,119
It's too wet and they won't
take it.

98
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,919
Are you ready? Right, it's
testing.

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,760
-Dun, dun, dun.
-[beep]

100
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
[Jeremy] So, that's...

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,360
-[Kaleb] Eight.

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
-...eight percent moisture,
which means?

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
We're perfect, we need to get
out here.

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,640
Let's do this!

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
[dramatic music playing]

106
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,439
But, actually, we couldn't do
this.

107
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,679
To harvest the rape,

108
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,119
I need a combine harvester,
and I haven't got one

109
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,679
because they're
a quarter of a million pounds,

110
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,359
so I'm gonna have to rent one.

111
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,239
And the trouble is that every
other farmer in the area

112
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,679
will have been out this morning

113
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,800
in the fields, testing the
moisture

114
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,559
and they'll all be coming
to the same conclusions

115
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,799
and they'll be trying to rent
one as well.

116
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,759
Back at the office,
my worst fears were realized.

117
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Three days?

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,760
You can't do anything before
that?

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,560
No, no, I've got his number.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,880
[sighs]

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,480
Yep, you've guessed correctly.

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,880
No, I know.

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,760
[sighs]

124
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,199
He's doing his own...
He's doing his own farm first.

125
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,719
All right, okay, no, thanks for
your time.

126
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,039
[sighs]

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,720
[dramatic music playing]

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,120
I went outside and wherever I
looked,

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,600
there was a glaring reminder

130
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,039
that I really was
the new boy on the block.

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Look, there's a combine there
and there.

132
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,360
Yeah, there's another.

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,759
Every farm's got a combine on
it.

134
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,440
[dramatic music playing]

135
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,119
By late afternoon, I'd got
nowhere.

136
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,319
37, 42...

137
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,439
But then Kaleb hit the jackpot

138
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,440
with a mate of his
I shall call "Jesus."

139
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,560
Even though his real name is
Simon.

140
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,039
-...this afternoon.
-If it comes down, I'll try--

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
I've only got two fields left
to do,

142
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,879
so ideally, I can get mine done
this evening.

143
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,999
[Kaleb] Yeah.

144
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,039
And then get up to you,
sort of like, tomorrow.

145
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Tomorrow, and then we can start
cutting.

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,680
[country music playing]

147
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,079
[Jeremy] The next morning,

148
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,960
with the combine sorted,
it was action stations.

149
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,400
-This is perfect.
-Yeah, look at the day.

150
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,320
I know.

151
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,199
[country music playing]

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
Right, the tractors are gonna be
coming through here all day,

153
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,039
so I'm gonna try and move this
gatepost to make life easier.

154
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,719
[grunts]

155
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,920
It is quite a-- Yeah, that's
what I meant.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,960
-I don't think you did any of
that.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
-I did...

158
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,559
[breathes heavily]

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,480
Right, this is your big day,
Lambo.

160
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,919
This is what
we've been looking forward to.

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm gonna go and hook up.

165
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,600
of watching Kaleb
attach things to tractors,

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
I figured I'd have no problems

167
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
hitching my Lambo to a trailer
I'd rented.

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,680
Um...

169
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,600
I do that, then that, then not
that.

170
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,160
Um...

171
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,280
[dramatic music playing]

172
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Right, that is definitely not
coming out.

173
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,159
Well, there must be something
else I've forgotten to do.

174
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,400
What have I forgotten?

175
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,880
Um...

176
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,839
Not that.

177
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,440
There was only one solution.

178
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,959
Get Kaleb to do it.

179
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,280
Actually, wait! Wait, wait,
whoa!

180
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,439
Right, you are all set.

181
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,000
[Jeremy] With that,
we headed off to the farm shop

182
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,720
to rendezvous with Jesus.

183
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,640
It's now Friday, twenty to
twelve.

184
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,159
We have a weather front
moving in Sunday morning.

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,720
So, we've got to try and do

186
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,479
four days' harvesting in a day
and a half.

187
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,840
This could be a long day.

188
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,359
[dramatic music playing]

189
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,960
Me aircon stopped working.

190
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,839
And I'm too tight
to get it fixed at the minute.

191
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,239
It's either there, or there.

192
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
That's nice there.

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,720
[tense music playing]

194
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,359
So, we're going all night
tonight probably, yeah.

195
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,600
In there, there's some toilet
roll.

196
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,719
All right, if you get short,
let me know, all right?

197
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,119
-You've actually brought bog
roll?

198
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,239
-Yeah.

199
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,599
Wouldn't be the first time
I get caught out.

200
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,199
Look!

201
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,639
We have a combine harvester.

202
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,640
[country music playing]

203
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,639
It's here.

204
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,479
-That's Simon.
-[Kaleb] That's Simon.

205
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,240
[harvester beeping]

206
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,840
Has he briefed you on how to do
this?

207
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,039
Are we doing this on the move?

208
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,640
-Unloading on the move?
-[all] Yeah.

209
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160
[Jeremy] We then discussed an
issue

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,760
that would add yet more
pressure.

211
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,640
This is an unusual year
for the barley and the rape

212
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,439
to be ready at exactly the same
time.

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,960
-Yes, very.
-Very unusual.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,160
-Almost unique,
I would say.

215
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
Normally, the barley's ready
much--

216
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Normally ready two or three
weeks earlier, yeah.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,520
-[Jeremy] And then the rape's...
-[Simon] Yeah.

218
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
-...it's just that dry spring
then?

219
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
-[Simon] Yes.

220
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,400
[engine whirring]

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,760
[classical music playing]

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,760
[Jeremy] Here it comes.

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
[Kaleb] And we're away.

224
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,919
My first harvest.

225
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,920
They are bloody clever,
combines, aren't they?

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,160
[Kaleb] They're wicked.

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,760
You're right, I mean,
to be able to chop the thing,

228
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,200
open the pod, take those tiny--

229
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,999
That massive machine take
those tiny seeds out and go,

230
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,960
"Don't need that,
don't need that,

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
don't need that.
But do need that."

232
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,439
And it measures
how much seed is taken out.

233
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,079
It's just-- Oh, farming is
amazing, isn't it?

234
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,279
Adrenaline's buzzing, I am
buzzing.

235
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,920
You know, come three 'clock
tonight,

236
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,000
in the morning, I'll be still
going.

237
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,599
You're gonna be hanging.

238
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
[gentle music playing]

239
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,360
[Jeremy] When the combine
was close to full,

240
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Kaleb maneuvered into position.

241
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,520
Okay, hold it about there.

242
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,520
That's the first lot coming out.

243
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
[Western-style music playing]

244
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,679
And once he'd filled up

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,320
with two payloads from the
combine...

246
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,760
he headed to the barn to unload.

247
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
And whilst he was grappling
with my 19th-century trailer...

248
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,999
Oh, my God.

249
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,920
...I was psyching myself up
for my first run.

250
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm just hanging back.

251
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,959
His yellow light is on,

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,400
that tells me its tank is 80%
full.

253
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm underway. This is the
moment.

254
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,199
I'm coming in now, coming in.

255
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,919
Not hot, no, not coming in hot.

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
[dramatic music playing]

257
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm gonna go back further.
Further back, further back.

258
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh, that's right, I'm filling
the back first, that's it.

259
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,159
I need one eye there and one eye
there, to see where I'm going.

260
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,280
I need to be a pigeon.

261
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,879
[Simon over walkie-talkie] It's
off.

262
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
[Jeremy] Oh, no, I've stopped.

263
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,159
[Simon] Keep going.

264
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,000
[Jeremy] I can't do it. Oh, no.

265
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,760
I need to be at the front,
I need to be at the front.

266
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,920
Wait a minute, what do I need
to do? Slow down.

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
[Simon] Ready, steady, steady,
go.

268
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,560
[Jeremy] Oh, no, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

269
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,519
Well done, you got most of
that in the middle.

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,360
[Jeremy over walkie-talkie]
Jesus, that's difficult.

271
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,559
Everything's reversed,
so if I'm looking here,

272
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
over my shoulder and I think,
"Oh, no, it's at the back,"

273
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,280
I have to slow down.

274
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,840
When it's at the back, slow
down.

275
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,160
When it's at the front, speed
up.

276
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,520
[country music playing]

277
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,560
Happily, on my next run
there was no onanism.

278
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,760
It all went well.

279
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,479
All these racing drivers
talk about precision driving,

280
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,399
they do not know what the words
mean.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,840
I then rushed off to unload my
cargo,

282
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,799
fully aware
that having complained for years

283
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,199
about tractors holding up
traffic,

284
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,079
I was now in a tractor holding
up traffic.

285
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
You should all have stopped
at the farm shop,

286
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,119
then you wouldn't be stuck here,
would you? Mmm.

287
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Back at the farm, it was

288
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,879
imperative I got the seed
unloaded quickly,

289
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,279
so I could get back to the field

290
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,560
before the combine was
full again.

291
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,439
Lovely.

292
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,719
Then, back up-- Wait a minute.
If I swing that way.

293
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
Back up...

294
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,879
Yes.

295
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,800
My angle was wrong.

296
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,120
If I back up,
that way keeps it to the right.

297
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Yeah, that's it.

298
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
God.

299
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,239
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Pay attention, Jeremy.

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,840
So, if I go that way,
keeping the back out.

301
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,799
Oh, for heaven's sake,
this is just impossible.

302
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,759
After a mere six attempts,

303
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,159
which could easily have been
edited out...

304
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,120
the much more modern
rented trailer was in.

305
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,840
Oh, yes.

306
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

307
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,319
Jesus, that was lucky.
I won't tell Kaleb about that.

308
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,800
[classical music playing]

309
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,040
With the weather holding,

310
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
we worked as a team

311
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,639
to cover as much ground as
possible.

312
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,519
Right, this field, according to
my map here, 54.8 acres,

313
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,920
and if we'd had good weather,

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,800
we could expect £23,500
worth of rape out of it.

315
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,759
I don't think it'll be that
much.

316
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,160
I'd like to ring Charlie and
ask him, but he's on holiday.

317
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,399
So, we're doing ten acres an
hour

318
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,880
and all the Canadians have just
fallen off

319
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,799
their chairs laughing at us.

320
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,520
It's definitely
getting rather hot in here.

321
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,720
Just turn my air conditioning
up a bit.

322
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,759
[laughs]

323
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,720
Go that way...

324
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,799
get that out...

325
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,519
it means I go right,
so I wanna be going that way.

326
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,040
Wait, wait, I'm gonna try that
again one more time.

327
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,799
[classical music playing]

328
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,920
Despite the idyllic working
conditions,

329
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,400
there was a nagging issue on my
mind.

330
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,560
How much seed were we actually
harvesting?

331
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,400
[Kaleb over walkie-talkie]
What's it saying

332
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,480
on thecomputer, Simon?

333
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,479
The yield monitor on the
combine is saying

334
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,679
it's running at two and a half
ton to the hectare now,

335
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,519
so that's a ton to the acre.

336
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,639
But what we're looking for
is a ton and a half an acre.

337
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
[Simon] It's good in patches.

338
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,160
[classical music ends]

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,800
7.3. We're all right.

340
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,400
[Jeremy] So far as I could tell,

341
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,440
most of what we were harvesting
were earwigs.

342
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,879
There were thousands of them.

343
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,879
But I was told this was normal,
so we kept on working.

344
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,560
Right, here we go, coat on.

345
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,920
[tense music playing]

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,960
[Simon speaking on
walkie-talkie]

347
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,319
The second field I think yielded

348
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
better than the first
one...definitely.

349
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
[Jeremy] Wait a minute.

350
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,639
You kick the back out that way,
yes, head it on that way.

351
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,759
Oh, bloody hell, that's the
wrong way.

352
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,999
-[Kaleb] It's like a tractor
meet.

353
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,039
-[Jeremy] Isn't it?
[Kaleb laughs]

354
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,559
-So, we've done Picket's Piece.
-[Kaleb] Yeah.

355
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,920
[Jeremy] We're doing Lower
Washpool now.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,560
And then we've got Bury Hill
North, which is 45.7 acres.

357
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,520
[Kaleb] You better get going,
Jeremy.

358
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,999
-Oh, his light's on.
-[Kaleb] Yeah.

359
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,239
[country music playing]

360
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,999
[guitar music playing]

361
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,519
[Jeremy] The next morning,
when we resumed harvesting,

362
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,999
my first offload of earwigs
was even trickier than normal.

363
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,479
He's parked his truck in the
farmyard.

364
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,039
There's something wrong with
him.

365
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,720
Right, he won't be
finding that in a hurry.

366
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,879
[Western-style music playing]

367
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
However, Kaleb's annoying

368
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,560
parking was the least of my
problems.

369
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Because, unlike yesterday,
the sky was overcast

370
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,960
and that didn't bode well

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,320
for the mid-morning moisture
test.

372
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,880
[beep]

373
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,239
-Ten.
-[Simon] Ten.

374
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,399
Yeah.

375
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,680
That's too much. Two percent
over. Why has it got wet?

376
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,879
It hasn't rained.

377
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,200
Is it just moisture in the
atmosphere?

378
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
[Kaleb] It's probably
the moisture in the air.

379
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,719
[Simon] 'Cause actually, it's
damper now

380
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,679
than it was at seven o'clock
this morning.

381
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,640
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, what do we do?

383
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,560
[Jeremy] Happily,
there was one thing we could do.

384
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,760
Go and test the barley

385
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,399
to see if we could harvest that
instead.

386
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,080
-What's the news, mate?
-14.7.

387
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
-What's the limit for that?
-15.

388
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,559
-So, it's good enough to go?
-We could go. Yeah.

389
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,160
[rock music playing]

390
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:21,799
[Simon over walkie-talkie]
Right,

391
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,040
I'd say that was
pretty successful.

392
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,799
Oh-hoo. Did you hear that,
fetus boy? It was successful.

393
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Simon, don't give him a big
head.

394
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,519
[Jeremy] What I've got
in the trailer right now

395
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,679
will keep Wetherspoon's going
for about a year.

396
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,799
That is beer seeds.

397
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,960
However, when I got to the barn,

398
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I realized I had another
problem.

399
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,080
All right, what have we got
left on rape?

400
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,080
We've got about, big field,

401
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,880
about 40 or 50 tons of rape
still to go.

402
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
So, where do I put the barley?

403
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,280
[phone ringing]

404
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Hello.

405
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,880
Where the bloody hell
am I gonna store this barley?

406
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,880
Because the barn's all full,
we can't mix them up, can we?

407
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,520
No, no, you'll have to store it
up the airfield.

408
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,159
That bunker I built,

409
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,000
we can probably store about 400
tons of barley up there.

410
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,159
Yeah, but we can't,
'cause it's gonna rain.

411
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,720
If it does rain, we can't just
leave it outside, can we?

412
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,919
No, it will get wet
and then they will reject it.

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,880
You'll have to just sell it
straightaway.

414
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
What do you mean?

415
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,599
Well, you can't store it,

416
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,440
you'll have to just literally
dump it up there,

417
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,279
then sell it straightaway.

418
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,359
What, today?

419
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,640
Well, yeah, ideally, today, yes.

420
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,960
[suspenseful music playing]

421
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,359
[Jeremy] Back in the office.

422
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,120
Okay, grain merchants.

423
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,440
Yeah, hi.

424
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,999
Really, I need a wagon today.

425
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,239
So, you can't help at all?

426
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,559
After a few calls, I finally
got a result.

427
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,920
Oh, you're playing music in my
ear.

428
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,760
Cheers, bye, bye.

429
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,079
Wagon on its way.

430
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
[country music playing]

431
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,240
I then drove to the storage
facility that Kaleb had rebuilt

432
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,719
after some lockdown agri-yobs
had burnt the old one down.

433
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,519
[country music continues]

434
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,879
This is like being nine,
playing sandcastles. I like it.

435
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,480
Then, Kaleb arrived with his
load.

436
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,480
Followed shortly afterwards
by the lorry I'd ordered.

437
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,639
-That is a smart lorry.
-[beeping]

438
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,680
-Will it weigh what we put in
there?

439
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,120
-Yeah.

440
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,800
-Will it? Epic.
-Yeah.

441
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,159
However, as the loading began,

442
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,160
I got a terrible hot-neck
feeling

443
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,360
as I realized that the grain

444
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,840
from the ten acres we'd
harvested

445
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,280
would completely fill the lorry.

446
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,880
And we still had 140 acres to
go.

447
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,479
My only hope
was that Kaleb wouldn't notice.

448
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,319
Twenty lorries you should have
organized.

449
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
-Twenty lorries?
-Twenty lorries.

450
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
They should have been coming
back and forth, back and forth.

451
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,239
-What, 29 tons in each one?
-Yes.

452
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,199
It's six o'clock on a Saturday
night.

453
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,159
We're not gonna get any more now
and it's Sunday tomorrow.

454
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,320
And it's gonna rain tonight.

455
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,600
Are we completely stuck then?

456
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes.

457
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
Completely stuck, we can't cut
any more barley now, because...

458
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,720
you fucked up. All you had to do

459
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,319
was get your phone out and go,
"Hiya."

460
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,519
-No.
-Yeah. Yes, it is.

461
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,679
Wrong, no, I made the mistake
about nine months ago.

462
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,599
What?

463
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
When I went, "That barn's big
enough."

464
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,960
I was in full Yorkshire mode.

465
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,160
"No, I'm not spending more than
22 grand,

466
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,840
that barn's perfectly big
enough,

467
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
everything will go in there."

468
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,240
I thought we'd have little bays
with rape would go there,

469
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,919
the wheat would go there,
the barley would go there.

470
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,280
They never said to me, you never
said to me, if I'm honest--

471
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,799
I did say, "Your barn's small."

472
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,640
Yes, I know, but you should
have said,

473
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,960
"You do realize that that barn

474
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
will be totally filled by your
rape."

475
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,279
-I did!
-You didn't say that.

476
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,639
I did. You just don't listen.
You do not listen.

477
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,240
No, [laughs] you switch off.

478
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,559
You'll probably switch off now,

479
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,160
you don't even know
what I'm saying now, probably.

480
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,600
What did I just say?

481
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,480
-Something about switching off.
-See?

482
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,439
[laughs] This is my point.

483
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
[wistful music playing]

484
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,360
[Jeremy] So, thanks to me,
all work ground to a halt.

485
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,160
And Kaleb headed for home.

486
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,480
Where's my fucking car?

487
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,840
Ah, I see it. I see the
tailgate.

488
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,560
[Jeremy] As it turned out,

489
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,880
the next morning,
I didn't need my tractor keys.

490
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,639
Obviously, we couldn't harvest
in the rain.

491
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,319
And even when the downpour
stopped,

492
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,880
we couldn't restart
until the crops had dried out.

493
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,719
So, while we were waiting,

494
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,519
we used the time to get another
job out of the way.

495
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,319
[upbeat music playing]

496
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,960
Starting the lambs on their
journey

497
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,880
to the Sunday lunch
table.

498
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,640
We're looking at good,
well-meated, uh, lambs

499
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
that are the right sort of
weight, 44 kilos-plus...

500
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
that are good to go to the
abattoir,

501
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,080
so we can have some good meat.

502
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,839
[upbeat music continues]

503
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,119
So, what we got, Ellen,
the right weight and the fit?

504
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,720
-Seventy-eight.
-Seventy-eight.

505
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,679
[Jeremy] It's like they know.

506
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,439
This is a powerful advertisement
for vegetarianism.

507
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,839
But I've seen powerful adverts
for going on a cruise,

508
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,560
and I'm still not gonna do that.

509
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
[Western-style music playing]

510
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
Once the lambs had gone...

511
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:13,199
and the fields had dried out,

512
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,199
we finished off harvesting
the oil seed rape

513
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,360
and the barley.

514
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,080
And then we sold what we'd got
to a grain merchant.

515
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,480
[beeping]

516
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,879
That just left one crop... the
wheat.

517
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,560
What's the news?

518
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,400
16.6.

519
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
[Jeremy] So, still over.

520
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,440
Without any green in it.
It wants another week.

521
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,879
-[Kaleb] Without any green.
-Right, we must leave it.

522
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,440
[Jeremy] Sadly, I then received
a rather distressing phone call.

523
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,159
Okay.

524
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Okay.

525
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,119
All right, I'll, um, I'll be
back later.

526
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,320
[clears throat] All right,
thanks. Bye.

527
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,399
Wayne Rooney's dead.

528
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,240
How my poor ram had died was a
mystery.

529
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,079
So, after we'd loaded him into

530
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,159
the most dignified hearse we
could find,

531
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,719
the vet took him away to do an
autopsy.

532
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,559
And rang later on to say he died
from a twisted intestine.

533
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,039
I'm surprised at how sad I am
about the death of Wayne,

534
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,519
because... I am.

535
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,359
He'd become sort of part

536
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,280
of a little ritual I had in the
evening.

537
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,719
I'd go for a walk
and bring them a bit of food

538
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,159
and they'd come running up.

539
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,519
I've just come down now

540
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,399
because I wanted to make sure
that Leo was all right.

541
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,000
But he's sort of hiding
in that bush over there.

542
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,239
And he won't come out,
not even for the food.

543
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,639
Sadly, we had to leave my only
remaining ram to his grief.

544
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,639
Because soon, the moisture level
of the wheat was bang on.

545
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,880
What's the news?

546
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,560
14.4.

547
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,440
[Jeremy] And we were good to go.

548
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,519
[dramatic music playing]

549
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,120
There were 96 acres of wheat to
harvest,

550
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,240
and its value was measured
differently

551
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,319
to oil seed rape and barley.

552
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,319
With wheat, the volume you
get...

553
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,880
I was gonna say it doesn't
matter, it does matter,

554
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,080
but it doesn't matter as much
as the quality.

555
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,680
So, I've got
a half a trailer load back there

556
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,959
and I don't know whether I've
got

557
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,040
half a trailer load of really
good wheat

558
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,879
that'll be used to make bread,

559
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,560
or really terrible wheat

560
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,519
that'll have to go to be animal
feed.

561
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,959
[dramatic music continues]

562
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,520
As we beavered away, Kaleb,

563
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,559
now desperate for his

564
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,719
long-awaited visit to
the barber's,

565
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,079
took a moment to rearrange his
coiffure.

566
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,160
Hair.

567
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,520
I like it.

568
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,799
[laughs]

569
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,640
It's out of my face at least.

570
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,959
[Jeremy] Shortly
after this exchange, though,

571
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,159
the mood changed,

572
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,360
because Gareth Bale noticed

573
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,960
that a neighboring farmer was
in trouble.

574
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,720
[Kaleb] Look to your left,

575
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,319
Jeremy, it doesn't look
very good over there.

576
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,879
Something's on fire, isn't it?

577
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,679
[Jeremy] This is every farmer's
nightmare.

578
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,399
A harvest blaze caused by
malfunctioning equipment.

579
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,239
[Kaleb over walkie-talkie] I'm
on it now,

580
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,799
just bear with me, two minutes.

581
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,320
I know there's two fire engines
going to it now.

582
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,920
How does he know that?

583
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,160
How do you know that?

584
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,880
Got contacts everywhere.

585
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,640
[Jeremy] I took a moment to
thank the Lord

586
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,120
for the bulletproof reliability
of the Lambo.

587
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,040
[dramatic music playing]

588
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,319
And then we got back to work.

589
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,119
Just let it go back
towards the back of it.

590
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,159
[Jeremy] Thanks to Simon's calm

591
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,720
and clear instructions over the
radio...

592
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,359
That's good, now bring it
forward.

593
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,520
...I was getting pretty good
at my tractoring.

594
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,239
[Simon] You're sort of

595
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,399
just the front end of the
middle.

596
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,480
Turn it slightly closer to you
than the middle at the moment.

597
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,559
[dramatic music continues]

598
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,160
[Jeremy] But, later that day,

599
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,080
I came back from a run to the
storage barn

600
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,360
to find Simon had been replaced
in the combine by a colleague.

601
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,239
[Gerald speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

602
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,440
I just don't know, I... I don't
know.

603
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,839
I don't know what he wants me
to do.

604
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,520
[over walkie-talkie] Do you want

605
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,279
me to come alongside on the next
run?

606
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,839
[indistinct]

607
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,360
...as long as you don't go too
fast...

608
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,040
[indistinct]

609
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,639
[Jeremy] He hasn't put his
light on, but the spout's out,

610
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,160
so I'm assuming he's ready.

611
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,560
[Gerald] As I say,
if you turn... [indistinct]

612
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,320
Am I at the back?

613
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,120
[Gerald speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

614
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
I have no idea.

615
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,440
[Gerald continues speaking
indistinctly]

616
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,479
[Jeremy] Shit, shit, shit.

617
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,039
[Gerald continues speaking
indistinctly]

618
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,919
Not a word, not a word.

619
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,400
[Gerald continues speaking
indistinctly]

620
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,760
[Jeremy] Eventually, though,
we got into a rhythm.

621
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,040
I tell you what, he's 72, look
at him.

622
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,919
He was telling me last week,

623
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,120
he's combined this farm
every year for 50 years

624
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,359
and he didn't want to miss this
one, even with COVID.

625
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,320
And here he is.

626
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,399
[over walkie-talkie] I'll wait
for your light to go on, Gerald.

627
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,600
Put your light on, I'll come
back.

628
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,959
[Gerald] Okay, but like I said,
if you just don't go too fast,

629
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,319
then I can see the backof the
trailer

630
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,680
and I can do the combine...
[indistinct]

631
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
Okay, got you.

632
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,200
I haven't, but--

633
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,200
[Gerald continues speaking
indistinctly]

634
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,560
[laughs]

635
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,080
[serene music playing]

636
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,280
[Jeremy] By the end of August,
our work was complete.

637
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:15,279
We had harvested 546 acres

638
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,960
of wheat, oil seed rape and
barley.

639
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,159
And the fields were now taking
a well-earned breather.

640
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,599
I couldn't, though.
I had to sell the wheat.

641
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,119
So, I took a sample...

642
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,959
[country rock music playing]

643
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,679
...and called Charlie, who,
now all the work was done,

644
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,640
was back from his holiday,

645
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
and arranged to meet him at my
local mill.

646
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
There it is.

647
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,199
[Jeremy] Sample bag.

648
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,599
My hope was that my wheat
would end up in here,

649
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,319
being turned into flour for
bread.

650
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,320
Because then I'd get top dollar
for it.

651
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,199
First, though, it had to pass
muster with Paul the miller.

652
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,879
This is your--

653
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,640
Number one, Premier League...

654
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,559
Premier League.

655
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,039
...milling wheat. Not Vauxhall
Conference.

656
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:18,959
No.

657
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,319
We'd like a Liverpool here,
you know, top of the league.

658
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,640
Man City at the very least.

659
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,639
Right, okay. We will see what
we can do.

660
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,800
I will go in to our lab man

661
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,680
and we will come out
with the result for you.

662
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,560
-How long's it take?
-Okay. Five minutes.

663
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,399
[Jeremy] The make-or-break
number, according to Paul,

664
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,320
would be the percentage of
protein in the grain.

665
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,040
-You're aiming actually for 13.
-Thirteen percent.

666
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,159
[Jeremy] Thirteen is the number.

667
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,200
I think it's about 13.4%
protein.

668
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,080
Right. I'll go for 12.6, 12.7.

669
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,639
Paul, we want to know whether--

670
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
-Yeah, we need to know.
-[laughs]

671
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,480
Okay. Shall I go and test it?

672
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,159
-Yes. Please.
-I'm-- Yeah.

673
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,159
-Good.
-Bye. Love your hat.

674
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,759
Whilst we were waiting

675
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,840
for Paul's bread boffin to do
his thing,

676
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,360
I was keen to know what success

677
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
would look like, in terms of
money.

678
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,080
-How much is premium wheat per
ton?

679
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,159
-£185.

680
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,999
Right, and if it's hen food...

681
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,560
-how much?
-150, 155 pounds.

682
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,119
All right, so, £185 a ton
if it's good quality.

683
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,319
-Correct.
-£155 if it's hen food.

684
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,440
Correct.

685
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,759
[softly] So, once we've
established. it's good quality,

686
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,480
do I then start haggling
with him over price?

687
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,559
Well, you might sort of ask for

688
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,159
an indication of what it's
worth.

689
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,119
Can I hit him with, "I want
£200 a ton."

690
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,279
I think that's a nice figure,
isn't it?

691
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,160
Sounds round.

692
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,360
It does. Just-- Just say £200
a ton and then,

693
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,040
"Okay, I won't
sell it today,"

694
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,639
and get in your car and drive
off.

695
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,959
So, we can just say, "I'm not
selling."

696
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,919
"We'd like to sell it, you know,
we will sell it to you, but..."

697
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,320
But not necessarily now.

698
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,160
"Not necessarily today."

699
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,560
Well, he might say, "Okay,
fine."

700
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,559
Yeah, he might.

701
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,160
I'm really useless at haggling.

702
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,920
The time for speculation,
though, was now over.

703
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,320
Oh, he's back. He's back.

704
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,520
The all-important protein,
the first number is one.

705
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,599
[Jeremy] Yeah.

706
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,159
The second number is three.

707
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,680
Yes!

708
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,960
Then we have a point.

709
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,279
Yes, zero.

710
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,160
And the next number is five.

711
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,879
-Oh.
-[laughs]

712
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,680
Almost like...

713
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,160
-How did you know that?
-Well, it's the color.

714
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,800
This is probably
as good as I've seen to now.

715
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,159
-[Charlie] Very good.
-Well done, Jeremy.

716
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,800
No, well done him and Kaleb.

717
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,320
Can I insist, Charlie, that we
buy it to grind up in the mill

718
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
and then we can send some of
the flour

719
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,640
back to Jeremy to sell
in the shop?

720
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,919
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Well, no, we've got to haggle.

721
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,880
[Paul] No, no, no, I've sorted
that out.

722
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,760
What do you mean, you've sorted
it out?

723
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,120
You may know about car prices,
but I know about wheat prices.

724
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,479
How much is it then?

725
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,479
It would be around the £180,
185 mark.

726
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,999
That's fantastic news.

727
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,039
So, it's gold star, to be
honest.

728
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,039
-I'm gonna go and bathe in it.
-[Paul] Mmm.

729
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:04,959
Thanks, Paul.

730
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,879
That's actually [laughs] good
news.

731
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,760
[country rock music playing]

732
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,960
[Jeremy] With the harvest done

733
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
and Charlie now crunching the
numbers,

734
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I caught up on the post,

735
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,480
where I found the results

736
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,679
from the latest tests
on my bottled spring water.

737
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,039
Um...

738
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,199
[clicks tongue]

739
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,480
"22 degrees and 37 degrees
bacterial results have failed.

740
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,479
So, the water is not in a
sellable state.

741
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,199
For your reference,
the TVC count should be zero

742
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,760
and they were found to be
10,000-plus."

743
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,359
That's not a fail, that's a
catastrophe.

744
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,760
Ten thousand?

745
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,160
This meant I had to get to
the farm shop sharpish,

746
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,160
to remove the water from the
shelves before anyone bought it.

747
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,799
And luckily, I had just the
machine for the job,

748
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,159
because I'd been reunited...

749
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,319
with an old friend.

750
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,159
[upbeat music playing]

751
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,120
Welcome, everyone,

752
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,919
to the new Diddly Squat
fast response vehicle.

753
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,760
[laughs] It's great to have it
back.

754
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,400
The fact is, if it can handle
the roads of Madagascar,

755
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,280
it can definitely handle the

756
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,520
fields of Chipping Norton and it
is doing.

757
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:52,439
Weird that I've never driven
this car

758
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,160
at more than eight miles an
hour.

759
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,639
Now look at me.

760
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,359
I'm literally saving lives here,
doing this.

761
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,480
I've come to get the water.

762
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:14,479
Why?

763
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,799
It's got shit in it.

764
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,520
-Sorry, what?
-It's got shit in it.

765
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,479
It says it's got no shit in it.

766
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,959
It says it's got no shit in it,

767
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,960
but that's not strictly
accurate.

768
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,640
-It's full of it.
-[Lisa gasps]

769
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,199
I don't know what it is, it's
bacteria,

770
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,320
it's not actual feces,
it's bacteria.

771
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,640
But we'll flush the system
out with detergent,

772
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,759
get it tested again.

773
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
What are they?

774
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,400
Mushrooms.

775
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,600
-[Jeremy] What?
-Mushrooms. Big mushrooms.

776
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,679
[Jeremy] Big?

777
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,440
-Bloody hell.
-You know what you do?

778
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,439
You slice them up and dip them
in egg

779
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:47,279
and you fry them
and it's like a mushroom toast.

780
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,640
No, but that's a mushroom.

781
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,160
Yeah, that's a big mushroom.

782
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,840
Our field mushrooms here. Look
at that!

783
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,839
They're fantastic.

784
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,040
[upbeat music playing]

785
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,879
Everything was fantastic at the
farm shop,

786
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,800
as we were finally starting to
see some fruit from our labors.

787
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,120
Orangutan-friendly vegetable oil
made with our own oil seed rape

788
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,559
was already on the shelves.

789
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,639
And a couple of days later,
our lambs were back.

790
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:21,079
-Your shoulder boned and rolled.
-Yeah.

791
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,999
The breast, which is like your
scrag for just roasting.

792
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,439
Your chops. Your liver and your
kidney and mince.

793
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,159
So, I delivered that,
reared it, fed it, nurtured it.

794
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,640
-You did.
-Loved it.

795
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,919
Loved it.

796
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,440
You've killed it and chopped it
up.

797
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,039
Chopped it up for you, yes.

798
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,039
Ready to eat.

799
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,400
[Jeremy] It had cost £5,000
to raise and butcher the lambs,

800
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,440
but they were so popular
with the locals...

801
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,799
So, you want two whole lambs,
basically, so it's four halves.

802
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,040
Yeah, yeah.

803
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,959
...it looked like we might

804
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,760
even get a couple of hundred
quid back.

805
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,080
See you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

806
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,840
Thank you very much for coming.
Hope you enjoy.

807
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,480
Who needs supermarkets?
A thing, a thing has worked.

808
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:05,879
Morning, morning.

809
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,760
-We've got seven left.
-[Lisa] Good.

810
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,960
That's all we've got, seven,

811
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,559
-and it's only half past 11:00.
-[Lisa] Excellent, okay.

812
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,600
Anyone else here for lambs?

813
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,679
The shop is incredibly busy.

814
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,080
And it'll be such a shame
if we have to shut it down

815
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:25,559
because the milk is from eight
miles away,

816
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,319
which is in Gloucestershire

817
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,080
and we're only allowed to sell
stuff from Oxfordshire.

818
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,799
[serene music playing]

819
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,520
[Jeremy] This had been
my first-ever farming year.

820
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,960
But even so, I decided to
celebrate

821
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,600
in the traditional way.

822
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:55,359
So, I met with Kaleb in my old
barn,

823
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,040
to hang a wheat sheaf
on one of its oak beams.

824
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,759
[Kaleb] It's like a celebration.

825
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,720
End of harvest, hang it up.

826
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,800
[Jeremy] And along
with the hanging of the wheat,

827
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
there was something else to
celebrate.

828
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,280
Did they use a pair of these to
do it?

829
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,200
It looks good.

830
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,120
It doesn't look good, it looks
ridiculous.

831
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,599
Did you pay money for it?

832
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:19,759
Yes.

833
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,720
Oh, it's not-- How have I done
that?

834
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,920
How can I not even do this
properly?

835
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,400
I would go up the ladder, but I
can't.

836
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,360
Why not?

837
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,760
I got shot.

838
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,480
What?

839
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:33,519
I was shot in the leg.

840
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,759
What, you've really been shot?

841
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,120
Yeah, honestly, yeah, yeah,

842
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,679
I was with a group of mates in
a circle,

843
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,959
playing footie and he got his
air rifle and

844
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,440
"accidently" shot me in the leg.

845
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,400
-You're kidding?
-In my shin.

846
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,320
-No.
-With an air rifle?

847
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,280
A .22 air rifle,
from about four meters away.

848
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:50,079
[Jeremy] Bloody hell.

849
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,199
[Kaleb] Scabbing over now, look,
the pellet's still in my leg.

850
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,560
The pellet is there.

851
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,839
But he was a mate who shot you?

852
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,040
Yeah, a mate of mine, yeah.

853
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,359
So, he got his gun out,
loaded it

854
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,880
and then he pointed it at you.

855
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
-Yeah.
-And what did you say?

856
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,720
"Don't point that gun at me,
you dickhead."

857
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,200
You hadn't had a row or
anything?

858
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,960
No, no. I've been, like, best
friends with him

859
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,680
since primary school.

860
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:12,559
He said it was an accident,
so it must have been.

861
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:13,919
Well, how can it be an accident,

862
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,920
to point an air rifle at someone
and then pull the trigger?

863
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,480
Don't know.

864
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,759
[Jeremy] My next conversation,
I suspected,

865
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,520
would be equally troubling,

866
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,040
as the time had come to sit down
with Cheerful Charlie

867
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,279
and find out how much money
the harvest had generated.

868
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,640
We're all-- We're all done.

869
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,839
End of the harvest.

870
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,680
-Well done. Good.
-Well, thank you.

871
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,000
How's it feel?

872
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,519
It's... [sputtering] It's...

873
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:41,599
Well, I'll let you know in a
minute,

874
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,239
'cause you're going to tell me
the figures.

875
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,200
You're going to give me
the moment of truth.

876
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,200
Well, as you know...

877
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,600
"As we know," here we go.

878
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,559
It hasn't been a great year
for...

879
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,319
for farming, generally.

880
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
I read in The Times yesterday,

881
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,520
it's the worst year for farmers
since 1976.

882
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,639
Dry summer. I know, I remember
it well.

883
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,199
It was the year of my O Levels.
It's why I haven't got any.

884
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,640
So, we're just gonna look
at these top boxes.

885
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:07,759
Look at the blue.

886
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,000
And now I'm gonna frighten you.

887
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,319
Last year, we made £226,000
from crop sales.

888
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,640
That's before any costs.

889
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,239
So, £226,000.

890
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,040
-Yeah.
-And this year's 137.

891
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,359
So, £90,000 lower from the same
area.

892
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,760
It is nine--

893
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,759
-Which is quite incredible. So,
you know.

894
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,400
-Well, "incredible" is one word.

895
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,880
-That is £90,000 down.
-Yeah.

896
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,720
It's-- It's enormous. Forty
percent lower.

897
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,520
£90,000 gone because of the
weather.

898
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,399
So where are the costs, because
how much--

899
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,680
-Here are the costs then, so we
spent--

900
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:45,279
-We spent--

901
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,360
-£14,000 on seed.
-On seed.

902
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,280
£34,000 on fertilizer
and £20,000 on sprays.

903
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,120
So, £68,601.

904
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:01,559
And then there's £68,457 of
costs.

905
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:04,999
That's Kaleb, that's the
machinery.

906
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,320
So, you've made £144 profit
from the arable farm.

907
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,760
So, the fact of the matter is
this,

908
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,120
farming seven days a week for a
year, on a 1,000-acre farm,

909
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,959
has generated an income of £144?

910
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:32,279
Correct.

911
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,560
Fortunately, at the moment,

912
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,719
we have this subsidy. When that
goes...

913
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,720
What are farmers going to do?

914
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,680
I mean, honestly,
what are they going to do?

915
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,400
The ones who don't have Amazon
film crews following them around

916
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,960
and Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?

917
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,280
to top up the income?

918
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,200
I mean, what do you do when the
subsidy starts to go down?

919
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,800
There will be...
there's gonna be a sea change

920
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,000
to the, rurally,
you know, the countryside.

921
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,479
There'll be 30 percent
less farmers, probably.

922
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,839
But that's where we are with
farming in this day and age.

923
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,520
And the next time a farmer
moans about the weather...

924
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,199
put your arm round him and buy
him a pint,

925
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,080
because he's not moaning about
it

926
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,959
'cause it's a bit miserable
working in the rain,

927
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:16,359
he's moaning about it
'cause it's crucifying.

928
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,680
[mournful music playing]

929
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,800
I was now in a quandary.

930
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,679
I'd worked bloody hard all year

931
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,400
and my reward was £144.

932
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,279
Even with the grants
and subsidies added in,

933
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,920
I'd have been far better off
selling up,

934
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,360
putting the money in the bank
and living off the interest.

935
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:48,719
And yet the past year
had been absolutely brilliant.

936
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,759
I'd done so many things I didn't
think that I'd be able to do.

937
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:58,639
I'd become a shepherd.

938
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,040
A tractor driver.

939
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,120
A shopkeeper.

940
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,879
[imperceptible]

941
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:10,839
A midwife.

942
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:14,079
A key worker.

943
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,559
[imperceptible]

944
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,239
An engineer.

945
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,560
And a conservationist.

946
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,599
All in the company of Diddly
Squat's

947
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:37,159
endlessly happy,
endlessly dysfunctional family.

948
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,079
[imperceptible]

949
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,040
But could I really go through
the whole cycle again...

950
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,560
for less than 40 pence a day?

951
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,040
It's a question that crops up
almost immediately

952
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:12,479
at our harvest festival picnic.

953
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,839
If there's anything I'm gonna go
for, it's one of

954
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,440
them whatsanames.

955
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,760
No, those.

956
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,400
-[Charlie] One of these.
-That's the one, yeah.

957
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,599
[Jeremy] So, is it a year and
a day since we started farming?

958
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,959
[Charlie] It is. Just over.

959
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:29,439
[Jeremy] So, the big thing
I've got to work out now is,

960
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,199
I've got a choice,
realistically.

961
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,680
I can either go back to London
and resume my old life--

962
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,840
Yeah, do that.

963
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,560
[laughs]

964
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:41,799
You haven't heard the "or."

965
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,760
No, no, no. Do that.

966
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,160
I think I don't want to go
back to London now.

967
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:49,239
-Ever?
-No, I'm happy here.

968
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,440
You like London, let's just--
You know, you love London.

969
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,439
[Jeremy laughs]

970
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:54,759
And London suits you.

971
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,960
-And, um...
-You've got friends in London.

972
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,960
[Kaleb] Yeah, you've got friends
in London,

973
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,640
you know loads of people.

974
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:00,799
[Charlie] You've got
loads of friends here.

975
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,640
Mmm.

976
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,599
He wants me to stay.

977
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,239
Because I am a cash cow to him.

978
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,840
[laughs]

979
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,760
If you weigh it up,
weigh-hey-hey, I'd go farm.

980
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,080
I think you're happy here.

981
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,559
You're right, I am happy here.

982
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,559
I said, back when we
were lambing,

983
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,279
that I've never
been happier.

984
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,200
Remember, we had all the lambs
coming

985
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,879
and it was quite a nice day,

986
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,680
I went, "I've never been

987
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,479
happier at work
than I am now."

988
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:27,959
-[Lisa] Really?
-No.

989
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:29,199
-Look at the colors.

990
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:30,999
-[Lisa] It is stunning.
- Autumn's coming.

991
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,679
It's always stunning
on the farm, actually.

992
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Whatever the day, there's

993
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,000
always something
that's absolutely beautiful.

994
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:41,959
The thing is, the show's now
over.

995
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,279
This one.

996
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,600
-Cheers, guys.
-Which is sad.

997
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:46,719
But thank you very much

998
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,800
for all your help over the last
year.

999
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,840
Cheers.

1000
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,080
[Jeremy] All of you,
thank you very, very much.

1001
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:53,919
Thank you for being so patient
with me.

1002
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,440
-I'm gonna get in that
tractor now.

1003
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,360
-[chuckles]

1004
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,920
You're gonna come back with me
and put the cultivator on it

1005
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,680
and I'm gonna go cultivating
now.

1006
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,320
I thought you was going to
a party tonight, you said.

1007
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,000
[laughter]

1008
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:06,999
[Lisa laughs] In London.

1009
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:09,839
[laughter]

1010
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,840
[music playing]
