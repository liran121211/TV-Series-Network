1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,120
[theme song playing]

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,880
[Jeremy] It turns out
there's a good reason

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,480
why farmers always moan about
the weather.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,000
Because it never does
what they want it to do.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,960
Back in the autumn when I needed
a dry spell to plant my crops,

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,240
I got this.

7
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,399
[thunder rumbling]

8
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,159
It rained non-stop for eight
weeks.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,160
And then in May when I
needed rain

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,320
to keep those crops
alive...

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,679
I got this.

12
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,319
The driest spring ever recorded.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,840
The drought was certainly
not helping in this field.

14
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,079
The previous year
I'd planted it with rape seed...

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,080
but that had all been eaten by
beetles.

16
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,479
-Where's the rape gone?
-The flea beetle got it.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
-[Jeremy] The whole bloody lot?
-[Charlie] Yeah.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,120
There's no... There's... I
just...

19
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,839
[Jeremy] So rather than let the
field sit there doing nothing,

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,640
I'd come up with one of my

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,160
brilliant lockdown
brainwaves.

22
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,239
I've planted it
with pumpkins for Halloween,

23
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,919
-sweetcorn 'cause I like it.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,360
And sunflowers 'cause socialists

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,000
like to eat their seeds
apparently.

26
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,679
-Brilliant.
-So can you see them?

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,800
-No.
-Come on, don't be so negative.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
No, there's pumpkins in there.

29
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,959
Oh, he's just pretending he

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,560
can't see them
to humiliate me.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,760
[Charlie] I got one. There's
another one

32
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,639
and another one there.

33
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
I know, they're everywhere,
there's thousands.

34
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,879
Stop going, "Oh, I've found
one."

35
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,759
Look that's good, isn't it?

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,839
And there look, pumpkins,
Halloween in the farm shop.

38
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,799
-The problem is, Jeremy...
-Yes?

39
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,839
We need to try and get some
water on them.

40
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,239
How are we going to water it?

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Well, now you see,
I'm way ahead of you again.

42
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,439
I have bought a vacuum slurry
tanker.

43
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,999
-So you're gonna spray it on?
-Yeah.

44
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,599
[Jeremy] To me, the job was
simple.

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Hitch the tanker to my tractor

46
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,759
and fill it up from my big
stream.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
I love being in my Lambo.

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,760
It's like a hay fever capsule,
no pollen allowed.

49
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,559
Kaleb, however,

50
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,919
said the job would in fact be
difficult

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,560
as my tractor wouldn't be able
to reach the big stream.

52
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,439
Yes. Look at this.

53
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,759
Jeremy, whoa, whoa!

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,160
[wood crackles]

55
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,959
[Jeremy] Oh, well,
I think I've done it

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,840
rather brilliantly.

57
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,279
[Kaleb] Oh, Jesus!

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,440
-[Jeremy] Oh, yes!
-[Kaleb] Whoa, Jeremy!

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
If he says my tractor is too
big, I'm going to kill him.

60
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,999
Tractor's too bloody big!

61
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,759
Look at it, you're catching on
the tree.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
It's gonna take the beacon off.

63
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,799
Your ideas!

64
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,759
[Jeremy] Right, no beacon.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,480
Oh, this is tight down here.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,760
But, you know,
you can't be a pumpkin farmer

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,760
without breaking a few branches.

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,920
Eventually after a half mile
drive

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
that took just one hour...

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,880
-[Kaleb] Keep going straight.
-[Jeremy] What the hell?

71
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,800
...I arrived at the stream.

72
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,359
Oh, ho, ho!

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,120
The mighty Lamborghini is in
place.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,240
Was that skillful driving
or just plain luck?

75
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,479
The whole driving of that
was just ruthless.

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,000
You snapped the gate post.

77
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,439
-Have I broken a gate post?

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,320
-Yes! Snapped it clean off,
drove over it.

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,560
-Do come through.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,240
-You're gonna upset these
people now.

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
It's a faux pas.

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
I bet you any money
they want pumpkins at Halloween.

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,200
Excuse me, do you do Halloween?

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,920
Yeah, I did this year. How come?

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,360
Well 'cause I'm growing pumpkins

86
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,520
and I'm just getting water for
them

87
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,760
and he's saying I'm being an
idiot

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
for growing pumpkins, but I'm
not.

89
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,359
He's blocking the footpath
for you, isn't he?

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,760
It's not a problem at all.

91
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,920
[Jeremy] Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,640
That's exact...
See. Have you undone this?

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Yeah, it's undone.

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
God! The things we'll do
for fucking pumpkins!

95
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,479
Getting in was one thing.

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,360
If you're gonna say getting out
again,

97
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
it's just turn it round, go
back out.

98
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,359
Turn it round where?

99
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,319
Ah, we perhaps should've
reversed in, shouldn't we?

100
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,920
-That would have been...

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,360
-[Kaleb] Yeah, I did try and
like...

102
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:10,919
-You wasn't really listening to
me.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,640
-But your hand signals, you
just do this.

104
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,480
I was like this. What's that
mean? Oh, turn around.

105
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,440
It could mean caterpillar,
it could mean snake.

106
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,799
I had no idea what you were on
about.

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
-[Kaleb] Right.
-That's in the stream.

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,440
Right, let's see if we can get
some water.

109
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
All I've got to do is do that.
Open that valve!

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,640
[pumping]

111
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,800
[Jeremy] Yes, I can hear it!

112
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
It's alive!

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
Any minute now
we're gonna have Tower Bridge,

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,519
we'll be sucked up this stream.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,560
[Kaleb] There you are, look,
look, look.

116
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,839
-Oh, yes!
-Water for your pumpkins.

117
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,959
[Jeremy] With the vacuum tanker
full,

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
it was time to switch off and
disengage.

119
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,799
[thuds]

120
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,440
You fucking... You rural
half-wit!

121
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,359
[laughs] I pressed the wrong
button!

122
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,959
[Jeremy] There was then the
simple task

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,320
of reversing back the way we'd
come.

124
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
Which way do I turn the
steering wheel?

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
Yeah, I can't tell you how to
do it. You just have to know.

126
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,959
Yeah, but unfortunately I don't
know.

127
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,959
[Jeremy] Nevertheless, as we'd
been

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
working together for nine
months,

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
we figured that with a bit of
teamwork we'd solve the problem.

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
-Right hand down a long way.
-Yeah, but I can't see it!

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,640
[Kaleb] Look behind you then.
Now forward.

132
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,799
Whoa, whoa! Now come back.
Other way.

133
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,959
-Other way?

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,360
-You're gonna take the fence
out.

135
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,039
-Well, what do I do now?
-Forwards.

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,360
-Again?

137
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,879
-No, you got to get over that
way.

138
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,439
-[Kaleb] Wait!
-[Jeremy] What?

139
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,679
-You gotta get the whole...
-I can't see you!

140
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,959
You've got to tell me
right or left hand down!

141
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm getting confused.

142
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,200
Oh, that's all we now need to
discover,

143
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,960
he does not know his right from
his left.

144
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,039
We're gonna be here a while.

145
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,640
-[Kaleb] Go forward more!
-[Jeremy] What?

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,280
-No, you got to get over that
way.

147
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,359
-What? Hang on.

148
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,039
-Come back.
-Other way?

149
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
No.

150
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,359
[Jeremy] Eventually Kaleb
came up with a suggestion

151
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,679
that was, in fairness, long
overdue.

152
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,080
-[Kaleb] Are you gonna let me
do it?

153
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
-[Jeremy] Yes.

154
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,680
If at first you don't succeed,
sod it, give it to a teenager.

155
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,719
Yeah, keep coming straight back.
It works, I knew it would.

156
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,559
Yeah, this is exactly what I
was gonna do

157
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,240
on my next run, so well done.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
-[Kaleb] Come on you piece of
shit!

159
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,039
-[Jeremy] It's not a piece of
shit!

160
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,560
-Well, well, well...
-Well done, Kaleb.

161
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,199
-Thank you very much.
-That's very good.

162
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,279
You're very welcome.

163
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,919
[Jeremy] The trip to and from
the stream had taken five hours,

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,320
but now with
1,000 gallons of water on board,

165
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,759
I was back at the field...

166
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,079
and ready to give the whole
thing a damn good soaking.

167
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,919
-[Jeremy] Yes!
-Drive! Go!

168
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm going. I'm going.

169
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,640
Look at it. Look at me.

170
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I'm bringing life and nutrition
to my otherwise dead field.

171
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,159
And then I swing it round
at the bottom end.

172
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,359
[Jeremy] That's fantastic, look
at that.

173
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,239
Soon there will be pumpkins

174
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,439
growing in my wake and
sweetcorn.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960
[Charlie] He's run out.
He's run out of water.

176
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Oh, hang on, where's the water
gone?

177
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,719
Look how you've run out of
water!

178
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,759
Are you seriously saying
that was all we got?

179
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,760
[Charlie and Kaleb] Yes.

180
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
-That's 1,000 gallons.
-[Kaleb] 1,000 gallons.

181
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,840
-[Jeremy] Four and a half
thousand liters.

182
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,239
-Four and a half thousand
liters.

183
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,359
And we did one and a quarter
runs.

184
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah. You've just put
a millimeter of rain.

185
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,319
[Jeremy] I've not put a
millimeter on!

186
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
That's effectively what that is.

187
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,760
You know, I mean it's
evaporated already

188
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,599
and blown away.

189
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,759
So, you know, effectively, well,
it hasn't been effective at all.

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
-He's so miserable.

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,880
-He is, but I'm with him on
this.

192
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,080
If we want pumpkins for
Halloween.

193
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,359
Well, that's answered the
question,

194
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,279
we don't really want pumpkins
do we?

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,360
Yes, yes. No because
we paid for the pumpkin seeds,

196
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,040
I've paid for the water bowser
thing.

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,640
But how do I make them live?

198
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,519
-You know, until we get a
meaningful rain.

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,960
-Yeah, yeah. When's the next
rain?

200
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,640
Well there's nothing in the
forecast

201
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,760
for another fortnight.

202
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,039
Fucking hell.

203
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,719
[Jeremy] That meant there was
only one thing I could do...

204
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,360
-Give Kaleb a hosepipe...

205
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,439
-[Kaleb] It's stupid ideas all
the time!

206
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,720
[Jeremy] ...and get an early
night.

207
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,079
The next day was important,

208
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,639
because soon everything in this
field

209
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,719
would be sold to make bread.

210
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,959
And everything in this field

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,840
would be sold to make Sunday
lunch.

212
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,839
And to make sure
I got the best possible prices,

213
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,319
cheerful Charlie
said I had to sit an exam.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
-[Jeremy] Charlie, how are you?

215
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,319
-[Charlie] I'm very well. How
are you?

216
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,880
Good. This red tractor business?

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,160
Yeah, so you've got your
inspection this morning.

218
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,440
But then I've got to do it on
the phone?

219
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,999
Yeah, that's the Covid rules.

220
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,240
And the background is
this is the difference

221
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,080
between being able to sell your
produce at full market rate

222
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,359
or not having a discount.

223
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,760
So when a customer
goes out and buys something,

224
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,760
if it's got a little red tractor
on the package...

225
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,359
-Exactly.

226
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,239
-...that means that somebody's
checked

227
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,799
to make sure my farm
hasn't got feces all over it.

228
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,439
Correct, yeah. It's a serious
accreditation scheme.

229
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
And if I'm not all right,

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,880
then I can't sell
all my stuff at full price.

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,560
Yes, which will have an even

232
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
bigger effect on your profit for
the year.

233
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,560
[Jeremy] Soon, the Red Tractor
examiner called

234
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,959
and I began my first ever
face-Zoom-time meeting.

235
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,319
[Dave] Jeremy, how are you?

236
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,559
I'm very well thank you.
How are you?

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,920
And how do I get to see you?
Or do I not?

238
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Um, I should be on your screen
somewhere in a little corner?

239
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,840
No. there's nothing. You're on,
video on, microphone on.

240
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,159
All apps don't work
and now the screen's dead.

241
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,119
[Jeremy] When we finally
reconnected...

242
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
Greetings, we're finally there.

243
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,359
...Dave, the inspector,

244
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,839
asked for a tour of the farm
buildings.

245
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,639
[Dave] Right, Jeremy, what's to
the right

246
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,719
of the hay and the straw there?

247
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,999
That is a massive scissor jack

248
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,720
that I used in Colombia to spot
condors.

249
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,959
And then there's some doors
over there

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400
from a house that my colleagues
blew up.

251
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,000
[Jeremy] Dave politely
pointed out

252
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,079
that he wanted to
see farm equipment,

253
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,640
not old Grand Tour props.

254
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,560
[Dave] Where abouts
is your chemical store?

255
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,359
And where are the chemicals
currently?

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, they're over here
in a shipping container.

257
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,039
We thought shipping containers
are watertight and secure.

258
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
-Ready?
-Yeah.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
Ta-da!

260
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,120
Oh! Oh sorry that might be an
Alfa Romeo.

261
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,320
-Yeah.
-Hang on.

262
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
It's...

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
[Jeremy] After this shaky
start...

264
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,360
Dave made me jump through hoops
for the rest of the morning.

265
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
[Dave] There's the can of
petrol on

266
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,480
the floor there Jeremy, what's
that for?

267
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,519
What's in the bags
that are there in front of you?

268
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Any medicines that you use for
the sheep,

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,280
where are they stored?

270
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
What's the black bag we just
walked past?

271
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,320
Is there a red picket anywhere?

272
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,999
Are you gonna be using that shed
to store grain at harvest?

273
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,800
What make is that?
What does it say on that?

274
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,199
What do you do
for vermin control here, Jeremy?

275
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,399
Nick, the mouse murderer comes.
That's not his real name.

276
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,160
What's the batch number, please
Jeremy?

277
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,880
17318.

278
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
What's the math number
on that one, Jeremy?

279
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,920
19/2H.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,440
76325.

281
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,679
/1549.

282
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,959
Zero zero zero zero zero B.

283
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,079
[Dave] Where abouts
are the sheep then, Jeremy?

284
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,519
-See my tractor?
-Yeah, very nice.

285
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,319
Ah-ha, chemical store.

286
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,039
Is there anything in there,
should any liquid get spilt,

287
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
is there anything in there
that can mop it up?

288
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,719
We've got a Bradley Cooper
and Jennifer Lawrence movie.

289
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,119
Is that something you'd be
interested in?

290
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,680
That won't do.

291
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,199
Yeah, so you need emergency
facilities,

292
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,280
which include sand, absorbent
granules,

293
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,840
a sump, an ability to retain a
spillage.

294
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,719
Who does the transportation
of the livestock?

295
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,919
Sometimes it's me.

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,360
[Dave] There's still
sort of animal muck in there.

297
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,120
No, that's just soil.
There's no animal muck.

298
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,080
Would you pick a handful of it
up and show me closer?

299
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,039
I can. Hang on. There you go.

300
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,440
The standard talks
about trailers being clean,

301
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,799
the trailer isn't clean.

302
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,639
[Jeremy] After a ticking off

303
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,799
about the chemical store and
the trailer,

304
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,120
which had a bit of mud
that wasn't feces in it,

305
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Dave asked to see my filing
system.

306
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,359
[Dave] Do you have a soil
management plan

307
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,599
to hand there, Jeremy, at all?

308
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,319
Oh, no that's MMP no.

309
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,400
What was the question?
I've forgotten.

310
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,639
Is this the first audit

311
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,719
you've been involved with,
Jeremy?

312
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,839
[Jeremy] Eventually with
my phone battery on 2%,

313
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,999
I had to cut to the chase.

314
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,200
[Jeremy] David, what I really
wanna know,

315
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,319
I appreciate there are two
things that we've got wrong,

316
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,719
the sand pit and the muddy
trailer,

317
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,079
but are we gonna be okay?

318
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,440
Yes.

319
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,760
[Jeremy] This made me very
proud.

320
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,640
I've done a thing!

321
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,880
Sadly though,
there was no time to celebrate

322
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,680
because the next emergency
beckoned.

323
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,919
Putting some wet into my
wetlands.

324
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,439
[Jeremy] I mean look at the
cracks.

325
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,479
-[Kaleb] Yeah. On the plus side,
though.

326
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,159
-What?

327
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,480
Grass is worth a lot of money
at the minute.

328
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,879
-Is it?
-Mmm, hay.

329
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,320
-Hay.
-Is it?

330
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,239
Cut some hay, bale it, put it
in the shed.

331
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,640
Guarantee, 'cause no one's had
a very good cut.

332
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,640
Well the sheep's had most of
the hay away.

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,840
-Yeah.
-Which you don't like again.

334
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,319
No, I mean, if you'd have not
had the sheep, cut that for hay,

335
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,279
you'd have made more money on
the hay

336
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,200
than you would have the sheep.

337
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
-I haven't made any money on
the sheep.

338
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,160
-Exactly, you've lost loads.

339
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
But what would you have lost
if you'd cut it for hay?

340
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,199
-Nothing.
-Exactly.

341
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,040
And there's my point again.
Fuck the sheep.

342
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,839
[Jeremy] Kaleb Attenborough and
I then turned our attention

343
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,599
to the watering solution system
I'd bought.

344
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Solar powered water pump.

345
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,479
That's not gonna work, is it.
Be realistic.

346
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,839
I don't think it is either,

347
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,239
but I'm going to give nature a
chance.

348
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,479
God has provided us with this
power station in the sky

349
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,359
and we're going to try and use
it.

350
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,400
Let's just lie them down for
now, that's a good idea.

351
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,280
This should fire up the pump.

352
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,359
I'm about to lower an

353
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,959
electrically powered
object into a pond.

354
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,359
-Ready?
-[Kaleb] Go for it.

355
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,159
-You could piss faster than
that.

356
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,240
-That is just lamentable.

357
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,360
-You know what the solution is,
mate?

358
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:58,959
-What's that?

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
Internal combustion.

360
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,559
It's the solution to everything.
Speed and power.

361
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,560
[Jeremy] I therefore
went shopping

362
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,200
and soon we had
some meaty hoses.

363
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,000
And a generator that ran

364
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,079
on the amber nectar that is
petrol.

365
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,799
[Jeremy] Solar power, my arse.

366
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,400
-[Kaleb] Um, problem.
-[Jeremy] Oh!

367
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
[Jeremy laughs]

368
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
-Can you go and get it for me?
-Yeah, of course.

369
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,159
No, that's stuck fast, mate,
sorry,

370
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,880
nothing I can do about that.

371
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
Oh, you bastard!

372
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,159
Well you got me in the tractor
the other day, that is payback.

373
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,080
Fuel, pump on, choke on.

374
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
-Um, right.
-Yeah, you ready?

375
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,039
[Jeremy] Here we are
demonstrating that once again

376
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,719
solar power is no match
for internal combustion.

377
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,080
There it is. There it is. There
it is!

378
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,320
Okay, that's pretty wild
actually.

379
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,080
-[Kaleb] That's not really
working is it?

380
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,039
-What do you mean?

381
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,239
It's too powerful.

382
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,799
It's taking all the seeds and
the soil into the river there.

383
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,200
This is really hard work
holding onto it.

384
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,760
-Oh!
-[laughs]

385
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,880
Fucking hell! No, shut it down.

386
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,559
Right, as I've always said,
speed and power doesn't work.

387
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
Solar power's the answer.

388
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
And so...

389
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,400
Come on, Kaleb,
we'll let Zeus do his job.

390
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,760
-Got to come back down in 15
minutes.

391
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,559
-I know.

392
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,199
And water here and turn round
and move the pipe.

393
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,320
[Jeremy] With the wetlands
sorted,

394
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,560
I plunged into my next
project.

395
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,520
Planting some trees for the
government.

396
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,080
Which in the driest May on
record

397
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,400
is not the sort of job your
right leg will thank you for.

398
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,960
When Monty Don does this...

399
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,560
it always looks so incredibly
easy.

400
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,959
The government announced that
by 2025,

401
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,200
it would plant 125 million
trees in the UK

402
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,960
and everybody
said that's fantastic!

403
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,320
And it is.

404
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,319
But where are all these trees
gonna come from?

405
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,799
You'd have to import them from
abroad and if you do that,

406
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,920
you get abroad diseases
like Ash dieback

407
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
from Scandinavia

408
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,799
and Dutch elm disease from
Canada.

409
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,080
And then that kills off all the
trees that are already here.

410
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,879
And who was gonna plant them?
125 million trees!

411
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,560
You can't even get people

412
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,039
to pick strawberries in this
country.

413
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,080
And selfishly, there's another
problem.

414
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,680
You know what I just thought of,
if I plant a tree,

415
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,079
by the time it's an actual tree,
I'll be dead.

416
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,720
So I'm doing all this work

417
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,399
for a bunch of ingrates and
millennials.

418
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,320
I need to speed this up.

419
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,560
We're managing to plant all
these trees

420
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,959
with just two track vehicles.

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,640
The dump truck, the van and the
lorry. That's all we're using.

422
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,040
A tree!

423
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,879
-And this is the exhaust pipe.
-This is the exhaust pipe.

424
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,320
So this is an irrigation
and an aeration tube.

425
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,160
So it's putting water
around the edge of the roots.

426
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,000
-So it's got holes in it.
-It's got holes in it.

427
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,959
And how old is it? Five, ten
years?

428
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,679
-Probably about 40-years-old,
I reckon.

429
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,320
-Is it?

430
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,079
And this is what I've ended up
with, 20 new trees.

431
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,040
Good for insects, good for
birds, which will nest in them.

432
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,760
I don't normally like trees,

433
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,319
but I like these ones 'cause
they've all got exhaust pipes.

434
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,560
As May came to a close,
there was still no sign of rain.

435
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,559
So we did everything we could

436
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,959
to look after everything in our
care.

437
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,679
We built some shade for the
trout.

438
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,479
I moved water about non-stop.

439
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,719
Kaleb stood around with his
hose.

440
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,079
And Charlie monitored the
vegetables

441
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,919
I'd planted in lockdown.

442
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,839
It's not ideal conditions, but
you know,

443
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,920
we've got the farm shop,

444
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,240
we need something to stock it.

445
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,079
We've got Swiss chard, we've
got beans,

446
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,159
broad beans, we've got swedes,

447
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,960
we've got turnips, we've got
leeks.

448
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,959
Whatever you want,

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
we're growing it up here, or
trying to.

450
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,160
I think it's gonna be a real
challenge.

451
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,879
[Jeremy] But the biggest
challenge

452
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,960
was the state of our main crops,

453
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,319
as Charlie pointed out
on our next field walk.

454
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,640
-So this wheat.
-And if we come down,

455
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,000
you can just see now
that we've got quite a lot of...

456
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,479
Brilliant, that's a whole loaf
of bread just gone.

457
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,879
So we've got rust coming on the
bottom.

458
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,800
-We've got what?
-Rust.

459
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,520
-So it's a type of disease.
-What, like a Lancia?

460
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,519
Exactly.

461
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,199
But the main problem at the
moment

462
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,280
is at this end of the plant,

463
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:18,159
we need these lovely white

464
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,240
fresh roots to keep growing with
the moisture.

465
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,359
-And there isn't any moisture.

466
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,720
-'Cause there isn't any
moisture.

467
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,959
I mean we've been in lockdown
now

468
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,800
for six, seven weeks,
haven't we?

469
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,359
It's just because I came to see
this rust.

470
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,360
-Yes.

471
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
-But we've been in lockdown
for...

472
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,560
-And it hasn't really rained,
really.

473
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,839
-No, well, about two months.

474
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah, two months.

475
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,519
It was the same parched story
everywhere.

476
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,080
He's ripped up another bit.

477
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,680
It's just getting a little bit
stressed, moisture stress again.

478
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,159
-So they become a bit waxy.
-How do you know?

479
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,879
-Oh, I see, so the white stuff?
-The white stuff.

480
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,760
So the white stuff is just like
a wax,

481
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,119
so it's just protecting itself,

482
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,520
So the leaves are curled.

483
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,399
So it's stressy
when it's got white stuff on it?

484
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,960
Yeah. And the leaves are curled
to try and reduce moisture.

485
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,999
[Jeremy] Ah! So curling round
is bad?

486
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,359
-Curling round is a bad sign.
- Stress.

487
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,920
[Dave] Stress, these crops are
stressed.

488
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,599
[Jeremy] The water shortage
was a serious problem,

489
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,480
but it wasn't the only thing
that was bothering me.

490
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,240
I was doing this thing the
other day,

491
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,079
I was watching Kaleb
spraying something or other.

492
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,360
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

493
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
How long can we keep just
spraying fields before they go,

494
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,800
"Actually you know what?
I've given all I can give"?

495
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,759
-The crop?
-Just the soil.

496
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,400
Isn't it a bit
like saying to a footballer,

497
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,880
right you've done
the whole Premier League season,

498
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,160
now you're immediately going on
to play

499
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,640
in the Southern Hemisphere

500
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,360
and you've got to give just
as much

501
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,480
there and then straight back.

502
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,159
They're not gonna last very long
as footballers.

503
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,280
So that's why we have a
rotation.

504
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,359
So we grow different...

505
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,640
But we do wheat, barley, rape.
So there's no real...

506
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
But the rotation breaks up
the rotation of chemicals.

507
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,640
And we're not just pouring on
chemicals

508
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,640
just for the sake of it.

509
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,160
I appreciate it. We're doing it
for all the right reasons.

510
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,600
Feed the world, keep the crops
healthy.

511
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,960
Long term though, some people
are saying,

512
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,320
I mean they're probably
scaremongers,

513
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,959
but nevertheless,

514
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,040
they're saying that in this
country

515
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,439
we only have 90 or 100 harvests
left

516
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,319
before the top soil is dead.

517
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,960
-Am I allowed to be a bit
worried?

518
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,280
-It's only right to be worried.

519
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,399
[Jeremy] Once Charlie and I
had finished the crop walk,

520
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,680
I turned my attention to a
murder mystery.

521
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,399
Normally my hens look like this.

522
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,719
But in the last couple of days,

523
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,159
they'd started to look like
this.

524
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,960
And I just worked out what was
going on.

525
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,959
This is a pastoral scene, you
would agree.

526
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,319
All the sheep rubbing up against
the henhouses.

527
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,680
There's nothing pastoral about
it, though.

528
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,799
Because what they do is
they open the henhouse doors.

529
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,400
Not making it up, they rub
against the catches until...

530
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,000
No, the blue one,
they've opened it, come on.

531
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,279
There you go.

532
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,040
Come on, clear off.

533
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,240
Look, they rub themselves
against the catches

534
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,720
so the door opens
and the hens can get out.

535
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,279
I wonder why they do it?

536
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,560
The only reason I can think is
that

537
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,639
they're bored and they
just think,

538
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,920
"Hey, girls, let's just go
and let some hens out

539
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,240
"and see how far they get

540
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,959
before they're eaten by the
fox."

541
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,919
I mean the foxes live in a hole,

542
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,360
I can see it actually from here,
in that hedge.

543
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,000
Basically they're living
opposite a branch of KFC.

544
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,880
The sheep know the foxes are
there.

545
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,960
They know the hens are here.

546
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,640
It's just a game to them.

547
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,840
[Jeremy] Kaleb, however,
dismissed my theory.

548
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,160
As we built a fence to stop the
problem,

549
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,760
he said the sheep were rubbing
themselves on the henhouses

550
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,599
because they were hot and itchy.

551
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,439
Which meant it was time to
shear them.

552
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,040
-Well, they basically live in
this field.

553
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,199
-Yeah.

554
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,160
Well there's a story to tell
there, isn't there?

555
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,840
That's green and that isn't.

556
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,920
[Jeremy] So I gave Kevin
from the NSA a call

557
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and he was keen to hear
how I'd got on with the lambing.

558
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,400
[Jeremy] Overall, all the lambs
have survived, except one.

559
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,800
[Kevin] Well that's good.

560
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,760
[Jeremy] I did put my hand
up one's bottom by mistake.

561
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,479
-I bet you've done that.
-No.

562
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,319
It was an honest mistake.
I wasn't doing it on purpose.

563
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,399
-[Kevin] Is this your friend?
-Yeah, this is the one.

564
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,160
I think this is the one
I went up the back,

565
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,880
'cause every time I come,

566
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,120
she comes and looks at me like,
"Please don't do that again."

567
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,440
-Yeah, but because there's
people here.

568
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,520
-I've apologized.

569
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,360
[Jeremy] Soon, Ellen the
shepherd arrived with a mate.

570
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,920
The sheep were rounded up in
their pens...

571
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,800
and a blizzard of shearing
began.

572
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,800
-God look at... Does that spin
round then?

573
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,759
-Yeah.

574
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
Oh, I've found it.

575
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,040
-What if you get your finger in
there?

576
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,239
-They'll come off.

577
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,159
That's bloody...

578
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,560
I'm gonna cut my hand off if
I...

579
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,519
-Why do they have that?
-[Ellen] So you can move it.

580
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,599
'Cause otherwise you wouldn't
be able

581
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,680
to get over all the bumps

582
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,200
-and the bends of the sheep.
-That's lethal.

583
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,360
-You pull them out upside down.
-'Cause then it's easy.

584
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,640
You can get straight on
and start clipping them.

585
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,880
Just saves you time.

586
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,040
And this is done mainly
for welfare reasons, isn't it.

587
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,959
I mean 'cause they'd be too hot.

588
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,279
They'd be too hot and it's more
likely

589
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,919
they'd get maggots as well.

590
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,160
[Kevin] Right, you're looking
for a job, I assume.

591
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,199
[Jeremy] Kevin then set me to
work rolling up the fleeces.

592
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,799
All right. Throw it out.

593
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,840
Can you tell which was the back
end from the neck?

594
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
-I reckon that's the back.
-No, that's the neck.

595
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,680
-[Jeremy] Yeah, I knew that.
-A bit of poo there look.

596
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,879
[Jeremy] Yeah, that's shit,
yeah.

597
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,360
[Kevin] Need to take
any poo off like that,

598
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,720
roll it up tight, bring your
neck round

599
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,799
and stuff it in there.

600
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,400
That's a nice one.

601
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,840
This one was crapping...

602
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,240
How's it got crap
at the back and the front?

603
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,079
Look it's crapped everywhere.
It's got it on its feet.

604
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,920
I immediately decided
rolling wasn't for me.

605
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,960
I want to have a go at that.
Can I do the next one?

606
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,079
If you want. So you get her
head.

607
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,799
And get her tail.

608
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,359
And they're gonna bend towards
each other

609
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,440
and you're gonna step back.

610
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,840
No, no!

611
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,120
Right. First of all, I've got
to be calm.

612
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,559
Give them no sense that I'm
gonna

613
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,239
roll them on their back in a
moment.

614
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,799
Just talking to you. Sheep
psychology. Here we go.

615
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,760
-She already knows you're after
her.

616
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,999
-Of course she does.

617
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,159
Stay calm, Kev, stay calm.

618
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's have no panicking from
you two.

619
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,680
Okay. Put your hand on her chin.

620
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,760
I've done a thing.

621
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,000
-We got her.
-Well, yeah, but she's on me.

622
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,719
The next move is head.

623
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,480
I'm gonna get kicked.

624
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,119
Ow, it's got me in the testes!
Oh, that's it. Right.

625
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,999
[all laugh]

626
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,720
I can't wrestle sheep.

627
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,799
To make life easier,
Ellen pulled a sheep out for me.

628
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,720
So you want to put that leg
up your bum crack.

629
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,039
-Up my bum crack?
-Yeah.

630
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,599
-Where do I put her head?
-Her head stays forward.

631
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,560
That side. Oh, God! Oh look,
I know I'll settle her down.

632
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,240
Where are you going
on your holidays this year?

633
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,680
There you go, now we've got
a relaxed relationship going on.

634
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,519
Whoa! In the inner thigh!

635
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,959
Fucking hell, that's impossible.

636
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
I couldn't believe the idea
of holding a sheep down,

637
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,840
already you need to be
an octopus to do that,

638
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,400
already you need eight legs
and you need to be strong.

639
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,080
-[Ellen] Yeah.
-Then it's lying there,

640
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,280
thrashing its head around,
looking for a weak spot in you,

641
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,999
while you're operating a thing

642
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,759
that would have your hand off
as quick as anything.

643
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,519
I mean, the old dog
I thought was impressive,

644
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,919
and now you're more impressive

645
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,160
-than your dog.
-[laughs]

646
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,159
[Jeremy] After the shearing
debacle,

647
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,480
I was put back on rolling
duties.

648
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,599
And how did you spend the day,
Jeremy?

649
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,240
Well ripping dingle berries
out of shaved sheep's coats.

650
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,120
Because this is
a sheep related enterprise,

651
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,680
I suspected it wouldn't be
financially rewarding either.

652
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,640
I know there's Covid,
so there's no exports to China.

653
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,200
Nobody's building houses,
so nobody's buying new carpets.

654
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,719
And nobody wears wool clothes
anymore

655
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
'cause everybody wears
tracksuits and football shirts.

656
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,919
So how much
am I gonna get for that fleece?

657
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,800
That probably I'd say 30 to 40p.

658
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,720
So, if there's 77 sheep.

659
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,279
£30.80.

660
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,040
£30.80 is what I'm going to get
for all this wool!

661
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,159
Yeah.

662
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,360
Ellen is £1.75 a sheep,
her mate's the same.

663
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,880
I then get 40 pence for what
they produce.

664
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,480
Mmm-hmm.

665
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,119
Kev, this is a bam business.

666
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,919
Yeah, but we're not doing this
section now

667
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,800
really to make money are we.

668
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,119
It did in the olden days.

669
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,119
Think about it half a million
sheep

670
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,200
in the Cotswolds in the 12th
century

671
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,520
and there were only two million
people in the whole country.

672
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,439
Sheep outnumbered people

673
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,520
back then four to one in
Britain.

674
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,959
Yeah, I mean if you look round

675
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,840
at some of the towns around
here,

676
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,680
they got unfeasibly large
churches,

677
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,559
that's because all the people

678
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,999
that made their money out of
the wool,

679
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,559
felt they needed to give to the
community

680
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,959
and just built massive churches.

681
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
Yeah. There, we've got massive
churches and big houses.

682
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,479
Why do people wear tracksuits?

683
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,799
Why don't we make tracksuits
illegal?

684
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,319
And football shirts, illegal.
Illegal.

685
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,399
You can only wear woolen
clothing.

686
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,800
We're right behind you.

687
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,519
-Right, no more tracksuits.
-Woolly underpants.

688
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,639
Woolly underpants.

689
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,480
As Ellen and her mate
blitzed through the sheep,

690
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,479
I got a visit from Gerald,
who'd also been to the shearers.

691
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,799
-All right, Gerald.
-Hello.

692
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,479
I didn't think you'd be
with the herds out here.

693
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,280
That's the area with all the
shit on.

694
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,240
I can finish it off if you want?
I've got the shit.

695
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,360
[laughs] Yeah, I know.

696
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,640
I reckon now
you'd pick whatever

697
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,199
or whichever one tank to put on
each tree, haven't you?

698
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,640
And not disturbing them,

699
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,880
I would have thought
they'd have went to Manchester.

700
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Another thing I found two years
ago on the subject...

701
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,400
Oh, yeah.

702
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,280
But, you know, with the old
back,

703
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,640
it's a terrible job, that is.

704
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,360
You got bloody hoses
fetching out there

705
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,040
in the place where your pond is.

706
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,439
Find no animals at all round
here now.

707
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,079
You're better off with the dirt.
You can't do that with animals.

708
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,279
Yeah. Right, I'm gonna roll
this up.

709
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,600
Nice talking to you Gerald.

710
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
As the afternoon wore on,

711
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,160
the valueless fleeces kept on
coming,

712
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,919
until eventually all we had left
were the two rams.

713
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,200
Wayne and Leonardo.

714
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,559
If he writhes around now...

715
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,360
Funny thing is the real Wayne
Rooney,

716
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,560
when he goes to the barbers,

717
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,959
he normally comes out with more
hair

718
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
than he went in with, but not
this one.

719
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,000
With Wayne and Leo
sporting their new BNP haircuts,

720
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,359
it was time to down tools
and crack open a beer.

721
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,319
I don't feel like
I quite earned it though,

722
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,360
I've got to be honest, 'cause I

723
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,640
didn't really master sheep
shearing.

724
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,319
Yeah, but as the host,
it's always good

725
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,400
to have a beer
with the shearers

726
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,000
to say thank you for all the
hard work.

727
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,159
Yeah, but they brought the beer,
so I'm now feeling bad.

728
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,559
You didn't tell me about the
need

729
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,319
to bring beer to a sheep
shearing,

730
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,760
and he didn't tell me that sheep
have two holes at the back.

731
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,160
-Well, you know that now, don't
you?

732
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:53,639
-Oh, yeah.

733
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,919
You learned that one.

734
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,680
[Jeremy] With the beer break
over,

735
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,640
there was still one job left.

736
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,159
Move the sheep to their new
field,

737
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,639
which was on the other side of
the farm.

738
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,760
And given that I hadn't been
much help all day,

739
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,960
I volunteered to take point

740
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
and steer the flock from the
front.

741
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,600
-[sheep bleating]
-Come on, girls. Come on, girls!

742
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,799
Come on girls, you're going on
a road now.

743
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,880
-Welcome to my world, the
highways.

744
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,880
-[sheep bleating]

745
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,079
"Baa" to you too. No, no, not
there.

746
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,640
[Kevin] Don't let them go by,
Jeremy!

747
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:37,439
No, you've overtaken me. Whoa,
slow down!

748
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,159
-[Kevin] You're in front,
Jeremy!

749
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,199
-No, no, whoa!

750
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
[Kevin] You've got to be in
front of them!

751
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,960
That's not gone terribly well.

752
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,439
-[Ellen] Come here!
-[Kevin whistles]

753
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
Where are you going?

754
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,759
-[Ellen] Lie down!
-[Kevin] Come on, girls.

755
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,839
Well, they've just...

756
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,920
Now they're just trampling the
crop now.

757
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,159
-[Kevin] Come on, girls.
-Well, walk on the margins.

758
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,119
They all think they're Russell
Crowe.

759
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,799
[whistles]

760
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,439
-[Jeremy] Come on, girls!
-[Kevin] Come on, girls!

761
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,079
[Jeremy] Come to me.
This has not gone well.

762
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,519
-[Kevin] Come on, girls.
-There's the dog.

763
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,599
The dog contributing slightly
to this, mostly me.

764
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,679
Come on, girls!

765
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,200
Don't do that. Don't do that.

766
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,640
No. No. No!

767
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,439
-[Ellen] Wait. Come by.
-[Jeremy] Right, watch the dog.

768
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:49,959
[Ellen] Come by, come by,
come by! Come by!

769
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,639
[Jeremy] Come on dog, get them
back.

770
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Good dog. There they go.

771
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:02,119
-[Ellen] Get on.
-[Jeremy] Go on labradog.

772
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,080
[Kevin] Come on, girls.

773
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,640
[Jeremy] They're now going
in the right direction.

774
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,080
-That's a great sight.
-[Ellen] Not a bad view, is it?

775
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,559
-[Jeremy] It's lovely, isn't it?

776
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,839
-[Kevin] That's the beauty of
this job.

777
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,400
See something like that
and it just makes you smile.

778
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,160
[Jeremy] Eventually after a
fraught

779
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,119
but visually stunning journey,

780
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,919
the sheep were at their
destination.

781
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,519
This is the very field where I
first had

782
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,759
the idea to keep sheep.

783
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,480
I thought they'd be a cheap and
easy way

784
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,839
of keeping the grass down
ecologically.

785
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,320
But seriously,
I could have done this field,

786
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,120
mown it completely
in the tractor in an hour,

787
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,439
would have cost me a tenner in
diesel.

788
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:59,839
But no, Jeremy knows best.
I shall keep sheep.

789
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,360
[laughs] What was I thinking of?

790
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,280
I quite enjoyed having them
though.

791
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,360
So, the newly trimmed sheep

792
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,640
were now equipped to deal with
the heat,

793
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,440
which is more than could be said
of my new trees.

794
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,800
Even though we were watering
them constantly,

795
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,800
they were all shedding their
leaves and dying.

796
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:40,359
And it was the same story
everywhere.

797
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,759
I'd be harvesting the crops
in six weeks' time.

798
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,279
And the big question was would
they all

799
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,640
just be shriveled husks by then?

800
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,640
Give me anything, grow
something, make something.

801
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,079
-I am growing things.
-Do something.

802
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,519
Now we have to have an
enforcement case opened on us.

803
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,639
[car honks]

804
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,040
Are you fucking having me on?

805
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,679
Every single thing you can do
in the countryside,

806
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,960
you can't do in London.

807
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,159
Where am I?
