40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,613
I don't even need that friend.

41
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,123
I have a new friend.

42
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,700

(Stacey sighs)

88
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,517
I shouldn't have argued with my friend.

89
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:30,816
- Dad.

90
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,113

00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:27,446
I'm scared!

436
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:32,283
- Look, there's nothing here.

437
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:34,043

470
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,300
Here, lie down.

471
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,590
Sleep.
