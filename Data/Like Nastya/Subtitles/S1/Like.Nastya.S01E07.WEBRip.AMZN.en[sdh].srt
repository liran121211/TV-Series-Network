385
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,421
(Stacey's dad sighs)

386
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:20,583
- I can make her laugh.

387
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,353
This is what girls like.

388
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:25,510

00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:40,231
Have you brought them for me?

394
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,351
Humph.

395
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:42,184
Humph!

399
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:54,300
- So, are you bringing me a dress or what?

400
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,208
- Listen, princess, have
you done your homework?

401
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,260
(Stacey gasps)

402
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,409
- Then you'd better get started.

403
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:01,848
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:03,633
- (scoffs) If you're the princess,

405
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,990
I'm a king!

406
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,823
(staff stomps)

407
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,364
(Stacey's dad groans)

408
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:13,364
- (gasps) Oops.

409
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:17,757
(Stacey grumbles)

410
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,403

412
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:26,275
(feet stomping)

413
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,743

414
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:31,410
(Stacey groans)

415
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:34,372

(chipmunk laughs)

417
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:37,749
- Beep beep.

418
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:39,954
He also isn't real.

419
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:42,314
(Stacey grumbles)

420
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:43,147
- Ah!

421
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,790

422
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,207

427
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,379
Stacey, let's go look for snow!

428
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:16,844

- No, no, no, no, no, Stacey.

472
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,283
It's not a lollipop or a candy.
