00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:34,484
- Mm.

568
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:37,126
I know, wait here.

569
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:38,385
I'll be right back.

(straw gurgles)

572
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:45,751
It's a good bag.

573
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,584
Ah, milk.

574

Ah, Chanel.

Hmm.

00:20:57,435 --> 00:21:00,229
(techno music)

579
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,105
Look.

580
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,086
- Yes, yes.

581
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,836
- Mm. Thank you, bye.

582
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,500

Ah!

(Stacy gasps)
(kid giggles)

588
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:20,804
Aw.

589
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,914
Wow, eye shadow.

590
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,747
(whimsical music)

591
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:32,604

(Stacy gasps)

593
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,180
Ah! Mm-mm.

594
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,199
Not happening.

595
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,466
(whimsical music)

596
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:44,299
Mm.

597
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:45,170

598
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,320
Mm-hm.

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,445
(techno music)

600
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:51,862
(kid sniffs)

601
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:53,842
- Hello.

602
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:55,562
- (gasps) Hmm.

603
00:21:55,562 --> 00:22:00,562
(feet stomp)
(dramatic music)

604
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,093
Nobody has this one.

605
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:05,657
Mm.

606
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,407
(dramatic music)

607
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,853

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,749
Wow. Can we also have this?

And, the T-shirts.
