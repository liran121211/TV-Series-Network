00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,943
Baby, come eat.

577
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,230
(game sounds)

578
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,909
Go eat quickly.

579
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:52,233
(gasps) Un huh.

580
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,769
(upbeat music)

581
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,240
Eww.

582
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,523
- I forgot bread.

583
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:07,140
(twinkling steps)

584
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,057
Mmm. Bread.

585
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,713
(gasps)
He's gone.

586
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,143
Daddy?

587
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,060
Hmm?

588
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,893
Daddy?

589
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:18,661
Bad.

590
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:19,494
Daddy.

591
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,810
(chime)

592
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,331
Daddy.

593
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:26,881
Hey.

594
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:29,381
(ghosts moan)

595
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:31,955
Ew.

596
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,520
Daddy.

597
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,353
Oy!

598
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:38,677
Daddy.

599
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,060
Daddy. Daddy.

600
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,107
Hmm? Who's in the car?

601
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,040
(children exclaim)

602
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,810
No, no, no. Go with soup quickly.

603
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,651
- Hmm.

604
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:54,810
(disappointed music)

605
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,860
Come on.

606
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,423
Open wide.

607
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,963
Here comes the train.

608
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,148
Good job. Open wide.

609
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:05,981
- Oh no.

610
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:11,325
- Well done. You ate it all.

611
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:17,740
You got dirty. Change your clothes.

612
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,253
(clothes honk)

613
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,663
- Here. I changed my clothes.

614
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,153
- No, no, no.

615
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,002
Look.

616
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:38,502
(bell chimes)

617
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:43,573
(children laugh)

618
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,764
What a beauty.

619
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:49,847
(children laugh)

620
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:50,910
Go play.

621
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,023
- Where to?

622
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,593
- You need some balls.

623
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,940
- La la la.

624
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,093
La la la.

625
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,960
- And Pacier, of course.

626
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,170
- Maybe we should.
(grunts)

627
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,193
- Wait for me.

628
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:17,146
- Hmm? I don't wanna play anymore.

629
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,118
(upbeat music)

630
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:21,718
(warbling sounds)

631
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:24,827
(dad plonks)

632
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,026
(TV whirls)

633
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:28,050
(girl laughs)

634
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,453
- TV. No, no, no, no.

635
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,266
It's time to get some sleep.

636
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,737
- Ah, well, okay.

637
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,117
- Nice.

638
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:38,950
Here.

639
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,118
Sweet dreams my baby.

640
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:43,951
- Ah.

641
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:46,050
- I'll read you a story.

642
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,038
Well listen.

643
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,180
Once upon a time.

644
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,906
(baby yawns)

645
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:56,010
(girl snores)

646
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,333
- Nice.

647
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,513
(twinkling steps)

648
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:04,286
(baby yawns)

649
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:05,885
- Oh, he is gone.

650
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:08,970
(foot stomps)

651
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,480
- Ah, ah, ah.
(baby cries)

652
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,637
- What's going on here?

653
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:23,970
- Ah, the baby is crying.
He needs his mommy.

654
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,177
- Let, lemme take them.

655
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:30,095
Ah. And you go away not to disturb me.

656
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,153
- Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

657
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,336
(dad cheers)

658
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,419
- Ah, ah, ah.
