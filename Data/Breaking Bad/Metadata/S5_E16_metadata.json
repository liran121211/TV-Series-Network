    "Walter returns to Albuquerque to tie up loose ends, setting the stage for a final confrontation. Meanwhile, Jesse fights for his freedom as everything comes to a dramatic conclusion.",
    "In the series finale, Walt returns to Albuquerque to settle accounts. He visits his former business partners Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz with a proposition. When they are less than forthcoming, he makes them an offer they can't refuse. He pays one last visit to Skyler but avoids seeing Walt Jr. In a coffee shop, he meets Todd and Lydia saying he's now broke but has a new formula for making meth that he wants to sell them. It's all a ruse to get a meeting with the neo-Nazis who stole his money. Once there, he puts his final plan into action.\u2014garykmcd"
