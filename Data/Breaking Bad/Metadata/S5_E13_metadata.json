Meanwhile, Jesse sets a trap that could change everything.", "Jesse's plan to get evidence against Walt is relatively simple: Find out where Walt has stashed his money and either take it from him or threaten to do so. Either way, it will flush him out and the DEA can nab him and the cash. Hank and Gomez convince Saul's man Huell that Walt has gone on a killing spree, and while he doesn't know where the money is, Huell tells them about the barrels of money. Walt for his part is on high alert knowing that Jesse wants him dead. He tries to get Jesse out into the open through his girlfriend Andrea but Hank intercepts that message. Walt finally contacts Todd's uncle and he agrees to eliminate Jesse. There is a price to pay, however. Jesse finally contacts Walt and tells him he's about to burn all of his money. Walt panics and heads straight to desert where it's buried, setting up a deadly confrontation.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2301449", "rating": 9.8, "votes": 63762, "number_of_episodes": 62}
