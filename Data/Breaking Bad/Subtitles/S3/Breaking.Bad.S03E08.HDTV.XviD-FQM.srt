1
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,218
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:53,988
Yeah. Whatever.

3
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,558
Uh, sir,
if you'd like to smoke,

4
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:00,027
you need to be another
20 feet from the door.

5
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,163
So roll me further, bitch.

6
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:25,386
What's coming?

7
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,721
Male Caucasian.

8
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,955
Early 40s.

9
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,524
Multiple gunshot wounds.

10
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,830
BP is 70. 7-0 over palp.

11
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,232
Pulse 140-- 1-4-0.

12
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:39,634
Weak and thready
at the brachial.

13
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:41,102
No breath sounds
on the right side,

14
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:42,236
and the belly is rigid.

15
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,005
Patient appears pale
and diaphoretic.

16
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,606
How many entry wounds?

17
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,375
We found four-- shoulder and
hip, through and through.

18
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,443
Right lung
and lower left quadrant,

19
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:51,445
no visible exit wounds.

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,147
Let's give him
2 grams of oxygen.

21
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:55,383
What's his hemoglobin?
7.3.

22
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,685
I need two
large-bore IVs,

23
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,020
6 units O-neg,

24
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,621
type and cross
for 6 more units,

25
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,156
Chest X-ray and KUB.

26
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,525
Notify the O.R.
we are on the way.

27
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,229
O.R. One is clear.
Let's put him in there.

28
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,796
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

29
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,001
Damn, brother, look at you.

30
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:49,136
That's messed up.

31
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:52,173
How are you feeling?
You okay?

32
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,574
Actually...

33
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,678
I'm great.

34
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:11,350


35
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:22,870
I don't understand.

36
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:25,406
I thought things were
going pretty well.

37
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,108
I--

38
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,277
I thought we were
kind of simpatico,

39
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,544
you know?

40
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,247
We were becoming a real team.

41
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:37,785
Uh, not-- not so much, no.

42
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,021
Is this about the temperature
setting the other day?

43
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,490
Because I can assure you
that will not happen--

44
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,358
No, it's bigger
than that, Gale.

45
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:48,296
It's-- It's-- It's
much more than that.

46
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,264
Could you elaborate?

47
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:53,167
Well, uh, yes,
of course I could,

48
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,170
but I don't think either of us

49
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:59,874
would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

50
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,978
Uh, yeah, so...

51
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,646
Yeah.

52
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,316
I set up the entire lab.

53
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,785
You said you liked
the configuration.

54
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,720
And I do.

55
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,822
For the most part.

56
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,526
Look, you're a fine
chemist, really,

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,227
with a promising future.

58
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:23,264
It's just that--
that I--

59
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:28,636
that-- that we just have
different...

60
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,871
Rhythms, Gale.

61
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:31,973
It's-- It's--

62
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:36,711
It's as if I'm classical

63
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:40,681
but you are-- are more...

64
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,616
Jazz.

65
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:45,252
Jazz.
Jazz.

66
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:46,420
Yes.

67
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,323
And God knows there is
nothing wrong with jazz.

68
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:55,062
It's simply
that I require--

69
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,197
Classical.

70
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,099
Exactly.

71
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,169
Oh, shit.

72
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,605
Man, this is the bomb.

73
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,615
What's up, partner?

74
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,586
Ohh.

75
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,221
I can't believe this.
This is my replacement?

76
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,590
Oh, Jesus.

77
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:25,960
Hi. Gale. Nice to meet you.

78
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,528
What's up?

79
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,197
Damn, we should have
ditched that RV months ago.

80
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,867
It's all, like,
shining up in here.

81
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:35,736
Oh!

82
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,139
I'm sorry. I must be
missing something.

83
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:39,974
I don't mean--
I don't mean to be--

84
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,909
Oh! Oh!

85
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,178
- This--
- No!

86
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:47,114
...makes no sense.

87
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,690
So...

88
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:59,293
I guess this is--

89
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,999
Oh, dear mother of God.

90
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,371
This is for the best.

91
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:12,807
200 pounds a week.

92
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,208
Got it?

93
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,743
Uh-huh.

94
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:19,346
Oh, man! Oh!

95
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:22,016
Mr. White!

96
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,158
Wow.

97
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:35,696
Okay. There's a lot
to show you.

98
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,965
Some new techniques to learn.

99
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,267
What, now?

100
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,902
Yes, now.

101
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,370
We've only got a couple days

102
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,339
before our next batch is due,

103
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,075
and I need to get you
up to speed.

104
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,677
Right on.

105
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,479
I'm just saying--

106
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,950
How's the cell service
down here?

107
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,785
It's nonexistent.

108
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,386
We're shielded.

109
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,922
There's a hard line
for emergencies. Come on.

110
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,458
So you haven't talked
to anybody today

111
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:07,094
other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

112
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,396
Why?

113
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,233
Your brother-in-law.

114
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,635
What about him?

115
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,607
So what's the story?
Upon arrival, he was unresponsive.

116
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,442
Take a look. You getting some
exposure on those wounds?

117
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:22,476
...blood pressure of 80.

118
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,744
2 units of normal saline.

119
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:25,012
We've got a bivalve mass.

120
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,213
He's got breath sounds
bilaterally.

121
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:27,848
This femur feels
like a wet bag of gravel.

122
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,350
The other one's
not much better.

123
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,518
Let's get those boots off.

124
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,519
See if you get a pulse.

125
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,754
You get a blood pressure
cup or an ABI?

126
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,089
Where's that blood?

127
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,329
Sir, can I help you?

128
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,430
Uh, yeah, I--

129
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:44,732
It's all right.
He's family.

130
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:45,766
Thank you.

131
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:47,835
Marie.

132
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,137
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

133
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:51,205
Hey.

134
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,811
I'm so sorry.

135
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,980
I don't know what to say.

136
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:08,923
How is he?

137
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,891
I don't know. They won't
really tell us anything.

138
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,726
He's still in surgery.

139
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,030
They shot him four times.

140
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,066
Oh, Christ.

141
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,573
Where's Holly?

142
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,408
I got a sitter.

143
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,779
Hey. How are you, huh?

144
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,914
Fine.
Yeah?

145
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,584
Sure?

146
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,754
I-- I'm fine. I just need
some fresh air.

147
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,825
Okay.

148
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,160
Here.
Let me get the door.

149
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,929
I got it. I'm fine.

150
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,867
Walt.
Hmm?

151
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:56,237
Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.

152
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,738
Hank's
brother-in-law Walt.

153
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,106
Hello.

154
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm very sorry.

155
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,208
Thank you. Uh--

156
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:02,977
Can you tell us anything

157
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,912
or any details?

158
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,146
Right now, all we know

159
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,681
is two men ambushed Hank.

160
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,583
They didn't have any I.D.
on them.

161
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:10,918
Probably Mexican nationals.

162
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:13,854
Their tattoos
indicated an affiliation

163
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,556
with the drug cartel.

164
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,893
Why did they attack Hank?

165
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:21,562
We're not sure yet.

166
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,098
It could be in relation

167
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:26,000
to an investigation
that Hank was working,

168
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:29,870
or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

169
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,241
They had an ax.

170
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:38,045
The cartels tend
to be dramatic.

171
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,714
Oh, Jesus.

172
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,918
Where are they?
I mean, did they--

173
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:46,620
Hank got both of them.

174
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,289
He killed one outright,

175
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:49,890
and the other one's upstairs

176
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,058
in critical condition.

177
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,060
Your brother-in-law's
one tough son of a bitch

178
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:54,461
to take them both out,

179
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,730
considering he didn't
even have his gun.

180
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,669
He didn't have his gun?

181
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,976
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

182
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:12,246
Marie, the assault charge.

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,449
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

184
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:18,819
That means I had to
take away his weapon.

185
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,922
It's standard procedure.
No one--

186
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,290
Okay, All right. Listen.

187
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,192
If you would have all
listened to him

188
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,360
right from the start,

189
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,295
and let him arrest
that little degenerate,

190
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,165
he wouldn't have had to take
things into his own hands,

191
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,434
and he would have had a gun
and defended himself.

192
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,601
Marie,
let's just--

193
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,636
No. Just--

194
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,673
It's their fault.

195
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,209
He didn't have a gun.

196
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,311
Honey, this isn't helping you.

197
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:46,180
You.

198
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:48,782
What kind of partner are you?

199
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,586
You were supposed
to back him up,

200
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,054
and where were you?

201
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,090
Where were you?

202
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,791
Texas.

203
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,495
And you.

204
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,832
You're supposed to
protect your agents

205
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,201
instead of taking their guns,

206
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,635
not supporting them,

207
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,037
not backing them up--

208
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,705
Marie. Marie.
...when they--

209
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,777
Honey, let's just go
and sit down, okay?

210
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,145
I'm not doing anything

211
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,381
until these two get
the hell out of here.

212
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:21,515
I mean it.

213
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,889
Sorry--
Go.

214
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:31,158
You are not welcome here.

215
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,061
The DEA is not welcome here.

216
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:35,429
Honey.

217
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,830
Come on.

218
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,766
Come on. Let's go sit down.

219
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,447
It's not just them.

220
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:57,518
It's you, Walt.

221
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,962
This Pinkman that Hank
was looking for--

222
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,099
Hank would have never
even heard his name

223
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:15,936
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

224
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,004
Marie--

225
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,106
Do you ever think
about that, Walt?

226
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,008
Do you?

227
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,310
Do you ever think
about everything

228
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,812
that you have put him through?

229
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,079
Marie, stop.

230
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,682
You're upset,

231
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,083
and you're looking
for someone to blame,

232
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:32,719
and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

233
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,822
It's not his fault.

234
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:43,530
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,065
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,767
Sweetheart. No.
No. No. Don't--

237
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:52,840
It's okay.

238
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,975
It's Hank--

239
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,211
It's all right.

240
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:58,345
Shh.

241
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:14,145
All right, you're done.

242
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,482
Okay, next.

243
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,978
Hello!

244
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,817
Hello,
hello, hello, hello, hello.

245
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:06,790
Yeah.

246
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:07,958
Wow.

247
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,601
Yo, yo, yo!

248
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:20,070
Jesse Pinkman in the house!

249
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:27,511
Oh, my dear God.

250
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,091
Wow.

251
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:06,283
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

252
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,620
<i>Walter White, please
pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

253
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,668
<i>Yo. We working sometime this year?</i>

254
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,303
What the hell
are you thinking?

255
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,339
Why are you calling me here?

256
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,808
I tried your cell, and it
went straight to voice mail.

257
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,676
How else am I supposed
to get hold of you?

258
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:33,844
You aren't.

259
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:35,579
<i>Look, man,
it's been a whole day.</i>

260
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:36,847
<i>How long is this
grieving process?</i>

261
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,682
Just put a clock on it for me.

262
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,952
<i>All's I'm saying is
we have a schedule, right?</i>

263
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,455
My family comes
before your schedule.

264
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,690
<i>Dude, it's not
my schedule.</i>

265
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,626
We have responsibilities here.

266
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,395
<i>I'll get there
when I get there.</i>

267
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,831
You know what? Whatever.

268
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,399
I'll just cook on my own.

269
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,834
You will do no such thing.

270
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,868
<i>Why not?</i>

271
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,272
<i>Well, uh, for starters,</i>

272
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,307
<i>you aren't
the least bit familiar</i>

273
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,608
with any of the equipment.

274
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>There's got to be some
sort of manual, right?</i>

275
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:08,245
And I can read.

276
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
Jesse, touch nothing.

277
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,516
Yo, stop treating me
I'm like your assistant.

278
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,251
I'm not your bitch
to order around.

279
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,486
We're partners.

280
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,820
<i>Remember?</i>

281
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:19,990
I need you to sit patiently

282
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:22,926
and wait, and I will be there
as soon as I can.

283
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,095
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

284
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,064
We-- We really do
appreciate that.

285
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,766
What, is your wife there?

286
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,035
<i>Uh, yes. Yes, she is,</i>

287
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,971
and she would be happy to know
that you asked about her.

288
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:35,973
And please do keep us
in your thoughts.

289
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,975
Hey, tell your douche-bag
brother-in-law

290
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,476
<i>to head towards the light.</i>

291
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,415
So I'm thinking, um,

292
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,450
maybe we should go get
everybody some breakfast.

293
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,319
Yeah. That sounds good.

294
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,154
Do you know who that was?

295
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,574
You know, these eggs
are really not too bad.

296
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:25,122
Look at that.

297
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:26,490
Look at what?

298
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:29,827
At what? This. These spots.

299
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:32,696
This fork is absolutely filthy.

300
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,836
Tell me you see this.

301
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,571
You've got good eyes.
Look at that.

302
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:43,440
Marie, those
are just water spots.

303
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,008
Fork is fine.

304
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,611
Those are not water spots.

305
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,980
That's dirt.

306
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,650
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

307
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:56,920
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

308
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,956
God knows what.

309
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,360
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

310
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,597
Ours at home aren't any better.

311
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,399
Yours at home are irrelevant.

312
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,933
We're in a hospital.

313
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:12,035
They need to be held
to a higher standard.

314
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,337
They have a responsibility.

315
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,172
Well, I'm not actually sure

316
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:17,775
if the cafeteria
necessarily qualifies

317
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,076
as being part of a hospital.

318
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,911
It's in the same building.

319
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,279
It's all under the same roof.

320
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:24,748
Do you think that sick
people aren't eating

321
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:26,950
with this bacteria-infected
silverware?

322
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:29,820
My Gpd, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

323
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,324
Marie.

324
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:39,296
I survived.

325
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,367
I had my lumpectomy
at this hospital.

326
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,568
Remember that?

327
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,172
Remember how scared
we all were?

328
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,306
Whoo.

329
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,442
I didn't want to act like it,

330
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:54,945
but I was terrified.

331
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,981
All that week,
all I could think of

332
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:02,820
was how they were actually
going to cut me open

333
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:06,523
and take out a part of me

334
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,326
that was with me
my entire life.

335
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,728
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

336
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:16,066
I think the scariest part

337
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,168
was when...

338
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:20,571
They took me into pre-op,

339
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,640
lying there,

340
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:26,076
waiting for them
to anesthetize you,

341
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,112
knowing that...

342
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,981
You may never wake up again.

343
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,590
Actually,

344
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:42,659
what I really remember
about that day

345
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:45,195
is driving to the hospital.

346
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,298
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

347
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,501
Yeah.

348
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:54,638
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central,

349
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:58,008
and we hit every green light--

350
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,711
I mean, every single light
that we hit--

351
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,313
sheew-- green.

352
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,817
When does that happen?

353
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,154
Just like bang, bang,

354
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,524
green the entire way.

355
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,326
And the whole time,
all I could think about

356
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,764
was "Why today? Why?

357
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,768
"Why can't I just spend
a few extra minutes

358
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,637
in the car with my family?"

359
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,743
I never wanted to be stuck
in traffic so bad in my life.

360
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:36,580
At least I was with my family.

361
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,951
I had that.

362
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:50,227
Anyway, I survived this place.

363
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,898
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

364
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,061
Yes?

365
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,632
I was going to ask you
the same question.

366
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,936
<i>I heard they they
attacked a DEA agent.</i>

367
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,204
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

368
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:41,545
I didn't order this,

369
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,714
and my men would never
do this on their own.

370
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:46,350
Someone gave the go-ahead.

371
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,052
<i>Are you
accusing me?</i>

372
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:52,322
I'm just saying they
wouldn't act on their own.

373
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:55,559
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

374
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:57,327
I assume

375
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:59,363
<i>that the next shipment
will be delayed.</i>

376
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,331
<i>Any thoughts on when
it might arrive?</i>

377
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:03,367
A week, a month.

378
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,268
There's too much
focus on the border.

379
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:07,337
We lay low for the time being.

380
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:08,772
We lay low,

381
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:11,308
and then we get the real story
from my man who survived.

382
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,844
Your man is in custody.

383
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,180
He's innocent
until proven guilty.

384
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:18,248
Correct?

385
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,283
I'll get him the best lawyer,

386
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:22,586
<i>and then
we'll learn the truth.</i>

387
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,588
Well, keep me apprised.

388
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:31,695
Any time you've got that close
proximity to the spine,

389
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,363
there's always going
to be cause for concern,

390
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,032
but, as I say,

391
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,700
it's really too soon to tell.

392
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,603
He's out of surgery,
at least, which is--

393
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:41,872
Out of surgery,
on his way to revery.

394
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,473
All right.
Where's that?

395
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,342
Unfortunately,
you can't see him just yet.

396
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,644
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

397
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:49,946
How long will that take?

398
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:51,748
I can't really say.

399
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,450
Could be hours,

400
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:56,453
but we'll let you know just
as soon as you could see him.

401
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,089
Thank you.

402
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,231
Um, maybe we should get
you home for a couple hours?

403
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,901
Get some rest?

404
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,536
I'm not going anywhere.

405
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:16,073
Me, neither.

406
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:25,215
Well, is anyone else dying
to brush their teeth,

407
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:26,616
or is it just me?

408
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:30,120
What if I ran over to the house

409
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,555
and picked up a few things?

410
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:34,357
Marie? I could
swing by your place.

411
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,892
That would be great.

412
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:36,993
Thanks, Walt.

413
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:40,731
Okay.

414
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:50,841
<i>Dr. Bender?</i>

415
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,175
<i>Dr. Bender.</i>

416
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:58,081
Walt. Walt.

417
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:00,383
We just heard he came through?

418
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:04,421
Yeah, well, it's, uh,
you know, guardedly good news.

419
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:06,356
Thank God.
I'll take it. Yeah.

420
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,458
Hey, guys, this is
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

421
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:09,459
Hi.

422
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:10,627
Hello.
Hi.

423
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:13,630
We were just swapping
Hank stories.

424
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:15,732
Oh, well, that could--
that could go on all day.

425
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:17,901
God knows,
there's a million of them.

426
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,737
Meanwhile...

427
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:23,039
Miserable piece of shit.

428
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:24,441
Guy who shot him,

429
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,109
the one that's left,
he's up there,

430
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:27,644
got the painkillers going on,

431
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:28,745
resting comfortably.

432
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,580
Your tax dollars at work.

433
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:34,918
You ought to see what
Hank did to that bastard.

434
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:36,119
Want to see?

435
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:39,256
Come on, let me show you.

436
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:45,428
We can do this?

437
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,180
You comfortable,
you piece of shit?

438
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:02,205
You got him?
Yeah.

439
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
Come on.

440
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,743
Easy, easy.

441
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,773
Whoa!

442
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:19,912
Oh! Oh!

443
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,166
Come on.

444
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,234
Oh.

445
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:43,769
No.

446
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:45,470
No.

447
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:46,672
Ho!

448
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:48,206
Ho!

449
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,242
Ouch.

450
00:28:56,783 --> 00:28:58,650
♪ Fallacies ♪

451
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,986

452
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,389

454
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:55,173
Finally. About damn time.

455
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:09,154
Why isn't there
anything cooking?

456
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:30,275
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

457
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,811
<i>Operator.
This is Walter White.</i>

458
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:34,446
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

459
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,886
<i>Yo, we got problems, big ones.</i>

460
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,455
Reverend,
so nice of you to call...

461
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:44,690
Again.

462
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:46,258
Turn your phone on already.

463
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,494
<i>You know, I will
definitely look into that.</i>

464
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:53,699
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone.

465
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:55,167
Okay?

466
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,770
I told you to wait.

467
00:30:58,805 --> 00:31:00,772
I don't know how many
more ways I could say it.

468
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,741
<i>Yeah, damn, I was waiting,</i>

469
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:05,644
<i>and then that creepy,
quiet guy showed up.</i>

470
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,479
Gus came by?

471
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:08,914
Not him, man.

472
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:11,016
Apparently I'm not worthy
of meeting him.

473
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,952
It was the other one, the one
that I'm qualified to speak to.

474
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:15,554
Then he started asking
questions, too,

475
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:17,989
<i>like why
I haven't cooked anything.</i>

476
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:19,591
<i>We have a quota.</i>

477
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,660
It's due tomorrow.

478
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:23,495
Do you seriously not care,
or what?

479
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,732
<i>Because that guy, he's got,
like, the dead eyes.</i>

480
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:28,133
Let me ask you something.

481
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:30,969
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

482
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:34,306
Oh, you mean when he put
a machinegun to my head?

483
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,275
Yeah, I think that does ring
a tiny bell. Why?

484
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,277
No. He kept-- He kept saying

485
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:41,546
that-- that someone

486
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:43,782
was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

487
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:46,284
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

488
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,120
<i>What the hell has
this even got to do with--</i>

489
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:51,022
Look, I don't know.
It was, um--

490
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,225
<i>uh...</i>

491
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,994
His cousins.

492
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:59,464
Right, Jesse?
It was his cousins.

493
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:02,033
Yeah, cousins.

494
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:03,735
Whatever, man. Why?

495
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,489
Any news?

496
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:25,957
No change.

497
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:31,897
Okay. Well, I--

498
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,766
I didn't know whose
toothbrushes were whose, so I--

499
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:37,869
I just stopped
by the drugstore.

500
00:32:37,904 --> 00:32:41,540
Thank God
for travel sizes, right?

501
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,342
Thank you.
Yeah.

502
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:51,049
Oh, I think I'm going
to go wash my face.

503
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:54,586
I'm going crazy.

504
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,188
Do you want to come?

505
00:32:56,222 --> 00:32:58,323
Yeah.

506
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:15,674
I got candy bars.

507
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,577
Oh, um--

508
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:22,781
Is this what
you were asking for?

509
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,983
Yeah.
Yeah?

510
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:28,353
Yeah, I--
I skimmed through it.

511
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:29,721
Looks interesting.

512
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:30,922
Yeah.

513
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:34,292
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

514
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,831
What's it about?

515
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:44,402
Pablo Escobar,

516
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,905
this big drug guy in the '80s.

517
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,142
Yeah. Yeah, I remember
seeing him on the news.

518
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:56,314
Well, it's more about
the guys who investigated him

519
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,017
and tried to bring him down.

520
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:02,120
Some of them were DEA,
you know?

521
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:07,559
Uncle Hank said that they
were worth learning about,

522
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:10,862
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

523
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,832
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

524
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,303
I guess I never thought
about it.

525
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:25,477
He said that good guys

526
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,779
never get ink
like the bad guys do.

527
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,824
So he gave it to me.

528
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,826
Figured I'd read it.

529
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:58,810
Uh, I-- I need to--

530
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:00,779
I'll be right back, okay?

531
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:10,155
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

532
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:12,357
Absolutely.

533
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:16,428
<i>So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.</i>

534
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,763
Well, uh--

535
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:20,532
No. Unfortunately--

536
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:24,336
<i>Unfortunately,
we're not going to be able</i>

537
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,571
to keep our schedule this week.

538
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,107
But not for lack of trying.

539
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:31,242
Is there something
I should know?

540
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:36,214
Well, to be completely
honest with you...

541
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:38,783
Gale really screwed us up.

542
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:40,652
I mean, not on purpose,
of course,

543
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:42,988
but he just--
he set us way back,

544
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:47,025
and we've been playing
catch-up ever since.

545
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:51,062
<i>And I've had to be out
running errands</i>

546
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:53,898
<i>and trying to keep us
on target.</i>

547
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,634
Some of the equipment

548
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:58,403
wasn't calibrated
correctly and--

549
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:01,639
Well, it's just all
very technical and boring,

550
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:04,876
but rest assured that--

551
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,245
that we will
do whatever it takes.

552
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,848
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

553
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:12,083
<i>We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.</i>

554
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:16,454
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

555
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,560
I have your word on that?

556
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,895
You do.

557
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:27,565
You have my word on that.

558
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,134
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

559
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,229
Any news?

560
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:02,167
Nah, I'm just-- just wandering.

561
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,202
How's everybody doing?

562
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,872
Well, as well
as can be expected.

563
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:11,142
It's this not knowing

564
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,044
that's the hardest part,
I think.

565
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,582
Anything new on these guys?

566
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:19,617
Who they are?
What they wanted?

567
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:21,786
No, nothing yet,

568
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:23,788
but we'll get it.

569
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,160
Steve...

570
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,364
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

571
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:38,570
Buddy, nobody's getting
to Hank.

572
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:41,005
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

573
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,874
So, no.

574
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:46,377
No way.

575
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:48,880
Jesus.

576
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:50,615
I'd love to walk in there

577
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:52,617
and shoot that bastard
right in the head.

578
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:54,052
Me, too.

579
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:03,661
Yeah.

580
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,264
Oh, yeah?

581
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:09,000
Great. We'll be right down.

582
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,635
Food's here.

583
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:12,470
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

584
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:17,408
Uh, on occasion, yeah.

585
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:19,310
Owner's a big booster
for the DEA.

586
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:22,580
He heard what happened.
He's going to feed every cop in the building.

587
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:25,783
That's-- That's wonderful.

588
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:28,553
Yeah, and apparently he's
bringing it by personally.

589
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:37,810
I don't even
know what to say.

590
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:38,877
That's an incredible--

591
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:40,179
Good, huh?

592
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:41,647
Delicious.

593
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,850
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

594
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:46,351
Yes, thank you.

595
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:47,519
Guys, did you hear that?

596
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:50,222
Mr. Fring is offering
a $10,000 reward

597
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:52,224
on any information
about the case.

598
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:55,828
Well, that's--
that's wonderful.

599
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:58,397
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Fring.

600
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:00,232
You're very welcome.

601
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,301
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

602
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:04,436
between us and these animals.

603
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:06,572
I only wish I could do more.

604
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:13,645
Well, we do appreciate
your support.

605
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,181
This reward could turn
the tide here.

606
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:18,884
It'll really help.

607
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:22,354
Again, I can't express
how sorry I am.

608
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,656
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

609
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,792
Really?

610
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:30,028
Our fun run,
a couple months ago.

611
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,432
Mr. Fring
was one of our sponsors.

612
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:37,269
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

613
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:41,006
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

614
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,778
Really? Huh.

615
00:39:46,813 --> 00:39:50,315
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

616
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,151
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

617
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,621
I hope that there's been
good news.

618
00:39:57,457 --> 00:40:01,493
Uh, yeah, things
have improved, yes.

619
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:03,795
That's wonderful to hear.

620
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,366
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

621
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:13,572
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

622
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:17,976
Um... thank you
again very much.

623
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:19,478
It was a great pleasure
to meet you.

624
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,647
- Thank you. 
- Yes, thank you.

625
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,084
Let me walk you out.
Oh-- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

626
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:36,028
You know,
I didn't say thank you.

627
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:37,162
I'll walk him out.

628
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:38,664
I'll be right back.

629
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,635
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

630
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,304
Enjoying the chicken?

631
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:47,339
Good. Good-- Hey.

632
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,608
Oh, you're very welcome.
My pleasure.

633
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:51,243
My pleasure, yeah.
Excuse me.

634
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:52,844
Thank you. Thank you.

635
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:54,413
It's good chicken, huh?
Yeah.

636
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:55,714
Good.
Mr. Fring.

637
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,282
May I--
Mr. White.

638
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:59,084
I just wanted
to thank you again.

639
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:00,586
Oh, it's my pleasure.

640
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,955
Uh, may I--
may I speak with you?

641
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,323
Just a moment?

642
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:11,129
You knew.

643
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:13,699
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

644
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:18,070
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

645
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:20,939
What careful man wouldn't?

646
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,875
He is not a problem for us,

647
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,944
for our business.

648
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:32,150
Your being here is--

649
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:35,754
Is this some sort of message?

650
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,156
I'm supporting my community.

651
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,993
I hide in plain sight,
same as you.

652
00:41:41,027 --> 00:41:42,227
Are we done?

653
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,261
No-- No, listen, I--

654
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:44,630
This attack
on my brother-in-law--

655
00:41:44,664 --> 00:41:46,765
I don't--
I don't understand it.

656
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:48,667
I don't know what it means.

657
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:52,938
Please, if you have
some knowledge

658
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:54,506
that you could share with me.

659
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:02,648
I fear for my family.

660
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:03,782
I'm sure they'll be fine.

661
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:06,351
I am told the assassin
that survived

662
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:07,853
is gravely injured.

663
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,655
It's doubtful he'll live.

664
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:15,594
Now thank me and shake my hand.

665
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:22,501
Uh-- thank you.
Thank you again.

666
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,536
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

667
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:38,216
What's going on?

668
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,018
What's happening?

669
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:41,053
Starting chest compressions.

670
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:42,788
One, two, three, four.

671
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:45,724
One, two, three--
 Defib?

672
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:47,259
No reason.
Patient is--

673
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,261
Continuing chest compressions.

674
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:51,029
One, two, three, four.

675
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,398
Give me a liter of saline wide open.
I can't get a pulse back.

676
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,100
One, two, three, four.

677
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,635
Still nothing.
One, two, three--

678
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:58,637
All right.
Stopping compressions.

679
00:42:58,671 --> 00:42:59,905
Time.

680
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:01,239
8:43.

681
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,141
Time of death. 20:43.

682
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,546
Burn in hell,
you piece of shit.

683
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,074
Yes? Juan?

684
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:38,143
<i>I assume you heard the news.</i>

685
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:41,046
Your man died.
I heard.

686
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,180
It's unfortunate.

687
00:43:42,215 --> 00:43:43,548
<i>Yeah, "unfortunate,"</i>

688
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,618
<i>and meanwhile I have Federales
surrounding my house.</i>

689
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,954
You know what I think, Gustavo?

690
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:50,455
I think you're behind all this.

691
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,259
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

692
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,228
<i>That's the part I'm trying
to figure out.</i>

693
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:59,364
Go off on your own, maybe.

694
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:00,966
Would you actually think
that would work?

695
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,035
<i>Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

696
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,403
<i>Maybe you should call me back</i>

697
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:06,872
when you're seeing things
more clearly.

698
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:08,740
I see things clear enough.

699
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:12,444
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

700
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:14,646
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

701
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,649
<i>and I wind up with Federales
in my rose bushes.</i>

702
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:19,451
<i>But just for a while.</i>

703
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:23,922
Appearances, politics.

704
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,991
<i>Are you still there,
Gustavo?</i>

705
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:29,127
Yes, I'm here.

706
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:31,830
<i>I'll weather this.
I always do.</i>

707
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:33,732
My brother's a police chief.

708
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:36,334
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

709
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:38,770
And when I get proof

710
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:42,174
and the others find out
what you've done,

711
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,043
maybe we come pay you a visit.

712
00:44:45,077 --> 00:44:47,345
<i>Maybe we c--

713
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,061
Skyler. Skyler.

714
00:45:36,095 --> 00:45:37,863
Marie. Marie.

715
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:41,967
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

716
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:44,970
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

717
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:47,739
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediately family only.

718
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:49,007
We're all family.

719
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,308
I understand,

720
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:52,644
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need--

721
00:45:52,678 --> 00:45:55,280
We're all family.

722
00:46:10,326 --> 00:46:20,326
