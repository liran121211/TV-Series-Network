3
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:33,615
Surprised he doesn't make
us do that.

4
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:39,386
The pack totally
has a pecking order.

5
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:43,423
And the head Hyena,
he's the man.

6
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,859
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

7
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:48,394
I mean, literally.
It's so gross.

8
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,864
They have to lick his jerk.

9
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:55,201
I-I-I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

10
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:01,301
Yo, if this is supposed
to be all, like,

11
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:03,469
Major League and all,

12
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,005
we should have equipment
maintainer guys.

13
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:14,375
And water boys.
You know?

14
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,643
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

15
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:22,080
Get us a couple flunkies
in here.

16
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:23,614
Treat us right.

17
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:37,191
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

18
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,860
I'm going to hit it,
if that's cool with you.

19
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:42,494
I don't understand.

20
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:43,828
What?

21
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,730
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

22
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:48,432
Told you.
Dude's totally boning us.

23
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,300
No, it's not that.

24
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,935
It's our output.
We're off.

25
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,337
We're .14% off.

26
00:03:56,371 --> 00:04:00,673
Point one-four,
that's what, like--

27
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,140
What does that mean?

28
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,976
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

29
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:11,114
So how far off are we?

30
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,815
It's not negligible.

31
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:19,220
Ball-parking it, I'd say we're
quarter to a half a pound shy.

32
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:24,390
That's weird.

33
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,992
What about spillage?

34
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,327
Spillage?

35
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,662
Yeah, you know, like,
just stuff gets spilled.

36
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:32,731
Nothing gets spilled.

37
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:34,165
A little maybe.

38
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,933
Nothing gets spilled.

39
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:39,437
What about evaporation?

40
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:40,805
It wouldn't account
for this much.

41
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,041
The materials aren't out
that long.

42
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,909
What about the other one?

43
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,912
The drops, like on--

44
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,147
on that, like, cold beer.

45
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,482
Condensation?

46
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,716
Yeah.

47
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,352
No.

48
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,858
What about the crap
that gets left behind,

49
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,958
you know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats?

50
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:05,460
I add up, like, a gallon each.

51
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:08,062
Did you work that in?

52
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,963
Vestiges?

53
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:11,865
Yeah. Vestiges.

54
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:17,670
Bet that's it.

55
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:20,105
Bet that's totally it.

56
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,443
Hey, Mr. White.

57
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,545
Mr. White.
Huh?

58
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,949
Are you okay?

59
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,817
Yeah-- Yeah, why?

60
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,388
Nothing.

61
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:51,765
Are you coming?

62
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,733
Yeah, in a minute.

63
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,970
All right, see you tomorrow.

64
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,227
All right.

65
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,892
Shit.

66
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:12,125
You bastard.

67
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,201
Son of a--

68
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,581
Come on, you--

69
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:43,349
Come on, come on.

70
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:49,620
Son of a--

71
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,830
Okay.

72
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,710
Son of a bitch.

73
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:22,314
Oh!

74
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,961
That's great.

75
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,346
All right.

76
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,635
You little bastard.

77
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:13,560
Shut the door!

78
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,161
My ears are popping.

79
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,496
Shut the door.
Move.

80
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,631
It's like
I'm on an airplane, yo.

81
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:20,665
What the hell's doing that?

82
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:21,799
Positive pressure.

83
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,235
Positive what?

84
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,903
God, friggin' kills, yo.

85
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,905
Well, just move your jaw around.
Move it around.

86
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,540
I am moving it around.
It's not working.

87
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:32,942
Then just yawn or something.
Stop acting like such a baby.

88
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,578
Damn.

89
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,080
W-W-What positive?
Positive what?

90
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,048
Pressure. I've turned
the ventilation up

91
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,584
to keep the outside out.

92
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,953
There's been a contamination.

93
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:49,290
Wait. What?

94
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,458
Whoa whoa whoa, hey, hold up.

95
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,794
Something got into the lab.

96
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:56,430
So what do we do?

97
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,765
I mean, do we--

98
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,235
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't
we be wearing masks?

99
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,507
No, no, it's not that--
that kind of contaminant.

100
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,343
So it's, like, not dangerous?

101
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:11,013
Mr. White,
talk to me here.

102
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,249
Not to us particularly. No.

103
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,385
What the hell is that?

104
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:21,389
This is, uh-- I made it.

105
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:27,726
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

106
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,732
A fly.

107
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,241
What do you mean?

108
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:41,043
A fly, like--
like what do you mean?

109
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:44,145
I mean a fly, a house fly.

110
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,483
Like, uh, one fly?

111
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:53,286
Singular?
What did it do?

112
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,621
It got into the lab,
and I'm trying to get it out.

113
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:57,323
Okay? Understand?

114
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,691
No, man, not really.

115
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:03,894
I can't say that I'm
really following you here.

116
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,796
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

117
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,032
I mean, when you say
it's contamination,

118
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,037
I mean, I'm thinking, like
an Ebola leak or something.

119
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,471
Ebola?

120
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,839
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel,

121
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:16,940
where all your intestines

122
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:18,909
sort of just slip
right out of your butt.

123
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,377
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Uh-huh.

124
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:24,080
Now, tell me.
What would a West-African virus

125
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,648
be doing in our lab?

126
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,150
Hmm?

127
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:30,019
So you're chasing around a fly,

128
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:34,024
and in your world
I'm the idiot.

129
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,728
Jesse, listen.

130
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,364
This fly-- any fly--

131
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,931
cannot be in our lab.

132
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,398
It's-- It's a problem.

133
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,864
It's a contamination,

134
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,198
and that is in no way
a misuse of the word.

135
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,332
Okay?

136
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:51,969
So in terms of keeping
our cook clean

137
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,237
and our product unadulterated,

138
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,806
we need to take this.

139
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,340
Now do you understand?

140
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,577
So is that your fly saber?

141
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,784
This is a swatter.

142
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,053
It happens to work quite well,
thank you.

143
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:14,057
Uh-huh. Hey,
what happened to your head?

144
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,859
Nothing. I'm fine.

145
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,794
You didn't hit it,
like really-- really hard?

146
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:20,962
My head is not the problem,
Jesse.

147
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,198
The fly is the problem.

148
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,203
You didn't happen to maybe...

149
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:31,306
try our product, did you?

150
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,840
Jess I know this seems
unusual to you, a layman.

151
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,643
A fly-- I get it--
seems insignificant, right?

152
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,977
But trust me.

153
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,446
In a highly controlled
environment such as this--

154
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,985
...anyollutant--

155
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,655
...no matter how small--

156
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,260
...could completely--

157
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,873
Hello.

158
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:16,710
What?

159
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:23,215
Were you here all night?

160
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,984
Have you even slept?

161
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:28,020
No. Jesse, look.
I'm fine. Okay

162
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,120
Will you just please focus--

163
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,096
Okay, look. We're running late,
so let's just get started.

164
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:40,632
Shall we? The sooner we do
it, the sooner we're done.

165
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,735
Frickin' finally.

166
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,340
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

167
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,108
What are you doing?

168
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:52,410
It's time to alkaline.

169
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:55,379
Have you not heard
a word I said?

170
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,783
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

171
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:01,519
Have I been speaking to self?

172
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,988
The mer went off, yo.

173
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,824
How long is this batch going to be good for?
An hour? Two?

174
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,126
The batch will be good
for nothing

175
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,295
if we don't clear
the contaminant.

176
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,264
Clear the contaminant?

177
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,098
We're making meth here,

178
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,533
not space shuttles.

179
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,802
We're making nothing
until we catch this fly.

180
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,070
What fly?

181
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,274
Where the hell is this fly?

182
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:25,774
Not like I've even seen
the thing.

183
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,576
Maybe your positive pressure blew
it out the door or something.

184
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:32,147
No, no. It is here.
It is around. Okay?

185
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:34,683
He's around,
and am not going to expose

186
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:37,987
this batch to the open air
and contamination.

187
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:41,523
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself, or you can help me,

188
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:42,690
but you are right.

189
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,158
We are running out of time,

190
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,990
so I need your answer
right now.

191
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,031
Okay.

192
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,875
Hey, tick-tock. Yo.

193
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,518
Look, I like making cherry
products, but let's keep it real.

194
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,786
All right, we make poison

195
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,021
for people who don't care.

196
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,923
We probably have the most
UN-picky customers in the world.

197
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,558
No, no, no, no, no.
No rationalizing.

198
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,060
We'll find it any minute now.
Don't give up.

199
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:46,608
Did you--

200
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:50,646
Did you know that there's an
acceptable level of rat turds

201
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,549
that can go into candy bars?

202
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,552
That's the government, Jack.

203
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,988
Even the government

204
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,125
doesn't care that much
about quality.

205
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:10,565
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs? Huh?

206
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,069
Pig lips and assholes,

207
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:17,505
but I say, hey,
have at it, bastard,

208
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,009
because I love hotdogs,

209
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:23,712
and, you know,
see what I'm--

210
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:24,979
What are you doing?

211
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:26,948
Oh. Hey.

212
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,687
Look, let me just top it off,

213
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,389
all right, really quick.

214
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,725
A little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid,

215
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,325
No harm done.
Then we're golden.

216
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,599
It stays closed.
That's an order.

217
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,967
You can't order shit,
Adolf.

218
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,672
We're 50-50 partners.
Remember?

219
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:58,445
Ow!

220
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,182
God, what is your problem,
bro?

221
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:04,751
Freakin' psycho.

222
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,486
Jesse.

223
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,288
Oh, God, it, like, hit bone.

224
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,655
Jesse.

225
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,424
Jesse.

226
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,228
You see it, right?

227
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:21,097
You see it?

228
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,399
Yeah.

229
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,103
Get it.

230
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,473
You want me to get it?

231
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:33,242
Yes.

232
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:38,613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow.

233
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,682
Move slowly.

234
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:41,883
I know.

235
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,884
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

236
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,087
Absolutely. I'm just going
to need your swatter thing.

237
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:53,359
Yeah. Come on.

238
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,095
Oh, yeah.
It's okay, come on.

239
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,598
Come on.
Make it count.

240
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,799
Yeah, no, no,
I'm gonna--

241
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,568
I'm going to make it count,
all right.

242
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,071
Ok. Now.

243
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,605
On three.

244
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,206
Okay.

245
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,508
One--

246
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,276
Ow!

247
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,377
Yeah. You like that?

248
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,778
Hurts, huh?

249
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,582
Did you get it?

250
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:25,351
I think so, yeah.
Where is it?

251
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,386
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

252
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,387
Who cares?
I got it.

253
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:31,055
Oh, Jesus, seriously?

254
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,491
Where is it?

255
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,061
It's, uh, right there.
Look.

256
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,498
Look. See?
I told you I got it.

257
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,711
This is a raisin.

258
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:55,415
Look, I definitely got it, man.

259
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,017
All right--

260
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,954
Oh, man.

261
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:03,289
He's got some skills, yo.

262
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:05,358
I'll give him that.

263
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:09,430
Look...

264
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:13,835
I feel like I'm running out of
ways to explain this to you,

265
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,472
but once more I shall try.

266
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:21,477
This fly is a major problem
for us.

267
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:24,147
It will ruin our batch.

268
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,183
Now, we need to destroy it

269
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:30,321
and every trace of it
so we can cook.

270
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,189
Failing that...

271
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,660
we're dead.

272
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,734
There is no more room
for error.

273
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,438
Not with these people.

274
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,277
All right,
how about we go get some air?

275
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,214
Get some air?

276
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:59,118
Your answer to "We're sliding
head-first into a massive crap--"

277
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:00,820
Mister-- Mr. White,

278
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:04,158
I understand that
the fly is a serious thing.

279
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,660
Now, all right?
I'm on board.

280
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:09,030
I'm just saying maybe
if we went and got some air,

281
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,998
it would help us
come up with a plan

282
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,563
on how to catch it.

283
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,196
Then come back down here

284
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,396
and subtract his ass.

285
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,373
Oh, wait,
do you have your keys?

286
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:40,942
Yeah.
You're sure?

287
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:42,877
Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

288
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,179
Yeah.

289
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:46,614
Hey!

290
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,883
If you're not going to help me,
stay out of my way!

291
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,252
Hey!

292
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,359
Yo. Yo, does somebody have
an ax I can use?

293
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:00,893
El ax-o!

294
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:02,595
<i>Peligroso! El ax-o!</i>

295
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,351
There we go.

296
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,723
Say good night.

297
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:46,626
Son of a bitch!

298
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:53,365
Son of a...

299
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,935
Shit! Damn it!

300
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,906
Where in the hell is that...

301
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,756
What the hell?

302
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:27,696
Need some juice maybe?

303
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:31,048
<i>Knock yourself out.</i>

304
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:35,634
It's a real one.
Yeah, like yours was working.

305
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:37,602
No, no...

306
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:41,438
No, no-- Look, we're trying
to decontaminate.

307
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:44,340
You don't decontaminate
by contaminating further.

308
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,808
What the hell is all this?

309
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:51,046
Here, how about this?

310
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,948
"Nontoxic glue strips."

311
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,983
Yeah, baby,
it's got pheromones.

312
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:58,151
I got a buttload.
We hang them up all over the place.

313
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,019
It won't be able to resist.

314
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,960
I sure hope we have enough.

315
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:11,663
I'm going to go out
on a limb and say yeah.

316
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,833
Do you see him?

317
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:19,639
How long do you think
you've been awake?

318
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:21,674
Why do you keep asking me that?

319
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,510
Just figure you could use
some coffee, is all.

320
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,479
I know I could.

321
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:28,580
How about it?

322
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,616
Yeah.

323
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,754
You take cream and sugar?

324
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:36,955
Black is fine.

325
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:52,637
Why don't you
just leave him be?

326
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:55,040
Let the traps do the work.

327
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:58,311
These pheromones
are supposed to kick ass.

328
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,216
I bet we catch this mo-fo
any second.

329
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:19,930
Thank you.

330
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:23,800
You ever have, like,
a wild animal

331
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,535
trapped our house?

332
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:32,509
Not that I can recall, no.

333
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:35,846
We did, this one time,

334
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,714
back when it was
my aunt's house,

335
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:42,019
back before she died of cancer.

336
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:46,822
Possum.
Big, freaky-looking bitch.

337
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:50,859
Hey, since when did they change it to "opossum"?
What's up with that?

338
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,228
I mean, when I was coming up,

339
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,230
it was just "possum."

340
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:58,103
"Opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

341
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:01,373
Why they gotta go changing
everything?

342
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:04,275
Whatever. They're just
big rats anyways,

343
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:05,776
giant pink-tailed rats

344
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,311
with their pink rat faces,

345
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,180
totally freaky,

346
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,482
like alien rats.

347
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:18,422
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

348
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:22,793
but he was living there
under the house.

349
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,163
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room,

350
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,399
always scurrying around.

351
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:31,568
Sometimes I'd see him
outside at night,

352
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:34,838
and he would just,
you know, freeze.

353
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:38,375
And it's like you're not
looking right at it. Right?

354
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,344
I mean, it thinks
it's fooling you.

355
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:45,081
That's what they do.
They play dead or whatever.

356
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,417
It's just so lame.

357
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:52,888
Is there a discernible point
to this story,

358
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,757
a point that
you'll be arriving at

359
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:59,060
sometime in the near future?

360
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,998
It was just a total bitch
to get out. It took forever.

361
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:07,602
A guy came,
set all these traps and all,

362
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,771
and he finally got it,

363
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:11,639
but my aunt,

364
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:15,309
she didn't believe it.

365
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:19,647
She kept insisting she
could still hear the thing.

366
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,850
I mean, you could not
tell her any different.

367
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,852
She started keeping
an old umbrella

368
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:27,287
by her chair.

369
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:30,357
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it,

370
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:33,093
even gave it a name.

371
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:35,195
It was, uh, Sc--

372
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:37,097
Scrabble.

373
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,498
Yeah, that was it.

374
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,334
"Scrabble, just knock it off."
Bang, bang, bang.

375
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:47,974
She got like that
toward the end.

376
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:52,545
Got obsessive about stuff,

377
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,583
just got mad about stuff.

378
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,485
We didn't know what was up.

379
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,089
It wasn't like her
to be that way.

380
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,495
But it turned out
that the--

381
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,899
the cancer had spread
to her brain,

382
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:15,935
and that was why.

383
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:18,771
It metastasized.

384
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:25,745
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor

385
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:30,783
because then we knew
what was up

386
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:33,653
and got her some treatment

387
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:36,289
and meds so she wasn't
stressing all the time.

388
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:44,830
It was a lot better after that.

389
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:47,533
She was a lot happier.

390
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:57,409
Where the hell is he?

391
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,523
I've been to my oncologist,
Jesse, just last week.

392
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:16,695
I'm still in remission.

393
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,031
I'm healthy.

394
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:24,102
Okay, so good.
Great.

395
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:30,475
Well, no end in sight.

396
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:40,452
Well, I missed it.

397
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:51,028
There was some perfect moment,

398
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:53,030
and it passed me right by.

399
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,304
Yeah, I had to have enough
to leave them.

400
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:03,374
That was the whole point.

401
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:07,612
None of this makes any sense

402
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,115
if I didn't have enough.

403
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:17,022
But it had to be before
she found out... Skyler.

404
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:19,324
It had to be before that.

405
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:22,694
Perfect moment...

406
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:25,597
For what?

407
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,599
To drop dead?

408
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,369
What, are you saying
you want to die?

409
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,643
I'm saying I've lived too long.

410
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:44,550
You want them
to actually miss you.

411
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,986
You know?

412
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,422
You want their memories of you

413
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:51,291
to be--

414
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:57,565
But she just won't understand.

415
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,567
She just--

416
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:04,507
No matter how well
I explain it,

417
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,644
these days
she just has this--

418
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:11,348
this--

419
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:12,650
I mean, I truly believe

420
00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:15,854
there exists
some combination of words.

421
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:18,056
There must exist

422
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:19,224
certain words

423
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,462
in a certain, specific order

424
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,264
that would explain all of this,

425
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:28,102
but with her I just--

426
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,206
I just can't ever seem
to find them.

427
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,675
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

428
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,679
I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

429
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:38,848
but before the fugue state

430
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:40,216
they didn't have enough money,

431
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,685
so no, not then.

432
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:56,566
And plus my daughter
wasn't born yet.

433
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,402
It had to be
Afr Holly was born.

434
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,070
Mr. White--

435
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,272
Definitely before the surgery.

436
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:08,511
Oh, Christ.

437
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:10,613
That damn second cell one.

438
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,515
How could I possibly...

439
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:25,461
Ah, I know the moment.

440
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,902
It was the night Jane died.

441
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:48,948
And we needed diapers,
and so I said I'd go,

442
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:51,747
but it was just an excuse.

443
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,548
Actually, that was
the night I--

444
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:56,380
I brought you your money,
remember?

445
00:33:56,415 --> 00:33:59,947
Yeah, I remember.

446
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:04,280
But afterward I stopped
at a bar.

447
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:09,279
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

448
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,047
I just walked in, sat down.

449
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:19,753
I never told you.

450
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:21,688
That you went to a bar?

451
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:32,097
I sit down, and this man,
this stranger,

452
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:34,932
he engages me in conversation.

453
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,601
Now, he's a complete stranger.

454
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:42,873
But he turns out
to be Jane's father,

455
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:46,043
Donald Margolis.

456
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,678
What are you talking about?

457
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:50,515
Of course I didn't know it
at the time.

458
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,651
I mean, it was just some guy
in a bar.

459
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:56,621
Didn't put it together
until after the crash

460
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:57,889
when he was all over the news.

461
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:00,559
Jane's dad.

462
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:03,929
I mean, think of the odds.

463
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:05,531
Once I tried to calculate them,

464
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:07,800
but they're astronomical.

465
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:10,403
I mean, think of the odds

466
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:12,336
of me going in, sitting down

467
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,733
that night in that bar

468
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:16,268
next to that man.

469
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,371
What did you talk about?

470
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:28,843
Oh, water on Mars.

471
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,947
Family.

472
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,117
What about family?

473
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:43,654
I told him
that I had a daughter,

474
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:47,557
and he told me he had one, too.

475
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:51,960
Then he said,
"Never give up on family."

476
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,630
And I didn't.

477
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,967
I-- I took his advice.

478
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,841
The universe is random.

479
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,775
It's not inevitable.

480
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,811
It's simple chaos.

481
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:27,881
It's subatomic particles
in endless, aimless collision.

482
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:30,317
That's what science teaches us,

483
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:33,052
but what is this saying?

484
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:36,622
What is it telling us,

485
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:37,889
when on the very night

486
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:42,527
that this man's daughter dies,

487
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:46,231
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

488
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,769
How can that be random?

489
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:53,704
Hey, listen, Mr. White.
Hey--

490
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:55,707
Hey, sit down.

491
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,175
No-- No.

492
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,780
No, it's--

493
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,851
Oh.

494
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:05,652
Oh.

495
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:12,660
No, that--
that was the moment.

496
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:16,464
That night.

497
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,938
I should never have left home.

498
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,278
Never gone to your house.

499
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,518
Maybe things would have--

500
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,993
Oh, thought I was--

501
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:49,037
I was at home watching TV.

502
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:53,580
Some--

503
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:57,622
Some nature program
about elephants.

504
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:02,867
Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

505
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,578
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

506
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:14,585
She was singing a lullaby.

507
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,159
Ah--

508
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:29,233
If had just lived
right up to that moment

509
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,268
and not one second more--

510
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:47,083
...that would've been perfect.

511
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,471
He's not coming down.

512
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:06,275
Must be Thailand-hot
up there.

513
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,611
That's why he likes it.

514
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:13,716
Thailand's hot, right?

515
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,984
Yeah.

516
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:18,590
See? That's why.

517
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,028
Oh, Jesus.

518
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,464
Hey, wait.

519
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:23,501
Here.

520
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:39,882
He's not coming down.

521
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,092
He's staying up there forever.

522
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:11,787
What are you--
What are you doing?

523
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:14,787
What do you think?
I'm going to get that bitch.

524
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,356
Uh...

525
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:22,692
No, you're going to break
your neck.

526
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:24,693
Yeah, yeah. Just--

527
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:29,697
No, seriously, you're--
This is a bad idea.

528
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:32,366
Damn it.

529
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:35,102
Jesse.

530
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,436
Just hold onto it.

531
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,571
Hold it still?

532
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,418
Jesse.

533
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:00,723
I'm sorry.

534
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,458
Sorry for what?

535
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:03,626
Being a lunatic?

536
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,665
I'm sorry about Jane.

537
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,443
Yeah. Me, too.

538
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,482
No, I mean, uh--

539
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,288
I'm very sorry.

540
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,095
It's not your fault.

541
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,366
But it's not mine either.

542
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,501
It's no one's fault,

543
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:47,436
not even hers.

544
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,835
Sucker's just sitting there.

545
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,841
We are who we are, Mr. White.

546
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:05,510
You know, just two junkies

547
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:08,613
with a duffel bag full of cash.

548
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:10,249
Like you said,

549
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:12,218
we both would've been dead
within a week.

550
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:15,720
But I miss her, though.

551
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:21,859
God, I do.

552
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:34,035
Jesse, come down.

553
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:37,371
Wait, I am so close.

554
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:42,840
Let it go.

555
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:44,375
We need to cook.

556
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:47,244
What about the contamination?

557
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:50,814
It's all contaminated.

558
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:01,525
I definitely scared him.

559
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:06,163
Probably stay out of our way--

560
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:12,435
God.

561
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:38,367
Yeah!

562
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:42,004
Zap! Somebody got got, yo!

563
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,072
You see that, Mister--

564
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:32,823
Bins are packed?

565
00:44:32,857 --> 00:44:34,891
Bins are packed.

566
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:38,195
How's the yield?

567
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:41,498
Two-oh-two and change.

568
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:43,166
You okay getting home?

569
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,602
Yeah. Better.

570
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:46,770
Thanks.

571
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:48,471
<i>Mañana, then.</i>

572
00:45:03,387 --> 00:45:06,355
Jesse, come here.

573
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,626
I couldn't chance
saying it inside.

574
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:14,862
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

575
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:21,968
That half a pound
that I said we're off by--

576
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:25,404
Now, I'm not accusing you,
but if...

577
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:27,606
You understand?

578
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,708
And if they
ever found out--

579
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:35,747
I didn't take shit.

580
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:44,289
I'm just saying that I won't
be able to protect you.

581
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:47,960
Who's asking you to?

582
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:58,645
