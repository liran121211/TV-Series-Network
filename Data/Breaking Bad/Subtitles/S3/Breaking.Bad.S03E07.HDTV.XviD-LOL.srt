1
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:29,857
Mmm.

<font color="#EC14BD">www. addic7ed. com</font>

3
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:39,039
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

4
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,975
All right, you can call
my lawyer, Saul Goodman.

5
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,077
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

6
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:46,113
Hey, you hear me.
I got nothing to say.

7
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:47,648
I told you.
You can call my-

8
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,718
Ah, Christ! God!

9
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:52,986
You had my cell phone number!

10
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,688
You had my wife's name!

11
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:55,756
How'd you do it?

12
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,592
Huh? Who you working with?

13
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:23,610
If you're, uh, ready to talk,

14
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:25,545
they want to get a statement.

15
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:29,016
Your side
of what happened here.

16
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:33,320
Or we can hold him off
till another time.

17
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,327
Maybe you'll want
to talk to a lawyer.

18
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:51,772
There it is.

19
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,143
Yo, Adrian.

20
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:58,578
Rocky called.
He wants his face back.

21
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:02,115
Come on.
I got to cheer you up.

22
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,252
You see that? That's your
Get Out of Jail Free card.

23
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:07,487
You understand Get Out of
Jail Free card, right?

24
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:09,957
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

25
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,426
The D.A.'s worst nightmare

26
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,228
is that face out in public.

27
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:16,930
They're going to have
to steer a wide berth

28
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,532
of young Master Pinkman

29
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,534
for fear of the P.R.
poop storm

30
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,035
that will rain down on them

31
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,537
if this story ever gets out.

32
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:25,339
I mean, this- this beating?

33
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,574
Best thing for you.

34
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,176
You're home free.

35
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:31,678
Good, right?

36
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,780
Right.

37
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,003
Oh, my God.

38
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,572
You're now officially
the cute one of the group.

39
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:01,274
Paul, meet Ringo.
Ringo, Paul.

40
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,080
This is- I-

41
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:11,618
Jesse, I'm-
I am so sorry for this.

42
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,553
This should not have happened.

43
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,657
But it did.

44
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:20,027
No thanks to you.

45
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,033
But the plan did work.

46
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,035
We would have been
locked up right now

47
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,536
if we didn't lure him away.

48
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,737
But this-

49
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,340
this- I just-

50
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,142
I never saw this coming.

51
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:42,916
So...

52
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,185
What, uh...

53
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:46,887
W- what happens now?

54
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,056
What happens now?

55
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,226
I'll tell you what happens now.

56
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:57,898
Yo scumbag brother-in-law
is finished,

57
00:08:57,932 --> 00:09:00,100
done.

58
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:01,568
You understand?

59
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:06,640
I will own him
when this is over.

60
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:09,276
Every cent he earns,

61
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,013
every cent his wife earns,

62
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,782
is mine.

63
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,085
Anyplace he goes,

64
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,053
anywhere he turns,

65
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:22,556
I'm going to be there,

66
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,325
grabbing my share.

67
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:30,197
He'll be scrubbing toilets
in Tijuana for pennies,

68
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:32,933
and I'll be standing over him

69
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,836
to get my cut.

70
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,871
He'll see me when he wakes up
in the morning

71
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:40,373
and when he crawls to sleep

72
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,809
in whatever rat hole's
left for him

73
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:46,746
after I shred his house down,

74
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:51,084
I will haunt his crusty ass

75
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,286
forever

76
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,889
until the day

77
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:59,292
he sticks a gun up his mouth

78
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,661
and pulls the trigger

79
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,264
just to get me out of his head.

80
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:11,204
That's what happens next.

81
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,715
Uh, my advice-

82
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:24,951
that's probably not
a good strategy.

83
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,387
I mean, they're scared
of you right now.

84
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,022
They want nothing
to do with you.

85
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:30,891
But if you hit them,

86
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,960
they're forced
to hit back hard.

87
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:36,229
I mean, they will
turn over every rock

88
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:38,031
hither, thither, and yon

89
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:40,300
until someone spills
the beans on you

90
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:42,135
and anyone associated with you,

91
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,670
uh, present company included.

92
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:46,907
Yeah, I think what Saul is
saying makes a lot of sense.

93
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:51,411
Jesse, move on with your life.

94
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,480
Leave it behind, all of it.

95
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,715
Nothing changes.

96
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,885
Once I walk out of here,

97
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,390
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

98
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,161
How exactly do you think

99
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,030
you're going to get
away with that?

100
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:11,565
They will catch you.

101
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,966
So what?

102
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What?

103
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,236
I have a Get Out of Jail
Free card.

104
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,874
Hey, I may have overstated
the, uh, power of your face.

105
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:23,543
Not this.

106
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,781
If the cops catch me...

107
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,717
I give them
what they want the most.

108
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,224
You.

109
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:44,364
They nab me,

110
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,566
I make a deal

111
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:51,671
to give up the great Heisenberg

112
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:55,909
and his million-dollar
drug ring.

113
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:05,352
You're my free pass, bitch.

114
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:11,424
You're so sure.

115
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,426
Look, if he didn't
give up my name

116
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:15,495
while Hank was beating him
senseless,

117
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,097
he's never going to talk.

118
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:19,766
What do you think that was
in there, a bluff?

119
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,601
He wants your brother-in-law.

120
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:23,403
And there's going to be
a parade of lawyers

121
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:25,839
creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

122
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,207
I mean, I'd take it myself

123
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,576
if it wouldn't cause
so much collateral damage.

124
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,211
And him cooking again.

125
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:34,047
Hey, when, not if,
he gets caught,

126
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:35,482
and he's facing 20 years,

127
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:36,883
what'll he do then?

128
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:40,120
Believe me, there's
no honor among thieves.

129
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:43,390
Except for us, of course.

130
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:46,026
No, he'll-

131
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,260
he'll come around.

132
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:50,964
And if he doesn't,

133
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:53,400
there may come a time
to talk options.

134
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:55,135
Options?

135
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:10,758
I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman
was involved

136
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,593
in the manufacture
and distribution

137
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:13,995
of phenyl-2
methamphetamine,

138
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,297
specifically what we're
calling the blue meth.

139
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,233
I tracked him to a scrap yard

140
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:22,036
where he stored
an early '80s camper,

141
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,905
an RV.

142
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,940
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle,

143
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,010
which I believed to be
a rolling meth lab,

144
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:32,680
I received a telephone call

145
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:37,918
telling me my wife Marie had
been injured in an accident.

146
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:40,087
Upon hearing the news,

147
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,822
I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle

148
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,991
to tend to my wife.

149
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,926
After arriving at the hospital,

150
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,095
I learned the emergency
call was a hoax.

151
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,665
My wife, fortunately,
was unharmed.

152
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,837
So I immediately went
back to the salvage yard,

153
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,539
but the RV was gone.

154
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:01,141
Most likely destroyed on site.

155
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,509
And it was at this point

156
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,545
that you drove to the home
of Jesse Pinkman?

157
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:18,292
I think we're done here.

158
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,994
Agent Schrader
needs to get home,

159
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,229
get some rest.

160
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:23,363
That's fine.

161
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,299
But just to confirm,

162
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,000
you're taking the Fifth here?

163
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,869
Yeah. That's correct.

164
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:33,774
Okay. Well, we just want
to GI you all a heads up.

165
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:37,444
Mr. Pinkman is pressing
charges in this matter.

166
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,413
He's given a detailed version

167
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:41,849
of events as he sees them.

168
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:43,317
The word of a meth head.

169
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,152
We know all about his history.

170
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,220
We're well aware,

171
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:49,690
but toxicology on Pinkman-

172
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,292
his blood is clean,
he's not using.

173
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:55,729
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds,

174
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,564
as far as we can tell.

175
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:01,702
So, um...

176
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:06,240
...where do we go from here?

177
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,208
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down,

178
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:10,444
probably tomorrow morning.

179
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,746
Janice will give us
an exact time on that.

180
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:16,283
And you men will be
continuing your investigation,

181
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,352
so...

182
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:19,787
Thanks for your time.

183
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,889
Right. We just-

184
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:23,524
We need one more thing.

185
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:28,395
Photo of Agent Schrader's
hands, for the record.

186
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,532
Yes, of course.

187
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,001
Bandage off, if you would.

188
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,208
Um, on the table is fine.

189
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,645
Flat on the table is fine.

190
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,814
It's all going to work out.

191
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,817
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

192
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,185
I hope it goes without saying

193
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,522
that we're not talking
to anybody about this, okay?

194
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,059
Okay.

195
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,564
Marie, who?

196
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,334
Hi.

197
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:22,770
Do you have a minute?

198
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,438
Sure.

199
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:41,321
I guess crime does pay.

200
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:49,129
I don't suppose you just
came by to insult me.

201
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:54,968
No. We need to talk.

202
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,371
You heard about Hank?

203
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:01,375
About what happened
with this, um, Jesse Pinkman?

204
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,544
Yes, I know.

205
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:06,046
Whatever Hank
was investigating,

206
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:10,250
him trying to find an RV,

207
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:12,286
is there any danger

208
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,755
that could lead back to you?

209
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,026
No. Why would it?

210
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,698
Is this why you're here?

211
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,202
I'm here to talk about Hank.

212
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,403
Mm-hmm.

213
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,806
You know what's
going to happen to him

214
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:35,375
if this Pinkman
presses charges?

215
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,780
Hank could lose everything.

216
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:46,820
I thought maybe, um...

217
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,757
There's a way
you could help him.

218
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,592
How?

219
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,695
Contact Pinkman.

220
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:56,630
Get him to drop the charges.

221
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:59,466
Look, Skyler, I don't know
what kind of relationship

222
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:01,802
you picture me having
with this person.

223
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:02,836
I'm not asking.

224
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,538
He was- He's-

225
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,073
He's not my friend.

226
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,407
I mean,
it's not as if we-

227
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,675
I'm-
... were even close.

228
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,944
I'm not asking.

229
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,514
But there must be
something you could say.

230
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:17,551
Isn't it even worth a try?

231
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,686
Hank is your family.

232
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,925
Not currently.

233
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,160
What?

234
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,796
I said not currently.

235
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm late. I have to go.

236
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,300
Hello. I was starting
to get worried.

237
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,340
Car trouble.

238
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:16,610
Oh. That's a bummer.

239
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,313
You should call me next time.

240
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:20,681
I'll pick you up.

241
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:21,748
Uh-huh.

242
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:26,854
No, uh, no sandals today?

243
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:29,756
I just thought-

244
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,826
a bit more professional.

245
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:35,596
Well,

246
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,997
everything is on track.

247
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,668
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to-

248
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:43,704
Let's get our trays ready.

249
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:45,572
Clean, no moisture.

250
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:46,406
Done.

251
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:52,846
Is our, uh...

252
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:54,147
Our solvent filtered?

253
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,316
I thought you might ask that.

254
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:57,618
Done.

255
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:03,257
That's good.

256
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,193
Hand in glove.
That's what we strive for.

257
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,897
Yo5 know,

258
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,966
this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

259
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:46,967
So, you the gentlemen?

260
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:52,673
Lucky you boys called me.
I got a load to pick up.

261
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,541
I'm taking the 40
straight through to Memphis.

262
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,076
I could hammer it out
in about 15,

263
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,411
but there's a girl down there

264
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,513
named Lainie or Lolly
or something. Maybe Fran.

265
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:00,948
She's got one
of these fetish things-

266
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,115
wants to get peed on.

267
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,750
I was hoping
to see her tonight,

268
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:07,788
so I want to wrap it up
here ASAP

269
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,489
because traffic
can be a wild card,

270
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:10,691
you know,
rubbernecking and such.

271
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,992
The surprising thing is

272
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,460
women who like to get peed on

273
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,195
always tend to be
from the warmer climates.

274
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,030
You'd think the ones
in the colder zones

275
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:18,131
would be more inclined.

276
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,733
Maybe it's a shock
to the system

277
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,101
if the body's
not properly acclimated,

278
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:24,037
but, you know, I leave that
for smart minds than me.

279
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:27,341
Science is a mystery.

280
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,042
Well, take a gander.

281
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,677
Prices are negotiable.

282
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,279
Buying in bulk
gets you a discount.

283
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,914
I'm running a special
on these little honeys.

284
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,784
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,

285
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,453
known by the natives
as Black Death.

286
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,088
Check it out.
Huh. You like that?

287
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,689
So sweet, you want to lick it.

288
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:44,891
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat for panache.

289
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:47,527
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact.

290
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:48,729
Whew.

291
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,130
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

292
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,698
Hmm.

293
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,100
Keep it. On the house?

294
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:54,601
Anyhow, I've been
windjamming long enough.

295
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,703
Why don't you boys tell me
what you're looking for?

296
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:57,938
What can I do you for?

297
00:23:57,972 --> 00:23:59,406
Vests.

298
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,309
Vests? Hell, yeah,
we got vests.

299
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:04,378
Right here.

300
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:09,683
Sleek, comfortable,

301
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,818
thermally bonded
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

302
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:14,287
Stop a bullet like a soft wank
against a Quaker girl.

303
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,655
Just ain't getting through.

304
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,024
And lightweight?

305
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:18,225
Damn, so lightweight,

306
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,559
you'll forget
you're wearing it.

307
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,562
They work?

308
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:25,198
Sure as shit, they do.

309
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,134
I don't leave home without it.

310
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:32,739
Ohh!

311
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,877
What the hell?

312
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:42,349
You broke my freakin' rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

313
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,082
You're welcome!

314
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:33,599
Gale.

315
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,401
What temperature
did you set here?

316
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,337
There? That's...

317
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,206
Station Five- 75 C.

318
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,778
I said 85.

319
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,279
8-5.

320
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:48,947
No.

321
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,184
I, uh-
I wrote it down.

322
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,952
You said 75.

323
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,220
I- I wrote it.

324
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:56,355
Well, then you wrote it wrong.

325
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,591
That's not what I said.
I said 85.

326
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:03,028
It's always been 85-

327
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:06,465
not 75, not 95.

328
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:07,933
85.

329
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:11,336
This is chemistry.
Degrees matter.

330
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:16,709
I'm sorry.

331
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,711
I'm very sorry.

332
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,180
Great. You're sorry.

333
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:24,683
Meanwhile, you've just brewed
50 gallons of useless sludge.

334
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:25,951
Congratulations.

335
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,520
Just dump it. Dump it all.

336
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,155
This batch is ruined.

337
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,290
You look nice.

338
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,561
I look like a TV weatherman.

339
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,132
You want a coffee?

340
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,636
Nah.

341
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:21,473
I squeezed some orange juice.

342
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:24,409
You want to glass
of orange juice?

343
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:25,778
I'm all right.

344
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,187
What are you
going to tell them?

345
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,994
Here's what you're
going to tell them.

346
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:45,430
He attacked you.

347
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:46,799
He attacked me?

348
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,334
He- He swung at you
with something.

349
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:51,103
He-
He-

350
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,172
Swung at me....
attacked you with a pipe.

351
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,473
With a pipe?

352
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,543
It happened fast.

353
00:27:57,577 --> 00:27:58,911
He resisted arrest,

354
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:01,079
and muscle memory kicked in,

355
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,348
and you had to disarm him.

356
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:05,150
Muscle memory.

357
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,553
Yes.
It happens all the time.

358
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:10,856
Years of training, and your body
acted faster than your brain.

359
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,858
You had no choice
but to hit him.

360
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,460
You had to fight back.
Marie, Marie, Marie.

361
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,930
No.

362
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,533
I'm not going to go
in there and lie.

363
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:24,369
It's some lowlife degenerate

364
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:27,206
versus you...

365
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,341
Doing the job
you're supposed to.

366
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,278
Why should you be
the one who pays

367
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:35,547
for doing the right thing?

368
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:38,050
Oh, baby,
it wasn't the right thing.

369
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:41,386
It's not what the job is.

370
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,890
I'm supposed to be
better than that.

371
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,061
And you made one mistake.

372
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,565
No, it wasn't one mistake.
I've been-

373
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:57,870
I've been...

374
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:03,508
...unraveling,
you know?

375
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,815
I don't sleep at night anymore.

376
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,685
I freeze.

377
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,420
I freeze up.

378
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,459
My chest gets all tight.
I- I can't breathe.

379
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:23,795
Just-

380
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,064
I panic.

381
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:32,638
Ever since
that Salamanca thing.

382
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:34,873
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

383
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:38,310
If ever a scumbag deserved
a bullet between the eyes.

384
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,384
It changed me.

385
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,658
And I can't seem to control it.

386
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,263
I tried to fight it.

387
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:04,436
But then El Paso.

388
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,106
And it's just gotten worse.

389
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,845
What I did to Pinkman...

390
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,717
...that's not who
I'm supposed to be.

391
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,018
That's not me.

392
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:24,990
All this-

393
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,894
everything
that's happened, I-

394
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:31,964
I swear to God, Marie,

395
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:36,802
I think the universe is
trying to tell me something,

396
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:40,105
and I'm finally...

397
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,840
Ready to listen.

398
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,051
I'm just not the man
I thought I was.

399
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,757
I think I'm done as a cop.

400
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:12,371
Now, this is-
is not an easy decision,

401
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:15,674
but it is one
that I have to make.

402
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,376
I'm sorry.

403
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,678
This whole...

404
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,413
Gale situation-

405
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,716
he's- he's just
not working out.

406
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,122
Yes. Now.

407
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:33,392
It- It may sound unorthodox,

408
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:38,864
but I think our first-
best option...

409
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,168
Is Jesse Pinkman.

410
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,306
Hello?

411
00:31:53,513 --> 00:31:54,613
It-

412
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,882
No, look. Th-There's-

413
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,786
There's a- a shorthand
that exists between us-

414
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,554
experience together

415
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,290
at a level that, quite frankly,

416
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,959
I- I'm just never going
to reach with Gale.

417
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:15,967
Look, Mr. Fring,

418
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:18,270
when I accepted your offer,

419
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,640
I was told the lab is mine.

420
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,975
And I know best how to run it.

421
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:30,782
Thank you.

422
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:35,821
Thank you.
Yes, I will. I will.

423
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:38,190
Okay. Good-bye.

424
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:47,632
Listen, something's come up.

425
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,703
And, uh, I think
it's a good opportunity.

426
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:57,476
There's been a job opening.

427
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,244
I need a new lab assistant.

428
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:05,083
I already did my time.

429
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:07,519
Why don't you just go
get yourself a monkey?

430
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:12,858
I don't want a monkey.
I want you.

431
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:15,293
Oh, gee, thanks.

432
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,929
Well, not interested.

433
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,766
I got my own thing going on.

434
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:26,171
Nice try saving your
a- head brother-in-law.

435
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,878
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

436
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:34,513
There's more.

437
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:39,417
It's more than an assistant.

438
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,219
Partners.

439
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,523
We'll be partners again.

440
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:48,160
Split everything 50-50,
just like before.

441
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:54,432
$1.5 million each.

442
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:02,507
No.

443
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,348
I don't think you heard-

444
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:14,519
I've heard you fine.

445
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,488
I said no.

446
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,494
Let me understand this.

447
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:26,831
You're turning down
$11/2 million.

448
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:30,468
I am not turning down
the money.

449
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:33,738
I am turning down you.

450
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,974
You get it?

451
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:39,644
I want nothing to do with you.

452
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,949
Ever since I met you,

453
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:48,420
everything
I have ever cared about

454
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:51,089
is gone...

455
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:54,593
Ruined, turned to shit,

456
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:56,995
dead, ever since I hooked up

457
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:01,032
with the great Heisenberg.

458
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,903
I have never been more alone.

459
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,872
I have nothing!

460
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:10,375
No one!

461
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,211
All right?
It's all gone!

462
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,547
Get it?

463
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:18,516
No. No, no.

464
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,819
Why-

465
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:24,789
Why would you get it?

466
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:26,258
What do you even care

467
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:31,129
as long as you get
what you want?

468
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,664
Right?

469
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:38,236
You don't give a shit
about me.

470
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,641
You said I was no good.

471
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:45,343
I'm nothing!

472
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:48,747
Why would you want me?
Huh?

473
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:54,419
You said my meth
is inferior, right?

474
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,954
Right?

475
00:35:55,988 --> 00:36:00,225
Hey! You said my cook
was garbage!

476
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,627
Hey, screw you, man!

477
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:13,338
Your meth is good, Jesse.

478
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,373
As good as mine.

479
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,333
Yeah.

480
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,003
<i>50-50.</i>

481
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:22,340
Yes. 50-50.

482
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,412
Okay.

483
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,581
Partners.

484
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:37,055
Good.

485
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:26,985
This is the statement
you want to give?

486
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,888
Yes, sir.

487
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:32,124
Hank, you don't
have to do this.

488
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:33,425
No, I-

489
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:36,295
I do.

490
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,530
I'm good.

491
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,902
So we understand

492
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:47,139
if we write it up like that,
you'll sign it.

493
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,776
That's the way it happened.

494
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:54,046
I accept the consequences.

495
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:03,088
In the light of these facts...

496
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:06,191
As of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

497
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:09,995
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

498
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:11,163
Yes, sir.

499
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:42,895
Schrader.

500
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,297
Hold up.

501
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:46,431
Yes, sir?

502
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,501
I just want
to tell you something.

503
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:51,770
And to be clear,
you didn't hear it from me.

504
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:53,839
I don't want you
to get your hopes up,

505
00:39:53,873 --> 00:39:55,107
but the word in the pipeline is

506
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,042
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

507
00:39:58,778 --> 00:39:59,745
Why not?

508
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,547
Who the hell knows?

509
00:40:02,582 --> 00:40:05,117
Maybe you have
a guardian angel.

510
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:28,907
It went fine.

511
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,077
Well, fine means what-

512
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,645
means what it means. Yeah.

513
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,214
I'll, uh...

514
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:39,184
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

515
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,454
Yeah. It's-

516
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,690
Yeah, it's just-

517
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:47,025
I don't know, baby.
I just think-

518
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,760
I think we may be okay.

519
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,062
Yeah.

520
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,631
Okay. I love you, too.

521
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,820
Schrader.

522
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:16,021
<i>I need you</i>

523
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,389
<i>to listen
very carefully.</i>

524
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:19,257
<i>Two men are coming
to kill you.</i>

525
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,759
Come again?

526
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:23,128
<i>They're approaching
your car.</i>

527
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:25,097
<i>You have one minute.</i>

528
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:27,866
I don't get the gag,
jerk off. Who is this?

529
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,102
<i>They're coming.</i>

530
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,370
Hello.

531
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:47,919
Hey, Li-

532
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:51,356
Hey, Gomie, this is Hank.

533
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:53,091
I don't know what that
call's supposed to be,

534
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:55,360
but it's dumb
even by your standards,

535
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:56,795
so call me when you get this.

536
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:19,578
Aah!
Aah!

537
00:43:32,525 --> 00:43:33,725
Aah!

538
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:10,388
No.
