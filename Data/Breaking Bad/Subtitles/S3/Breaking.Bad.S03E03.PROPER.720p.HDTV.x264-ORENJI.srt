00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:07,806
He's still breathing.

3
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,244
By the looks of him, he has
no idea how close he came.

4
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:16,348
I'm assuming saul goodman
doesn't need to know.

5
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,601
Mum's the word.

6
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,476
Son of
a b----.

7
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,792
Hang on, baby.

8
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,423
<i>Hello.</i>

9
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,092
Walt, are you in the house?

10
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,614
<i>Oh, hey, skyler. Yeah, it's me.</i>

11
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,069
What-- what the hell
are you doing in there?

12
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,937
<i>I'm back.</i>

13
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:49,641
No. No, you're not back.
Walt, you're not back.

14
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,443
Get-- get-- get
out of there.

15
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,830
<i>Well, it's-- it's my house, too,
skyler. I'm staying. End of story.</i>

16
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,249
We had an agreement.

17
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,286
<i>I didn't agree to anything.</i>

18
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,039
Now, look, just come on inside,
and we'll talk this through, okay?

19
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,795
No. No, there's nothing to talk about. I
am not coming in there until you get out.

20
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,382
Well...

21
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,467
Suit yourself.

22
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,771
Walt. Walt?

23
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,998
What is wrong with you?

24
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:50,085
Skyler, I have every right to be here.

25
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,469
No, you don't.

26
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,555
You don't live here anymore.

27
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:55,006
We're getting a divorce.

28
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,641
I don't agree to a divorce.

29
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,926
It's not up to you.

30
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,847
If you don't get out of here right now,

31
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,516
I'm going to call the police

32
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,053
And I'm going to tell them everything.

33
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,955
I mean it, walt.

34
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,443
There's the phone.

35
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,148
<i>It's ringing.</i>

36
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:47,488
<i>Albuquerque police department,
Operator #314b. How may I help you?</i>

37
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,699
Yes, I-- I want to report
a disturbance, please.

38
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,070
No, no, it's not--
it's not exactly--

39
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,038
It's, um...

40
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,642
It's a domestic issue.

41
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,211
Okay.

42
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,883
They're connecting me.

43
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,721
Right hand to god, I will tell them.

44
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,157
Do what you have to do, skyler.

45
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,979
This family is everything to me.

46
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,566
Without it, I have nothing to lose.

47
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,567
Fine.

48
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,122
Yes, my name is skyler white.

49
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,042
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

50
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,326
My--

51
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,463
Soon-to-be
ex-husband

52
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:46,718
Broke into my house, and I need
an officer to come and remove him.

53
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,723
It's 308 negra arroyo lane.

54
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,092
Okay.

55
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,344
Okay.

56
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,764
Thank you.

57
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,439
They're coming.

58
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,540
Oh... Dad's here?

59
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,075
Hey. Dad.

60
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,359
Hey, son, come here.

61
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,162
How are you?

62
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,915
Are-- are you
back for good?

63
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,300
Why-- why are
you home so soon?

64
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,669
I--
I'm not.

65
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,138
Ah.

66
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,674
Hey, I am starving. How
about a grilled cheese?

67
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,175
Yeah, sure. You want one, too?

68
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,011
Walter, your dad and I have
something we need to discuss.

69
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,013
When your sandwich is ready,

70
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,232
I'll bring it to
your-- to your room.

71
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,518
Mom, can't it wait?

72
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,154
I haven't seen dad in, like, forever.

73
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,522
Walter--

74
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,563
Ooh.

75
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,790
So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?

76
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,459
Yeah, that's the plan.

77
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,009
Hello, ma'am. We were
called about a disturbance?

78
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,429
It's more of a trespassing
situation, really, but--

79
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,066
Yeah, that was me.

80
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,604
You called the cops on dad?

81
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,576
I, uh-- I came
home from work,

82
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,811
And he was back.

83
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,330
He just moved back into the house.

84
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:33,785
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen.

85
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,869
I
just--

86
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,872
I-- I want
him out.

87
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,991
I want him out of the house.

88
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,711
Okay, mrs. White. There's
a couple of questions

89
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,711
I need to ask you right off of the bat.

90
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,346
It's very important that
you answer them honestly.

91
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,265
Did he strike you?

92
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,633
No.

93
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,218
Has he ever hit you?

94
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,004
No. This is not about violence.

95
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,106
This is about trespassing,

96
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,910
About him being here against my will.

97
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,094
Okay. Trespassing.

98
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,779
You're divorced, then?

99
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,998
No, working on it.

100
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,783
Right now we're separated.

101
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,236
Legally separated?

102
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,537
Well, there's not a court order,

103
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:10,788
If that's what you mean,

104
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,123
But we've been living apart

105
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,375
For almost two
weeks, give or take--

106
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,077
I changed the locks.

107
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,830
Isn't that breaking and entering?

108
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,915
Whose name is on the title to the house?

109
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,418
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

110
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,304
We can't arrest a man for
breaking into his own house,

111
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,505
Not without a court order

112
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,107
Requiring he stays away from the premises,

113
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,509
Unless he's threatened
you or the kids in any way.

114
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:33,678
No,
not--

115
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,146
Not physically, but having him

116
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,514
In the house
is just--

117
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,268
It's not a good thing.

118
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,821
Excuse me. Don't cry. Daddy's here.

119
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,356
I got her, honey.

120
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,075
Oh, come here.

121
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,110
There we go.

122
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,912
You hungry?

123
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,864
You hungry?

124
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,865
Here we go.

125
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,501
Oh, that was it.

126
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,737
I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?

127
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,122
Disagreements.

128
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,926
Yeah, so we've had our share of that.

129
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,946
Um, I-- I haven't...

130
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,415
I haven't been the most
attentive husband lately.

131
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,537
Mrs. White, would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

132
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,376
No.

133
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,628
No.

134
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,048
I'm fine right here.

135
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,766
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

136
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,301
If you want your husband out of the house,

137
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,186
You're gonna have to help me out.

138
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:35,339
Is it possible maybe he's
broken any laws that you know of?

139
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,392
Anything at all.

140
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,811
Anything that we can work
with here, just tell me.

141
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,146
Even if you've just got
a suspicion of wrongdoing,

142
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,364
I can work with that.

143
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,366
I'll get him out of the house for you.

144
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,351
What's your take on all this?

145
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:50,238
It-- it's my
mom's fault.

146
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,372
I--

147
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:57,962
She won't even say what my dad did,
and it's because he didn't do anything.

148
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,631
I don't know why she's being this way.

149
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,834
My--
my dad--

150
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,920
...He is a great guy.

151
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,592
Mrs. White?

152
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,431
I'm sorry, ma'am.

153
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,399
There's no legal basis

154
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,268
For us to remove your husband from the house.

155
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,439
Next time you feel like things
are getting out of control,

156
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,940
You should call this number.

157
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,825
It's the family hotline.

158
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,194
I'd really look into some counseling.

159
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,248
Best of luck to you folks.

160
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:37,118
Listen, thank you, officers. We're sorry.

161
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,344
Why do you
got to--

162
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,129
Why do you got to do this to dad?

163
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,413
Junior. Wait. Come on.

164
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:51,382
Don't blame your mother for this.

165
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,472
Sorry.

166
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,281
Ah, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

167
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,574
Welcome home.

168
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,735
He lives!

169
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,853
Happy housewarming, kid.

170
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:05,706
Don't look so glad to see me. Thanks.

171
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,875
Interesting decor.

172
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,527
It's, uh, subtle.

173
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:12,246
The whole minimalist thing
never really blew my hair back,

174
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,297
But hey.

175
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,751
So, how are you doing?

176
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,419
You staying clean?

177
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,506
Good.

178
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,557
I was kind of worried

179
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:23,841
That you were back to old habits,

180
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,093
Since I didn't hear from you, you know?

181
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,348
Realize how stupid it is to
ignore your counsel's phone calls?

182
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,818
What if I was trying to warn you that
the DEA was going to kick down your door?

183
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,236
I mean, what then, huh?

184
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,821
Why don't you spare me the sermon

185
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,406
And get to why you're here?

186
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,690
Fair enough.

187
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,192
Remember the other day

188
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,726
When I brought up the idea

189
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,829
Of you getting back in
touch with your, uh, partner?

190
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,665
Well, I kind of wanted to refloat that boat.

191
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,751
I'm not suggesting that you
yourself get back to cooking,

192
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:52,570
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

193
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,289
I only want you to convince the master chef

194
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,507
To do his thing,

195
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,544
So what do you say?

196
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,412
Sure, man. Whatever.

197
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,930
Okay. Whatever what?

198
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,583
I mean, you going to call him?

199
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,185
I said I'll handle it.

200
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,919
Now bounce, will you?

201
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:09,920
Please?

202
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,305
Final thought.

203
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,192
Look at this place.

204
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,426
You're house poor.

205
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,861
You got no bankroll.

206
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,762
If you get the maestro cooking again,

207
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,815
I'll make it worth your while.

208
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,901
Call him.

209
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,316
<i>Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,</i>

210
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,784
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

211
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,152
<i>Do not call list.</i>

212
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,371
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

213
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,146
Schrader.

214
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,148
Yes, sir? Yeah, what's up?

215
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,735
Yeah?

216
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,689
Wow!

217
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,991
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

218
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,327
Ah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

219
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,495
You can bet on that.

220
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:00,631
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir.

221
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,216
I really appreciate you
stepping to the plate.

222
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,250
Thank you.

223
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,307
You going to keep me in suspense or what?

224
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,474
What's the good news?

225
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,376
Merkert called in a couple of favors.

226
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,845
El paso wants me back. Aaah!

227
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,215
Hey, man, congrats, man. That's fantastic.

228
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,684
Thank you. Yeah.

229
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,520
Yeah.

230
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:04,895
Hello.

231
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,279
<i>Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,</i>

232
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,731
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

233
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,015
<i>Do not call list.</i>

234
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,702
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

235
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:57,931
<i>Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,</i>

236
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,199
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

237
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,584
<i>Do not call list.</i>

238
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,653
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

239
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,391
<i>Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,</i>

240
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,759
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

241
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:51,301
Oh, sweetheart.

242
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:54,021
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

243
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,658
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

244
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,811
Oh, yes. It's okay.

245
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:03,664
It's okay. Mama's got you.

246
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:07,417
Oh, mama's got you, yeah.

247
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,653
Yes. Oh.

248
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,874
Skyler, want some help?

249
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,105
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

250
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:42,569
G--.

251
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,340
What do you mean? Against your will?

252
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,143
Yes. Very much against my will.

253
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,345
He just-- he-- he
showed right back up,

254
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,480
And he-- he doesn't
want a divorce.

255
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,816
Won't even consider it.

256
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,737
I-- I called the
police on him.

257
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,323
I-- I was--
I was so clo--

258
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,892
So close to what?

259
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,894
Nothing. Never mind.

260
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:27,748
Skyler, I can't advise you properly

261
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:29,449
If you don't give me all the facts.

262
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,702
Understand I am bound

263
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,287
By the attorney-client privilege

264
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,289
To keep everything you tell me a secret.

265
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,909
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

266
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,678
Even if it's something illegal?

267
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,581
Especially if it's illegal.

268
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,516
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

269
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,553
My job is to protect you.

270
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,315
My husband makes meth.

271
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,985
Methamphetamine.

272
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,740
Your husband's a drug dealer.

273
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,824
A manufacturer.

274
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,944
Technically, they, uh,

275
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:16,797
They-- they
call them cooks.

276
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:19,132
I looked it up on the internet.

277
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:23,303
This is my advice, and you should take it.

278
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,056
Sue your husband for divorce immediately.

279
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,841
Let me go to the police

280
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,010
And tell them what you've just told me.

281
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,345
I'll go in ex parte

282
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,764
And get a restraining
order from the court today.

283
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,849
If he comes anywhere near
you and your children,

284
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,685
He goes straight to jail, no questions asked.

285
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,470
This is a no-brainer.

286
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:43,440
It's the best thing for you and your family.

287
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,110
I can't.

288
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,281
I can't do it.

289
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:56,152
I don't want my son to find out

290
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,255
That his father is a criminal.

291
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,123
I
just--

292
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,543
I can't do that to him.

293
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:07,180
In the end, it may not be up to you.

294
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,716
Drug dealers have a way of getting caught.

295
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:15,772
Walt has lung cancer.

296
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,841
His treatment bought him some time,

297
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,342
But the doctors, they all say

298
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,011
That sooner
or later--

299
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:26,450
But I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family

300
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,486
When...Things
may--

301
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:36,293
Resolve themselves on their own

302
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:40,497
Without anyone else knowing.

303
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:48,839
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

304
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,142
What are we doing
in this ----hole?

305
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,376
Just relax, will you?

306
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:56,146
Relax? This is the kind
of place you get knifed.

307
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,764
We should have went to chili's, man.

308
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,516
All right,
already. J----.

309
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,234
Outback steakhouse.

310
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,269
It's not too late.

311
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,271
They got that blooming onion.

312
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,723
What's wrong with spicing
things up a little bit, huh?

313
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:11,361
This spice looks like it's been
through a couple of guys already.

314
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:14,064
So when are you headed back down to el paso?

315
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,398
Uh, you know,

316
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:18,418
Between the packing and errands and, uh,

317
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:21,171
Getting my ducks in a row,
maybe, um, a week or two.

318
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,090
A week or two? Come on, man.

319
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,092
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

320
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:27,677
Yeah, well, it's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

321
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,012
What are you talking about?

322
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,714
There ain't jack going on up here.

323
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,300
It's quiet as hell.

324
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,552
I'm going to hit the head.

325
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:08,752
Those two over there.

326
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,588
I think they're holding.

327
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:14,958
Man, in this place,

328
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,593
The bartender's probably holding.

329
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,933
All right.

330
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,267
Whoa. What are you doing?

331
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,569
Calling apd. What do you think?

332
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,021
Since when can't we handle
a couple of dirtballs?

333
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,573
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

334
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,442
What if vice is running
some kind if undercover op?

335
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,616
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

336
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:15,619
Where are you going?

337
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:16,903
I have to take a leak.

338
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,239
J----, get yourself
some flomax.

339
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,002
Stand up.

340
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:43,180
Do you got a problem
with us, b----?

341
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,814
Your move.

342
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,345
Dea! Don't move.

343
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,386
Go tell my partner to
get his a-- in here.

344
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,106
<i>Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,</i>

345
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,574
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

346
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:02,993
<i>Do not call list.</i>

347
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:05,662
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

348
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,458
<i>Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,</i>

349
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,176
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

350
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,394
<i>Do not
call--</i>

351
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,993
<i>We're sorry. You have reached a number</i>

352
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,613
<i>That has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.</i>

353
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,330
Come on.

354
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:20,746
Skyler.

355
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,719
Can we talk?

356
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:44,904
Asac wants to see you.

357
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,241
And?

358
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:51,377
We're hanging back. Saw a deal go down.

359
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,079
I went outside to call it in.

360
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,415
You stayed to keep an eye on the suspects.

361
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,083
That's when they attacked you.

362
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,175
What I didn't tell them

363
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:07,126
Is that you left your gun under the seat

364
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,729
Before you went back inside.

365
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:27,831
I've done a terrible thing,

366
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,200
But I did it for a good reason.

367
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,954
I did it for us.

368
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,175
That...

369
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,512
Is college tuition for walter junior

370
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,430
And holly,

371
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,099
18 years down the road.

372
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,300
Huh?

373
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,940
Then it's health insurance
for you and the kids,

374
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,476
For junior's physical therapy,

375
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,646
His sat tutor.

376
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:04,868
It's money for groceries

377
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,487
And gas,

378
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:11,908
For birthdays and graduation parties.

379
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,696
Skyler, that money

380
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,415
Is for this roof over your head,

381
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:22,051
The mortgage that you are
not going to be able to afford

382
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,138
On a part-time bookkeeper's
salary when I'm gone.

383
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,839
Walt, I--
please.

384
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,591
Please.

385
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:36,933
This money...

386
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:38,935
I didn't steal it.

387
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:42,405
It doesn't belong to anyone else.

388
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,324
I earned it.

389
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,361
The things I've...

390
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:52,415
Done to earn it...

391
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,783
The...

392
00:40:58,238 --> 00:40:59,289
The...

393
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,759
Things I've had to do,

394
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:07,046
I've got to live with them.

395
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,721
Skyler.

396
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,109
All that I've done,

397
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,063
All the sacrifices that I have...

398
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:26,115
Made for this family,

399
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,068
All of that will be for nothing

400
00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:32,238
If you don't accept what I've earned.

401
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,874
Please.

402
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:41,914
I'll be here when you get home from work.

403
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,586
You can give me your answer then.

404
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,576
Hey, sky.

405
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,694
Hi.

406
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,001
Ahem.

407
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:11,170
Uh, some coffee?

408
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,306
Yeah.

409
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,259
That report's looking real good.

410
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,011
That-- I like how
it looks. Good.

411
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,689
Are your kids home?

412
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,160
Ahem.

413
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,814
<i>Ooh, it's here, it's here!</i>

414
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,121
Hello, mrs. White.

415
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,990
Oh. Hi, louis.

416
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,743
Hey, uh, thanks for
having me over for dinner.

417
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,379
Um, sure.

418
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,748
Hey, skyler.

419
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:32,468
I'm, uh, cooking dinner.

420
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,453
Pot roast.

421
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,589
Uh, could
you--

422
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:59,278
So how was your day?

423
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:02,615
Good.

424
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,451
Good. Excellent.

425
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:06,986
I hope you don't mind.

426
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:11,090
I invited louis to stay for dinner tonight,

427
00:45:11,124 --> 00:45:12,341
You know, as a thank you

428
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,661
For driving walter junior to school for us.

429
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,631
We've been kind of absent,

430
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:23,135
But I tell you, louis really pitched in.

431
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:27,273
Um...

432
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:33,062
Look, I just want
to say that I--

433
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:35,014
I feel good about our talk this morning,

434
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,282
And I'm--
I'm very eager

435
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,367
To hear what you're
thinking about--

436
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,352
About what we talked about.

437
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,571
But, you know,

438
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:43,406
Whenever you're ready, of course.

439
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,292
Yeah.

440
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,166
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

441
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,510
There.

442
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,158
I f---ed
ted.

443
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:30,202
Boys, dinner.

444
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,959
Thank you. Louis?

445
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,911
Uh, yes, please. All right.

446
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,046
Thank you.

447
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,883
I want you boys both to eat your salad, okay?

448
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:44,967
Okay.

449
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:46,385
I know.

450
00:46:46,419 --> 00:46:48,104
Nobody likes salad,

451
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,473
But it's good for you.

452
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:52,058
Thanks, darling. Thank you.
