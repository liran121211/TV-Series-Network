1
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,739
[sighs]

2
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:43,174
Yo, I thought I was going
to see some, like, vaginas.

3
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:50,979
I didn't say she actually
painted vaginas.

4
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:52,079
I said

5
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:53,814
some of her paintings

6
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:56,916
looked like vaginas.

7
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:00,118
Uh, seriously?

8
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:02,119
[whispers] Not even close.

9
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:03,319
[chuckles]

10
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,688
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

11
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:10,991
Huh. Everyday items,
her surroundings.

12
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:15,527
Some of it evoked
an erotic nature.

13
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:17,062
[snickers]

14
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:19,530
It's who she was.

15
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:23,800
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

16
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,935
This chick have medical issues?

17
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,336
This particular painting--

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,770
Mmm.

19
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:31,438
...is of a door.

20
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:35,674
Any other doors
we can check out?

21
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,943
Like, real ones or...

22
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,278
[groans]

23
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,947
You know,
I-I-I don't get it.

24
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,949
Why would anyone paint
a picture of a door

25
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:50,585
over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

26
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,986
But it wasn't the same.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,388
Uh, yeah, it was.

28
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:57,023
It was the same subject, but
it was different every time.

29
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,357
The light was different.

30
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,725
Her mood was different.

31
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,293
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

32
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:05,863
And that's not psycho to you?

33
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:09,198
Well, then, why should we
do anything more than once?

34
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,900
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

35
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:15,536
Maybe we should only have sex
once if it's the same thing.

36
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,171
Whoa, no--

37
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,473
Should we just watch
one sunset?

38
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:23,176
Or live just one day.

39
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,977
Because it's new every time.

40
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,712
Each time, it's
a different experience.

41
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,147
Okay, fine.

42
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,983
I guess the cow skull
pictures were cool,

43
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:35,018
but a door?

44
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:37,487
I will say it again.

45
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,855
[chuckles] A door.

46
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,056
[snores] [chuckles]

47
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,891
Why not a door?

48
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,759
Sometimes you get fixated
on something,

49
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,194
and you might not even get why.

50
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,763
You open yourself up
and go with the flow,

51
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,498
wherever the universe
takes you.

52
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:52,565
[snickers]

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,503
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door,

54
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,437
and she got all obsessed
with it

55
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:04,442
and just had to paint it
20 times until it was perfect.

56
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,877
No, I wouldn't say that.
Nothing's perfect.

57
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,579
Yeah?

58
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:09,913
Well...

59
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:13,082
Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,884
Some things.

61
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:23,124
[giggles]

62
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,899
Oh, that was so sweet,

63
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,802
I think I threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

64
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:35,038
[laughs]

65
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:37,474
You can't admit just
for once that I'm right.

66
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,642
Come on.

67
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,046
That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,114
until that stupid door

69
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:46,150
was perfect.

70
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,752
No. That door was her home,
and she loved it.

71
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,923
To me, that's about making
that feeling last.

[machine whirring]

74
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:30,359
All right, here we go.
You ready?

75
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:33,529
[labored breathing]

76
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,965
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

77
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,270
[exhales]

78
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,473
Nope.

79
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:46,074
Nope, that's it.
Take me up.

80
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,609
You can do this, Hank.

81
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,544
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.

82
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:52,047
Pain is weakness
leaving your body.

83
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,615
Pain is my foot
in your ass, Marie.

84
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,518
Hey, if you can get your leg
up that high, I say go for it.

85
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,953
Take me up. Take me up.
All right, coffee break.

86
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:01,623
We're gonna let you rest for a minute,
and then we're gonna try it again.

87
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,258
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up.

88
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,093
I'm done. I'm done.

89
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:06,694
[grunts] [machine whirrs]

90
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:12,333
Come on, Uncle Hank.
You can do it.

91
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,135
How else are you going
to get out of here?

92
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,403
Don't you have any friends?

93
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:17,338
I mean Jesus, find
something better to do.

94
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,739
I don't need everyone
staring at me

95
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:21,842
hanging here
like a camel's ball sack.

96
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:24,779
Hank, he just wants
to be supportive.

97
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,181
It's all right.

98
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,187
All right, I'll be right back.

99
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,855
Okay?
I'll be right back.

100
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:37,694
You gonna get me out
of here sometime today?

101
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,764
[machine whirring]

102
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,031
Honey--

103
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,034
We got our first bill,

104
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:48,637
and, you know,
if you're still insistent--

105
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,671
I am.

106
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,580
Prepare yourself.

107
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,454
[whispers] Yeah.

108
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:09,225
They're gonna start coming in
weekly like that, so...

109
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,660
Okay.

110
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:12,729
You're sure you can do this?

111
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,733
Yeah.

112
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,996
[scale beeps]

113
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,397
I'll do that.

114
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,202
[scale beeps]
What the hell, man?

115
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,740
What, I can't work a scale now?

116
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:06,977
This is bullshit.

117
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,712
Just say it.

118
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,014
Just say the words.

119
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,916
You think I'm stealing.
Shh.

120
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,095
[Group leader]
Walk with who you are.

121
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,195
That was a phrase my sponsor
used to use with me

122
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,898
back when I first started
coming to meetings.

123
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,434
It's probably just a different
way of saying "Be yourself."

124
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:39,802
Right?

125
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:44,373
But this idea of "walk"

126
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:45,841
also tells me

127
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,143
that I have to move forward.

128
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,145
Always good advice,
at least for me.

129
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:54,082
I see we have some
new people here at group,

130
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,350
a couple new faces.

131
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,385
Let's see some hands.

132
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,453
First time?

133
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,696
Great. Welcome.

134
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,331
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

135
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,500
Say whatever's on your mind.

136
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,602
How about you?
You want to start us off?

137
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:18,672
[clears throat]

138
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,743
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

139
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:24,111
and, uh...

140
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:30,483
We don't bite.
No judgments.

141
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,653
You can be as open and honest
as you want to be.

142
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:38,992
Honestly, I don't
want to be here.

143
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:44,398
All right.
Fair enough.

144
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:45,866
Who else had their hand up?

145
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:53,839
Hey. 'Sup?

146
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,141
My name's Jesse.

147
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,010
Why, hello.

148
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:59,178
My name is Brandon.

149
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,549
And this is, I believe, Peter?

150
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,617
Right. I'm Peter.
How are you?

151
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,929
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

152
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:20,298
It's gonna get a little
slower smuggling product

153
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,134
with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

154
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:26,503
But don't worry.
I'll keep it flowing.

155
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,371
Great. Right on.

156
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,006
Yeah.

157
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,375
So how's it selling?

158
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,843
Mad volume?

159
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:37,278
Yeah. It's, uh...

160
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,013
You know, it's, um...

161
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,817
It's not so good.

162
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:44,488
What do you mean?

163
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:46,690
How much have you sold?

164
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,091
I sold a teenth.

165
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,759
One teenth?

166
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,126
That's it?

167
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,828
Yeah.

168
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:53,829
To who?

169
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:55,431
To him.

170
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,268
Look, it's not so easy
selling to these people.

171
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,170
They're here trying
to better themselves.

172
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,304
Yeah, there's, like,

173
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,840
positivity and stuff
going on here.

174
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:09,577
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

175
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:12,446
and you're too pussy to sell?

176
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,481
You're pathetic.

177
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,985
You know what?
I want it back. All of it.

178
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll sell it myself.

179
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,522
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.

180
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,191
Selling to these people, it's
like shooting a baby in the face.

181
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,325
It's not natural.

182
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,728
Yeah, Jesse,
it's not easy like you think.

183
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:33,035
I'll show you exactly
how easy it is.

184
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:54,030
Oh, hey. Sorry.

185
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,065
No. Go ahead.

186
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:57,701
It's Andrea, right?

187
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:59,536
Yeah.

188
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,401
Hey, um, my name's Jesse,

189
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:05,737
and, uh, I don't really
want to be here, either.

190
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,373
Oh, um--

191
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,407
Sorry.
[chuckles]

192
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,441
Thanks.

193
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:36,224
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

194
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,259
No.

195
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:39,761
Your dad is.

196
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,870
[Walter, Jr.
] How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

197
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,405
Are you that boring?

198
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,175
I'm comforting.

199
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,545
I'm a comforting presence.

200
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,984
[whispers] There we go.

201
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:02,119
Shh, shh.

202
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,726
Hey, so check it out.

203
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,161
Huh?

204
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,196
See what that means?

205
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,331
Check out the date.

206
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,800
Next Thursday
is officially six months

207
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,333
that I have had my learner's,

208
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,032
which means I can
get my provisional

209
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,364
and start driving by myself.

210
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,960
Since when? You don't
turn 16 for two more months.

211
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,563
It doesn't matter.
It's a provisional.

212
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:33,699
Look it up. They changed
the law, like, 10 years ago.

213
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,768
Oh, yeah? Well,
I didn't vote for that.

214
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,403
Doesn't matter
if you voted for it.

215
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:39,571
It's the law.

216
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:40,772
So both of you start thinking

217
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,474
about what kind of car
you want to buy me.

218
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:43,842
Mmm.

219
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,143
I think I'd be good with either

220
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:48,413
an old IROC or a 'Stang.

221
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,949
Ah, a 'Stang.

222
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,384
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:55,087
How about something with
playing cards in the spokes?

224
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,656
Makes a nice
motor-y sound, you know?

225
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,191
[imitates motor clicking]
[chuckles]

226
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,694
[both laughing]

227
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,996
Yeah, yeah. You're not
gonna get off that easy.

228
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,400
Well, I-- I think
that this is, um--

229
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:12,004
We should probably table
this discussion for later.

230
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:13,839
Your dad and I have
a couple things

231
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,608
we need to talk about, so--

232
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:16,742
Okay.

233
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:21,914
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback

234
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:24,284
in Grabber Lime

235
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:25,819
with a shaker hood.

236
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:26,853
Mmm.

237
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,522
'Stang.

238
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,556
I want to write that down
so I don't forget.

239
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,057
Oh, darn it. No pencil!

240
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,924
[groans] [laughing]

241
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:01,013
What is Ice Station Zebra
Associates?

242
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,086
It's a loan-out.
It's fine.

243
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,421
Whose loan-out?

244
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:12,090
It's fine. Really.

245
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:16,561
I...have a guy.

246
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:18,396
Okay.

247
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:21,433
Um, does your guy know

248
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:24,002
the tax code and regulations
in New Mexico?

249
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:26,471
'Cause there's very
specific paperwork

250
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,939
that has to be submitted
quarterly on this.

251
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,808
Yes. My guy is a top...

252
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:31,809
guy.

253
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:32,810
Who is he?

254
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,211
Uh.
What's his name?

255
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,779
What are his qualifications?

256
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:41,121
Walt, this money has
to be unimpeachable

257
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:44,256
when it reaches Hank and Marie.

258
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,792
And it is. It will be.

259
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,527
But how do I know that?

260
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,763
I mean, apparently, you can't
even tell me the man's name.

261
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:51,798
Oh. Jesus.

262
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:54,600
Skyler, do you
really want to know?

263
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:55,935
I mean, do you really
want to know?

264
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:00,972
Really?

265
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:10,011
[man coughing]

266
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,284
[coughing continues]

267
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:33,831
[door closes]

268
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,032
[Saul]
Hello. Welcome.

269
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,934
What a pleasure it is
to have you.

270
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:40,236
I'm just gonna call you
Skyler, if that's okay.

271
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,703
It's a lovely name.

272
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:45,173
Reminds me
of a big beautiful sky.

273
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:47,041
Walt never told me
how lucky he was--

274
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:49,977
prior to recent
unfortunate events.

275
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,611
Clearly, his taste in women

276
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,380
is the same as his taste
in lawyers--

277
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,415
only the very best

278
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:59,018
with just the right
amount of dirty.

279
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:00,852
[laughs] That's a joke.

280
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:03,021
That's a joke.

281
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:05,824
It's funny because you are
so clearly very classy.

282
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:08,826
Here. Please, sit down.

283
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:13,564
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

284
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,503
Uh, yes, I do.
I have...

285
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,109
concerns.

286
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,384
If we're going
to go down this road,

287
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:24,022
and clearly we are

288
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,425
for the sake of
my brother-in-law.

289
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,798
I've heard about him.

290
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:29,699
He's an American hero.

291
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:34,070
At any rate,
I need some assurances

292
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,872
that we're gonna go
about this in a manner

293
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:38,741
that is extremely safe
and cautious.

294
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:42,011
Fair enough. I'll walk you
through the process.

295
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:43,246
First step is something

296
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,382
we like to call
money laundering, all right?

297
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:50,486
Take your money, represented
by, say, these jelly beans.

298
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,654
You know, I'm a bookkeeper-- Then I--

299
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,591
...so I actually know
what money laundering is.

300
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,925
Uh-huh.

301
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,461
Well...
Yeah.

302
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:01,696
And, as with most things,

303
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:03,799
the devil is in the details.

304
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,133
So to begin with,

305
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,936
what are we saying is
the source of this money?

306
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,837
That's simple.

307
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:13,107
Walt here actually
came up with a great story

308
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:14,308
about gambling winnings.

309
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,443
Blackjack, right?
Some card counting?

310
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:19,279
Well, actually,
that was Skyler's idea.

311
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:22,248
[clears throat] Well,

312
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:24,451
you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

313
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,486
Well, there you have it.

314
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,788
I'll generate

315
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,624
false currency
transaction reports

316
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:30,726
out the wazoo.

317
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,598
As well as
the necessary W-2Gs.

318
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:36,002
I know a couple casino managers

319
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:38,772
who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

320
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,107
It's a win-win for everyone.

321
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,944
Yeah, but you can't
sell that for very long.

322
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Way ahead of you.

323
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:48,684
We declare just enough
so as not to arouse suspicion,

324
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,955
then Walt's one-time winnings
become seed money

325
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,556
for an investment.

326
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:55,625
Investment in what?

327
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,894
Drum roll please.
Wait for it.

328
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,062
Laser tag.

329
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:02,934
Laser tag.

330
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:05,169
7,000 square feet
of rollicking fun

331
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,606
in the heart of northern
Bernlillo County.

332
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,676
Laser tag?

333
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,713
Yeah. There's guns
and glow lights and--

334
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,682
Kids wear the vests,

335
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:16,749
and they have to
split into teams--

336
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,451
Right. No, actually,
I know what it is.

337
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:21,155
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's--

338
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:24,525
I mean, it doesn't
make any sense.

339
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,095
It makes more sense
than you two being together.

340
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:29,097
I'm still trying to figure out
how that happened.

341
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:31,266
Do you even know Walt?
I mean...

342
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:34,970
how would he of all people
buy a laser tag business?

343
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:36,605
It doesn't add up.

344
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,473
It adds up perfectly.
Walt's a scientist.

345
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:40,175
Scientists love lasers.

346
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:43,445
Plus they got
bumper boats, so--

347
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,114
Hey, everybody.

348
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:48,651
Walt suddenly decided
to invest in laser tag.

349
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,219
Just out of the blue.

350
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,988
Really? That's what we're
supposed to tell people,

351
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:56,458
our family, our friends,
the government?

352
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:57,961
Let me bottom line
this for you.

353
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:00,464
You don't need to be involved.

354
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:03,035
Because I've been doing this
for a lot of years--

355
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,971
successfully,
believe it or not--

356
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:07,609
without your help.

357
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:10,446
So thank you for stopping by.

358
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,403
You want a beer or something?

359
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,407
Or something.

360
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,376
What do you mean?

361
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,744
[laughs]

362
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,546
Like beer.

363
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,015
[laughs]

364
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,416
I'm clean out of anything else.

365
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:47,523
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

366
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:50,527
Yeah.

367
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:52,696
I've heard it over

368
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:54,265
and over

369
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,167
and over again.

370
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:01,607
You know, don't you think
it's ridiculous

371
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:05,277
that society says beer is okay

372
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:10,183
and a little hit
of something sweet is wrong?

373
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,219
I mean...

374
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,689
what's the point of shutting
yourself off completely

375
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:18,860
from something that
lifts you off the ground?

376
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:25,335
I spend so much energy

377
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:29,907
fighting the urge not to use,

378
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,276
and I feel like crap
because of it.

379
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:39,151
I know. It's just...

380
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,286
What?

381
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:46,059
I can't get caught using again.

382
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,799
See, the thing is...

383
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,971
[whispering] not to get caught.

384
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,711
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

385
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:04,781
[exhales]

386
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:07,718
Just a little gas in the tank,

387
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:11,455
and suddenly...

388
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,224
everything is interesting.

389
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:18,530
Man, I wish I can make
that feeling last.

390
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,205
Like I said,
I got nothing here.

391
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,311
What if I could get some?

392
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:38,517
[door opens]

393
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:40,952
Mommy! Mommy!

394
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,253
Hey, B!

395
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:45,421
Oh, your Nana
brought you home early.

396
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,357
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today.

397
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:53,593
I was.
Then I saw your car.

398
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,327
I thought you had a meeting.

399
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:57,796
I did, but we changed the time.

400
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:00,031
Grandma, this is Jesse.

401
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,433
He's from the meeting.

402
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,301
He's like a sponsor.

403
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:05,370
Jesse, this is Grandma.

404
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:10,939
[speaks Spanish]

405
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:17,877
[speaking Spanish]

406
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:23,314
Jesse, this is Brock.

407
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:27,218
So, you, uh--

408
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,354
You have a kid, huh?

409
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:30,655
What's up?

410
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,890
Brock, huh?

411
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,625
That's a cool name.

412
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,962
Here.
Give it up.

413
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,273
Brock is almost 6.

414
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:55,109
You okay with kids?

415
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,610
What? Yeah, he's cool.

416
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,713
Okay, Brock is gonna
go play in his room

417
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,248
while the big people talk.

418
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:06,216
He's gonna go play with his
Legos and his cars

419
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,184
Say "Bye, Jesse."
Bye, Jesse.

420
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:22,849
Safe and cautious,
that's all I'm asking,

421
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:26,447
and that man is neither.

422
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:29,845
I'll admit, he comes across
like a circus clown.

423
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,077
But he actually knows
what he's doing.

424
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,942
Safe and cautious is you

425
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,874
not being involved
in this at all.

426
00:23:36,908 --> 00:23:38,573
Well, it's a little
late on that.

427
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:41,938
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

428
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:52,535
Skyler, this isn't just about
what happened before.

429
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:59,470
My involvement
in this is ongoing.

430
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,769
Understand?

431
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,402
I can't just quit.

432
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:11,967
I have something of a contract.

433
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,135
It's all very safe
and professional

434
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,802
and structured.

435
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:19,403
I can't simply quit.

436
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,967
Where are you going?

437
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:51,708
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt, at least do it right.

438
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:13,660
You worked here four years.

439
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:15,461
It's a business you understand.

440
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,429
It's a story
people will believe.

441
00:25:17,464 --> 00:25:20,365
Not laser tag. This.

442
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,300
This is what we buy.

443
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:24,869
You.

444
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:28,505
This is what you buy.

445
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:55,127
[muttering]

446
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,367
Hey, uh, Jesse, right?

447
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:04,169
Brandon. Peter.

448
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:05,804
How goes it?
Hanging in there?

449
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:08,940
Please, just--
Dumb ass.

450
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:12,577
Sorry, man. I was trying
to keep it on the DL.

451
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,915
So you and that girl,
you do the deed yet?

452
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,717
Do what?

453
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:22,554
You know, sell to her.

454
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,223
What are you two
even doing here?

455
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:29,260
What do you mean?

456
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:32,362
You can't get
your nut up to sell.

457
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:33,864
What's the point
of even coming?

458
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:36,700
Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.

459
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:38,001
Deuce, yo.

460
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:39,102
I'm catching up.

461
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:46,943
Whatever.

462
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:48,311
Later.

463
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,751
Dude needs to come
into the fold.

464
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,187
[Badger] Yep.

465
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,689
Oh, you know,

466
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,124
I have magical powers.

467
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,158
You want to see?

468
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,961
Ready?

469
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,766
That's not real.

470
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,338
[laughs] [whispers] It is real.

471
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,277
All right, do you want
to see something that's real?

472
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:20,012
Look at this.
Watch this.

473
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:22,515
Ready?

474
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:30,555
You like that?

475
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,625
That's science and stuff.
Makes it do that.

476
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,829
Do it again.

477
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:37,997
Let Jesse eat
his dinner, Brock.

478
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,998
It's okay.

479
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,099
It's okay.

480
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,533
Want to see it again?

481
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:43,535
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

482
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,370
Firecrackers.

483
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:50,610
You know, I don't have
any firecrackers on me.

484
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:51,946
Who does tricks
with firecrackers?

485
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,448
Tomás.

486
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:56,618
Tomás does tricks
with firecrackers, huh?

487
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:57,786
Who's Tomás?

488
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,087
He's my kid brother.

489
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,022
Yeah?

490
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,423
And we don't talk about him.

491
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,328
Come on.
Eat your food, Brock.

492
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,466
[Jesse] Can I have a chip?

493
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,001
I'm gonna steal your chip.

494
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,602
[Brock] Hey, that's mine.

495
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,141
[Saul] That's it?
That's what you want to buy?

496
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:19,909
[Walt] People will
believe it at least.

497
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,311
[chuckles]

498
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:23,380
I worked here for four years.

499
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:25,649
Wax on, wax off.
Was that you?

500
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:29,786
Hey, how come you guys always get
with the air freshener, huh?

501
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,654
I explicitly say
I want no air freshener,

502
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:32,989
and every time I drive away

503
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:35,058
smelling like an Alpine w3-- house.

504
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:40,163
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

505
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:43,496
Makes a better story
than your laser tag.

506
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:46,126
Is that you talking
or Yoko Ono?

507
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,458
She has a point.

508
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:51,096
It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

509
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,697
Based on her years
of experience

510
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,266
in money laundering, I suppose.

511
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,968
Let me tell you something.

512
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,404
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

513
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,273
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner.

514
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,975
And it worked
because I believed it.

515
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,678
It has nothing to do
with the story.

516
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,447
Besides, this dump
isn't gonna work

517
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,849
because it doesn't have
a Danny.

518
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,384
Okay?
There's no Danny here.

519
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,521
What in God's name is a Danny?

520
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,090
Danny runs the laser tag.

521
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,493
Danny is the guy
who had a vision.

522
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,994
Where others saw a dirt lot,

523
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:27,097
he saw black lights,
rubber aliens,

524
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,500
teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

525
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,902
It was like Bugsy Siegel
in the desert.

526
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,970
And when the stock market
took a shit

527
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,438
and Danny got into trouble,

528
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:37,040
he went searching for exactly

529
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:39,342
the type of situation
that we're offering.

530
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,678
Danny will look the other way

531
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:44,013
to keep his dream afloat.

532
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,783
In other words, Danny
can be trusted completely.

533
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:51,020
That guy-- the guy with the
eyebrows that won't quit--

534
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,155
is he a Danny?

535
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:53,456
[no audible dialogue]

536
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,991
You buy this place,

537
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,526
all you got is a big building

538
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,660
that squirts water.

539
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,162
You got no Danny here.

540
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,710
You want to stay for dinner?

541
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:15,778
Yeah.

542
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,047
Thanks.

543
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,649
What time is it?

544
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:23,953
Early still.

545
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,325
So...

546
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,064
[chuckles] What?

547
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:37,032
I thought maybe,

548
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,634
if you're holding,

549
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:40,536
we can do something.

550
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,972
What?

551
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:47,976
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about?

552
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:50,245
Maybe you had a line on some.

553
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,749
Wait. Whoa. What?

554
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,019
I thought you said
the kid is coming home.

555
00:30:58,054 --> 00:31:00,055
Yeah, in a few hours.

556
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,258
And you seriously
want to get high?

557
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:06,761
I don't know what you're
getting so pissed about.

558
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:09,231
You're the one who
brought it up the other day.

559
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:12,100
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

560
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:15,036
What kind of mother are you?

561
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:17,305
What?

562
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,973
You heard me.
What kind of mom gets wasted

563
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,608
with a little kid
to take care of?

564
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:28,215
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

565
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,085
You gonna come
in my house and judge me?

566
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,186
Like you got no responsibility,

567
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,754
so it's okay
for you to get high.

568
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:35,322
Look, I-- What do you know about me?

569
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,857
I take care of my baby.

570
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:38,158
I'll do anything for him.

571
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:42,696
The day Brock was born,
I swore...

572
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,732
I won't let what happened
to Tomás happen to my son.

573
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:48,801
I'll die first.

574
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:51,737
Sorry. I--

575
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:54,839
I just--

576
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:02,747
Look, I'll get out
of here if you want.

577
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:04,748
That's what you want
to do, then go.

578
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,750
It's not what I want.

579
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:11,053
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

580
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:24,064
We both were.

581
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:29,170
You're right.

582
00:32:29,204 --> 00:32:32,740
I don't know what
you've been through.

583
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:34,775
You can tell me if you want.

584
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,184
This whole neighborhood
is run by gangs.

585
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:45,293
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

586
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,870
And they sort of took Tomás in.

587
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,775
No dad around.

588
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,812
8 years old,
they got Tomás slinging.

589
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,948
Part of some crew.

590
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:08,721
Then, when he was 10...

591
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,624
for some initiation
or something...

592
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,028
they made him kill somebody.

593
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:21,934
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

594
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,101
[exhales]

595
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:27,572
But then I saw him,
like, a weekater.

596
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,312
He told me, yeah, he did it.

597
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,250
They gave Tomás a gun.

598
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,486
Gave him a choice.

599
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,289
Him or some dude.

600
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:47,926
So he did it.

601
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,896
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

602
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,134
Who did he say he killed?

603
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,936
Some dealer...

604
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:01,939
[smacks lips]

605
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,741
from some outside crew.

606
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,276
Right around the corner
from here,

607
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,212
over off the Central.

608
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,351
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

609
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,023
Off the Central?

610
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,528
Like, over by the train tracks?

611
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,298
When was this?

612
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,701
A few months back.

613
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,141
What else did he tell you?

614
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,915
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

615
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,119
Shot him dead.

616
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,325
Just because he was
working the wrong corner.

617
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,132
It won't happen again.

618
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,636
Not to my son.

619
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,734
[monitor beeping]

620
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,773
Guess what.

621
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,210
People who say "Guess what"

622
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:30,847
and then actually
expect you to guess--

623
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,782
I hate those people.

624
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,683
Well, I just heard

625
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:39,554
about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank

626
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:42,592
who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

627
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:45,463
Isn't that fantastic?

628
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:49,734
Are they planning on rolling me
out the front door at least,

629
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:51,669
or they'll put me
on a greased plank

630
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:53,471
and, uh, slide me
out the window?

631
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:54,906
Hey.

632
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,340
Listen, I don't care

633
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,643
what any damned
insurance company thinks.

634
00:35:58,677 --> 00:36:01,213
I'm not leaving here
until I'm well.

635
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,815
Hank, this isn't
about insurance.

636
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:06,017
I've talked to everybody,
and they all say

637
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:08,086
that you are healthy
enough to go home.

638
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,922
Oh, I'm healthy
enough, huh? Yeah.

639
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:12,024
Hank, you get stronger
every day.

640
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:14,260
You don't need to be
in a hospital.

641
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:17,730
In this condition, yeah, I do.

642
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:19,732
You'll be just as comfortable at home

643
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:20,833
as you are here.

644
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:22,568
You'll have all the same equipment--

645
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:24,337
All the same equipment?
What--

646
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:25,772
The equipment--
...does that mean?

647
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:27,073
...that you have here
that you need.

648
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,575
Short term.

649
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:31,044
You'll do your PT at home,

650
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,682
and it'll be great
because you'll be home.

651
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,018
Wait till you see the bedroom.

652
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:38,653
I had them move the plasma in.

653
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,955
I know that's how
you always wanted it,

654
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:43,424
and you only had to get shot
to get it, right?

655
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:45,626
I got you a new bed.

656
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,094
A hospital bed?

657
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,062
Well--

658
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:50,897
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

659
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:55,635
Hank, you'll be home.

660
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:58,672
You get that out of my house.

661
00:36:58,706 --> 00:37:00,941
You hear me, Marie?

662
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:02,576
Today.

663
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,477
Hank--

664
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:06,212
I leave this hospital

665
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:09,782
when I walk out of here,
you understand?

666
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:13,152
And not before.

667
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:18,591
[Skyler scoffs] What's a Danny?

668
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:20,759
Danny is an accomplice,

669
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:23,029
someone who's in on the scheme,

670
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:25,532
who knows about laundering,

671
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:29,335
who's paid to look
the other way.

672
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,003
Now, while I agree with you

673
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:33,540
that laser tag is a hard sell,

674
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:35,109
without a Danny,

675
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:37,346
the car wash
isn't really an option.

676
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,850
And he can't get you
another Danny

677
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,552
to run the car wash?

678
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:44,588
Easier said than done,

679
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:48,125
if we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

680
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:02,673
What about me?

681
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:07,512
What about you?

682
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,680
Me.

683
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:13,050
I'll be the Danny.

684
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:16,688
No. No. No, Skyler.
That is not a good idea.

685
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:19,157
I'm perfectly capable
of managing a small business.

686
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,226
A legal business, not this.

687
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,627
Who else could we trust?

688
00:38:22,662 --> 00:38:24,863
No.
Walt.

689
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:26,698
I'm in this.

690
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:29,867
And if I'm in it,
I'm going to do it right.

691
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:32,370
You are not in this.
You are not--

692
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:34,106
We're married.
How am I not in this?

693
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,708
We are not married,
Skyler. We're divorced.

694
00:38:45,752 --> 00:38:47,420
Right?

695
00:38:49,924 --> 00:38:55,596
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

696
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,202
Married couples
can't be compelled

697
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:03,571
to testify against one another.

698
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:07,575
So there's that.

699
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:33,567
Jesse!

700
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:36,264
Jesse.

701
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:38,697
Respirator.

702
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:41,229
Right.

703
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,803

708
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:11,177
Uh-huh.

709
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,108
Yes. All right.

710
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,441
Okay.

711
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,607
I'll be there.

712
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,145
What was that?

713
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,781
An invitation.

714
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:41,728
[doorbell rings]

715
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:47,801
Ah. Walter.
You're right on time.

716
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:49,669
Please, come in.

717
00:40:58,445 --> 00:41:01,280
I hope you like paila marina.

718
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:03,482
It's a fancy name
for fish stew.

719
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:06,752
It sounds like a cliché,

720
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,588
but indeed, it's just like
my mother used to make it.

721
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,529
Come on.
You can help me cook.

722
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,836
This is a Chilean dish
that I love,

723
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:27,873
but I never get to make it.

724
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:30,209
The kids won't eat it.

725
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:33,345
But, uh...

726
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:35,547
you know how that is.

727
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:38,050
Sure.

728
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:43,688
Do you mind?

729
00:41:43,722 --> 00:41:47,124
Would you slice the garlic?

730
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,993
Oh.

731
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:50,594
Very thin.

732
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:00,938
Why did you invite me here?

733
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,943
We're working together.

734
00:42:04,977 --> 00:42:07,579
Why not break bread together?

735
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:11,617
Now the garlic.

736
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:23,358
Mm.

737
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,693
Mmm.

738
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:31,497
It always amazes me
the way the senses work

739
00:42:31,531 --> 00:42:33,098
in connection to memory.

740
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:36,801
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

741
00:42:36,835 --> 00:42:38,169
Taken separately,

742
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:40,303
these ingredients alone
don't remind me of anything.

743
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:41,638
Hmm.
[chuckling]

744
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:42,939
Not very much at all.

745
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:46,709
But, in this
precise combination,

746
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:49,745
the smell of this meal instantly--

747
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,147
it brings me back to my childhood.

748
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:53,515
How is that possible?

749
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,118
Basically, it all takes place
in the hippocampus.

750
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,789
Neural connections are formed.

751
00:43:02,824 --> 00:43:07,860
The senses make the neurons
express signals

752
00:43:07,894 --> 00:43:11,230
that go right back to
the same part of the brain

753
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:13,232
as before,

754
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,668
where memory is stored.

755
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:21,006
That's, uh, something
called relational memory.

756
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:24,609
Uh...

757
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,710
don't quote me on that.

758
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:30,249
I-- I'm rusty on my biology.

759
00:43:30,283 --> 00:43:32,019
That's very interesting.

760
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:37,834
Walter,

761
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:39,838
I would like to help you,
if I could.

762
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:43,942
Help me how?

763
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:45,243
Well, when I first started out,

764
00:43:45,277 --> 00:43:47,011
I made a lot of mistakes.

765
00:43:48,114 --> 00:43:49,181
[sigh]

766
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:50,683
More than I care to admit.

767
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,588
I wish I'd had
someone to advise me--

768
00:43:53,622 --> 00:43:54,723
[chuckle]

769
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,262
because this life of ours,

770
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:00,732
it can overwhelm.

771
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,375
You are a wealthy man now.

772
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,720
And one must learn to be rich.

773
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:14,561
To be poor anyone can manage.

774
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:20,537
What advice do you have for me?

775
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:25,908
Never make
the same mistake twice.

776
00:45:08,424 --> 00:45:09,424
Hey.

777
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:12,695
What's up?

778
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:15,430
You, uh, you Tomás?

779
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,363
Heard you were the man.

780
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:19,429
Yeah? What you want?

781
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,826
Crystal.

782
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:26,922
You think you could hook me up?

783
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:29,721
300.

784
00:45:29,755 --> 00:45:30,720
For a teenth?

785
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:33,085
Shit, come on, yo.

786
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,987
300.

787
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,124
Tch.

788
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,209
Hey, what's up?

789
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:09,418
Hey.

790
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:19,764
[whistles]

791
00:46:30,376 --> 00:46:31,777
Bounce.

792
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:47,428
[breathing heavily]

793
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:58,341
