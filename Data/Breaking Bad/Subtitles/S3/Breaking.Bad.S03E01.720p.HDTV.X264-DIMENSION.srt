1
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,463
<i>We interrupt our scheduled
programming</i>

2
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:15,963
<i>to bring you breaking news.</i>

3
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,230
Good afternoon.

4
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:18,498
In the last several minutes,

5
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,767
KOB has received dozens of reports

6
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,302
of what appears to be
a crashed aircraft--

7
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:24,770
possibly two aircraft--

8
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,671
on Albuquerque's east side.

9
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:28,606
As of yet, details are scarce,

10
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,343
but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead,

11
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:34,313
followed by falling debris.
Visible now toward...

12
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:37,485
...crash investigators with the
National Transportation Safety Board

13
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,555
are expected on-site as
early as this evening.

14
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,722
But officials warn that,

15
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,690
with a debris field
of this magnitude,

16
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,458
the investigation and the
clean-up may well stretch--

17
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,560
...are now saying
that the Boeing 737

18
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,829
was being re-routed or vectored

19
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:51,131
through the airspace,

20
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,365
which is standard procedure,

21
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,067
according to a
spokesman for the FAA.

22
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:57,137
The eight-seat King Air 350

23
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,237
was a charter flight

24
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,205
operating out of
Saint George, Utah,

25
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:02,006
bound for Amarillo, Texas.

26
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,941
It sounded like hail.

27
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,743
Like heavy hailstones.

28
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:08,478
It was just, um...

29
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:10,379
bump-bump-bump all
over the neighborhood.

30
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:15,245
...indicating that the final
death toll now stands at 167.

31
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:17,543
<i>..67 muertos--</i>

32
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,578
...167.

33
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,014
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering

34
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,982
how such an accident
could take place

35
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,583
in a system with
so many safeguards.

36
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:26,818
Allegations continue
that the collision

37
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,686
which brought down Flight 5

38
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,922
was caused by improper
air traffic control.

39
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,291
The bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City today,

40
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,827
as the FAA confirmed,
it was, indeed,

41
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,496
a lone air traffic
controller's fateful mistake...

42
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,932
<i>...que el nombre del hombre
es Donald Margolis.</i>

43
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:44,800
...is Donald Margolis,

44
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,102
a 19-year veteran of the FAA's

45
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,438
Air Route Traffic Control
Center in Albuquerque.

46
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:52,640
...Margolis recently
returned to work

47
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:54,741
after a five-week absence,

48
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,776
which was due to, quote,
a personal loss.

49
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,278
While it's now known

50
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,879
that Margolis had recently
lost a daughter...

51
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:02,780
<i>...to a drug overdose
a month before.</i>

52
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:06,116
<i>His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,
aged 26,</i>

53
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,584
<i>apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.</i>

54
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,086
<i>And friends of the family say the
death of his only child</i>

55
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,822
<i>hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

56
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:17,391
<i>Coming as it did little more
than a month before,</i>

57
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:19,192
<i>many are questioning the timing</i>

58
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,027
<i>of his return to work,</i>

59
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,261
<i>and are wondering how much
blame truly lies</i>

60
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,929
<i>with those who let this
grieving father--</i>

61
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:49,338
No. No, no.

62
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:17,832
I usually open

63
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,133
with "So sorry you're here."

64
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:23,701
Where would you like to begin?

65
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,903
I really just need this
quick and easy, you know?

66
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:31,873
As quick as something
like this can be.

67
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,074
Okay.

68
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:34,909
Is that mutual?

69
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,577
Does your husband
go along with that?

70
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,113
Does he know?

71
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:41,381
Well, I mean,

72
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,883
he certainly knows
we're separated, so--

73
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,517
Has he moved out?

74
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:47,819
We're in the process
of moving him out.

75
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:48,853
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

76
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,021
And in the meantime, my--

77
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,022
my son and my daughter

78
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:55,090
and I are staying with my sister.

79
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,725
So you've moved out?

80
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,228
Well, yes, just temporarily,

81
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,062
only so he could get his things.

82
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:03,532
That was supposed
to happen last week,

83
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,734
but then came the crash, and--

84
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:06,868
Oh, God.

85
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:08,270
You weren't one of the-- Right--

86
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,940
Yeah. Right beneath
the flight path.

87
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,277
And, um...

88
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:15,918
uh, we had debris land in our yard

89
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,322
and all of our neighborhood,
so-- Mmm. Terrible.

90
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,457
Yeah. Apparently, even, um...

91
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,360
you know, parts of bodies,

92
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:28,065
and so I certainly
couldn't bring myself to--

93
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,567
So awful. I know.

94
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,737
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back, but it's time.

95
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:35,938
And, um,...

96
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:38,807
I'm sure we're driving my sister
and her husband up a wall.

97
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:41,676
Well, you definitely want
to maintain residency

98
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:42,977
in your actual home.

99
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,946
It just puts you in
a better position

100
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,547
in regards to custody.

101
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:47,915
Two children, you said?

102
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:50,016
Yes. Holly here,

103
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:53,119
and then I have a
son in high school--

104
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:54,754
Walter Junior.

105
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:58,252
They need to stay with me.

106
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:00,753
Okay.

107
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:01,885
How long have you been married?

108
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,781
Sixteen years.

109
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,383
And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?

110
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,252
Mm-hmm. Do you own outright?

111
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,887
Do you have a mortgage? Yes.

112
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,222
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have, um...

113
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,890
maybe 15 years on it.

114
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,559
What about other debts or assets?

115
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,561
Do you feel you have
a good understanding

116
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,697
of you and your husband's
financial situation?

117
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,004
Is your husband employed?
You know what? Here's the thing.

118
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,972
I-- I'm really not looking

119
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,608
for any, sort of, uh,
loopholes or-- um--

120
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,076
I don't know-- just-- No.

121
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:38,045
No loopholes.

122
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,613
I just intend

123
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,047
that every one of my clients

124
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,016
get a full and honest accounting

125
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,617
of what it is they owe

126
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:47,086
and what it is they own.

127
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,155
To that end, I say

128
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,956
let's leave no stone unturned.

129
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:57,229
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

130
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:44,767
Hey, Walt?

131
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:47,870
Hey. Hey, buddy, there you are.

132
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:50,072
Listen, I, uh-- You know, well--

133
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,408
It's, uh...time.

134
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,851
The s---tiest week since 9/11,
okay? Bar none.

135
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,019
Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

136
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:07,320
I mean, I speak with some authority

137
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:08,688
because we definitely
had some s---ty weeks

138
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:09,989
in the past few months, you know?

139
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,957
But this here, I mean,
call, you know--

140
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:14,426
call freakin' the Guinness
Book of World Records--

141
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,827
Call freakin'-
Am I talking too much?

142
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,162
Am I? I am, right? I am.
I know. Look, look.

143
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,831
But this situation between
you and, uh-- uh--

144
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,669
I'm not asking, by the way.

145
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:24,404
Okay? It's none of my business.

146
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:26,572
I do not want to get in
the middle of you two.

147
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,340
I'm just saying-- Listen,
listen-- Okay?

148
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,509
You beat a little tactical retreat.

149
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,543
Yeah?

150
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:32,711
And regroup.

151
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,446
And then-- bong.

152
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,048
You know, absence makes the--

153
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:47,056
I'm pulling for you,
you know? I'm pulling--

154
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,529
Whoa, whoa. No heavy lifting.

155
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:55,696
I got it. No, it's okay.

156
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,064
I got it.

157
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,900
J----.

158
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,835
What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

159
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:06,839
Half a million in cash.

160
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:15,513
That's the spirit.

161
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,183
I got it. I got it.

162
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,386
Whoo.

163
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,523
Who's here for self-improvement?

164
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,294
Come on, give me a show of hands.

165
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:51,133
Who among you is here hoping

166
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,334
they can actively
improve who they are?

167
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,307
Right.

168
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:01,908
See, that's your first mistake.

169
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,279
You should be here to
learn self-acceptance.

170
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,787
Hey, honey, you, uh--

171
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,388
you want another waffle?

172
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,090
I still got the iron out.

173
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,660
I could cut up some bananas.

174
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,863
<i>Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler,
Flynn, and Holly.</i>

175
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:28,131
<i>Please leave us a message.</i>

176
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,599
<i>Uh, hey. Hello, everybody.</i>

177
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:34,402
<i>Good morning.
I was just checking in</i>

178
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:35,736
<i>and thought I'd pass along</i>

179
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,904
<i>the current contact information.</i>

180
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:40,474
<i>I mean, certainly, you can always
reach me on my cell.</i>

181
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,543
<i>I've always got that on me.</i>

182
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:44,945
<i>But in terms of a mailing address,</i>

183
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:46,913
<i>I'm here at The Beachcomber.</i>

184
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,248
<i>And you know what?
It's actually very nice.</i>

185
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,716
<i>It's very pleasant.</i>

186
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,184
<i>Not as high end as the Oakwood,</i>

187
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:53,652
<i>but, you know, not as corporate--</i>

188
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,920
Oh, hey, would you please just-

189
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,155
Hey, Dad. It's me.

190
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:00,424
No, I'm not okay.

191
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,426
I don't know what the h- -
is going on.

192
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,060
Nobody's telling me jack s- -
around here.

193
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:06,295
Hey, Flynn. What-- Whatever.

194
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,630
I-- I don't even care anymore.

195
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:11,132
Can-- Can you just give
me a ride to school?

196
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,267
I'll take you to school.

197
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,169
Yeah. No.

198
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,470
I-- I'm ready now.

199
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:19,105
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

200
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:22,476
All right. I'm here.

201
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,077
See you soon.

202
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:47,903
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

203
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:49,305
<i>As all of you know,</i>

204
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,209
<i>last week our city suffered
a terrible tragedy,</i>

205
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:54,345
<i>one that none of us
will ever forget,</i>

206
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,247
<i>which is why today we're
going to take</i>

207
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,682
<i>a little time out of our schedule</i>

208
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,718
<i>to gather in the gym and talk.</i>

209
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,890
I just find it,

210
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,859
you know, really--

211
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,829
really hard to concentrate

212
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,999
because of all the horrors,

213
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,701
you know, we perceived.

214
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:18,037
It just really gets
inside your brain, and--

215
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:21,138
In college they have
this thing where,

216
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,271
if your roommate kills himself--

217
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:25,003
like, if you come home

218
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,471
and find him hanging in
the closet or whatever--

219
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:31,439
it's basically, like,
an automatic "A" for you.

220
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:35,005
And I just think that that
kind of compassion is--

221
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,038
is something to-- Okay.

222
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,306
Thank you, Barry.

223
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,639
Who wants to go next?

224
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,508
Hmm?

225
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:43,942
No judgments, guys.

226
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:45,276
Just feelings.

227
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,876
You can say anything and everything

228
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:49,377
that's on your mind.

229
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:50,578
Anyone?

230
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,082
There you go, honey.

231
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,853
I just keep asking myself--

232
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,022
Honey, could you please stand up?

233
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,661
Just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

234
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:13,631
I mean, if there's a God and all,

235
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:15,932
why does he allow all
those innocent people

236
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,632
to die for no reason?

237
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,698
Okay, can we just keep
it secular, honey?

238
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:24,933
Anyhow, I haven't really
been sleeping much.

239
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,101
Does anyone else have that?

240
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,906
I just keep hearing that-
that sound.

241
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,742
That boom.

242
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,379
It just plays over
and over in my head

243
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,946
like it won't ever stop.

244
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:48,052
Thank you, sweetheart.

245
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:50,654
Is there anyone else?

246
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,594
Uh-- --

247
00:18:57,628 --> 00:19:01,664
My neighbor, he heard the crash,

248
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:03,600
and he ran out to his front yard,

249
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,302
and he found, like, this seat--

250
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:08,471
you know, like, an airline seat.

251
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,473
Like one you have on an airliner?

252
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:13,076
Well, anyway, the seat was standing

253
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,244
perfectly upright
in his front yard,

254
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,813
right next to his Sea-Doos--

255
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:18,514
because, like, he has Sea-Doos--

256
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,282
But...

257
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,650
there was still a pair of legs

258
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,386
buckled into them.

259
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,821
Human legs.

260
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:30,490
J---- H. C-----.

261
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,760
You okay?

262
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:36,595
Yeah. Sorry. I-- um--

263
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:39,097
I was just moved.

264
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,000
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

265
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:45,335
Certainly this tragedy

266
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,570
didn't only affect our students.

267
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,506
Mr. White, would you
like to say something?

268
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,209
And by the way, welcome back. Hmm?

269
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:07,518
It's so good to have you back.

270
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:21,398
Uh...

271
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:26,103
I guess what I-- I would--

272
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,638
Sorry. Sorry.

273
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,848
I guess what I would
want to say is...

274
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:38,918
to look on the bright side.

275
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:45,723
First of all, nobody on
the ground was killed.

276
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:49,191
And that-- I mean,
an incident like this

277
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:52,157
over a populated urban center--

278
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:55,091
That right there,
that's-- that's just gotta be

279
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,758
some minor miracle, so--

280
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:01,192
Plus, neither plane was full.

281
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,860
You know, the-- the 737 was--

282
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,061
was what? Uh,

283
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:06,829
maybe two-thirds full, I believe.

284
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:07,829
Right? Yes?

285
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:10,398
Or maybe even three-quarters full.

286
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,867
Well, at any rate,

287
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,771
what you're left
with casualty-wise is

288
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:19,374
just the 50th worst air disaster.

289
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:22,514
Actually, tied for 50th.

290
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,286
There are, in truth,

291
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,394
53 crashes throughout history

292
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:34,334
that are just as bad or worse--

293
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:35,436
Tenerife?

294
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:36,772
Has anybody--

295
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:38,141
anybody hear of Tenerife?

296
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,143
No?

297
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:45,447
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s

298
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,750
crashed into each
other on Tenerife.

299
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:52,756
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?

300
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,991
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.

301
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:56,293
And we're talking
about two of them.

302
00:21:56,327 --> 00:22:01,098
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

303
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:04,334
Doesn't any of you even
remember it at all?

304
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,803
Any of you? I doubt it.

305
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:07,803
You know why?

306
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:10,105
It's because...

307
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,641
people move on.

308
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,412
They just move on.
And we will, too.

309
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,983
We will move on,
and we will get past this

310
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,820
because that is what
human beings do.

311
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:23,291
We survive.

312
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:26,627
And, uh...

313
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,728
We survive, and-- and we--

314
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:30,563
we overcome.

315
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:31,664
Yeah.

316
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,866
We survive.

317
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,334
We survive, and--

318
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:36,368
Thank you.

319
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,436
Okay.

320
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,771
Thank you.

321
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:41,839
Good.

322
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:17,144
Well...

323
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:21,716
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

324
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:27,555
Fine, I guess. Oh.

325
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:30,291
You make sure you say hello
to her for me, will you?

326
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,693
Why don't you just come inside?

327
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:33,827
It's your house.

328
00:25:35,763 --> 00:25:36,762
No, I--

329
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,029
He's gone.

330
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:19,902
Hey, Flynn!

331
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,373
Tricks. It's an expression.

332
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,908
How are you?

333
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:28,645
Why do you gotta
treat him like this?

334
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,347
Why you gotta be like this?

335
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,148
Why can't you just talk,
even? Hey, hey, hey.

336
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:33,616
Cool down.

337
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:35,118
Okay. Okay.

338
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:49,198
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

339
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,937
Wow.

340
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,739
You know, try not to
hold it against him.

341
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:57,873
You know, I mean,

342
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,576
the poor kid, he's probably just

343
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,945
dying of curiosity.

344
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:05,147
You know, and I guess it would be

345
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:08,349
natural for him to wonder.

346
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,682
I mean, he's probably
just wondering, you know,

347
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,718
what is it that could have
gone so wrong-- Marie.

348
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:14,687
...that my mother
would leave-- Marie.

349
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:17,056
I can't help you get
through this, Skyler,

350
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,292
you know, if you won't tell me

351
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:21,227
what it is that Walt did.
Well, you know what?

352
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:23,965
I don't-- I don't remember
asking you, all right?

353
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,700
Well, I think that's-
So if you want to be supportive,

354
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,837
...the reason you're stuck.
you could be supportive without prying,

355
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,672
that would be really great-
Prying, okay.

356
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:32,408
...and so-- Well, prying's a
strong word, but I don't--

357
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,609
...helpful.

358
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,350
It's that...

359
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:44,018
voice inside your head.

360
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,756
It's that sneaky,
rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.

361
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,292
You guys know what
I'm talking about.

362
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:56,596
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

363
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,336
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to...

364
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,305
be what, President
of the United States?

365
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,209
Well, okay, so maybe
you're not that good.

366
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:09,612
But now are you good enough

367
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,115
to deserve your share of
basic human happiness?

368
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,750
Are you good enough to be okay

369
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:18,220
with who and what you are?

370
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:20,088
I say yes.

371
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,996
But it doesn't matter what I say.

372
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,664
It's your voice,

373
00:28:28,698 --> 00:28:30,632
which means you're the
only one that hears it,

374
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,268
which means that you're the
only one that can fight it.

375
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:35,170
Right?

376
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,139
Jesse...

377
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,507
we never hear from you.

378
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,043
What's going on?

379
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:42,911
You can tell me I'm full of s---.

380
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:44,880
It's okay. I don't mind.

381
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:46,915
Just-- Come on.

382
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,150
Let us in on it.

383
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:59,327
So, like, what makes
you the expert?

384
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:02,430
I don't think I ever
said I was that.

385
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,032
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

386
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:07,902
Telling us thus and so,

387
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:12,039
be happy, forgive yourself,
blah, blah, blah.

388
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:15,009
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

389
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:19,947
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever,

390
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:23,384
but did you...

391
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:25,553
ever really...

392
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:27,054
hurt someone?

393
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:31,492
I killed my daughter.

394
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:41,101
It was July 18...

395
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:43,471
which is my birthday.

396
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:47,374
July 18, 1992.

397
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:50,210
I was high on cocaine,

398
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:51,345
and I was drunk.

399
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:53,113
Cocaine wasn't an issue

400
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,614
because I had bought myself 2 grams

401
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:56,716
the night before as
a birthday present.

402
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:57,918
I had plenty left.

403
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:00,687
But I was out of vodka.

404
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,722
And this is in Portsmouth,
Virginia,

405
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:06,192
where instead of selling
liquor in the supermarkets,

406
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:09,462
they have these ABC stores
which close at 5 p.m.

407
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:13,166
And right then it was, like, 4:42.

408
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:18,037
So I'm arguing with my wife--

409
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:20,406
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.

410
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,041
"It's my birthday.

411
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:24,110
"Come on.

412
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,112
They're not gonna sell it to me."

413
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:29,649
She's saying, "No, no."

414
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:34,320
So I'm p---ed,
and the clock is ticking,

415
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,222
so I jump in my truck.

416
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:38,858
She's--

417
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:40,493
my 6-year-old daughter...

418
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:44,696
She's playing at the
end of the driveway.

419
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,000
So...

420
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,908
How do you not hate yourself?

421
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:00,678
I did hate myself...

422
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:01,946
for a long time.

423
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:05,683
But it didn't stop me from...

424
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:07,619
drinking and getting high.

425
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:09,521
It just made it that much worse.

426
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,625
Self-hatred, guilt,

427
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,994
it accomplishes nothing.

428
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,464
It just stands in the way.

429
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:22,366
Stands in the way of what?

430
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:24,902
True change.

431
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:58,268
Skyler, hi.

432
00:31:58,302 --> 00:31:59,936
Is this a good time to talk?

433
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,973
Yeah. Come in, please.

434
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:10,914
Skyler.

435
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,818
Um...

436
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:33,168
Do you want to start?

437
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,646
Okay.

438
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:07,068
Why-- Why are you doing this?

439
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:09,304
Why are you even thinking this way?

440
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:11,673
Is it to punish me?

441
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:14,108
I am not punishing you, Walt.

442
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:17,679
This is punitive is what this is.

443
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:19,080
We are happily married.

444
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:21,282
I am happily married.

445
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:22,683
I am happy.

446
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,919
We're just--

447
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:34,328
I love you, Skyler,

448
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:37,298
and I would do anything for you.

449
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:42,336
Would you even consider--

450
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,172
I mean, J----!

451
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:46,373
You come in here,

452
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:48,842
and you wave these
papers in my face,

453
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:51,211
when there's a whole other

454
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:54,148
entire side to this thing.

455
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,150
There's your side,
and there's my side.

456
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,285
And you haven't heard my side yet.

457
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,853
You haven't heard any of it at all.

458
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:01,255
You're a drug dealer.

459
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,694
No. What-- How--

460
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:09,863
What?

461
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:20,573
Yeah.

462
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,179
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

463
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:32,118
Marijuana.

464
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,255
That Pinkman kid.

465
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:44,732
No?

466
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,537
Oh, my God, Walt.

467
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:54,275
Cocaine?

468
00:34:58,414 --> 00:35:00,114
It's methamphetamine.

469
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,586
But I-- I'm--

470
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,954
I manufacture.

471
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,455
I am not a dealer.

472
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,858
Oh.

473
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:11,760
Per se.

474
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:14,263
It doesn't--

475
00:35:14,297 --> 00:35:15,698
No, Skyler.

476
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:17,166
Listen to me, Skyler. No.

477
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,901
Listen. No.

478
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,703
There are a lot of
angles to this, okay?

479
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:23,839
It's complicated,
all right? So please, let's--

480
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,840
Please, let's just sit back down,

481
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,174
and we'll talk it through.

482
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,443
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

483
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:32,277
I won't tell Hank,

484
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:35,512
and I won't tell your
children or anybody else.

485
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,546
Nobody will hear it from me,

486
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:40,281
but only if you grant
me this divorce

487
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:41,582
and stay out of our lives.

488
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:43,017
No, Skyler. I mean it.

489
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:47,321
Now let me the h-
out of here before I throw up.

490
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,552
Your windshield's broken.

491
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,957
Yep.

492
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:39,367
A little friction in
the marriage right now.

493
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:40,935
Strictly temporary.

494
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,537
We're just--

495
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,072
just taking a little break.

496
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:48,678
Uh, that's you over there.

497
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:53,617
Listen, um, money.

498
00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:56,555
Saul has got it for you,

499
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,324
and so as so as you're
feeling better--

500
00:36:58,358 --> 00:36:59,492
I'm better.

501
00:37:00,894 --> 00:37:02,795
You're better.

502
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,597
Really?

503
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:07,601
What? The rehab? It helped?

504
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:10,004
Yeah. I'm done using.

505
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,942
That's excellent. That's--

506
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:17,778
That's very good, Jesse.

507
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:20,081
Boy-- Very good.

508
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:23,885
You know, um...

509
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:28,522
in spite of how bad things got,

510
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:31,492
it really could be looked at

511
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:33,427
like a wake-up call for th of us.

512
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:36,798
I mean, you know, just to get our--

513
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:38,367
our lives back together again

514
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:42,138
and on the straight and narrow.

515
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:48,012
You been following
this airplane crash?

516
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:51,548
Yeah.

517
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:54,450
You know it was Jane's dad

518
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,218
who accidentally
crashed them together?

519
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:58,452
Because he was so torn up?

520
00:37:58,486 --> 00:37:59,952
Okay, look, let me stop you

521
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,553
right there, all right?

522
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,794
You are not responsible for this--

523
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,895
not in any way, shape,
or form, all right?

524
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,530
Now, I-- I am very
up-to-date on this thing,

525
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:12,864
probably far more than you are,

526
00:38:12,898 --> 00:38:16,565
and there are-- there are
many factors at play there.

527
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,697
Yeah?

528
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:19,165
For instance,

529
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,997
there's some sort
of collision radar

530
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:25,864
on the jet that may not
have been working properly.

531
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:27,797
Now, that's public record.
You can look that up.

532
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,398
And the whole system

533
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,932
is run on-- on 1960s technology.

534
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:33,600
No.

535
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:35,999
No, really...

536
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:37,332
I blame the government.

537
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,167
You either run from things,

538
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,936
or you face them, Mr. White.

539
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,805
And what exactly does that mean?

540
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,039
I learned it in rehab.

541
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:53,176
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

542
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:56,912
I accept who I am.

543
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:58,380
And who are you?

544
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:01,650
I'm the bad guy.

545
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:30,704
Is the food to your satisfaction?

546
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:31,771
Very much.

547
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:33,706
It's good to see you again.

548
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:38,878
May I?

549
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:48,853
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

550
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:54,959
I actually am not here to--

551
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:04,032
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect

552
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,001
to tell you this personally.

553
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:10,638
I'm done.

554
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,042
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

555
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:19,346
I find you extraordinarily
professional,

556
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,548
and I appreciate the
way you do business.

557
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:24,716
I'm just...

558
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:26,618
making a change in my life

559
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:29,787
is what it is, and I'm--

560
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:33,390
I'm at some-
something of a crossroads.

561
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:37,793
It has brought me to a realization.

562
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:43,064
I am not a criminal.

563
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:48,668
No offense to any people who are.

564
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:51,104
But...

565
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,207
this is not me.

566
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,844
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

567
00:41:02,914 --> 00:41:05,081
It won't change my mind. I'm sorry.

568
00:41:05,115 --> 00:41:07,450
$3 million

569
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:09,518
for three months of your time.

570
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:14,889
Three months, then out.

571
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:22,662
3 million?

572
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:28,933
May I take this as a yes?

573
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:39,275
I have money.

574
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:41,676
I have more money than
know how to spend.

575
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:47,080
What I don't have is my family.

576
00:41:48,783 --> 00:41:50,618
The answer is still no.

577
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:58,763
Enjoy your meal.

578
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:06,406
Thank you.

579
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:13,301
What the h--- is going on in there?
