1
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:37,257
I am awake.

2
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:41,361
You are not how I
remember you from class.

3
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:42,929
I mean, like, not at all.

4
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:53,006
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.

5
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,975
My guy wants 85.

6
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:59,679
This is all the money
I have in the world.

7
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:02,049
You are a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

8
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:06,420
Buy the RV.

9
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,556
We start tomorrow.

10
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:21,001
Work it, work it, baby.

11
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:22,869
Yo, this is sick, brother.

12
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:24,104
Totally.

13
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:25,872
God.
 Yo, Jesse.

14
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:29,843
I got these two fine ladies
want to participate.

15
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:31,178
You got the funds?

16
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,512
Oh, I got the funds.

17
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:35,782
Hey, would you ladies
like to meet my fat stack?

18
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:42,923
Get in here. Come on.

19
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,157
Hey, yo, yo.

20
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,059
Yo, you got champagne?

21
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:47,360
None of that cheap stuff.

22
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:48,795
I want the expensive shit.

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,397
Don Perig-non.

24
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,932
It's 400 a bottle.

25
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,101
Oh, well, in that case,

26
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:55,602
I'll only have two.

27
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:58,438
Oh, and I want
the tall, skinny glasses.

28
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:02,242
I like those skinny glasses.
That's what James Bond drinks.

29
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:05,312
Mofos, I'm all about that.

30
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:08,982
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

31
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,750
Where'd you
get all the cheddar?

32
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:13,053
Must be moving mad volume.

33
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,221
It's totally funny.

34
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:15,355
You want to know what's funny?

35
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,356
What's funny?

36
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,592
This old dude,
he gave it to me.

37
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,893
What?
He gave it tme.

38
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,661
It's, like,
his entire life savings.

39
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,196
What? Why?

40
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:25,499
Because he's a dumb-ass.
That's why.

41
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,900
Oh, God.

42
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:32,906
Yes! Whoo! All right,
living large, players.

43
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:37,971
Thank you.

44
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,773
No, thank you.

45
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:45,178
That was--

46
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,485
...awesome, bro.

47
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:56,623
Later.

48
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:58,225
Oh, man.

49
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,961
Oh, I'm so dead.

50
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:04,598
I only got-- oh, damn.

51
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,570
I only got, like, 1,400.

52
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:14,040
Waffle House, yeah.

53
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:16,576
No, man.

54
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:19,479
I'm supposed to use that
dude's money to buy an RV.

55
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:22,749
What you want with an RV for?

56
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,751
'Cause it's like--

57
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:29,656
It's like-- never mind.

58
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,258
Jesus.

59
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,827
Now I've got to,
like, leave town

60
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,196
or change my identity
or something.

61
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,799
Guy's blackmailing me.

62
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:44,437
He's got, like,
a criminal mind, yo.

63
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:47,274
RV, huh?

64
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,075
I can hook you up, bro.

65
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,011
I can totally get you an RV.

66
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:53,647
No, I need it today-- now.

67
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:57,017
No problem. Let's go.

68
00:04:57,051 --> 00:05:00,020
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

69
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,255
For 1,400 at 6 in the morning?

70
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,833
Right on.

71
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,102
So do I need to sign
something or something?

72
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:52,839
Nah, it's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

73
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:58,645
Pleasure doing business
with you.

74
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,081
Mm.

75
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,049
Come on, we gotta bounce.

76
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:05,118
What? For real, yo.
Get it out of here.

77
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:43,119
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>

78
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:57,937
Oh, my God,

79
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,006
I love this floor.

80
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,477
This feels fantastic.

81
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,313
Can you control
the temperature?

82
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:11,384
Uh, yeah, there should be a
switch right next to you there.

83
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:13,353
It's a thermostat.

84
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:20,426
Ted...

85
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:26,065
This has got to be the most
amazing invention ever.

86
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:30,470
I know. Contractor talked me
into it.

87
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:35,842
Seemed kind of extravagant,
but I gotta tell you,

88
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:39,846
once you try it,
you can't go back.

89
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,483
I can never find anything
in this Buick.

90
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:49,589
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

91
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,682
Why don't you go get your dad?

92
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,817
Sure.

93
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,593
Hey, Dad.

94
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:29,595
Dad.

95
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,698
Uh, yeah.

96
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:34,000
Um, Mom's asking,

97
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,569
want to come to dinner?

98
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,538
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

99
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,647
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

100
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,315
<i>Yeah, right,
like you don't know.</i>

101
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,451
Wha-- What did I just say?

102
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,752
Give me the phone.
Give it.

103
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:56,055
Like you didn't make
some deal behind my back.

104
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,724
<i>Correct. I did not.</i>

105
00:08:57,758 --> 00:09:00,026
I was sitting at a stoplight,

106
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,395
minding my own business,
when the man th--

107
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:03,496
uh, the man--

108
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,599
the kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

109
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,534
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

110
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,403
<i>Let me talk to him.
I owe you--</i>

111
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,505
I owe you nothing,

112
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,107
and I will get
to the bottom of this.

113
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:15,775
<i>Trust me.
Trust you?</i>

114
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:17,143
Trust you? That's a good one.

115
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:18,778
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I'm going to do.

116
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,279
You want to talk about trust,
Jesse?

117
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:21,914
Let's talk about trust.

118
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,117
I told you
not to cook my formula,

119
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:25,618
and you went ahead
and did it anyway.

120
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,987
'Cause I never said
I wouldn't cook it

121
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,624
'cause it ain't yours.
It's ours. Plural, bitch.

122
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,593
<i>You did not have
my permission.</i>

123
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:36,696
Alls I know is I got
half the money I'm due,

124
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,097
and you got the rest.

125
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:40,333
Escalating--
You're escalating.

126
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,534
You know what?
Escalate this.

127
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,770
My meth, my money!

128
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,671
<i>I will be a one-man
glass factory.</i>

129
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,207
<i>I will rock that RV
24--</i>

130
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,973
It's buttoned up tight.

131
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,242
Can't see a damn thing.

132
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,945
I ain't feeling it.

133
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:01,314
No smoke, no smell, no waste.

134
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:02,949
There's no cook.

135
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:04,984
Could be they're setting up.

136
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:07,086
I heard movement inside.

137
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,621
I say we call it a night,

138
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:10,356
come back
with a search warrant.

139
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,559
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

140
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:16,429
There's got to be a way.

141
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:19,031
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a way.

142
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,105
Hey-- Hey, hey.

143
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,593
Oh, no, no, no, no.

144
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,595
What the hell
you doing up there?

145
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:24,964
You some kind of a pervert?
Shit.

146
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:47,920
Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

147
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,260
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

148
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,528
All right, I'll tell you what.

149
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:56,963
We're gonna check out
a couple more.

150
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,764
Then we're gonna call it a morning.
Okay? What do you say?

151
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,466
Can't. Gotta get home.

152
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,802
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

153
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,571
Gotta pack.

154
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:09,075
Where you headed?

155
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:11,911
Texas.

156
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:33,966
Hey, there.

157
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:37,937
Hank?

158
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,942
Hank?

159
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:56,088
Can I come in?

160
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,491
Hey, babe.

161
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,826
Hey.

162
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:02,328
How did it go last night?

163
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:03,462
Good.

164
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:06,132
Catch the bad guys?

165
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,634
Uh, nope.

166
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,136
Want me to make you
some breakfast?

167
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,272
Nah. I'm--

168
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,541
I'm heading back out
after this.

169
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Now?

170
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:19,011
You worked all night.

171
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,513
Get some sleep, Hank.

172
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:22,014
Those RVs
aren't going anywhere.

173
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:24,183
They're recreational vehicles,
Marie.

174
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:25,851
That's what they do.

175
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,753
You know what I mean.

176
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,924
I spoke with Blanca.

177
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,628
She said that Steven's
going to El Paso?

178
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

179
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:44,937
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

180
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,239
I turned it down.

181
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:48,507
End of story.

182
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,975
Good, good.

183
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,078
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

184
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:53,846
Yeah, well, I needed
some time here

185
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,581
because I'm deep
into this investigation

186
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,983
and couldn't do both,

187
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:59,652
so I made a judgment call.

188
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:10,162
You know that you can talk
to me about things, right?

189
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,698
You don't have to go
through this alone.

190
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:17,703
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone

191
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,705
before you nuke them?

192
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,207
Jesus, Marie.

193
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,342
I made a decision.

194
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,845
I'm not going through anything.

195
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,247
I'm doing my job.

196
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,648
I would like--

197
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:32,718
I know, I know, a condo in Georgetown.
I know.

198
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,120
If you would let me finish,

199
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:38,924
I was going to say
I'd like to be included.

200
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,893
That's all.

201
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:43,462
Don't you worry
about my career.

202
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:44,964
My career is just fine.

203
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:48,100
Did you not want to go?

204
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,972
I don't blame you.
I just--

205
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,274
Aren't you late for work
or something?

206
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,009
I mean,
what happened last time,

207
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,244
it would make perfect sense

208
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,678
for you to not want to go back.

209
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:02,281
I'm on to some important
stuff right here, right now,

210
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:04,416
and Mexico doesn't have
a damn thing to do with it.

211
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,519
Anyone who doubts that--

212
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:09,088
I'm doing some actual good
out here,

213
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,157
and all I get are
these bullshit accusations!

214
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:15,294
What, everyone thinks I'm jerking
off on this thing? Fine.

215
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:17,296
But I'm onto something.
I know it.

216
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,965
You understand me?

217
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,867
You hear me?

218
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:31,110
What exactly is this?

219
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,584
I'll tell you
what I think it is.

220
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:45,824
A ploy. A ploy to get me
cooking again...

221
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:47,693
And an obvious one at that.

222
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:50,396
How do you mean?

223
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,531
As if I would seriously believe

224
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:55,401
you would hire an addict.

225
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,269
Jesse Pinkman?

226
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:58,637
Recovering or not--

227
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:00,539
You vouched for him previously.

228
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:01,607
I took you at your word.

229
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,642
No, no, no, no,
let me be clear.

230
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:06,478
Let me be perfectly clear.

231
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:10,582
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

232
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:15,387
Trusting him
with a solo venture,

233
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:20,159
that's quite another matter.

234
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:25,798
How he could possibly produce anything
other than a mediocre product at best.

235
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:29,334
I am told his product was
more or less consistent

236
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:32,004
with the quality
I had come to expect.

237
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:34,840
More or less?

238
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:38,043
More or less? Really?

239
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:39,178
Wow.

240
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,815
Boy, that is the--

241
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,316
Talk about setting the bar low.

242
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:49,254
Except you don't do that--

243
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:52,724
set the bar low.

244
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:58,096
Therefore, what conclusion
am I left to draw? Hm?

245
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:00,098
That you believe

246
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:03,635
I have some proprietary
kind of selfishness

247
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,671
about my own formula.

248
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,005
Hm?

249
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,343
Some sort of overweening
pride, I suppose,

250
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:12,678
that you think

251
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:16,415
simply overwhelms me,

252
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:19,318
clouds my judgment.

253
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:20,652
But it doesn't.

254
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:23,322
Absolutely not.

255
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:25,991
I simply respect the chemistry.

256
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,829
The chemistry
must be respected.

257
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,235
I apologize for being
so transparent.

258
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:42,374
Would you take a drive with me?

259
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:44,376
I'd like to show you something.

260
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,289
Hi. Is everything okay?

261
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:33,091
She's already finished
an entire bottle,

262
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,260
but she still seemed hungry.
Than she fell asleep.

263
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,664
I was thinking I'd give her
another when she wakes up.

264
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:40,232
Yeah-- yeah, yeah,
absolutely.

265
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,401
Absolutely.
Fatten that baby up.

266
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,236
<i>Will do.</i>

267
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:51,043
Um...was that it?

268
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,378
So where are you.
Are you at work?

269
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:55,347
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.</i>

270
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:57,416
<i>I-- I shouldn't be
much longer.</i>

271
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,984
<i>Is that okay?</i>

272
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:01,086
You know I love
my little Pookums.

273
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,322
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years

274
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:04,523
as far as I'm concerned.

275
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:07,259
<i>Great.</i>

276
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,461
Thanks, Marie.

277
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,366
Are you-- Are you sure
you're okay?

278
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:19,004
<i>Sweetie, what is it?</i>

279
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,372
<i>Come on.</i>

280
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:23,075
It's Hank.

281
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:24,543
<i>What about him?</i>

282
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:27,379
I don't know

283
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:29,982
how to talk to him.

284
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:31,817
I don't know
what to say to him anymore.

285
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:33,785
I don't know how to--

286
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,053
Ever since El Paso--

287
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:39,024
Ever since maybe before...

288
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:41,026
Yeah.

289
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,962
God knows he went
through a lot down there.

290
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:45,964
People blown up
right in front of him,

291
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:49,735
blood everywhere,

292
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,370
and last week

293
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,604
El Paso said
they want him back.

294
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,172
<i>Yeah?</i>

295
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:57,676
He's not going.
Steve Gomez is going in his place, and...

296
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:01,380
I don't know how I feel
about that.

297
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:05,751
Well, he's certainly
a lot safer up here, isn't he?

298
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:09,721
<i>Of course,
and I want him safe.</i>

299
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:12,090
I can't tell what he wants.

300
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,393
He won't talk to me.

301
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,927
He hardly even comes home.

302
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:17,462
He works all day, all night.

303
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:20,265
Barely eats,
barely speaks to me.

304
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,268
<i>It's like something's
eating him away from inside.</i>

305
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:25,270
He's just not the same.

306
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:28,674
He's not.

307
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,709
Facing death,
it changes a person.

308
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:33,278
It has to, don't you think?

309
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,215
I guess you've notice
a change in Walt.

310
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:09,715
Please.

311
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,959
What is this?

312
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,597
Your new lab.

313
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:11,770
My God.

314
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:26,318
Thorium oxide...

315
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:29,554
for a catalyst bed.

316
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:34,392
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

317
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:35,861
Why, that's got--

318
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:38,163
that's got to be 1,200 liters.

319
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,134
Where-- Where--

320
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:47,405
How did you know how
to put this all together?

321
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,407
I had excellent help,

322
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:51,343
as will you.

323
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,114
Quite a lot of planning
went into this.

324
00:24:57,316 --> 00:25:00,518
I would say so.

325
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:01,853
The laundry upstairs--

326
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:03,455
I've owned it for years.

327
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:06,591
It receives large chemical
deliveries on a weekly basis--

328
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,126
detergent and such.

329
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,363
There is
nothing suspicious about it,

330
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:15,467
and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

331
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:20,005
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

332
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,375
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam,

333
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:25,243
just as the laundry does,

334
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:27,412
and through
the very same stacks.

335
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:33,018
I need 200 pounds per week

336
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:35,220
to make this
economically viable.

337
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:38,890
You would choose
your own hours, of course,

338
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:41,559
come and go as you please

339
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:43,728
so long as the quota is met.

340
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,550
Sorry.

341
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:08,219
The answer is still no.

342
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:19,998
I have made a series
of very bad decisions,

343
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,267
and I cannot make another one.

344
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:24,502
Why did you make
these decisions?

345
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:27,105
For the good of my family.

346
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,908
Then they weren't
bad decisions.

347
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:35,747
What does a man do, Walter?

348
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:42,187
A man provides for his family.

349
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:45,190
This cost me my family.

350
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:48,293
When you have children,
you always have family.

351
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:51,496
They will always be your
priority, your responsibility,

352
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,600
and a man-- a man provides.

353
00:26:58,738 --> 00:26:59,904
And he does it

354
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,741
even when he's not appreciated

355
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:05,176
or respected

356
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:07,445
or even loved.

357
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,249
He simply bears up,
and he does it...

358
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:15,487
because he's a man.

359
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:37,593
Any chance we could
grab a quick bite?

360
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:39,662
Thai place around
the corner's pretty good.

361
00:27:39,696 --> 00:27:42,965
Um, I really gotta head home.

362
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,968
All right, rain check, then.

363
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:08,891
She said it was the tofu.

364
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:15,665
Whatever.
She's still cute anyways.

365
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:24,440
Uh, great-- great dinner, Mom.

366
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:25,508
Yeah.

367
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:31,614
Um, can I be--
can I be excused?

368
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:34,283
To do homework
or to play videogames?

369
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,252
I can multitask.

370
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,588
Yeah.

371
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:40,990
Go ahead.

372
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:29,772
You want to take her?

373
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,217
Yeah.

374
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:15,818
Mm-hm.

375
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:44,747
Give me something, Andy.
Come on.

376
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:46,949
Please tell me you're joking.

377
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:56,058
Welded onto the back of a house.
Wow, that's classy.

378
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,726
Christ.

379
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:01,030
Okay. Okay, thanks.

380
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,678
Hey, Janice. Janice.

381
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,249
That the last one?

382
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,484
Yeah.

383
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:23,452
Sorry, hank.
That's all DMV had--

384
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:26,622
29 early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

385
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:28,724
Could you check again?

386
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:31,660
Now?

387
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:33,462
Can I do it after the party?

388
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,731
Janice, I'm--

389
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,233
I'm dead in the water here.

390
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,935
Okay, I'll check.

391
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,770
Thanks.

392
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:02,658
Gomie, time for the little
bird to fly the nest, huh?

393
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:05,995
They got the right guy
for the job,

394
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,464
specially since the bean-speak
comes natural and all.

395
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,966
Wanna know how to say
"Get bent" in Spanish?

396
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:13,903
Just don't go native on me,
all right?

397
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:19,175
Oh, uh--

398
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:22,011
Hey, uh--

399
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:23,746
here.

400
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,516
Know your enemy and all.

401
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,727
Fight the good fight, brother.

402
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:40,029
I will.

403
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,966
What have we got to drink
around here?

404
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:55,177
Your hunch was right.

405
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:57,880
One more RV.

406
00:32:57,914 --> 00:33:00,382
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed,

407
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,218
but then they realized
it was never filed

408
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:04,620
as non-operational
or destroyed.

409
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,121
No police report, either.

410
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:33,942
I just don't know

411
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:36,879
what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

412
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:39,782
It's like I'm paralyzed,

413
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:42,584
like if I take a step
in any direction,

414
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,689
I'm going to make
a spectacular mistake.

415
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:51,126
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

416
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:54,897
You want to go to--

417
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:56,332
Sorry, never mind.

418
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:03,472
Anyway, breaking news is

419
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:06,108
I am sleeping with my boss,

420
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:08,744
and I don't know why.

421
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:10,679
Wow.
Yep.

422
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:16,652
That's a lie.

423
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,354
I do know why.

424
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:24,093
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

425
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:27,663
He's--
He's a really good person,

426
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,366
but, I mean, it's not
like we're ever gonna--

427
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:36,972
Somehow, and I can't
actually believe it,

428
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:40,042
but my entire family

429
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:42,044
sees me as some sort of--

430
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:45,814
my own sister,

431
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:47,249
my brother-in-law.

432
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:50,119
My teenage son

433
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:51,587
tells me I'm a bitch.

434
00:35:53,957 --> 00:35:57,092
And you say tell him the truth.

435
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:01,997
Tell him about his father,

436
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:05,534
but I can't...ever.

437
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,570
How could I?

438
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,139
And this man that I'm seeing,

439
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:13,475
you know,
as wrong as I know it is,

440
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,377
as much as I know
I'm probably doing it

441
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:16,712
just to make Walt leave me,

442
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:21,150
it is the only thing in my day

443
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:23,218
where I don't feel...

444
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:29,091
like I'm...

445
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:31,627
drowning.

446
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:38,700
So he knows
about this other man?

447
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,302
Yeah.

448
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:44,373
So then he'll sign?

449
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:49,011
Um, Walt says
he's not going anywhere,

450
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,145
so that's a--

451
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,481
that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part.

452
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,149
Yep.

453
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:55,951
Genius.

454
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,296
He keeps money in the house.

455
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:12,267
Your husband, the drug dealer?

456
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:15,003
How much money?

457
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:16,872
I didn't count it.

458
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:18,907
It's-- It's heavy.

459
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,945
The bag where he keeps it.

460
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:29,184
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

461
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,019
No. God, no.

462
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:34,022
I-- No, I'm just, you know--

463
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:37,593
I'm just trying to just
talk it through. That's--

464
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:40,162
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified

465
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:42,097
and twice the price
of a therapist.

466
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:44,266
There is nothing
to discuss here, Skyler.

467
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,601
I'm just saying, you know?

468
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:49,004
We have a history.

469
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:51,206
He's the father of my children,

470
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:54,243
and maybe what he did, he--

471
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:57,412
He did it for the family.
Right?

472
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:58,647
Well, guess what.

473
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,450
That is one enormous load
of horse shit.

474
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:03,051
Okay.

475
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,988
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

476
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,723
You are a fool

477
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:09,157
to stay in that house

478
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,360
one minute longer.

479
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:13,762
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

480
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:16,398
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

481
00:38:16,432 --> 00:38:17,599
You are culpable.

482
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:18,867
You, your children,

483
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:21,003
you could lose everything
you own.

484
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:23,238
Do you understand?

485
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:26,208
All courtesy of this criminal

486
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:28,777
you refuse to divorce.

487
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:30,646
I didn't marry a criminal.

488
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,148
Well, you're married
to one now.

489
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:53,542
Hows about we run through
this thing one more time,

490
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,478
especially the part
where I do all the talking

491
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:56,679
and you don't say jack?

492
00:39:56,713 --> 00:39:58,381
Oh, I'm going to say jack.

493
00:39:58,415 --> 00:39:59,582
I'm going to say plenty.

494
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:02,051
What did we say about
escalating, huh?

495
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:03,519
Who's got your back here, hm?

496
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:05,821
Me. All right?
I'm going to take care of things.

497
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:09,325
Hey, what are the parameters of
this sobriety thing you got going?

498
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,659
What do you mean?

499
00:40:10,694 --> 00:40:11,927
Can you take a Xanax?

500
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:13,162
'Cause I got
a drawer full of them.

501
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:17,166
I get them
from my "chiropractor."

502
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,502
Vietnamese, 5 foot tall,

503
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:22,204
she adjusts you to completion.

504
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,107
Her name's Kim Nu Suong,

505
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:29,512
as delicious as it sounds.

506
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:32,148
I should give you her card.

507
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,383
To hell with this.

508
00:40:34,418 --> 00:40:37,887
Uh--

509
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:39,789
Send him in.

510
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,494
Hello, Walt.

511
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:46,629
Good to see you.

512
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:51,233
Please, have a seat...
here.

513
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:53,135
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

514
00:40:55,138 --> 00:40:56,505
You're late.

515
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,609
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

516
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:02,411
There's always a way to oil
everyone's lock.

517
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,447
This young man

518
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:05,948
is prepared to offer you

519
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:07,216
a sweetheart of a deal

520
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,685
doing precisely nothing.

521
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,886
Really?

522
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:12,922
10 percent
of all future profits

523
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:15,658
from his solo venture

524
00:41:15,692 --> 00:41:17,026
is money you get paid

525
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,761
for walking down
to the mailbox.

526
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:22,131
Consider it
a gesture of respect

527
00:41:22,165 --> 00:41:23,866
for your valuable contributions

528
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,134
to the business thus far.

529
00:41:25,168 --> 00:41:27,703
I'm sure you'll agree
that's fair.

530
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:30,906
That's charity,
is what that is.

531
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,641
I do all the work.

532
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:35,678
He sits around on his fat a--
judging people.

533
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:38,047
Hey, hey, hey. Escalating.

534
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,448
Stop.

535
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:41,016
Sohere's that,

536
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:43,252
but then there's
one small detail.

537
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:45,354
Clearly a mistake was made

538
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:46,956
on the part
of our mutual associate

539
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,458
when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

540
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:51,227
He must not have realized
that you two

541
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,129
had come to a parting
of the ways.

542
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:56,132
Take it.
It belongs to you.

543
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,634
You're damn right
it belongs to me.

544
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:01,303
I knew I could count
on you boys to play nice.

545
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:03,873
That's-- That almost brings
a tear to my eye.

546
00:42:03,907 --> 00:42:07,276
Enjoy it.
Spend it in good health.

547
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,947
That is the last money you'll
ever earn in this business.

548
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,049
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

549
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:18,320
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Jesse,

550
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:21,824
but our mutual associate

551
00:42:21,858 --> 00:42:26,128
was only using you
to get to me.

552
00:42:26,163 --> 00:42:27,363
What are you talking about?

553
00:42:27,397 --> 00:42:32,568
You see, he needs someone
with expertise,

554
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:35,137
someone
who knows what he's doing.

555
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:38,874
In other words, he needs me.

556
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:41,610
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

557
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,946
Yeah, uh--

558
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,347
How should I put this?

559
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,520
I'm in. You're out.

560
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,526
Whoa, whoa, Walt,
hold on there.

561
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:58,961
Uh, what was the offer,

562
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:01,730
if I may ask?

563
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:04,567
It's, uh, 3 million

564
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,602
for three months of my time.

565
00:43:06,636 --> 00:43:08,938
What You're gonna need
that money laundered, right?

566
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:10,239
I mean, of course.

567
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:11,574
What was our deal before?

568
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:13,509
17 percent.
That's a shade high.

569
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:15,711
Let's settle on an even 15.

570
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:17,112
That's a nice round number.

571
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:18,347
5 percent.

572
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,815
14's fair.
5.

573
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:21,283
13.
5.

574
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:22,985
12.
For old time's sake, 12.

575
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:24,620
5.

576
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:27,423
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

577
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:29,625
10 even, but I can't go
any lower

578
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:31,060
and still respect myself.

579
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:33,596
5. What in the hell
just happened?

580
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,332
You're my lawyer, not his!

581
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:37,833
That's the way
of the world, kid.

582
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:40,002
You go with the winner.

583
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,037
You think this'll stop me
from cooking?

584
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:44,039
Cook whatever you like...

585
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:48,110
As long as it's that ridiculous
"Chili P" or some other drek,

586
00:43:48,144 --> 00:43:51,647
but don't even think
about using my formula.

587
00:43:51,681 --> 00:43:54,850
Just try and stop me, bitch.

588
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:46,669
Yes?

589
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:48,003
Hi, there, uh, Mrs. Ortega?

590
00:44:48,038 --> 00:44:49,038
Yes.

591
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:50,372
Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

592
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:52,274
I'm with the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

593
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:54,643
We're interested in an RV

594
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:56,712
that's registered
to your name and address.

595
00:44:56,746 --> 00:44:59,515
Uh, do you have an RV?

596
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:00,783
I did.

597
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:02,718
It was stolen months ago.

598
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:06,422
Stolen, huh?

599
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:09,825
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

600
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:11,360
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police

601
00:45:11,394 --> 00:45:12,594
or the DMV.

602
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,731
I just...
didn't get around to it.

603
00:45:15,765 --> 00:45:17,232
May I ask why?

604
00:45:19,002 --> 00:45:22,104
I mean it's a-- it's a great
way to get the family together

605
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:23,605
for an affordable vacation.

606
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,607
It must've been quite a blow
when it went missing.

607
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:28,877
It was.

608
00:45:28,912 --> 00:45:30,579
Do you have any ideas at all

609
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,014
who might've taken it?

610
00:45:34,384 --> 00:45:36,952
I didn't want him arrested.

611
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:38,354
He ran with a bad crowd,

612
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:41,457
but he was never a bad person.

613
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:44,126
I thought he could
turn his life around.

614
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,028
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

615
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:48,997
My son.

616
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:52,401
I'd really like to speak
with him.

617
00:45:52,435 --> 00:45:53,836
He's passed away.

618
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,971
He was shot two months ago.

619
00:45:58,274 --> 00:45:59,641
What was your son's name?

620
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:00,709
Christian.

621
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:04,747
Christian Ortega.

622
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:07,483
Was his nickname "Combo"?

623
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:18,193
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.

624
