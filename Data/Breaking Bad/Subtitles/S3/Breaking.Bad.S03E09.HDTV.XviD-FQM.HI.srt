00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,295
Been working a lot.
I got a job.

180
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,463
[Group Leader]
Job is good.

181
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:20,132
It's in a Laundromat.

182
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,367
It's totally corporate.

183
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,968
Corporate Laundromat.

184
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:25,271
[Jesse]
It's, like, rigid.
All kinds of red tape.

185
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:29,241
My boss is a dick.
The owner? Super dick.

186
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,976
I'm not worthy or whatever
to meet him,

187
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,912
but I guess everybody's
scared of the dude.

188
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,247
The place is full of
dead-eyed douche-bags,

189
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:36,449
the hours suck,

190
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,317
and nobody knows
what's going on,

191
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,919
so...

192
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:42,822
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

193
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:46,592
Yeah.

194
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,627
Totally Kafkaesque.

195
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,632
Majorly.

196
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,604
Ooh, from the U.S. attorney
in Santa Fe.

197
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:00,740
Very nice.

198
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:04,610
We've got
all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

199
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:08,280
This is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

200
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:10,282
Look at these Hank.
Aren't they beautiful?

201
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,484
Beautiful.

202
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:13,452
Wow, look at the size
of this basket.

203
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,955
It's got so many
goodies in it.

204
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:17,623
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels

205
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:19,725
and cheese sticks

206
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,628
and some some fancy
designer olives.

207
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:23,963
You had me
at cheese sticks.

208
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:26,465
Mmm, you're going to have
to fight me for those, Hank.

209
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,901
"Get well, and best wishes
from Ted Beneke

210
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:31,737
and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

211
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:35,241
Wow, he gives you
all this time off,
and now this?

212
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,409
Get me a job there.

213
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,910
I know. He's great.

214
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:39,211
Boss hall of fame.

215
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,414
I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

216
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,249
They're going to have
to get on the stick.

217
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,383
[knocking on door]

218
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,919
How's everybody doing today?

219
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,220
Good. We're good.

220
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,422
How are you?

221
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:51,257
I'm very good.

222
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,758
Hi, Hank.

223
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:55,261
Just going to do a quick
peripheral response,
all right?

224
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:56,395
See where we're at.

225
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,597
Moment of truth, huh?
[chuckles]

226
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,466
Yeah.
I wouldn't call it that.

227
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,603
All right, let's just
take a look here.

228
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:07,940
All right.

229
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:10,409
All right,
I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

230
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:17,283
All right.

231
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:19,318
How about this?

232
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:24,957
Okay.

233
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,326
How about now?

234
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,596
Do that one again,
would you?

235
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,565
Right there?

236
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,569
Yeah, yeah, I feel it.
A tingle.

237
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,204
Okay, on a scale
of one to ten,

238
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,905
ten being your normal
level of feeling

239
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,440
and one bein
no feeling at all.

240
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:44,310
Oh, I don't know.

241
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,578
A four?

242
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:48,247
Okay, four. Okay.

243
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:52,585
And how about there?

244
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:55,921
Yeah. Um, a six.

245
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,056
Okay, good.

246
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,392
And here?

247
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:05,598
Yeah, still there.
A little less.

248
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:07,032
A three.
Okay.

249
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,435
All right, good.

250
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:11,904
Thank you very much, Hank.
Good, good.

251
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:15,241
So this is good news,
right?

252
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,209
Oh, yeah,
definitely.

253
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:22,448
It looks like
some nerve function
is returning.

254
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,583
Oh, thank God.

255
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:27,620
All right, so when do we
get him walking again?

256
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:38,230
Marie, it's important that
we manage our expectations.

257
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,867
We're talking about
months of very hard work,

258
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:44,970
and even then the odds,
they're not great.

259
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:47,206
But you can't know
for sure.

260
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,374
No.

261
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,075
When does he start
physical therapy?

262
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,879
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.
It's high priority.

263
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,549
We should have
pre-authorization
the next few days.

264
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,551
Certainly by early next week.

265
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,985
[Marie]
Next week?

266
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,621
No, that's not
going to do it.

267
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:05,057
I've looked into this.

268
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,792
The sooner
physical therapy begins,

269
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:08,561
the better his chances are.

270
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,529
He needs daily sessions.

271
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:11,730
Isn't that right?

272
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,132
Well--
Actually,

273
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,667
your plan's treatment program

274
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,569
covers four sessions a week.

275
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:21,240
Actually,
she asked the doctor.

276
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:25,911
Plan-wise,
four sessions a week
is fairly typical.

277
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:29,148
And the therapists
in your network
are mostly fine.

278
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:32,117
Mostly fine? Okay.
There's a ringing endorsement.

279
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:37,523
Look, if Hank had
more physical therapy,

280
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:39,525
with better therapists,

281
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,861
wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

282
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:47,967
It's very hard to say, Marie.

283
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:52,538
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

284
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,873
Is it absolutely optimal?

285
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:58,210
Yo5 know, screw it.

286
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,045
I'm going to make sure
he gets what he needs,

287
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
and they can just
reimburse me later.

288
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:04,883
Mrs. Schrader,
I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

289
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:08,220
But my best advice
is stay in the network.

290
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:09,488
Don't go out of pocket.

291
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,890
Physical therapy
is just the beginning.

292
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,561
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home,

293
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:18,230
occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

294
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:21,900
It could run into
the hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

295
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,569
So what?

296
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,904
We're just supposed
to compromise on his care?

297
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:29,508
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's
procedures,

298
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,143
they may never
pay you back.

299
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:33,178
I've seen patients
and their families
go bankrupt,

300
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,514
waiting to be reimbursed.

301
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:38,817
Who is the best
physical therapist
that you know?

302
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:41,186
I can give you some names.

303
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,522
But they're not likely
to be on your plan.

304
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:44,923
To hell with the plan.

305
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,241
[door chime dings]

306
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,377
Yeah, there he is.

307
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:07,946
Finally. I went ahead
and started without you.

308
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,183
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

309
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:14,887
Kick off your shoes.
Lay back. Exfoliate.

310
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:15,921
Maybe later.

311
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:17,056
So, where's the maestro?

312
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,557
Out parking the mini-van?

313
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,858
What do I look like,
his shadow?

314
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:21,060
Who cares where he's at?

315
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:22,728
What am I doing here?

316
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,564
Well, I was going
to have you two flip a coin,

317
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:29,702
but since the genius
can't be bothered,

318
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:31,503
today's your lucky day.

319
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,906
Look around, kiddo.
It's all yours.

320
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,444
What? This?

321
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:42,514
Yeah. You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

322
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:43,849
For free?

323
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:45,517
Free?
Ladies, cover your ears.

324
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:48,787
No, not free.

325
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:51,190
Look, hey,
this is a squeaky-clean,

326
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:53,859
highly profitable--
at least potentially--

327
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,327
local institution,

328
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,196
looked upon with favor
by the Chamber of Commerce.

329
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,697
Better Business Bureau.

330
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,867
At $312,000, it's a steal.

331
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:04,203
312,000?

332
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,871
Don't you get it?

333
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,073
On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

334
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:12,945
On the inside,
it's the best money laundry
a growing boy could ask for.

335
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:16,281
Wait, wait.

336
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,250
Wait.

337
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:19,885
Ladies, thank you.
Thank you. Good job.

338
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,186
Come back here.

339
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:23,722
Sit. Come on.

340
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:27,826
Humor me here for a second.

341
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:30,429
Now, you know you need
to launder your money,
right?

342
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,232
Do you understand
the basics of it?

343
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,434
Placement, layering,
integration?

344
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,504
I ain't buying
no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

345
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,439
You want to stay
out of jail, don't you?

346
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:43,175
You want to keep
your money and your freedom.

347
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,843
Because I got three
little letters for you.

348
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:46,178
IRS.

349
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,480
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

350
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:51,517
Hey, look.
Here's you, right?

351
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,185
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

352
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,187
Okay, here's your cash.

353
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,856
You're out on the town.
You're partying hearty.

354
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,858
You're knocking boots
with the chickie babes.

355
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:03,228
Oh, who's this?
It's the tax man.

356
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,197
And he's looking at you.

357
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,532
What does he see?

358
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:09,201
He sees a young fellow
with a big, fancy house,

359
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:12,204
unlimited cash supply,
and no job.

360
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,407
Now what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

361
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:17,209
I'm a drug dealer.

362
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,744
[imitates buzzer]
Wrong.

363
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,546
Million times worse.

364
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,548
You're a tax cheat.

365
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:25,050
What do they do?
They take every penny,

366
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:28,220
and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

367
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,023
Ouch.
What was your mistake?

368
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,592
You didn't launder
your money.

369
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,494
Now, you give me
your money.

370
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,496
That's called placement.

371
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,698
Hand me that
little thinGod bin.

372
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,769
This is the nail salon,
right?

373
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,504
I take your dirty money

374
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:49,908
and I slip it into the salon's
nice, clean cash flow.

375
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:52,177
That's called layering.

376
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:53,378
Final step, integration.

377
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,748
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner.

378
00:19:56,783 --> 00:20:00,519
That's you.
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed

379
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:03,522
into nice, clean,
taxable income,

380
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:07,693
brought to you by
a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

381
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:13,532
So you want me
to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

382
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:14,800
I'm a criminal, yo.

383
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:18,203
Yeah, and if you want
to stay a criminal

384
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:20,539
and not become,
say, a convict,

385
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:23,542
then maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

386
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:27,579
Right, so you can get
your 5%.

387
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:28,881
No, that's 17%.

388
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:30,883
I heard you say 5.

389
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,551
You said it
right in front of me.

390
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:33,886
Yeah. That was
for your partner.

391
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,721
It's privileges
of seniority and all.

392
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:39,591
But for you, it's the usual.
17%, and that's a bargain.

393
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,493
Hey, what, you--
Hey, listen to--

394
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:44,563
Come on, I'm talking to you
about your future here.

395
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:46,665
Listen to reason.

396
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:30,275
How is your
brother-in-law?

397
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:34,880
He'll live.

398
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:37,549
Good. I'm glad.

399
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:43,822
Walter, you seem troubled.

400
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,524
How can I help you?

401
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:52,364
I asked to see you
in order to...

402
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,734
clear the air.

403
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:59,871
There are some issues

404
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:03,175
that could cause
a misunderstanding between us,

405
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:07,279
and I think it's
in our best interest

406
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:10,382
to lay the cards
on the table.

407
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:14,052
That's the best way
to do business.

408
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:19,224
My brother-in-law,

409
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,560
moments before
he was attacked--

410
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:23,562
someone called to warn him.

411
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:29,234
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

412
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:35,240
Those two men, the assassins--

413
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:38,543
I believe
I was their prime target,

414
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:41,980
but that somehow
they were steered away from me

415
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:44,082
to my brother-in-law.

416
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:52,024
Because of this intervention,

417
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,426
I am alive.

418
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,631
And yet I think
that this person

419
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,367
was playing
a much deeper game.

420
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:08,840
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout,

421
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,043
not a silent assassination.

422
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:14,212
In one stroke

423
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:17,115
he bloodied both sides,

424
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,385
set the American
and Mexican governments

425
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,487
against the cartel,

426
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:25,190
and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine

427
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:26,425
to the Southwest.

428
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:33,165
If this man had
his own source of product

429
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,400
on this side of the border...

430
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,005
he would have the market
to himself.

431
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,144
The rewards would be...

432
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:47,379
enormous.

433
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,356
We're both adults.

434
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:01,059
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

435
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:09,734
I want there to be
no confusion.

436
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,605
I know I owe you my life.

437
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:22,047
And more than that,

438
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,483
I respect the strategy.

439
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:29,921
In your position,

440
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:31,523
I wouldn't done the same.

441
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:43,135
One issue which troubles me--

442
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,273
I don't know what happens

443
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,609
when our three-month
contract ends.

444
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,779
What would you like
to happen?

445
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,483
You know why I do this.

446
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,622
I want security
for my family.

447
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,323
Then you have it.

448
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:07,025
Three million
for three month.

449
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,693
That was our agreement.

450
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,662
Extended annually,

451
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:14,466
twelve million a year.

452
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,601
Call it fifteen.

453
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,770
Open-ended.

454
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:20,739
Would that be agreeable?

455
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:53,205
[motor accelerating]

456
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:25,704
[truck horn blares]

457
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:27,339

[exhales]

460
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,652
Part of the reason we talk
about what gets us riled up<i>,</i>

461
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:07,887
in our daily lives

462
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,489
is to help each other
put a finger

463
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:13,393
on what our relapse triggers
might be,

464
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,895
head off our disease
before it comes back.

465
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:21,167
So... anyone?

466
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,570
Free license
to bitch and moan.

467
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:26,272
How often do you get that?

468
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:30,543
Jesse, last time
you seemed pretty down

469
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:32,178
about your job
at the Laundromat.

470
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,312
Let me ask you something.

471
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:36,082
If you had the chance
to do anything you wanted,

472
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:37,450
what would you do?

473
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:41,254
Make more green, man,
a lot more.

474
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:43,523
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

475
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:47,460
Um...

476
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:52,365
I don't know.

477
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,069
I guess I would make something.

478
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:58,738
Like what?

479
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:04,243
Not that it even matters,
but...

480
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:08,448
work with my hands,
I guess.

481
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:11,417
Building things,
like...

482
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:14,420
carpentry or brick laying
or something?

483
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:18,825
I took this vo-tech class
in high school,

484
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,059
wood working.

485
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:23,663
because it was just
a big Jesus--,

486
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:27,200
but this one time
I had this teacher

487
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:31,070
name of, uh...

488
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,172
Mr. Pike.

489
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:39,145
I guess he was, like,
a Marine or something
before he got old.

490
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,346
He was hard of hearing.

491
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,084
My project for his class

492
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:49,055
was to make this wooden box,

493
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:53,659
you know, like a small--

494
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:55,461
just like a-- like a box,

495
00:28:55,496 --> 00:28:57,830
you know, to put stuff in.

496
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:01,033
So I wanted to get the thing
done just as fast as possible.

497
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:04,670
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester,

498
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,138
and he couldn't flunk me

499
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:10,843
as long as I, you know,
made the thing.

500
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:12,512
So I finished it
in a couple days.

501
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:16,582
It looked pretty lame,

502
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:18,317
but it worked,

503
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:20,620
you know, for putting stuff in
or whatnot.

504
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:27,159
So when I showed it
to Mr. Pike

505
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:28,794
for my grade,

506
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:34,500
he looked at it
and said,

507
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:37,670
"Is that the best you can do?"

508
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:39,739
At first I thought to myself,

509
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:40,873
"Hell, yeah, bitch.

510
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:43,075
"Now give me a D and shut up

511
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,745
so I can go blaze one
with my boys."

512
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,880
[group chuckles]

513
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:51,984
I don't know.

514
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,721
Maybe it was the way
he said it, but...

515
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:56,923
it was, like, he w--

516
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:58,324
he wasn't exactly saying
it sucked.

517
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:01,561
He was just asking me
honestly,

518
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:04,630
"Is that all you got?"

519
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:08,868
And for some reason
I thought to myself,

520
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:11,904
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"

521
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,940
so I started from scratch.

522
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:15,174
I made another,

523
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,043
then another,

524
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:18,177
and by the end of the semester,

525
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:21,380
by, like, box number five,

526
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,215
I had built this thing.

527
00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:26,552
You should've seen it.

528
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:28,287
It was insane.

529
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:32,291
I mean, I built it out of
Peruvian Walnut

530
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:35,361
with inlaid Zebrawood.

531
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:37,563
It was fitted with pegs,
no screws.

532
00:30:37,598 --> 00:30:41,367
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

533
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:43,803
Then I rubbed all the wood

534
00:30:43,837 --> 00:30:47,540
with tung oil so it was
rich and dark.

535
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:49,375
It even smelled good.

536
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:50,810
You know, you put nose in it

537
00:30:50,844 --> 00:30:52,878
and breathed in,

538
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:54,513
it was--

539
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,884
It was perfect.

540
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,053
What happened to the box?

541
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,825
I, um--

542
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:07,827
I gave it to my mom.

543
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:12,365
Nice.

544
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,467
You know what I'm going to say,
don't you?

545
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,836
It's never too late.

546
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:21,140
They have art co-ops
that offer classes,

547
00:31:21,174 --> 00:31:24,143
adult extension program
at the university.

548
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:27,113
You know, I didn't give
the box to my mom.

549
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,718
I traded it
for an ounce of weed.

550
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:44,096
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage
to a hero.

551
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:45,965
They'll say
they're not denying coverage.

552
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,566
No, no,
I'm agreeing with you,

553
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:50,870
but I went through all this
with Walt.

554
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:53,873
You'll burn
through your savings,
and then what?

555
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:55,975
Well, you two managed, right?

556
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,510
You said yourself

557
00:31:57,544 --> 00:32:01,080
that Elliot and Gretchen's
money didn't cover everything.

558
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,050
[sighs]
Jesus, I've got to get back.

559
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:06,519
What? No.

560
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:08,120
No, no, no,
you should rest.

561
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:11,223
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath

562
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,925
I put some fresh sheets
on the bed.

563
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,960
I want to be there
in case he wakes up.

564
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:16,996
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

565
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,898
[doorbell chimes]

566
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:21,901
Hey, Sky.

567
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:23,335
Hey.

568
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,705
Wha--
What are you doing here?

569
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:26,772
Well, I just thought
I'd stop by

570
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:27,973
to see how
you're holding up.

571
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,642
Is this a bad time, or...

572
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:31,043
Um--
Hi.

573
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:32,511
Hi.

574
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:36,082
Uh, Marie, this is Ted,
my boss.

575
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,483
Oh, you're Ted.

576
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:40,319
I've heard so much about you.

577
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:41,954
Thank you
for your gift basket.

578
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:43,522
That was really thoughtful.

579
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:44,890
It was. It was really nice.
Thank you, Ted.

580
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:46,225
Cheese sticks.
Cheese sticks.

581
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:47,460
Well, you're welcome.

582
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:49,361
You know,
we care about Skyler so much

583
00:32:49,396 --> 00:32:52,064
that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

584
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:54,900
Are you coming in?

585
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:57,770
Oh, yeah, you should.

586
00:32:57,804 --> 00:32:58,838
[chuckles]
I'm sorry.

587
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:00,506
Come on in, Ted.
Thanks. Okay.

588
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,041
[clears throat]

589
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:04,009
We were just having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

590
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:05,344
No. No, thanks.

591
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,179
I'm just on my way home.

592
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:08,514
I just thought I'd--

593
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:10,116
You know, I--

594
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,119
I am really beat.
I think I'm going
to take that bath.

595
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:14,754
It was nice
to meet you, Ted,

596
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:16,222
and thank you again.

597
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,357
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.

598
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:19,759
Please give my best wishes
to your husband.

599
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:22,194
I will.

600
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,200
Thanks for stopping by,

601
00:33:28,235 --> 00:33:30,870
but it's actually not a--

602
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:32,772
not the best time
for a visit, so--

603
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:36,575
Can we just talk
for a minute?

604
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,544
I know you need to be
with your family,

605
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:42,915
but I haven't heard
from you in days

606
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,350
I left messages--
I'm so sorry.

607
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:46,786
You gave me all that time off,
and I really should've--

608
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,920
That's not my point.

609
00:33:47,954 --> 00:33:51,090
I-- I care about you.
That's all.

610
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:52,191
Ted, I--

611
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:54,059
It's just this whole thing
with Hank

612
00:33:54,094 --> 00:33:56,262
has been one non-stop
horror show,

613
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,364
you know, so...

614
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,534
Well, I--
I just want you to know

615
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:03,068
that I'm here for you.

616
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,838
Thank you.

617
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:10,643
Um, but I really do need
you to...

618
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:12,411
Okay.
Okay?

619
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:19,952
Skyler, I've got to say
your sister seeing me here--

620
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,320
I mean--

621
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:23,455
So what?

622
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,090
I'm divorced.
You're divorced.
So what?

623
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,893
Okay, let's talk about it
later, Ted, okay?

624
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:29,495
Is there some reasonfor sec?

625
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:30,996
Because--
Later. Ted, not now.

626
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:32,498
Skyler, just tell me--

627
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,500
You really want
to do this now?

628
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:37,069
Are you really going to make me
do this right now?

629
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:39,505
[sighs]

630
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,408
Wow.

631
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:45,578
Yeah, you're right.

632
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:48,047
I'm--
Bad idea
to come here.

633
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,151
Ted, I'm--

634
00:34:53,353 --> 00:34:54,720
I'll see you in a day or two.

635
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:57,923
Back at the office.

636
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:01,493
Take as much time
as you want.

637
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:12,638
[Badger]
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

638
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:14,340
Must've been, like...

639
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:15,708
depressing.

640
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:18,544
[Skinny Pete]
For real. That's a stone loss.

641
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:21,213
[Jesse]
No one misses it
more than me.

642
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:23,549
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

643
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,185
No quotas, no one to answer to.

644
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,687
What's the point
of being an outlaw

645
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:30,823
when you've got
responsibilities?

646
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:34,326
Darth Vader
had responsibilities.

647
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,295
He was responsible
for the Death Star.

648
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:38,497
True that.
Two of them bitches.

649
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,369
Just saying.
Devil's advocate.

650
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:45,471
I've got to pay taxes now?
What the hell's up with that?

651
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:47,806
That's messed up, yo.
That's Kafkaesque.

652
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,311
Church.
Right.

653
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:55,981
Let's kick it back into gear.

654
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:58,817
Let's start slinging again.

655
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,019
Boo-yah!

656
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,221
Shh.

657
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:03,422
Let's dot.

658
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,890
Life's too short.
That's what I say.

659
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:07,092
Hell, yeah, bitches.
We don't need no RV.

660
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:08,594
Alls we need is a bicycle,

661
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,396
some Drano, soda bottles,

662
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,530
Nah, nah, nah,
no shake 'n bake.

663
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:13,065
Where's your self-respect?
Come on.

664
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,533
Yo, maybe it ain't top shelf,

665
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,135
but we could at least move it.

666
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:17,703
Still kind of dry out there.

667
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:18,871
Let's-- It'll sell
on the street.

668
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:21,206
Who says we sell
on the street?

669
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,876
Maybe I know
a whole new market.

670
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,978
Maybe alls we need
is the meth.

671
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:41,694
[exhales]

672
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:57,443
[scale beeps]

673
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:03,482
What's the yield?

674
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:07,686
Hey.

675
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:09,288
The yield.
Come on.

676
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:13,325
Uh... 201.8.

677
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:33,271
[Group Leader]
I see a couple new faces.

678
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,273
Anybody want to introduce
themselves?

679
00:37:37,476 --> 00:37:39,377
Don't all speak at once.

680
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:47,318
Yeah.

681
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:53,057
So my name's Brandon.

682
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:55,193
Okay, Brandon.

683
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:57,495
You want to tell us
something about yourself?

684
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:00,998
Well, why I'm here--

685
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:05,203
it's just one thing.

686
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:06,537
It's meth.

687
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,475
It's bad.

688
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,046
Thought I had it kicked
a couple times, you know,

689
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,283
but then... Jesus.

690
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:22,987
This new version of it
hit the streets and...

691
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,288
wow.

692
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:27,125
Not that blue stuff.

693
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,861
Oh, sorry,
I didn't raise my hand.

694
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:31,963
No, go ahead.
This is what we do.

695
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:33,564
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

696
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,667
You had it, to

697
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:38,236
Yeah, bro.

698
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,671
I wish I never even
heard of it.

699
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:43,674
It was like lighting
my whole head on fire.

700
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,077
[Badger]
Yeah, stuff
will burn you down.

701
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:48,913
Only reason I have
a hope in hell

702
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,549
is because it's long gone.

703
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,551
That's the shame of it.

704
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:56,354
Nah, come on, man.
Don't tell me that.

705
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:58,623
I hear it's back in town.

706
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:05,196
Stay strong, brother.
Stay strong.

707
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,032
It's gonna be okay.

708
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:15,072
[monitor beeping]

709
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,216
[Marie]
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

710
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,219
I will go to <i>48 Hours.</i>
I will go to <i>Nightline.</i>

711
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:30,354
I don't even know if there is
a <i>Nightline</i> anymore.
It doesn't matter.

712
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:32,957
They will all take it,
and they will run with it

713
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,492
because he is a hero,

714
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:38,563
and he is not going to be
in a wheelchair at 43.

715
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,167
Jesus.

716
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:50,174
Marie, I know Skyler's
already told you this,

717
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:54,178
but if there's every
anything that you need,

718
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:55,413
anything at all...

719
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:57,782
It's good to have you here.

720
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:02,019
Both of you.

721
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:03,888
I just wish there was...

722
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:05,690
something more
that we could do.

723
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,166
Walt?

724
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,370
We can always pay
their bills.

725
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,575
[Marie]
Please, it's tens
of thousands of dollars.

726
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,478
We have the money,
more than enough.

727
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:29,881
Walt earned it.
Skyler.

728
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:31,549
I think Marie
should know the truth.

729
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:35,553
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

730
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:37,522
I think that--
He earned it gambling.

731
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,163
Walt and I, uh--

732
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:48,533
We've had our problems lately.
You know that.

733
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:53,471
And, uh...

734
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:56,107
what it all came down to

735
00:40:56,141 --> 00:41:00,011
really was... money.

736
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:01,979
Pure and simple.

737
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:04,348
When Walt was diagnosed,
it, um--

738
00:41:06,552 --> 00:41:07,885
It changed him.

739
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:12,957
Looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood

740
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:15,760
what it was
that he was going through.

741
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:18,729
It was more than facing death.

742
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:21,933
It was knowing that
he was going to leave behind...

743
00:41:23,936 --> 00:41:26,037
nothing.

744
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:28,806
And so that's how
this all started.

745
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,809
For better or worse,

746
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:37,415
he wanted to provide,
and so...

747
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:42,687
he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

748
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:46,490
I thought
that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

749
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:48,659
Yeah, I thought so, too,

750
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:51,495
but the truth is
he never took their money,
not a dime.

751
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:53,931
He was too proud to take

752
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:55,800
what he considered
to be charity.

753
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:58,936
Isn't that right?

754
00:42:03,008 --> 00:42:07,345
So he put his mindo it
and--

755
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:12,249
Well, you know how Walt is.

756
00:42:12,284 --> 00:42:15,920
He's-- He's a problem solver,

757
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:17,388
and he read books,

758
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:21,092
and he did
a whole bunch of research,

759
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:23,661
and he came up with...

760
00:42:23,695 --> 00:42:26,030
this system.

761
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:28,566
A system?

762
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,370
A system for counting cards
in Blackjack.

763
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:36,173
W-What do you mean,
like Rain Man?

764
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:40,277
Well, I don't pretend
to understand, you know,
all the details,

765
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:42,279
but he was convinced

766
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:43,814
that if you put
enough money into it,

767
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:45,983
he'd have a, um, uh--

768
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,151
God, what is it?

769
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:49,987
A statistical edge?

770
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:55,393
Yes, statistical--

771
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:57,028
So-- right.
...um, yeah.

772
00:42:57,062 --> 00:42:58,863
So he-- Every spare minute,

773
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:01,932
Walt was at some card table
somewhere,

774
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:04,201
and at first he went
to the casinos,

775
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:05,803
but then he realized that--

776
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:10,908
[low]
...but then he realized

777
00:43:10,942 --> 00:43:14,478
that the casinos report
your winnings to the IRS,

778
00:43:14,513 --> 00:43:16,047
and if it gets reported,

779
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,248
your family might find out,

780
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:19,316
and if you do not want
your family to find out,

781
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:21,519
then you find
another place to gamble,

782
00:43:21,553 --> 00:43:26,090
like an illegal,
backroom game.

783
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:31,729
You remember
all those long walks
that Walt used to take,

784
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:34,999
all that time
he used to spend
away from home?

785
00:43:38,537 --> 00:43:41,238
I guess for a couple months
there you were...

786
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:43,908
sort of leading a double life,
weren't you?

787
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:51,115
Oh, my God.

788
00:43:51,149 --> 00:43:53,250
Oh, my God, your--

789
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:56,020
your fugue state,
was that some sort of cover?

790
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:57,788
No. No.

791
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,191
He did not fake that, Marie.

792
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:02,493
The night
that Walt disappeared...

793
00:44:06,598 --> 00:44:10,801
he los$14,000.

794
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:13,637
[sighs]
It was his pension fund,

795
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:15,573
our savings,

796
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:19,910
basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

797
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,482
He couldn't live with it.

798
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:26,250
He was suicidal.

799
00:44:26,284 --> 00:44:28,652
But you have to try
to understand

800
00:44:28,687 --> 00:44:31,288
that as soon as he got
out of the hospital,

801
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:33,157
he went right back
to gambling.

802
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:36,360
I mean, that's how deep
this went.

803
00:44:37,629 --> 00:44:39,563
How could you

804
00:44:39,598 --> 00:44:41,832
do that to her, Walt?

805
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:44,201
I, um--

806
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:48,339
Anyway, this system of his...

807
00:44:48,373 --> 00:44:50,574
he finally got it to work.

808
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:55,446
So all this is to say

809
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,614
we have the money.

810
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:58,716
No more gambling.

811
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:03,320
But we have the money.

812
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:09,927
How... much money?

813
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:11,228
Walt?

814
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:16,901
Uh--

815
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:19,069
Well, uh--

816
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:25,576
It's in the seven figures.

817
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,913
Oh, God.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

818
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:33,818
What can I say?

819
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:35,920
I did very well.

820
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:39,857
Marie...

821
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:42,359
you will take our money.

822
00:45:44,362 --> 00:45:47,198
Use it to take care of Hank.

823
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:50,067
Please.

824
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:52,236
Marie, let us help.

825
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:55,573
Does Walt, Jr. know
about this?

826
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:57,741
Absolutely not,

827
00:45:57,776 --> 00:45:59,944
and I need to keep it th way,

828
00:45:59,978 --> 00:46:01,512
and Hank-- okay--

829
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:03,180
Hank's got enough
on his mind right now,

830
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:06,550
so can we just please keep
this between us?
Yeah. Yeah, I--

831
00:46:06,585 --> 00:46:08,519
Yeah, I--

832
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:09,753
I just-- I need to--

833
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,088
Yeah, okay.

834
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:13,023
We'll talk about it later.

835
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:16,427
How did you come up
with that?

836
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:19,496
I mean, where--

837
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:22,266
where did you possibly--

838
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,668
I learned from the best.

839
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:34,578
Somehow something tells me

840
00:46:34,613 --> 00:46:36,981
that Hank is here
because of you.

841
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:41,986
And I'm not forgetting that.
