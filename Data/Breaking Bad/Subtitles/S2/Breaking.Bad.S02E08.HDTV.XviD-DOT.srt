1
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,197
You selling?

2
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,789
I don't know what
you're talking about.

3
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:32,473
That's cool.

4
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,395
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling,

5
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:41,713
I could maybe do with a teenth.

6
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:46,526
You're kidding, right?

7
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:49,436
Dude, I so smell bacon.

8
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:52,560
What?
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,256
Gee, I don't know.

10
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,951
How about over there.
That brown van.

11
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:01,279
- That's yours, right?
- What brown van?

12
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:03,866
Parked all inconspicuous.

13
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:05,789
It's a cop van.

14
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,889
Another one right over there.

15
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:13,160
"Duke City Flowers"?
Come on!

16
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,587
Can't you at least be original?

17
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,201
Dude, I just want to get high.

18
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:19,623
A flower van.

19
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,971
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

20
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:26,281
Seriously.
And I don't mean to disrespect.

21
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:29,031
But if you put a bunch of cops
in the back of a garbage truck,

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,317
there's no way
I'm seriously thinking

23
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:34,442
that there's cops in the
back of a garbage truck.

24
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,648
It's a freebie, yo.
Just think about it.

25
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,323
Think about it, boys!

26
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,996
All right. I'm hitting it.

27
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:46,801
You dudes give up that easy?

28
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,126
I'm not a cop.

29
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:50,805
Then lift your shirt.

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,180
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

31
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:56,384
All right, you know what?

32
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,109
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

33
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:01,393
I'm blinded by white.

34
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:02,972
Douchebag.

35
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:05,197
Come on. I was joking.
Come on.

36
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,312
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

37
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,674
I mean, what are you
complaing about?

38
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,986
You got abs, man. Kinda.

39
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,487
Whatever, dude.

40
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,204
I'm not even sure
I want to buy anymore.

41
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,974
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

42
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,092
Come on.
Don't be like that.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,289
I just need you
to prove it, you know?

44
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,396
Prove you're not a cop.

45
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,971
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

46
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,080
I don't know.

47
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:36,961
I got it.

48
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:39,575
Go over there and punch
that dude right in the face.

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,750
Which dude?

50
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,544
That dude?

51
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,930
No way.
He'd kick my ass.

52
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:47,371
True that.

53
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:50,956
This is so hard, you know?

54
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:56,317
I know.

55
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:58,332
It's simple.

56
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,212
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,

57
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:03,646
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:05,521
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:07,626
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:12,769
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,450
Are you a cop?

62
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,560
Not like that.
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,993
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,886
I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,013
Okay, then.
175 for a teenth.

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,820
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:36,575
All right.

68
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:04,561
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,560
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:17,361
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,066
Get on your stomach now!

72
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,491
On your stomach, get on the ground!

73
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:24,263
Hold it, don't move!

74
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,431
Stay down!

75
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,769

77
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:52,155
<i>I had a good job until my boss
accused me of stealing.</i>

78
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,075
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

79
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:02,278
<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business...</i>

80
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,531
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

81
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,441
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

82
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:11,716
<i>Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.
Did you know that you have rights?</i>

83
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:14,229
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

84
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,552
<i>I believe that until proven guilty,</i>

85
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:19,740
<i>every man, woman, and child
in this country is innocent.</i>

86
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>And that's why I fight
for you, Albuquerque!</i>

87
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,418
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

88
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,543
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law.</i>

89
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,793
I really need to get some furniture.

90
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,619
I suggest you start with a bed.

91
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:42,723
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

92
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,458
- Well, you can't.
- I know. I know.

93
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:47,828
I'm just saying.

94
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,042
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

95
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,174
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

96
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,799
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

97
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,948
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

98
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:07,591
Has he ever caught you?

99
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:12,445
Many times.

100
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:15,895
Well, listen.

101
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:19,931
Since I already lost
my deposit and all,

102
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,422
maybe we should light up.

103
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:29,930
You sure?

104
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,846
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

105
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,193
Maybe you'll change your mind.

106
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,651
Do what you want to do, I guess.

107
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,396
- What'd I say?
- Nothing.

108
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:56,052
I just have to go is all.

109
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,156
What's this?

110
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,855
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,774
I'm in recovery.
And you know,

112
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,031
pot is, like,

113
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,406
stepping stones.

114
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,875
Recovery?

115
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:35,612
That's cool.

116
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,297
Right on.

117
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,698
I respect that.

118
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:43,195
You know, I don't really
burn much anymore.

119
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,928
It's just a sometime thing.

120
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,149
But no more, like, in the house.

121
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,447
So, you want to go grab some dinner?

122
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,770
I could really go for some Chinese.

123
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,364
I better hit it.

124
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,341
We cool?

125
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,907
Your satellite's on, by the way.

126
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,126
That screen's bad-ass.

127
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,063
I just think it's asking a lot.

128
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:35,411
He knows it.

129
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,058
He's done nothing but apologize.

130
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:41,911
Is this going
to be every weekend now?

131
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:44,986
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

132
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,490
But I am earning double time.

133
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,587
There's a bright side.

134
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,272
So, when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up,

135
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:55,576
tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said "Bye."

136
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,356
And tell him to let
them air dry this time.

137
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:01,581
I don't want them banging
the hell out of my dryer.

138
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:02,749
What?

139
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,628
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

140
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,682
You look nice is all.

141
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,386
It's work.
Everybody's gonna be there.

142
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,168
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

143
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:38,028
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler, and Walter Junior.</i>

144
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:40,840
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

145
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:42,615
<i>Skyler?
Are you there?</i>

146
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:45,480
<i>I just don't know what to do.</i>

147
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:47,419
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

148
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,421
It's me. What's up?

149
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,858
Yesterday I got home and found him.

150
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,251
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

151
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:09,258
- A man was killed?
- A federale, right in front of him.

152
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:13,046
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

153
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:17,366
It's like what you hear about
in Iraq or something.

154
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,038
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

155
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:23,126
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

156
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,254
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

157
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:29,575
Hank should win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

158
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:32,582
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

159
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,900
And all he keeps saying is,

160
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:37,985
"I'm fine. I'm fine.
Leave me alone."

161
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,303
Baby, not now.

162
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,081
It's me, Hank.

163
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,609
Sorry.

164
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,925
Hey, buddy.

165
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,079
What's up?

166
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:19,994
I just...

167
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,363
Do you mind if I...

168
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,122
So...

169
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,442
How you doing?

170
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:35,826
You know. Lousy.

171
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,282
Montezuma's Revenge, big time.

172
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,807
I mean, everything's
going through me

173
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,108
like crap through a tin horn.

174
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,439
Better not get too close.

175
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,124
I'll take my chances.

176
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,133
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

177
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,306
Terrible.

178
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,287
What do you expect?
Freakin' animals.

179
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:10,852
Like <i>Apocalypse Now</i> down there.

180
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,031
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

181
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:18,532
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.

182
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,616
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

183
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:27,220
You don't put
your second most senior man

184
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,097
on the trail of those motherless
bastards, you send him home.

185
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,546
I was, you know,
"He's out getting an evidence bag,

186
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,192
"and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

187
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:41,217
"So must be something wrong
with that picture."

188
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:45,457
So are you home for good?

189
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
Playing it by ear.

190
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,004
"To be determined."

191
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:00,487
Think you might want to talk it through
with somebody?

192
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,050
What? A shrink?

193
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,066
I can't.
Start going down that road,

194
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:06,660
kiss your career goodbye.

195
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:08,683
Or Marie.

196
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:10,755
Or me,

197
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,078
if you like.

198
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:22,445
You know, I don't
know how to say this.

199
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:28,286
You know, the things I deal with,

200
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:32,201
you and me don't have much of a...

201
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:35,891
what you might call
an experiential overlap.

202
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,833
What if I told you we do?

203
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,568
I have spent my whole life scared.

204
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,177
Frightened of things
that could happen,

205
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:07,058
might happen, might not happen.

206
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,059
50 years I spent like that.

207
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:15,386
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

208
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:21,287
But you know what?

209
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,570
Ever since my diagnosis...

210
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,217
I sleep just fine.

211
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:38,423
And I came to realize

212
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:42,109
it's that fear
that's the worst of it.

213
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,058
That's the real enemy.

214
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:48,182
So...

215
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,098
get up.

216
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:54,864
Get out in the real world.

217
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:58,524
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can

218
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,099
right in the teeth.

219
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,710
Do it again.

220
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:17,884
Go on.

221
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:29,077
$10,000 even. Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

222
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,504
You and I, we are gonna
feed this machine.

223
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,325
I want it running 24 hours a day.

224
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,450
Right on.

225
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,942
Not yours, I take it.

226
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,320
We got 10,

227
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:49,390
20,

228
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:50,841
30,

229
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:55,487
44.5 each.

230
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:01,349
3 pounds should be 48 each.

231
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,436
Who's short?

232
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,357
Don't freak.
We didn't get ripped off.

233
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:08,544
Badger hasn't
kicked in his full amount.

234
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,092
I know he's planning on
pulling an all-nighter,

235
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:14,617
- so he's probably still in the sack.
- Then wake him up.

236
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,925
He can sleep after we're paid.

237
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,335
Why you gotta be such a hard on?

238
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:21,939
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.

239
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,524
This only works
when they're scared of you.

240
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:26,896
Jack off.

241
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:33,553
It's going straight to voicemail.

242
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,309
Voicemail?

243
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,293
Just chill, okay?
Count your money.

244
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,129
Combo,

245
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,155
you seen Badger?

246
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,619
Don't you cover for him!

247
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,595
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer!

248
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:11,839
Well?

249
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,457
They were too scared to tell me.

250
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:21,678
Badger got busted.

251
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:23,385
He's in jail.

252
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:01,491
Honey, I'm home!

253
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,476
Too slow!
What's up?

254
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,960
You've got more lives
than a damn cat.

255
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,585
Now if I can only learn
to lick myself.

256
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,251
What's up, guys?
Good to see you.

257
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,369
All right!

258
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,400
Let's all go back to work,
for Christ's sake!

259
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:20,515
In my office, man. Let's see what
you bozos have been up to lately.

260
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,268
You okay?

261
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:46,572
Hanging in?

262
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:48,789
What's it look like?

263
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,178
What's this from APD?

264
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,250
I been checking with them to see if they
come across that blue meth of yours.

265
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,203
Sure enough, last night.

266
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,522
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

267
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,647
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

268
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,952
Maybe you'd like to go with me.

269
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:09,428
Well, all right.

270
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:13,342
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

271
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,087
I feel manipulated.

272
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,258
I thought we were gonna hang out.

273
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,951
We are hanging out, Badger.

274
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,926
You like Badger or Brandon?

275
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,271
I like people who don't,
like, abuse the Constitution.

276
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:27,916
Badger, listen.

277
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,586
I'm trying to help you here, man.

278
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,604
If you just tell me
who your supplier is,

279
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:40,229
I think this can end
very well for you.

280
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,768
What are you doing talking to
my client without me present?

281
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,101
You Sneaky Pete!

282
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:48,858
Which is which?

283
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,621
What, did the Academy hire
you right out of the womb?

284
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:53,623
You guys get younger every...

285
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:56,903
What'd you say to Baby-Face?
Did you say anything stupid?

286
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,428
By anything stupid,
I mean anything at all.

287
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:02,227
Look at you. Mouth open,
vocal chords a-twitter.

288
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:04,605
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

289
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,920
Ten minutes ago! Go on!

290
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:10,237
There are laws, detective. Have your
kindergarten teacher read 'em to you.

291
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:13,353
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

292
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:18,667
All right.

293
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,122
Who do we have?

294
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:23,492
Brandon Mayhew.

295
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:26,476
All right.

296
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:34,649
Here we go.
Public masturbation.

297
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,693
- What?
- I don't get it. What's the kick?

298
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,110
Why don't you do it at home,
like the rest of us

299
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:42,572
with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

300
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,905
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

301
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,934
That ain't me, man!

302
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:50,281
I was the guy who was selling meth.

303
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,715
Allegedly.

304
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,671
All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

305
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,870
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

306
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:00,655
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

307
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:03,265
And a felony quantity.

308
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,014
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

309
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:09,607
The cops around here are like butchers,
always got their thumbs on the scales.

310
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:12,082
But good luck arguing that in court.

311
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:14,272
Let me get down to brass tacks.

312
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,406
I'm going to get you
a second phone call.

313
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:18,655
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy

314
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,162
or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader,

315
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,805
and they're going to
deliver me a check for $4,650.

316
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,246
I'll write that down
on the back of my business card.

317
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,987
4-6-5-0.

318
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:32,165
And I need that in a cashier's check

319
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,426
or a money order, doesn't matter.

320
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:37,115
Actually, I want it
in a money order.

321
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,082
And make it out to
Ice Station Zebra Associates.

322
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:42,662
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.

323
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:44,802
It's done just for tax purposes.

324
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,181
After that, we can
discuss Visa or MasterCard,

325
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,534
but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask.

326
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:52,894
Any questions?

327
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:57,815
You're gonna get me off, right?

328
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:02,821
I look like your high school girlfriend?
Five fingers, no waiting?

329
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:05,091
That's a joke, Brandon.

330
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,266
Lighten up.

331
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:10,125
Son, I promise you this.

332
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:15,165
I will give you the best criminal
defense that money can buy.

333
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:21,161
Francesca, I took these already.
Didn't I take these already?

334
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,955
Look, it's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on Vitamin A.

335
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,730
It's bad for the liver.

336
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:29,806
Okay, who's next?

337
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,715
Did him. I did him.

338
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,625
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

339
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,690
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

340
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,368
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.

341
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,664
Gentlemen, I sense
you're discussing my client.

342
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:48,574
- Anything you care to share with me?
- Sure. Your commercials? They suck ass.

343
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,911
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

344
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,871
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

345
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,939
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

346
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
DEA, huh?

347
00:22:58,484 --> 00:22:59,884
For a street bust.

348
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,297
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

349
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:19,733
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

350
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:22,008
You want your exponential growth,

351
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,193
guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

352
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,588
So how about we get him a real attorney?
I mean, what the hell is this?

353
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:29,263
This is who he hires?

354
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,332
What?
Are you kidding me?

355
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,829
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.

356
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,125
- It's the guy you'd hire.
- Look, you remember Emilio?

357
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,159
This dude got Emilio off,
like, twice.

358
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,699
Both times,
they had him dead to rights, yo.

359
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,115
And then poof!

360
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,800
Dude's like Houdini.

361
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,852
Seriously,
when the going gets tough,

362
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:52,997
you don't want a criminal lawyer.

363
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:55,699
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

364
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:58,071
Know what I'm saying?

365
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,245
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

366
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,668
Badger's way too loyal to roll.

367
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,854
Plus he's scared shitless of me.

368
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,978
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

369
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,718
And it's only his first dealing rap,
so worst case scenario?

370
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,908
They plead him out, he does five months
picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit.

371
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,456
So who goes inside?

372
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,797
I don't need them seeing my face.

373
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:27,221
I don't need them seeing my face.

374
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:30,944
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

375
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:31,966
Dick.

376
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:33,685
Fine.

377
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:36,419
We'll flip for it.

378
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:37,827
Call it.

379
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:39,929
Heads.

380
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,743
<i>Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?</i>

381
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,218
Mr. Mayhew.

382
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,513
Nice of you to come down.
Please.

383
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,056
Look at you.

384
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:20,977
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

385
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:22,764
Joking.

386
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:24,939
Please, come on.

387
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:26,189
Come on.

388
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:27,203
Please.

389
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,594
Saul Goodman.

390
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:31,943
Please sit.

391
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,118
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

392
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,755
I believe you have something for me?

393
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:55,261
Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?

394
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:56,692
Irish.

395
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:59,474
Faith and begorrah!
A fellow potato-eater.

396
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,059
My real name's McGill.

397
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,369
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

398
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:09,144
They all want a pipe-hittin'
member of the tribe, so to speak.

399
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:12,324
I digress.
Good things are happening.

400
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,085
Fact is,
your nephew's gonna get out in no time.

401
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,035
That's wonderful.

402
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:20,956
There's still a few details
to be ironed out,

403
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,872
but now that the DEA is involved,

404
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,556
I think he's looking at time
served and probation.

405
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:30,338
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

406
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,956
Excuse me, the DEA?

407
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,447
That's the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

408
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:35,572
The feds.

409
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,478
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news,

410
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:45,221
but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

411
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:48,442
I understand that. But what does
that have to do with the DEA?

412
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,318
They're after some mystery man,

413
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,738
some heavy-hitter that goes
by the name Heisenberg.

414
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,196
They want this guy like
the ax wants the turkey.

415
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:59,458
Seems young Brandon may have information
that could lead to his arrest.

416
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,220
Jesus, cheer up!

417
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:04,954
This is good news. I mean, Brandon
fell head-first into the doo-doo pile

418
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,579
and came up smelling
like Paco Rabanne.

419
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,013
Look, look.

420
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,279
I just think that we should

421
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,043
review our options.

422
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:17,853
Options?

423
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,221
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

424
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,249
And you got a grand total of two.

425
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,286
Option A, Brandon takes the deal.

426
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:26,685
Option B,
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary

427
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,374
and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

428
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:31,835
Look, look.
What about...

429
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,008
reprisals?
I mean, if Badger...

430
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,609
If Brandon...

431
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:40,009
informs on this Heisenberg...

432
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:43,131
I mean, what if...
God forbid...

433
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:44,856
that they decide to...

434
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:47,617
take revenge?

435
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:49,959
What have you been telling him?

436
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:53,852
The kid keeps spouting off about
"if I talk, they'll kill me."

437
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:56,674
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

438
00:27:57,737 --> 00:27:59,887
- Good.
- No, that's not good.

439
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:01,721
That's terrible.
Trust me, sir,

440
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,241
your nephew won't last
in prison two weeks.

441
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,726
You let him take
his chances on the outside.

442
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,195
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

443
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,687
No, look, look.

444
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,636
These are vicious, desperate people.

445
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,087
I've been told that

446
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:18,212
one of them killed another man

447
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:21,026
by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

448
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,676
People love to take
credit for the fun ones.

449
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:29,214
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

450
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:32,042
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

451
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,771
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

452
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,616
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,

453
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:38,340
get him singing like a canary...

454
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,315
all's right with the world.

455
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:43,958
$10,000.

456
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,400
10,000.

457
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,322
Cash to you.

458
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:06,549
I'm not saying to throw the case.

459
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:07,524
Just...

460
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,706
no talking to the DEA.

461
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:15,296
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

462
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,617
What's it going to be?

463
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,394
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?

464
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:28,055
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

465
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,876
"Morally outraged," he said.

466
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,551
- Threatened to call the police.
- And Badger's gonna spill?

467
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,690
Like the Exxon Valdez.

468
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,390
So what do we do about it?

469
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,752
Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

470
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,077
For safety!

471
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,613
What?

472
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,577
God, you are killing
me with that booty.

473
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:15,331
Talk to me, guys!

474
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:18,469
Come on.
Just tell me what you want! Jesus!

475
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:25,448
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio! He's the one!

476
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:32,483
Shut up!

477
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:34,725
Shut up!

478
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,906
All right, just speak English.

479
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:39,377
Lalo didn't send you?
No Lalo?

480
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,329
- Who?
- Thank God!

481
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:45,885
I thought...

482
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:49,638
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

483
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:51,932
Anything!
Just tell me what you need.

484
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,044
This afternoon, an associate
of ours offered you $10,000.

485
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,260
You should have taken it!

486
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:01,192
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

487
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:03,861
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

488
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,530
The uncle.
That was your guy?

489
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,786
No offense, guys, but I don't take
bribes from strangers, you know?

490
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,218
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

491
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:15,284
But I'll take your money! Sure!

492
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:17,421
That offer's expired, yo.

493
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:21,540
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

494
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,720
Just tell me what you need.

495
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:26,221
I'm easy.
I'm going to keep a happy thought

496
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:28,344
and assume this is
just a negotiating tactic.

497
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:31,418
All right,
listen to me very carefully.

498
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:34,644
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew the best

499
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,834
legal representation ever.

500
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:39,141
But no deals with the DEA!

501
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:43,573
All right? Badger will not
identify anyone to anybody.

502
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:45,870
If he does, you're dead!

503
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:50,196
Why don't you just kill Badger?

504
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:56,330
Follow me, guys,
but if a mosquito's buzzing around you,

505
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:59,706
it bites you on the ass, you don't go
gunning for the mosquito's attorney.

506
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:02,868
You go grab a flyswatter.
I mean, so to speak.

507
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:06,632
I mean, all due respect,
do I have to spell this out for you?

508
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,134
We're not killing Badger, yo!

509
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,205
Then you got real problems.
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down

510
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,956
on your boy like
a proverbial ton of bricks.

511
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:17,579
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here,

512
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:21,355
but he's not gonna like prison.
He's gonna sing like Céline Dion

513
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,623
regardless of what you do to me.

514
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,661
I recognize your cough.

515
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,620
Take that mask off.
Get some air.

516
00:32:37,195 --> 00:32:38,085
Go on.

517
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,698
Take it easy!
Breathe in, breathe out.

518
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,718
I'm gonna stand up, all right?
'Cause I got bad knees.

519
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:56,185
That's better.

520
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:01,020
Now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

521
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:02,688
How?

522
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:06,810
First things first, you're gonna
put a dollar in my pocket, both of you.

523
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,613
You want attorney-client privilege?

524
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:13,782
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

525
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:16,041
I mean it!

526
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,704
Put a dollar in my pocket.
Come on, make it official.

527
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,048
Come on, do it!

528
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,419
That's it. Come on.
Just a dollar.

529
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,682
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on.

530
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,357
Give with the dollar.

531
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,276
- Go on.
- Be smart.

532
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:36,213
What?

533
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:42,478
- All I got's a 5.
- I'll take a 5!

534
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,390
Come on, already.
Come on.

535
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:45,515
Be cool.

536
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:52,197
You're now both officially represented
by Saul Goodman and Associates.

537
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,722
Your secrets are safe
with me under threat of disbarment.

538
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,204
Take the ski mask off. I feel like
I'm talking to the Weather Underground.

539
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,041
Do it.

540
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,214
So if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

541
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:13,989
and we're sure of that?

542
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:17,554
No shanking!

543
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,593
Then the way I see it is

544
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:26,063
somebody's going to prison.

545
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,777
It's just a matter of who.

546
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:34,413
All right.

547
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,006
Lame-ass TV ads aside,

548
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:40,160
your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

549
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:42,928
Time served, no probation.
He's pretty slick.

550
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:45,553
Couldn't believe
the judge went for it.

551
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:48,590
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

552
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:51,463
You don't give us the name
of your supplier, you're going nowhere.

553
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:55,903
Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.

554
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,924
Is that right?
You cooperating?

555
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:07,113
Let's start with a name.

556
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:10,754
He just goes by Heisenberg.

557
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,279
How old's this Heisenberg?

558
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,905
Old.

559
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:19,749
Like 50 or 70 or something.

560
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,396
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

561
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,389
Medium height, medium weight.

562
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:25,539
What color hair?

563
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:27,198
No hair.

564
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,126
Dude's balder than you.

565
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,523
1963.

566
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:36,577
James Edward Kilkelly is convicted
of stealing a vending machine.

567
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:39,495
1975.
Breaking and entering.

568
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,472
1982. Grand theft auto.

569
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:45,083
1984. Armed robbery.

570
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,936
1987. 1992.
You get the idea.

571
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,640
And here he is today.

572
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,858
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out.
City, State, and Federal.

573
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,378
He's spent 44
of the last 58 years inside.

574
00:35:58,132 --> 00:35:59,982
An entire life behind bars.

575
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:03,202
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

576
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,205
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

577
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:08,347
On purpose?

578
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:10,911
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

579
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:14,023
He's actually more
comfortable inside.

580
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:16,340
The outside world hasn't
been too kind to him.

581
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,646
Sometime during
the Clinton administration,

582
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:24,521
Jimmy figured out how he could use
his talents to turn a profit.

583
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:33,857
- When does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

584
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,701
The buy is set for tomorrow.

585
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,549
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy,

586
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:42,672
and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000
and one pound of your finest meth.

587
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:51,187
$80,000 for eight years
of his life, huh?

588
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:54,096
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

589
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:56,426
I'm gonna represent him,
and I guarantee

590
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,814
there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

591
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:02,386
Secondly, he gets 30.
50 goes to me.

592
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:05,597
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

593
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,741
Who's taking a bigger risk?
He likes prison.

594
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,075
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

595
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,820
Look, if this option
is too expensive,

596
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:17,362
you can still always...
Badger in the chow line.

597
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:37,754
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

598
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:55,194
All right. There's our boy.

599
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:58,200
Right on time.

600
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,976
- Go back.
- What? All right.

601
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:32,659
So...

602
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:35,616
what do you think?
Did they see us?

603
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:37,564
I think we're good.

604
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:45,072
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

605
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,556
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!

606
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:55,827
Where the hell is Jimmy? He should
have been here ten minutes ago.

607
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:59,952
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

608
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:03,234
There's more
than one kind of prison.

609
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,859
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

610
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:07,992
Wait a minute.

611
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,465
What? What?
Let me see.

612
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:15,310
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

613
00:39:19,162 --> 00:39:21,352
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

614
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:24,253
Time to move?

615
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,010
Not till we see the exchange.

616
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:35,820
- What?
- Now he shows.

617
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,417
Okay, let's do this.

618
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,860
My God. Jimmy's on the wrong bench.
Crap!

619
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,139
We are screwed!

620
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,127
What are you doing?

621
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:02,024
I don't get it.
What's the holdup?

622
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,077
Where's the stuff, man?

623
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:16,663
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

624
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:24,982
- Get out. Go stop him.
- The DEA is right there.

625
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:27,591
- If they see me, we're screwed.
- Get out. I'll do something.

626
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:29,456
- What?
- Go!

627
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,067
Hank, I thought that was you!

628
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:46,860
Schrader, I'm blocked.

629
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,821
- Not a good time.
- How you doing? Are you feeling okay?

630
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,490
Schrader, I'm blocked.

631
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:53,742
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

632
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:57,158
You're working? Like DEA working?

633
00:40:57,673 --> 00:40:59,373
Is something going down?

634
00:41:01,865 --> 00:41:04,115
Wrong guy! Wrong guy!
Other bench.

635
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:16,640
- Move your ass now!
- Okay. I'll go and leave you alone.

636
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,064
- We'll talk about it later.
- Just floor it! Floor it!

637
00:41:20,528 --> 00:41:23,428
Forward is better?
I'll be out of the way then?

638
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:26,069
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.

639
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:29,384
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

640
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:32,206
Where'd he go?
Where the hell'd he go?

641
00:41:34,621 --> 00:41:35,459
Wait.

642
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:37,577
Got him.

643
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:47,212
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take 'em!

644
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:15,992
I think they bought it.

645
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,361
Absolutely.

646
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:23,013
Textbook bust, sir.

647
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:24,519
Yes, sir.

648
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:28,081
Looks like we got a full
pound of the blue stuff.

649
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:30,275
And Heisenberg's real name?

650
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,080
James Kilkelly.

651
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,769
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

652
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,417
You weren't home,

653
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:11,286
so I let the delivery guys in.
I hope that's okay.

654
00:43:11,411 --> 00:43:12,461
Absolutely.

655
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:23,921
So you bought a bed.

656
00:43:27,654 --> 00:43:29,204
What is that? A king?

657
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:33,075
Pillow top?

658
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:11,127
My God.

659
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,691
You really are a chemistry teacher.

660
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:19,688
You mind?

661
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:26,503
I was terrible at chemistry.

662
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,124
I'm more of a humanities guy.

663
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:32,253
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

664
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,293
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

665
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,722
My P.I. charged me for three hours,

666
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:41,469
so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

667
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:46,056
So this is what,

668
00:44:46,777 --> 00:44:47,777
blackmail?

669
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,788
I'm your lawyer.

670
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:53,435
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

671
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,555
I'm not in the shake-down racket.

672
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,071
I'm a lawyer.
Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?

673
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,221
Especially drug dealers.

674
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:07,227
So what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

675
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,560
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

676
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,336
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

677
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,667
Is it in your mattress? Is it in
a jelly jar, buried in the side yard?

678
00:45:19,423 --> 00:45:22,631
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up,

679
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,899
but he won't be the last.
And if I can find you,

680
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:27,074
how far behind can the cops be?

681
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:29,192
I don't understand.

682
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:31,978
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

683
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:36,222
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

684
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:39,705
I'm no Vito Corleone.

685
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:42,987
No shit!
Right now, you're Fredo.

686
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:47,285
But with some sound advice
and the proper introductions, who knows?

687
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,839
I'll tell you one thing,
you've got the right product.

688
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:52,761
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

689
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:54,691
you're on to something special.

690
00:45:54,816 --> 00:45:58,471
And I would like to be a small
and silent part of it.

691
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:03,235
Food for thought, yeah?

692
00:46:07,846 --> 00:46:10,392
So if you want to make more money

693
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,394
and keep the money that you make...

694
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,302
"Better call Saul!"

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
