1
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,007
{\an8}All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:39,705
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning

3
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:42,082
we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,126
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:48,422
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,180
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:57,013
{\an8}So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:59,599
{\an8}Get a big old raging hard-on

9
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,145
{\an8}at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

10
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,022
{\an8}My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:10,068
{\an8}Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,820
All right.

13
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,947
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,282
{\an8}Reputed to have whacked one "Dog" Paulson

15
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,369
{\an8}back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away

16
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,003
{\an8}from the So Cal biker gangs.

17
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:24,583
{\an8}Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,420
{\an8}And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals

19
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:31,378
{\an8}I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance

20
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,717
of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,887
{\an8}Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,222
{\an8}We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that,

23
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,956
{\an8}but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:43,602
{\an8}Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:47,961
{\an8}And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,275
{\an8}Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,319
{\an8}We sure don't want it going on up here

28
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:55,203
{\an8}which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:59,910
{\an8}We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,955
{\an8}This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,714
{\an8}Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law

32
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,503
a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:14,174
{\an8}Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body...

34
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:16,882
{\an8}Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:20,430
{\an8}... when he got his arm crushed clean off.

36
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,689
{\an8}Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,852
{\an8}Anyway. The upshot is

38
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:31,399
{\an8}we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint

39
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:35,070
{\an8}which belongs to Señor Tuco.

40
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,824
{\an8}Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:42,536
{\an8}That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,997
{\an8}So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,708
{\an8}- Yes.
- Yes.

44
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,417
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,046
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:56,466
- Do you wanna find this guy?
- Yes!

47
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:59,219
- Are we going to find this guy?
- Yes!

48
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,762
- Louder, damn it!
- Yes!

49
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,871
- Give me a "hell, yeah!"
- Hell, yeah!

50
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,766
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

51
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:08,520
{\an8}<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>

52
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,568
{\an8}They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,987
{\an8}Guy's in <i>México</i> by now.

54
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,198
{\an8}Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,869
Listen, I gotta take some personal time.

56
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:26,663
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:31,418
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,921
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:37,966
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:41,511
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,639
{\an8}All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,882
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

63
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:05,220
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:07,764
Without the hair.

65
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,685
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:15,355
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,983
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:20,443
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:23,029
- What about height and weight?
- Five eleven

70
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:25,365
most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:29,995
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:33,039
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:36,500
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,045
What about other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,548
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:46,803
- Anything that might help us.
- Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:48,805
That's fine.

78
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,973
- Is that the list of medications?
- Yes.

79
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,768
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:57,480
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,191
Has he been depressed?

82
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,160
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,078
Yeah.

84
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:16,583
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,917
Agitated?

86
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:22,589
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:26,509
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:35,310
When I asked him what was wrong, he said:

89
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,021
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:42,233
Then he just walked out of the room...
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,943
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:47,197
...and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,033
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:55,246
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:59,125
But... What about the phone call?

96
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:02,670
I'm looking into it.

97
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:06,758
- What phone call?
- Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:11,304
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:15,183
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,143
I mean

101
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:19,187
couldn't that be

102
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,272
important, right?

103
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,903
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:29,656
Anything else.

105
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,991
No. I called
the credit card providers,

106
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,330
and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,876
I... Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,170
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,048
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:50,760
I was actually hoping
that you had something else

111
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,471
being that you're the expert.

112
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,310
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,854
No worries.

114
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:04,816
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,529
- Mrs. White.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,198
- Walter.
- Thank you.

117
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,211
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,338
- And?
- Never happened.

119
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,007
No record of it.

120
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,509
- Second cell phone.
- Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:11,651
I understand.

122
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,446
Out.

123
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,615
Get away from me!

124
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,786
Settle down, bitch.

125
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:27,250
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

126
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:31,012
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:33,265
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,645
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,772
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now get out.

130
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,034
Get up.

131
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:55,537
Get up.

132
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:06,256
Oh, my God.

133
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,592
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,345
No more posters?

135
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:38,640
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,354
Thank you, Marie.

137
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,902
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,656
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:56,533
He'll turn up.

140
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,837
Okay, the whole tiara thing

141
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,590
- I just find it bewildering that...
- Marie.

142
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,719
- ...you didn't believe that...
- Marie.

143
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,389
Not now.

144
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,317
Empty your pockets.

145
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:25,515
Thought your name was Heisenberg

146
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,518
"Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,896
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,651
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,326
Yeah.

150
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,251
I like doing business with a family man.

151
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:56,004
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:33,791
Answer me one thing.

153
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,463
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:42,884
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,687
Sit down.

156
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,323
DEA...

157
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,744
...hit my place of business
this morning.

158
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:12,163
About a hundred cops looking for me.

159
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:16,876
- You two haven't been talking, right?
- No.

160
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,503
No.

161
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:23,633
Picked up my whole crew, top to bottom.

162
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,844
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,097
That's weird, right?

164
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:32,767
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

165
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,687
It's weird. Yes.

166
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,271
Unusual.

167
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,857
Unusual.

168
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:45,822
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:50,326
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,038
Explain to me.

171
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:59,335
How is it my fault that that little bitch
did not know his place?

172
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:08,136
I saw this coming.

173
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:11,931
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,853
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

175
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:21,596
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,151
Gonzo.

177
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,742
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:37,665
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:41,461
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him,

180
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:45,173
and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag,

181
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:49,510
and every time I hit him,
it's going to be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:53,765
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:05,985
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

184
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,112
What?

185
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:11,449
You're saying, Tuco...

186
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,452
You're saying that Gonzo

187
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,040
is currently operating
as a police informant

188
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:20,416
as far as you know?

189
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:26,089
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:29,133
That's disappointing.

191
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,718
Yeah.

192
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,930
- I'd waste him too, yo.
- Shut up.

193
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,473
Okay.

194
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:38,559
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:41,562
They got ghetto birds and black ops.

196
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:45,942
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,866
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,162
No, it's... It's killer.

199
00:20:58,538 --> 00:20:59,872
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:07,421
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,257
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:18,182
- Mexico?
- We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

203
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,143
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:22,854
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:25,105
And no Federales are gonna mess with us

206
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,358
because I got my people there.

207
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,402
Connections.

208
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:33,781
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,117
Tuco, I...

210
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:38,911
I have a wife and family.

211
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,290
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:46,544
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just

213
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,130
uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,340
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:56,053
Who's talking to you?

216
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:02,435
You need me, man

217
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:05,813
because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

218
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:10,151
Yeah.

219
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,944
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:14,989
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,325
Stink or no stink

222
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:22,038
one bump, you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:27,668
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:30,213
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:33,257
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,846
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,642
What secret ingredient?

228
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,645
Chili powder.

229
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,278
I hate chili powder.

230
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:01,327
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,665
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:13,089
We're gonna rewrite history with this.

233
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:21,264
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,351
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,561
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:31,065
He's my partner.

237
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,404
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:41,742
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now

239
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:44,912
to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset,

240
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:48,457
and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,003
And you...

242
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:56,215
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:15,993
- Where are you going?
- Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:17,953
We'll put these up.

245
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:22,166
- No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
- He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,836
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:30,090
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:33,802
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:36,263
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:38,599
- Okay?
- Okay.

251
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:43,646
- Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
- All right. Bye.

252
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:51,070
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet

253
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:53,155
bodes well.

254
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:58,619
Well, I mean, if he... You know.

255
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,665
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:05,458
There's got to be something.

257
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:07,718
Some detail that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:12,132
- What about the second cell phone?
- Jesus.

259
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:15,970
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,472
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:27,898
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:30,442
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,362
No incoming, no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,656
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:42,079
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,834
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

267
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:50,129
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:55,967
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:58,095
What does it mean?

270
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:00,553
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,768
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:08,856
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:13,944
- Okay. Everyone. Okay.
- Skyler, come on.

274
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:18,073
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:23,912
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:26,539
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,084
Walt? Please.

278
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:39,094
- What about the marijuana?
- He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:41,305
Says who? Him?

280
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:43,640
Chemotherapy and marijuana go together

281
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:47,770
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:52,608
Maybe he's addicted to the pot,

283
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:55,026
and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,197
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,605
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:06,330
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:08,123
He may know something.

288
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:17,382
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:21,386
Then grasp.

290
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:32,898
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:36,944
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:39,530
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:42,658
- Why?
- I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:47,287
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:50,707
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,253
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:27:54,461 --> 00:27:57,089
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:27:57,297 --> 00:28:00,968
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

300
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,685
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:12,229
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,815
He was one of the few teachers who cared.

303
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:16,923
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,570
I'm so sorry to hear about his illness.

305
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,478
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,950
I certainly will, as soon as he turns up.

307
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,368
He's missing, actually.

308
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:28,877
Just kind of walked off, or...

309
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,291
Anyway, which is why I'm going around

310
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:35,293
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,087
That's terrible.

312
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:39,590
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:42,759
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son...

314
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:46,013
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:50,267
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:54,646
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:58,734
I don't necessarily. I just...

318
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:01,442
- Are you with the police?
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:08,619
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:10,329
Oh, my God.

321
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:11,622
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,291
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,002
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:19,861
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this

325
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:22,590
coming here and asking questions
about my son and...

326
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:25,052
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,931
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:30,939
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:36,188
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:40,192
I'm sorry. I would like to help you,

331
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,903
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:46,531
I don't expect to see him anytime soon.

333
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:51,453
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,668
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:02,256
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:07,886
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education

337
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:12,307
as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car...

338
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,727
Low rider, huh?

339
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:18,480
Gomey, hey.

340
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:21,639
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out

341
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,819
a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo

342
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:28,448
registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:31,785
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:35,539
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:39,126
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:08,071
Chili powder.

347
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:12,075
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,618
Whatever, man.

349
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:15,579
At least I tried something.

350
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:17,706
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:21,001
How's about you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:24,046
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

353
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:25,964
My gun.

354
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:32,763
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:36,183
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:11,968
Hey, I don't get it.

357
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:15,180
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo, then who did?

358
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,140
I don't know.

359
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,684
I don't know.

360
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:22,938
Does it really matter?

361
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:27,109
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant

362
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:29,403
who does he automatically blame?

363
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:31,488
Us.

364
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,867
We need a plan.

365
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:41,331
- Think, think.
- Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,792
You crack him over
the head with something,

367
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,086
and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:53,677
Crack him over the head with something?

369
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:59,474
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man, all right?

370
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:01,517
You're as good as checked out already.

371
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:05,730
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

372
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:07,357
Just...

373
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,446
Oh, so my life is not the priority here

374
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:15,198
because I'm gonna be dead soon anyway.

375
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,242
That's your point?

376
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:19,453
Yeah.

377
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:50,108
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:52,694
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chili P.

379
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:54,738
That much has been established.

380
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:57,908
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

381
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,917
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,687
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

383
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:31,191
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

384
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:12,482
Take it easy, <i>Tio.</i>

385
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,987
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

386
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:26,705
What?

387
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:36,339
I get it, I get it, I get it.

388
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:40,760
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

389
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:43,221
I tell you, Heisenberg.

390
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,391
Old people.

391
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:49,185
You feed them, huh?

392
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,022
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country,

393
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,609
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

394
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,112
You better eat every bite of that.

395
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:25,055
What did you do that for?

396
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,739
God!

397
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,659
Hey, look. Look.

398
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,494
There's nothing left.

399
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:45,608
What? What do you want?

400
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,241
No.

401
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:56,702
Don't even tell me that you're hungry.

402
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:58,162
Don't go there.

403
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:13,469
Are you mad-dogging them, <i>Tio?</i>

404
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:18,432
What, you don't like them?

405
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:21,769
One ding.

406
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:25,314
That means yes.<i> Tio</i> don't like you.

407
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:32,446
Why don't you like them, <i>Tio?</i>

408
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:37,743
You don't trust them?

409
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,755
- Why don't you trust them, <i>Tio?</i>
- Tuco, come on. He's...

410
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:53,968
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

411
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,108
Did they do something to you,<i> Tio?</i>

412
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:14,572
Something that you don't like?

413
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:25,624
What did they do to you?
What did you do to my <i>tio?</i>

414
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,126
Nothing. Nothing.

415
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:32,131
- Bullshit! My <i>tio</i> does not lie!
- I don't know. I swear. I don't know.

416
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,136
No, I... Maybe it was... I did change
the channel on his TV, but...

417
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:39,597
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking

418
00:39:39,805 --> 00:39:43,267
he was watching one of those telenovels

419
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:46,311
with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:48,188
I told you not to change the channel.

421
00:39:48,272 --> 00:39:51,275
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

422
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:00,910
Is that it, <i>Tio?</i>

423
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,537
Is that it, <i>Tio?</i>

424
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:06,656
Did they change your mamitas?

425
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,968
What are you telling me, <i>Tio?</i>

426
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,056
Are they punking me?

427
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:39,824
Hey. No.

428
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:43,452
No, man. No.

429
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,121
- Come here!
- No.

430
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:48,916
No, no, Tuco.

431
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,717
Tuco, no. Tuco.

432
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,932
Shut up!

433
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:20,865
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

434
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:23,576
No, God. I don't wanna die.

435
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,786
Tell me what you did, Walter!

436
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:29,290
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

437
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:33,210
- No!
- Tell me what you did!

438
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:41,343
We tried to poison you.

439
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:45,014
We tried to poison you

440
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:50,978
because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth,

441
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:53,105
and you deserve to die.

442
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:37,942
Who's the bitch now?

443
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,422
Let him bleed.

444
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:21,068
The keys.

445
00:43:22,027 --> 00:43:23,654
Tuco.

446
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:26,115
Oh, my God.

447
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,577
The cousins?

448
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,801
What the hell is going on?

449
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:41,482
Jesse Pinkman.

450
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:44,443
You're a hard man to find.

451
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:54,870
Oh, shit.

452
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:07,841
Easy.

453
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:26,837
Oh, my God.

454
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:31,925
Oh, God. Hank.

455
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:33,552
- Who?
- Hank.

456
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:35,137
What?

457
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:37,055
- Oh, my God.
- What?

458
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:40,476
- Oh, my God.
- Stay. What are you doing?
