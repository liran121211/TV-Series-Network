1
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,181
Okay. That's okay.

2
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:26,779
Get that.

3
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,282
Hey.

4
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:46,442
- Oh, God. Please.
- Oh, jeez.

5
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,068
Please.

6
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,612
Please.

7
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,705
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,749
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,168
Yeah.

10
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:05,753
Yeah.

11
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:29,878
You see that?

12
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,953
- What does he remember?
- Not a whole lot.

13
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:05,112
He came in dehydrated and disoriented,

14
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:08,083
but once we gave him fluids
he stabilized pretty quickly.

15
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,293
But I mean...

16
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:12,880
- He knows where he is?
- Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

17
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:16,425
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,261
{\an8}Go on in. He's probably awake.

19
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:26,894
My God.

20
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:29,188
Walter.

21
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:33,025
I'm so sorry.

22
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,867
{\an8}Come here.

23
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,411
{\an8}You know who I am, right?

24
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,705
{\an8}Yes, son. I know who you are.

25
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,833
{\an8}Come here. Give your old man a hug.

26
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,923
{\an8}It's so good to see you.

27
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,052
How do you feel?

28
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,682
Better.

29
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,768
Yeah. I...

30
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,187
I feel like myself.

31
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,481
{\an8}Really, I mean, in...

32
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:17,694
{\an8}The past couple days are missing,
but other than that

33
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:18,987
I feel fine.

34
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:21,240
{\an8}My God, Walt.

35
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,786
{\an8}What a day this has been.

36
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:29,122
{\an8}So, Uncle Hank, he was in a shootout?

37
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:31,458
{\an8}A shootout?

38
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,628
{\an8}He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

39
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:35,937
Uncle Hank wasted him.

40
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,715
- Oh, my God. Is he all right?
- Absolutely fine.

41
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:42,761
{\an8}- Where did this happen? How could...
- Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,390
{\an8}We're all okay.

43
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:48,225
{\an8}We'll be all right.

44
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,061
{\an8}<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

45
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,479
{\an8}No.

46
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,607
{\an8}But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

47
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:59,862
{\an8}<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

48
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,155
{\an8}I really...

49
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:06,974
{\an8}You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

50
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,579
{\an8}Well, which supermarket?

51
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:11,874
{\an8}Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

52
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:14,751
{\an8}- Marie.
<i>- I... Don't get me wrong.</i>

53
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,007
{\an8}I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,009
{\an8}I just, I mean...

55
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:25,804
{\an8}He... Naked?

56
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:28,807
He was naked.

57
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:30,767
Naked.

58
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,603
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,311
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,857
{\an8}<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

61
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,944
{\an8}No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

62
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:42,613
{\an8}How's Hank?

63
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,532
{\an8}You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of

64
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:48,869
{\an8}30 seconds before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:51,914
{\an8}You know, you'd think today of all days

66
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:55,292
{\an8}they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,670
But how is he? Really?

68
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:02,382
Hank?

69
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,804
{\an8}He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:13,310
{\an8}I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:16,354
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca,

72
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:19,816
and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,528
{\an8}- He was shot previous to your arrival?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:27,324
Again I instructed him to show his hands.

75
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,701
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle,

76
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,497
and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

77
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,749
I returned fire and sought cover

78
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,044
as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

79
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:42,881
When he paused to reload

80
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,467
I was able to take an effective shot.

81
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,012
{\an8}Agent Schrader

82
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:52,721
{\an8}what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

83
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,727
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

84
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,511
- I was tending to another matter.
- What other matter?

85
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,528
An unrelated family matter.

86
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,781
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

87
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:11,493
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir. He's since been found.

88
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:14,413
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

89
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:16,706
At the time, he'd been missing for hours,

90
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,252
and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

91
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,421
I was talking to his acquaintances

92
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,881
trying to get a fix on his whereabouts.

93
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,677
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his

94
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:32,014
a Jesse Pinkman.

95
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:36,768
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

96
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:40,396
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,234
- Have you run him down yet?
- Not yet, but we're working on it.

98
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,498
Man, they're like Jehovah's Witnesses.

99
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,125
They don't give up.

100
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:03,711
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

101
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,090
- They need probable cause.
- Probable cause?

102
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,092
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

103
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,679
I told you, this is serious shit.

104
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,931
I'm like an outlaw.

105
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,308
Okay.

106
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,319
Let's do this.

107
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:40,707
Holy Christ!

108
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,335
You're Willy Wonka.

109
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:46,338
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

110
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,740
Put me on your magical boat, man.

111
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,969
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

112
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,628
So where you keep the pseudo?

113
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:58,475
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

114
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:02,312
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

115
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,314
No pseudo?

116
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,777
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

117
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:12,697
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

118
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,576
But I can't just let you break this down.

119
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:19,537
- That'd be sacrilege.
- I told you, that's why we're here.

120
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,271
- You saw the cops. Right?
- Sure.

121
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,792
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,711
- You know, for the road?
- No, forget it, all right?

123
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,799
- This stuff has to go, like, now.
- Dude, you owe me.

124
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,803
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

125
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,514
God, Badger!

126
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,352
Don't mess with me.

127
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:44,938
Got it?

128
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,569
Yeah, I got it.

129
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,921
Oh, my God.

130
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:15,468
Okay, that's all of it.

131
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,388
This was a bad choice.

132
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,520
You sure about this guy?

133
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,898
He's totally, totally cool.

134
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,858
He's my cousin.

135
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:37,490
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?
- We didn't say, and it's 1000.

136
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,075
Thousand bucks?

137
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:41,953
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

138
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,037
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,835
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

140
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:54,925
560.

141
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,300
- You know what?
- Hey... No...

142
00:11:57,427 --> 00:12:00,263
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

143
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:03,975
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

144
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:08,396
- That right? You a stand-up dude?
- Yeah, I am.

145
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,815
I will get you the other 500.

146
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:12,192
Five hundred more.

147
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,654
Your word's your bond, right?

148
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,697
Right.

149
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:27,999
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

150
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,211
What are you doing now, exactly?

151
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,296
I'm giving you, like, two hours,

152
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:36,967
and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

153
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,725
You're not using your own name.

154
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:43,723
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

155
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:45,976
Why do you gotta go and do this?

156
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,812
They need probable cause.

157
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,397
I'm giving it to them.

158
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,704
What's the last thing you remember?

159
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,458
Well, I was driving home.

160
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:12,252
I think.

161
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:14,879
And...

162
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,382
Do you remember coming home?

163
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,850
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

164
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:27,434
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

165
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,020
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

166
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:35,608
- Nothing else? No fleeting images?
- Well, no. I...

167
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,153
I was...

168
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:44,993
I was walking down some road or highway

169
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,330
with a lot of headlights,

170
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:52,709
and I remember feeling fear.

171
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,088
- That's it.
- All right. Thank you.

172
00:13:57,172 --> 00:14:00,091
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

173
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,843
The MRI shows no metastases.

174
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,889
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

175
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,932
Yeah, we're looking really good.

176
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,934
Oh, thank God.

177
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,854
So, what was it, then?

178
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:17,566
- There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
- And considering your condition

179
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,319
the blood panel looks good.

180
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,697
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

181
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:26,076
As of right now, we really

182
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,702
can't say.

183
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,331
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field,

184
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:34,292
but isn't it possible
that this had something to do

185
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,669
with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

186
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:38,254
There's the antiemetic

187
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,298
the antitussive

188
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:44,010
the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

189
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:50,558
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say

190
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,602
I'm feeling much better.

191
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:55,563
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications

192
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,108
the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

193
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:02,320
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

194
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,782
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

195
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,619
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

196
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:12,978
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

197
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:14,958
Stressed out? I...

198
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,216
- No, I don't think I'm...
- Walt, please.

199
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,712
Stressed out is putting it

200
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:21,172
mildly.

201
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:28,972
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said

202
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,849
I'm feeling much better.

203
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,851
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

204
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,855
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

205
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:39,607
A ways down the road?

206
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:43,987
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

207
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,409
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

208
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,953
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

209
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,538
But until we know
what caused this incident

210
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:57,041
we can't be certain it won't recur.

211
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:43,963
- That your last hit?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,466
Finish it quick.

213
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:21,374
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

214
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,505
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

215
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,596
I'm going, I'm going.

216
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,557
What's going on?

217
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,809
What did I do?

218
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,689
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

219
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,335
- What, man?
- Tell me again.

220
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:06,629
Again?

221
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,840
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

222
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:12,802
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

223
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:16,514
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

224
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,098
Taco? I don't know any Taco,

225
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,893
and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

226
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,770
Three days, you must have got hungry.

227
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:24,063
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:26,566
- You order take-out?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,818
Yeah, where from?

230
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,737
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan

231
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,948
from that chink place around the corner?

232
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:37,827
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

233
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,662
You know, Funyuns.

234
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,372
I had a Hot Pocket.

235
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:44,083
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

236
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,043
You didn't notice your car was gone?

237
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,727
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

238
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:50,965
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

239
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:53,224
Management's gonna be on my ass for sure.

240
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:56,429
- You weren't answering your phone.
- It was in my car.

241
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,390
- That right?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,436
We found your car,

243
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:05,772
but your phone wasn't in it.

244
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,482
You found my car?

245
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:09,734
You found my car?

246
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:13,279
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

247
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:19,159
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

248
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,913
Did you leave anything else in the car?

249
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:23,247
Like what?

250
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,834
Like what? Like...

251
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,420
I don't know. Like this?

252
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:42,725
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

253
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,602
That's not mine.

254
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:46,646
That's not yours?

255
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:49,607
He says it's not his, Gomey.

256
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,151
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

257
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,947
- I wish.
- Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

258
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:58,305
You know what we got here,
Gomey, don't you?

259
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:01,327
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

260
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:04,163
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

261
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,873
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

262
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:08,543
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

263
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,046
So who's your chief, little Injun?

264
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:13,756
What?

265
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:17,009
- What does that even mean?
- I think your story's bullshit.

266
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,679
I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was.

267
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,937
Your car was there
because you were there.

268
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:26,352
Tuco had a bullet in him when I got
there and you know about that too.

269
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,397
So, what are you saying?

270
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,524
I shot someone?

271
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,236
- With, like, a gun?
- You?

272
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,238
No.

273
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,616
Only shooting you do is into a Kleenex.

274
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:43,911
But I think you know the badass who did.

275
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:49,584
Look, I was partying with Wendy, okay?

276
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:53,087
Funyuns and boom-boom.

277
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:55,256
No.

278
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,383
I don't think so.

279
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,678
Tell you what. We're gonna

280
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:04,891
go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

281
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,809
And you know what?

282
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:12,815
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

283
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:18,321
Don't go nowhere.

284
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:36,130
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

285
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,342
- I got medical issues.
- Medical issues?

286
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,552
Like, what kind of medical issues?

287
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,429
You got penis withdrawal?

288
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:46,015
You got schlongus interruptus?

289
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:49,185
Wendy, listen. Talk to me,

290
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,343
and you get a root beer and a tinkle.

291
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,605
- Tell me the last three days.
- I told you

292
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,192
we were shacked up since Saturday.

293
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,700
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

294
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:03,366
Not even for a second?

295
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,662
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

296
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,622
Maybe?

297
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:11,624
Did Jesse leave the room?

298
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,502
He did, didn't he?

299
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:18,089
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

300
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,551
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

301
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:25,388
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

302
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:29,559
It's you. I know you.

303
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,104
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

304
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,064
- What?
- The kid with the crutches.

305
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:37,691
- The football player.
- How about we stay on topic?

306
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:41,863
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

307
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,990
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

308
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:46,924
And that's all I'm saying about that.

309
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,536
Now, come on.

310
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,955
Where's my root beer?

311
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:56,710
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

312
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:58,254
It's a long story, Gomey.

313
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:02,132
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

314
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:05,385
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

315
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,729
And how are you sleeping?

316
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,610
Fine. Most nights.

317
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:22,069
Good.

318
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,780
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images

319
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:26,991
things you can't get out of your head?

320
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,665
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

321
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:38,669
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude,

322
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:41,797
but where is this going, exactly?

323
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:45,425
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

324
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:49,305
- Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
- Ongoing for how long?

325
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:50,913
I just met you. Hard to say.

326
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:54,060
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

327
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,315
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

328
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,816
Now

329
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:06,364
if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

330
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:09,158
Walt

331
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:12,954
a fugue state is a very serious event.

332
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:15,455
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

333
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,689
Get into a situation

334
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,791
where you could be shot by the police?

335
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:20,586
We can't allow you to leave

336
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:23,895
until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

337
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,842
Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.

338
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,643
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

339
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,151
It's very straightforward.

340
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,648
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

341
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,149
What about my family?

342
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:45,653
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

343
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,614
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

344
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:52,451
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

345
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,247
And you, as a medical practitioner

346
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:58,624
you abide by these strictures absolutely.

347
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,167
Yes.

348
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:07,675
All right.

349
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:12,388
There was no fugue state.

350
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:16,350
I remember everything.

351
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,982
The truth is

352
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,819
I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

353
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:30,489
I just had to get out,

354
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,324
and so I left.

355
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,702
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

356
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:41,333
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

357
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,962
I got as far as Gallup...

358
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:51,510
and then it was just time to come home.

359
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,304
So

360
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:56,348
Being found naked in a supermarket

361
00:25:56,556 --> 00:26:00,061
that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

362
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,563
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

363
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:12,907
Why run away?

364
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:16,160
What did you feel you had to run from?

365
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,376
Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant

366
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,504
with a baby we didn't intend.

367
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:31,175
My 15-year-old son has cerebral palsy.

368
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,721
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

369
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,726
When I can work, I make $43,700 per year.

370
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:42,937
I have watched all of my colleagues,

371
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:45,689
and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable,

372
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:49,652
and within 18 months, I will be dead.

373
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,323
And you ask why I ran?

374
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,357
Gomey, you wanna do the honors?

375
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:39,659
- What's that mean?
- That means yes.

376
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:43,747
- Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

377
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:47,656
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

378
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,295
Señor

379
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,630
are we on the planet Mars?

380
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,303
Are we on the planet Saturn?

381
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:01,348
Are we on the planet Earth?

382
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,188
Señor, is today Friday?

383
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:08,981
Is today Monday?

384
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,734
Is today Tuesday?

385
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:15,070
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

386
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,449
Señor

387
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,870
was this man at your house yesterday?

388
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,965
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

389
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:45,684
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

390
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,145
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

391
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:54,068
Señor, are you scared of this man?

392
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,072
No, he's not scared.

393
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,953
Come on, Granddad.

394
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,497
Don't you wanna help us out?

395
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,891
Oh, man.

396
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,900
I guess that's a no.

397
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,988
- I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

398
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,365
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

399
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,619
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

400
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:49,748
- All right. It was worth a try at least.
- We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

401
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,834
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

402
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,169
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

403
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:57,673
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do

404
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,009
with shooting Tuco, man.

405
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,388
Dad? Hey, Dad.

406
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,432
Hey, can you hear me?

407
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,352
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

408
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,813
What's...?

409
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:15,983
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

410
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,943
You know, I actually

411
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:20,987
lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

412
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,323
I've been busy as...

413
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,366
As totally productive.

414
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:27,870
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

415
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:31,373
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

416
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,043
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

417
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,628
Hey, could you give me a ride?

418
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:41,258
I'm actually...
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

419
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,094
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will...

420
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:50,017
I'll call you later when you have some...

421
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:52,728
Okay. Yeah. No. I...

422
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,564
I get it. I get it.

423
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:58,150
Okay, bye.

424
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,411
Thanks.

425
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,414
So, what are you doing now?

426
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,625
Waffle House?

427
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,003
Waffle House is good.

428
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:53,705
Pay phone?

429
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,542
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

430
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,793
So how did it go?

431
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,213
Okay. You?

432
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:05,759
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

433
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,262
- So you getting out of there?
- Tomorrow.

434
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,472
So who came for you?

435
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,433
The DEA? What did they ask you?

436
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,103
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law

437
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,813
took my rainy-day fund.

438
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,815
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

439
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,318
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

440
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,612
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

441
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,573
Now I got like 80 bucks to my name.

442
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,281
Wait, wait. What does he know?

443
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,951
Does he know it's your money?

444
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,662
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

445
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,372
The plan worked.

446
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:36,832
They bought it.

447
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,501
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

448
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,881
- Did he mention my name?
<i>- No. Thanks for caring.</i>

449
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,927
- What about the basement?
- It's clean.

450
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,054
<i>And the RV?</i>

451
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:55,142
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

452
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,728
Can he get it running again?

453
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,523
<i>- Why?</i>
- So we can cook.

454
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,485
So you still wanna cook?

455
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,153
Seriously?

456
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,115
What's changed, Jesse?

457
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,085
Seven-hundred thirty-seven thousand.

458
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,254
Twenty-one pounds

459
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,882
minus cash on hand...

460
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:28,800
Cash on hand.

461
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:08,960
- Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
- No, I was awake.

462
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,341
- Want some cornflakes?
- Yeah, sure.

463
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,724
- You okay?
- Yeah.

464
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:25,096
Southwest Aniline again?

465
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:27,557
What's this?

466
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,216
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

467
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,772
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

468
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,316
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

469
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,819
P2P, huh?

470
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,612
So, what are you thinking?

471
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,697
The two stooges over here cooked it?

472
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:46,827
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

473
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,578
At least since this.

474
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,456
- Krazy-8.
- Yeah.

475
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:55,669
Krazy-8, Tuco...

476
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:59,548
Somehow, some way, it's all connected.

477
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,551
A simple explanation

478
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,470
only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

479
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,181
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

480
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,765
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

481
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,727
It's 11 in the morning.

482
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:13,979
I'm buying.

483
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:15,437
You're buying? Holy crap.

484
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:18,483
- What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,322
Surprise.

486
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,243
You little sneaky bastard, you.

487
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,078
Very nice work.

488
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,289
Thank you, sir.

489
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,877
- What's this?
- Look what we got you.

490
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,338
- Look at that, I love it.
- They got the gut right.

491
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,424
- Hey.
- There you go.

492
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:44,301
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Thank you.

493
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:50,307
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

494
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:52,475
You shouldn't have.

495
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:56,771
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

496
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,732
I love it.

497
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,822
You going to finish your apple juice?

498
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,867
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

499
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,412
You're supposed to drink it.

500
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:16,082
The nurse said you have to stay hydrated.

501
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,293
But I'm not thirsty.

502
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,796
Dad. Drink it.

503
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,643
Hey.

504
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,603
Better late than never, huh?

505
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:38,813
- Hey.
- Hey.

506
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:41,648
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

507
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:43,860
I see the mark of the beast there, huh?

508
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,237
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

509
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,324
They really cheer the place up.

510
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,495
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

511
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:57,207
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

512
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,460
So tell us about the shootout.

513
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,005
I was, you know, just doing my job.

514
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,675
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

515
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,802
Say, Walt, you know

516
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,805
how are you?

517
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,723
I'm okay.

518
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,518
Really, I'm feeling fine.

519
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,979
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:22,065
The doctor is calling it a...

521
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:26,319
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

522
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,071
Damn.

523
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,864
Which means non-recurring.

524
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:32,283
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

525
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,868
Sounds real good.

526
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:37,747
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

527
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,834
Listen, Hank.

528
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,460
I don't know what to say. I mean

529
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:49,467
you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

530
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:53,346
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

531
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,307
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

532
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,769
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

533
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:03,273
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake

534
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:05,483
like you wouldn't believe, okay?

535
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,862
You ought to disappear more often.

536
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,448
Just kidding. Don't do that.

537
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,325
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

538
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:16,119
Look what they gave me.

539
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,537
What is it?

540
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:22,250
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

541
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:24,669
- His grill?
- Yeah.

542
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,630
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

543
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,924
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

544
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,802
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

545
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,763
Wow, cool.

546
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,014
Yeah.

547
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,793
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

548
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,927
I'll get these in the wash.

549
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:15,470
Okay.

550
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:54,259
Say, honey, I...

551
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:59,472
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

552
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:09,190
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

553
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:23,371
Skyler, listen to me.

554
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:28,877
This will not happen again, okay?

555
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:30,253
I won't let it.

556
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:34,007
I'm still here. I'm me,

557
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:37,552
and we're gonna be okay.

558
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,185
Walt...

559
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:49,981
do you have a second cell phone?

560
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:54,819
A second cell phone?

561
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:59,199
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath,

562
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:01,534
and you were very upset.

563
00:45:02,368 --> 00:45:05,288
It was like something
terrible had happened.

564
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:08,333
And then your cell phone rang.

565
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:11,753
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up,

566
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:14,464
and just disappeared.

567
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,675
Yeah.

568
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:20,178
And when Hank checked your phone records

569
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:23,431
there was no call.

570
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:27,352
No call on the phone I know about.

571
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:33,775
That is

572
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,777
odd.

573
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:38,905
I mean, I don't remember any of that,

574
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:44,077
but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

575
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:48,414
Okay.
