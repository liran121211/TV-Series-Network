2
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,828
All right, everybody.
Listen up.

3
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:07,663
Tuco Salamanca.

4
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:12,843
For those of you not with us this
morning, we raided his headquarters.

5
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,066
Also his last known address.

6
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:19,225
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth hag girlfriend.

7
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,216
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The big man himself smelled us coming.

8
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,341
So...

9
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:25,895
Study the face.

10
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,366
Study the file.

11
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,304
Get a big ol'raging hard on

12
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:33,547
at the idea of catching
this piece of shit.

13
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,637
My apologies to the HR department.

14
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:39,617
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

15
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:41,613
All right.

16
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,370
On the hit parade, 1998.

17
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:48,317
Reputed to have whacked "Dog" Paulson,
back when our home-grown banditos

18
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,129
where wrestling the crank trade away
from the So Cal biker gangs.

19
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,543
Also, we're pretty sure he knifed
a Mexican national in '03.

20
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:58,362
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals,

21
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,553
I'd say he is a prime suspect

22
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:03,469
in the disappearance
of our dearly-missed Krazy-8.

23
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,718
Hats over your heart
for that dirtball.

24
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:08,881
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that one,

25
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,685
but as usual,
we couldn't make it stick.

26
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,187
He runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

27
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:17,232
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

28
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,626
I know it's...
We all know what's going on down there.

29
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,756
We sure as hell don't
want it going on up here.

30
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,712
Which brings us to the good news.

31
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,460
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

32
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:33,200
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name, No Doze.

33
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:37,076
Found him tucked in the junkyard,
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law,

34
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:38,651
A.K.A. Gonzo.

35
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:41,298
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,

36
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,235
was moving No Doze's body,

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,678
either hiding it there
or pulling it out, still not sure,

38
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,695
when he got his arm
crushed clean off.

39
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:52,810
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my Web site. Hilarious.

40
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,133
Anyway. The upshot is,
we got us a nice,

41
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:59,671
big, juicy, bloody fingerprint,

42
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,123
which belongs to senor Tuco.

43
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,035
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

44
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:10,329
That is, provided we find this guy.

45
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,960
So to all present,

46
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,499
I ask you, you wanna find this guy?

47
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,248
What the hell was that?
Jesus.

48
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,103
Wanna try that again?

49
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,465
Do you want to find this guy?

50
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,802
Are we going to find this guy?

51
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:28,846
Louder, damn it!

52
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,409
- Give me a hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

53
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,615
They ain't gonna find him.

54
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,708
Guy's in Mexico by now.

55
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:47,865
Appearances, Gomie.
It's all about appearances.

56
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,327
Listen,
I gotta take some personal time.

57
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:54,246
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

58
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:59,095
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

59
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,212
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

60
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,446
Damn. You don't think he...

61
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:11,715
- Holler if you need me.
- Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that.

62
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,163
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

63
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,472
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:32,541
Without the hair.

65
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,515
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:40,769
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate
you sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,162
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,669
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:48,455
- What about height and weight?
- Five eleven...

70
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,571
most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:54,709
165. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:56,535
I guess...

73
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:00,122
- he weighs a little less.
- That's fine. That's close enough.

74
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,290
Good.

75
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:04,238
What about other
distinguishing features?

76
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,772
Tattoos or moles or scars?

77
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:09,597
- Anything that might help us...
- Tattoos?

78
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,175
Not really.

79
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,578
That's fine.

80
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,942
- Is that the list of medications?
- Yes. I wrote them all down.

81
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,814
And there's no drug interactions.
None that are listed.

82
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,060
I called his doctor, so, no.

83
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,688
Has he been depressed?

84
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:34,531
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

85
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,231
Last night, he was...

86
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:40,787
agitated.

87
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:42,361
Agitated.

88
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:44,905
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was...

89
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,668
agitated, upset.

90
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:50,505
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

91
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:58,301
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said...

92
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,808
"I don't know where to begin."

93
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,915
Then he just walked out
of the bathroom...

94
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,782
I was in the tub. Taking a bath.

95
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:10,817
And when I came out about ten
minutes later, he was gone.

96
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,604
Nothing else missing?

97
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:18,199
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

98
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,364
What about the phone call?

99
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,595
I'm looking into it.

100
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,171
What phone call?

101
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:31,922
Walt's cell phone rang.
He pulled it out,

102
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,749
looked at it, and didn't answer it.

103
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:38,262
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

104
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,818
I mean...

105
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,139
couldn't that be...

106
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:44,226
important, right?

107
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,731
Anything else you can think of?

108
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:52,204
Anything else.

109
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:55,136
I called the credit card providers,

110
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,082
and there's no report

111
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,548
of any recent activity.

112
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:03,697
Let's see...
I checked with every hospital

113
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,929
within 50 miles.
Every police station. Every morgue.

114
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,833
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

115
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,008
I was actually hoping
that you had something else,

116
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,756
being that you're the expert.

117
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,247
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

118
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:26,893
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

119
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:33,766
Thank you.

120
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:47,182
So that cell phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

121
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:50,433
- And?
- Never happened. No record of it.

122
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,045
- Second cell phone.
- Yeah. I'm thinkin'...

123
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,704
I understand.

124
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:39,763
Out!

125
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,016
Get away from me!

126
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,774
Settle down, bitch!

127
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:49,064
You gonna shoot me?

128
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:52,308
Shoot me in here!

129
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:54,978
I hope I bleed like a mother, too!

130
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:56,863
That way, you have to clean it up!

131
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:04,287
It's your ride, retard.
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now get out!

132
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:15,783
Get up!

133
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,730
Get up.

134
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,568
Don't do this, Tuco.

135
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,398
No more posters?

136
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,676
Walter Junior's making more.

137
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,106
Thank you, Marie.

138
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,256
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

139
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:16,365
I mean, he just doesn't
strike me as the type.

140
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,838
He'll turn up.

141
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:30,971
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

142
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:34,596
I just find it bewildering that...

143
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,724
you didn't believe that...

144
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:40,766
Not now.

145
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,330
Empty your pockets.

146
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,175
Thought your name was Heisenberg,

147
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:48,960
"Walter Hartwell White."

148
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:52,533
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

149
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:57,076
A business name.

150
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,930
I like doing business
with a family man.

151
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,391
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,058
Answer me one thing.

153
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,110
Can I trust you?

154
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:02,567
Yes, absolutely.

155
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,102
Sit down.

156
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:24,450
DEA...

157
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,713
hit my place
of business this morning.

158
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:31,799
About a hundred cops looking for me.

159
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:35,685
You two haven't been talking, right?

160
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,048
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

161
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,684
Everybody except Gonzo.

162
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,185
That's weird, right?

163
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:49,734
I mean,

164
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:52,153
don't you think that that's weird?

165
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,584
That's weird. Yes.

166
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,483
Unusual.

167
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,610
Unusual.

168
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,706
Last two days,

169
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:05,124
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

170
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,545
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No Doze.

171
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:12,642
Explain to me,

172
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,229
how is it my fault

173
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,467
that that little bitch
did not know his place?

174
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:26,920
I saw this coming.

175
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,953
I can see the future, you know?

176
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,403
It's this gift that I have

177
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,822
deep inside my head.

178
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:42,120
I knew last night they were going
to come and try and bust me. Gonzo...

179
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:46,703
He went and snitched to the cops!

180
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:49,627
That lousy son of a bitch!

181
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,713
I trusted him like a brother!

182
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:56,167
I was good to him!
I was good!

183
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,323
I see Gonzo, I'm going to gut him,

184
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,038
I'm going to skin him,

185
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:04,113
and I'm going to stuff
his hide for a heavy bag,

186
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,399
and every time I hit him,

187
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:08,676
it's going to be like
a lesson to myself!

188
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:12,259
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

189
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:22,503
So, you plan to ice Gonzo,

190
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,453
like, future tense?

191
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,622
What?

192
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,380
You're saying...

193
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,715
You're saying that...

194
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:35,071
Gonzo is currently...

195
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:38,759
operating as a police informant,
as far as you know?

196
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,295
I'm very sorry to hear that.

197
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,192
That's disappointing.

198
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:52,148
- I'd waste him, too, yo.
- Shut up.

199
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:56,927
They're out there
looking for me right now.

200
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:59,825
They got ghetto birds and black ops.

201
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,728
I need to get high.

202
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,035
I need to get good and high.

203
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,918
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

204
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,685
It's killer.

205
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:17,840
Yeah, seriously.

206
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:24,685
So, I was thinking last night.

207
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,141
I came up with this great idea.

208
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:30,305
<i>Mexico.

209
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,188
Mexico?

210
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,983
We'll disappear way
out in the jungle.

211
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,237
We'll set you up in a superlab.

212
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,940
We'll do nothing but cook 24-7.

213
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:45,035
And no federales are going to mess
with us, because I got my people there.

214
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Connections.

215
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,174
We're going to make

216
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,415
<i>beaucoup</i> bucks, Heisenberg.

217
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:56,504
I have a wife and family.

218
00:21:57,877 --> 00:21:59,843
So what?
You'll get another one.

219
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,948
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I can't just...

220
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,719
uproot my life like that.

221
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:08,766
Yeah, man.
I mean, me, neither.

222
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,479
Who's talking to you?

223
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,777
You need me, man,

224
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,114
'cause I cooked
that scante in your hands.

225
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,343
I'll tell you something, yo.

226
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:31,838
You never tried nothing like it.

227
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,766
Stink or no stink,

228
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,139
one bump,

229
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:39,171
you'll be flying high for days.

230
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:44,279
It's a new product him
and I been working up.

231
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,991
Careful when you hit it.

232
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:50,308
It kicks like a 12-gauge
when it comes on.

233
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:55,679
It's got a secret ingredient.

234
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,608
What secret ingredient?

235
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:02,263
Chili powder.

236
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:11,120
I hate chili powder.

237
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:18,085
This blue magic, this is money.

238
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,728
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

239
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,963
We're going to rewrite
history with this.

240
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:35,178
All right!

241
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:37,813
Time to clean the <i>menudo</i> out
from between your ears!

242
00:23:39,343 --> 00:23:41,067
No, I need him, Tuco.

243
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:44,070
I need him very, very badly.

244
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:47,531
He's my partner.

245
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,910
And if he doesn't go,

246
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,415
I don't go.

247
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:57,619
I'll tell you this,
my cousins are driving up here

248
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:01,036
right now to smuggle us back down,
and they're going to be here by sunset,

249
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:05,064
and you're going to be on that truck,
or you're going to be dead!

250
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,023
And you...

251
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:12,664
You better hope
they got room in the trunk.

252
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:28,476
Where are you going?

253
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:31,197
Louis is taking me
to the train station.

254
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,992
We'll put these up.

255
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:34,775
No, no, honey.
No, I'll do it.

256
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,199
He wants to help, let him help.

257
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:40,643
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

258
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:44,872
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

259
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,764
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

260
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,246
I got my cell if you need me.

261
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,342
Bye, sweetie.
I'll see you later.

262
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:57,897
All right. Bye.

263
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:02,263
Actually,

264
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:06,014
I think the very fact they haven't
found him yet...

265
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,464
bodes well.

266
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:10,814
Well, I mean, if he...

267
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,751
You know.

268
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,071
Somebody would've smelled
something by now.

269
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:21,992
There's got to be something, some
detail that we haven't picked up on.

270
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:24,828
What about the second cell phone?

271
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,674
Aw, Jesus.

272
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:30,292
We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

273
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,754
Okay. What are you talking about?

274
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:41,727
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared,

275
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:44,598
there's no record of it
with the phone company.

276
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,518
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

277
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:50,011
But his phone rang.
I heard it.

278
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:53,231
Well, all right.
Well, then, if that's the case,

279
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:55,978
he must have a second phone.

280
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:01,342
Why? What sense
would there be in that?

281
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,881
All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

282
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,105
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
"secret cell phone" and then drop it.

283
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,819
What does it mean?

284
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,682
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

285
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,509
It means Walt has a secret.

286
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:22,239
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

287
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:26,153
"Everyone."

288
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,158
Skyler, come on.

289
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:31,770
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

290
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:37,732
Then, let's assume
there'a second cell phone.

291
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:40,154
So, what? Is he having an affair?

292
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,698
Walt? Please.

293
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:48,412
What about the marijuana?

294
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:52,387
He's not on pot anymore.

295
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:54,383
Says who? Him?

296
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,958
Chemotherapy and marijuana
go together

297
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,767
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

298
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:02,711
Maybe...

299
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:05,677
he's addicted to the pot,

300
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:09,252
and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

301
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,863
You don't get hooked
on pot like that.

302
00:27:11,988 --> 00:27:15,105
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

303
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:20,027
You have to question
this drug dealer person.

304
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:21,928
He may know something.

305
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:30,593
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

306
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:33,586
Then grasp.

307
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:45,681
Excuse me. Ma'am?

308
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:49,848
Hi. I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

309
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,434
No. I'm afraid not.

310
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:55,379
- Why?
- I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

311
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,823
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

312
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:03,586
He taught your son
chemistry in high school.

313
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,928
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

314
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:08,909
That was a long time ago.

315
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:10,127
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:13,664
It's my understanding that he and Jesse,
they've stayed in touch.

317
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:15,415
Really?

318
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:22,503
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

319
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,852
He really tried to motivate him.

320
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:27,747
He was one of the few
teachers who cared.

321
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,128
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

322
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:32,341
I'm so sorry to hear
about his illness.

323
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,578
Please pass along our best wishes.

324
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:37,406
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

325
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:38,814
He's missing, actually.

326
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:41,233
Just kind of walked off or...

327
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:44,854
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around

328
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:47,489
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

329
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:49,337
That's terrible.

330
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,723
Anything we can do to help?

331
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:55,217
Well, if you could put me
in touch with your son.

332
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,423
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

333
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:01,054
Jesse's not answering either
phone number I have for him,

334
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,178
and no one seems
to be home at his house.

335
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:06,800
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

336
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,738
I don't necessarily. I just...

337
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,677
- Are you with the police?
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

338
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:19,313
I'm with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

339
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:23,609
Oh, my God.
Is my son in trouble?

340
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:26,653
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

341
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,871
Do I need to get a lawyer?

342
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:31,852
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this,

343
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:34,119
coming here and asking
questions about my son...

344
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:36,914
Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you,
I'm not here on official capacity.

345
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,103
I do not care what your son
may or may not have done wrong.

346
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,819
I just want to find
my brother-in-law.

347
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:45,790
His wife is worried sick,

348
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:48,218
and she's got a baby on the way.

349
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:52,237
I'm sorry.
I would like to help you,

350
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:54,901
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

351
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,670
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

352
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:01,932
Well, thanks for your time.

353
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:09,441
If you could tell me one more thing.

354
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:11,787
Is Jesse still driving the, uh,

355
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:14,809
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo,
as far as you know?

356
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:17,176
If he had spent half as much time

357
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:19,414
and money on his education

358
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,117
as he has on that
ridiculous bouncing car...

359
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,282
Lowrider, huh?

360
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:33,025
Nah, nothing yet. Listen,
do me a solid and check out a...

361
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,380
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo

362
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:38,760
registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.

363
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:43,085
Specifically? I want to know
if the car's got LoJack.

364
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,013
It's one of those jackoff lowriders.
It's got a good shot that there is.

365
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:50,779
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

366
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:18,256
Chili powder.

367
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:22,847
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

368
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,435
Whatever, man.

369
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:26,773
At least I tried something.

370
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:28,671
It almost worked, too.

371
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:31,141
How's about you leaving my gun?

372
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:34,963
First you boost it, then
you leave it in your house.

373
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:36,144
My gun.

374
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,166
How was I supposed to know

375
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:43,232
you were chauffeuring Tuco
to my doorstep?

376
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:46,227
Well, at least he wants you alive.

377
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:22,246
Hey, I don't get it.

378
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:25,184
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

379
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:26,818
I don't know.

380
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,297
I don't know.

381
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:33,011
Does it really matter?

382
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:37,058
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant,

383
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,545
who does he automatically blame?

384
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:40,808
Us.

385
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,811
We need a plan.

386
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:49,273
Think, think.

387
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:51,351
Let's just bum-rush him, man.

388
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:53,938
You know, you crack him
over the head with something,

389
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:55,823
and I'll go for his gun.

390
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:03,412
"Crack him over the head
with something"?

391
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:09,432
And you got the C-bomb, man.

392
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:11,780
You're as good
as checked out already.

393
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:14,208
You should be, like,
all sacrificial,

394
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,344
jumping on a grenade, yo.

395
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:22,334
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here,

396
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,057
because I'm going
to be dead soon anyway.

397
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:26,809
That's your point?

398
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,013
We got to get him to take this.

399
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:02,033
He don't much like
the taste of chili P.

400
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:03,930
That much has been established.

401
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:07,058
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

402
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:13,495
Eat.

403
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,033
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

404
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,128
Go and sit.

405
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:37,088
You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

406
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:40,455
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

407
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,638
Take it easy, Tio.

408
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,493
I will feed you. I eat first.

409
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:25,219
That's the deal.

410
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:34,412
What?

411
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,813
I get it, I get it, I get it.

412
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,116
You greedy old bastard.

413
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,291
I tell you, Heisenberg...

414
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,457
Old people.

415
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:57,555
You feed them, huh?

416
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,547
You put them in a really
nice crib in the country,

417
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:03,591
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

418
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,699
You better eat every bite of that.

419
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:32,377
What did you do that for?

420
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:34,372
God!

421
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,615
Look. Lookit.

422
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,503
There's nothing left.

423
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:49,061
What?

424
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:51,050
What do you want?

425
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:02,327
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

426
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,035
Don't go there.

427
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,352
Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?

428
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,547
What, you don't like them?

429
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:29,276
One ding. That means "yes."

430
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:31,156
Tio don't like you.

431
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,989
Why don't you like them, Tio?

432
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,376
You don't trust them?

433
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:52,586
Why don't you trust them, Tio?

434
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,335
Tuco, come on.
I mean, he's...

435
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:59,726
There's clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

436
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,824
Did they do something to you, Tio?

437
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,899
Something that you don't like?

438
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,334
What did they do to you?

439
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,649
What did you do to my Tio?

440
00:39:31,774 --> 00:39:32,800
Nothing.

441
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,303
Bullshit! My Tio does not lie!

442
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,392
I don't know. I swear.
I don't know.

443
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,142
Maybe, I did change

444
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,247
the channel on his TV, but...

445
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:47,668
That's it. While you were cooking,
he was watching one of those...

446
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:51,083
those "telenovels"
with all those ripe honeys on it?

447
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:54,120
He was really into it. I told you
not to change the channel, man!

448
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:57,196
Dude needs his eye candy. That's it.

449
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:05,416
Is that it, Tio?

450
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,253
Is that it, Tio?

451
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:13,127
Did they change your <i>mamitas</i>?

452
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,690
What are you telling me, Tio?

453
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,564
Are they punking me?

454
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,852
No, man.

455
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:50,086
Come here!

456
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:09,857
Shut up!

457
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:24,829
Please, no!

458
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,416
Please, no! No, God!
I don't want to die!

459
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:31,169
Tell me what you did, Walter!

460
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:32,707
Jesus!

461
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,672
I don't want to die!

462
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:38,551
Tell me what you did!

463
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,411
We tried to poison you.

464
00:41:48,562 --> 00:41:50,355
We tried to poison you,

465
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,385
because you're an insane,

466
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,277
degenerate piece of filth,

467
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:58,404
and you deserve to die.

468
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:43,157
Who's the bitch now?

469
00:43:03,883 --> 00:43:05,445
Let him bleed.

470
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,653
The keys!

471
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:30,857
Oh, my God.

472
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:34,292
The cousins?

473
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,507
What the hell's going on?

474
00:44:44,658 --> 00:44:45,858
Jesse Pinkman.

475
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:49,169
You're a hard man to find.

476
00:44:57,557 --> 00:44:58,656
Aw, shit.

477
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:12,386
Easy.

478
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,850
Oh, my God.

479
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:30,991
Oh, my God.

480
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,552
- Hank.
- Who?

481
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,361
- Hank.
- What?

482
00:46:40,224 --> 00:46:41,743
- Oh, my God.
- What?

483
00:46:41,868 --> 00:46:44,666
- Oh, my God.
- Stay. What are you doing?
