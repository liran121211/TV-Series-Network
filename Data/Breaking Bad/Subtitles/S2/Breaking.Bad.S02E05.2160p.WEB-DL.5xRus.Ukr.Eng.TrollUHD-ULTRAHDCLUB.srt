1
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,209
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,961
Here at the end of round one

3
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,421
I'm gonna recommend cautious optimism.

4
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,841
{\an8}We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded

5
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,803
{\an8}reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,764
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:46,809
{\an8}Yeah.

8
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:49,019
{\an8}Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,703
{\an8}You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,855
{\an8}And your hair should start to come back.

11
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,487
{\an8}Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:03,033
- I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
- Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,621
{\an8}So no more confusion?

14
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:12,334
{\an8}- No more...?
- No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,962
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,257
Fine.

17
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:21,593
I mean, you know, we're busy,

18
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,471
but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,474
It's all good.

20
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:35,441
{\an8}So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,526
{\an8}Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:40,195
{\an8}Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,223
Thank you.

24
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:20,402
{\an8}I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,238
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,241
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:30,204
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,706
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,416
Okay.

30
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,710
HOPE

31
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,420
Congratulations.

32
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:41,423
Thank you.

33
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,230
{\an8}Okay, well, then what about the MRI?

34
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,482
{\an8}Can you...?
Can you please explain to me

35
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:02,903
{\an8}the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

36
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:09,284
{\an8}Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

37
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:14,123
{\an8}Okay, you know, it should be covered.

38
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:17,126
{\an8}You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

39
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:21,797
{\an8}Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

40
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:24,007
{\an8}Yeah. Okay.

41
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,802
{\an8}Bitch.

42
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,679
{\an8}Hi.

43
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:33,308
{\an8}Been around someone who smokes?

44
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:34,768
{\an8}No.

45
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,979
{\an8}The hospital bill came.

46
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,148
{\an8}- That was fast.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:43,444
{\an8}Three-day stay, 13,000 and counting.

48
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:54,413
{\an8}Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

49
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,332
{\an8}I mean

50
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:01,670
{\an8}I know it's strictly your domain, but...

51
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:03,964
{\an8}They will. I'm sure they will.

52
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,799
{\an8}I'll handle it.

53
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,624
Oh, crap.

54
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,711
Bring me up to speed on Tuco Salamanca.

55
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:48,962
- Dead.
- Still?

56
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,381
- Completely.
- Okay, then.

57
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:54,134
- Well, thanks for stopping by.
- Okay.

58
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,389
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

59
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,850
- Good.
- Of course, that's not gonna last.

60
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:05,103
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

61
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,647
No takers so far?

62
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,192
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

63
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,902
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

64
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,322
- Heisenberg?
- Yeah, I know.

65
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,200
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

66
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:22,537
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

67
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:25,207
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

68
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,795
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

69
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:36,385
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

70
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:39,096
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles

71
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:41,390
in pursuit of their prey.

72
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,558
Yeah, I think I heard that.

73
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,729
You, my friend, are a great white.

74
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:50,857
How does Albuquerque liaison

75
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,403
Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

76
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,770
Like one hell of a promotion.

77
00:09:56,905 --> 00:10:00,617
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

78
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:03,245
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

79
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:05,545
What you gonna do without me, Gomey?

80
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:09,292
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

81
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,295
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

82
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:15,006
- I'm the whole package.
- I'm glad I didn't just eat.

83
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

84
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,553
- You wanna grab lunch?
- Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

85
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,432
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

86
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,600
Try not to get lost on the way.

87
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,811
Schrader.

88
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:29,146
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

89
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,982
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

90
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,859
Yeah, El Paso.

91
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:37,404
Here's the man.

92
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,617
- Hey, congratulations, Hank.
- Thanks.

93
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:47,682
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

94
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:51,102
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

95
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,938
Hey. Hey.

96
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:27,055
- Hey.
- Got some nerve coming back here.

97
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,182
Or you're even dumber than I thought.

98
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,518
Yeah, well, maybe both.

99
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:42,696
Balance for the tow, the repairs,

100
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:47,701
and extra for damages and stuff, the gate

101
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,704
the toilet.

102
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:54,249
Look, like I said

103
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,335
my word is my bond.

104
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:14,853
What would you charge me
to store this here?

105
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,981
- A million-five.
- Come on, yo.

106
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:20,400
- Your sister.
- Dog, I'm serious, all right?

107
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:25,238
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

108
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,866
We could, you know, negotiate.

109
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:34,372
Five hundred.

110
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,874
- A month?
- A week.

111
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:39,836
For real?

112
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:41,671
- See you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

113
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,090
Just hold on. Just chill.

114
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:48,803
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

115
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,097
- Outside.
- Inside.

116
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,933
- Forget it.
- Man, come on.

117
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,186
Your fence is too easy to climb.

118
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,939
Inside, padlocked, plus gate privileges.

119
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:03,109
- Come again?
- Gate, in and out, privileges.

120
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:08,031
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

121
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,784
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

122
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,285
Yeah.

123
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,925
You selling?

124
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,052
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

125
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:38,937
What about that one?

126
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,401
Serious?

127
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:57,455
FOR RENT

128
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,758
It's Jane, right?

129
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:12,429
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

130
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:16,641
- Really? Does it inspire awe?
- No. I mean, you know, it's great.

131
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:19,352
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

132
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:22,355
I had an entire house before,
detached and all,

133
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,901
but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

134
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:30,113
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

135
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:33,033
Jesus.

136
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,662
Utilities are included.

137
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,664
Stacking. Sweet.

138
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,584
- You got cable?
- Already wired. Just call to activate.

139
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,419
High speed, whatever.

140
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:47,297
Bathroom, cool tile.

141
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,341
Bedroom.

142
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:50,675
Nice.

143
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:54,054
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

144
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,516
- So you're interested?
- Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

145
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,685
And you're good with NP, NS?

146
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:04,439
Sorry. What?

147
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:07,900
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

148
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,945
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

149
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:15,241
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a
W-2 or recent pay stub, current employer

150
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,036
former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

151
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:21,915
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

152
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:25,752
Yeah. Look

153
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,420
the thing is

154
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,255
I can...

155
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,924
Unbelievable.

156
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,761
- I'm just currently between situations.
- Then I'm currently not renting.

157
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:38,598
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

158
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,268
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

159
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,085
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

160
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,440
- Trust me.
- Your dad?

161
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,443
Owns the place. I manage it.

162
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,862
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

163
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,781
Or go run your game somewhere else.

164
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,200
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

165
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,786
And I got no game, all right?

166
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,622
I just need a chance.

167
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,254
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

168
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:12,424
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

169
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,510
Didn't meet their expectations again.

170
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:18,513
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

171
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,851
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

172
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:25,561
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

173
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,648
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

174
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,825
Rent just went up.

175
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,828
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

176
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,580
Yes.

177
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,832
Okay. Yes.

178
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,834
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

179
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,754
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

180
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,340
DBAA fee, nonrefundable.

181
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:59,095
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

182
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:05,018
All right. So, what's DBAA?

183
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,562
- Don't be an asshole.
- Gotcha.

184
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,315
- I live next door.
- Really?

185
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:13,943
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

186
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,694
If you blow this, I want you gone.

187
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,989
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster

188
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:20,523
faster than you can blink.

189
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:25,038
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

190
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,539
Which is what, by the way?

191
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,042
It's Jesse.

192
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,046
Jesse Jackson.

193
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,215
Seriously?

194
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,092
What?

195
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,810
- What are you doing?
- Beating off. What's it look like?

196
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:33,398
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

197
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:36,775
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

198
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,904
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

199
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,282
So let me get this straight.

200
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:47,078
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited

201
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:49,622
career-boosting promotion,

202
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,127
so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

203
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,713
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

204
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,881
Babe, relax.

205
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:02,427
- Please, don't tell me to relax.
- Sorry, I forgot.

206
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:04,637
- You know I hate that.
- Right.

207
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,598
Dave said I should express that.

208
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:09,517
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

209
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,061
I can take a day.

210
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:13,980
No big deal.

211
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:20,194
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

212
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,762
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

213
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,265
The plan is we cook.

214
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:16,894
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

215
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:29,490
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

216
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:32,410
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

217
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:34,412
- Dude.
- What?

218
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,457
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

219
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:41,085
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before,

220
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:44,588
- but still, what choice do we have?
- First of all, there's no we.

221
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:48,801
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

222
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,219
I got profile now.

223
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:53,639
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

224
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,226
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

225
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:59,979
- No way.
- Then what do you suggest?

226
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:05,067
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

227
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,492
I got bills, man.

228
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:13,993
You've got bills?

229
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,037
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

230
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,122
I've already lost more than I've made,

231
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:20,917
and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

232
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,170
You wanna know how much I've got left?

233
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,547
After completing
my first round of treatment,

234
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:30,176
and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

235
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,345
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

236
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:35,722
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family

237
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:39,268
which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

238
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,776
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option

239
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:50,029
that leaves us with a total
of two choices:

240
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:53,282
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic,

241
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:55,535
or you and I start...

242
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:59,497
You selling whatever you can.

243
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,502
There's a third way.

244
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,880
And what would that be?

245
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:12,802
We got to be Tuco.

246
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:15,469
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

247
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:19,433
So you're going to what?

248
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,811
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

249
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:25,064
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

250
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:29,819
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

251
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:33,906
Look, we control production
and distribution.

252
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,409
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

253
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:40,580
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

254
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,081
Sky-high stacks.

255
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,918
- No.
- No? That's not the point?

256
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,713
No, I am not willing to do that.

257
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,549
Who said anything about you?

258
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:56,721
I don't vote for this plan.

259
00:24:56,887 --> 00:25:01,100
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

260
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,853
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

261
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,608
I beg your pardon?

262
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:12,612
- This is a partnership, remember?
- I rem... Oh, I remember.

263
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,947
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

264
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:18,451
That was the division of labor
when we started all this.

265
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,868
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

266
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,956
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk,

267
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,292
or on my knees with a gun to my head

268
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,462
before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

269
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:39,805
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

270
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,933
And perhaps I was overly ambitious.

271
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:46,270
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

272
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,064
Yeah, damn straight.

273
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,274
Know why?

274
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:53,277
Because we do things my way this time,

275
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:55,321
or I walk.

276
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:03,162
You need me more than I need you, Walt.

277
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:25,017
Yo, enter my <i>casa.</i>
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

278
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,227
What up with it, yo?

279
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:29,689
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

280
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,650
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

281
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:37,863
- Yo, Badge, hey.
- Cool crib, man.

282
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,699
Hey, it echoes.

283
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,534
Hello.

284
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,703
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

285
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,704
Let me give you the virtual tour, okay?

286
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:48,374
So plasma is gonna go right here.

287
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,709
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

288
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:53,045
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

289
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,922
No. They burn in, yo.

290
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:58,259
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

291
00:26:58,426 --> 00:27:01,053
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

292
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,930
That's what I'm waiting for.

293
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:05,349
- Porn, coz. You know?
- Jesus.

294
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,060
Like 3-D tatas, like right in your face.

295
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,229
Yeah. So I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs,

296
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:14,263
for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

297
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:15,526
Those are buck.

298
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:18,738
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

299
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,073
- Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
- Yeah.

300
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,575
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles

301
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,203
maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

302
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:28,122
- It's gonna be chill.
- The ladies

303
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,084
they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

304
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,421
You are going to score, big time.

305
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:40,092
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

306
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,429
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

307
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:47,266
You got any other refreshments?

308
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,352
- I could kick it. It's been a while.
- Yes, yes.

309
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,980
I could totally go for a loving spoonful.

310
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:55,524
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

311
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:59,278
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

312
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:02,114
Okay? So listen up.

313
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,993
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

314
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,122
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

315
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,083
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

316
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,753
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

317
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,463
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

318
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,133
- Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
- Seventeen.

319
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,054
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

320
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:28,765
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second

321
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,976
who else is selling right now, huh?

322
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,230
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.
- Church.

323
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:37,746
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

324
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:41,070
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

325
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:43,489
Short me, you're out.

326
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:45,282
Cut it, you're out.

327
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,118
Period.

328
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:51,247
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

329
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:52,998
Understand?

330
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,835
Badger, what is this?

331
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,630
A big opportunity.

332
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:03,300
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

333
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:07,012
Gentlemen, how far you go is up to you.

334
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,681
So bring out the product, yo.

335
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:11,642
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

336
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:15,813
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

337
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:21,652
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

338
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:23,654
Now, I got mad volume.

339
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:27,533
So you move it quick, you move it right

340
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,870
there is always more.

341
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,583
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

342
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:38,002
Apply yourselves.

343
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,295
Hell, yeah.

344
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,505
Hell, yeah.

345
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:14,955
Hey, there's the big guy.

346
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:17,416
- Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, Hank.

347
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,792
It's an armpit.

348
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,753
It's not an armpit.

349
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,588
Oh, excuse me.

350
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:25,341
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

351
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,927
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

352
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,513
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

353
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,807
Human heads, they leave.

354
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:38,103
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

355
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,770
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

356
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:45,527
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

357
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:48,614
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

358
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,450
You just do your time like a good boy,

359
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:54,620
and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown

360
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,580
in a couple of years.

361
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:16,850
I went online to this fantastic

362
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:19,979
real estate website for D.C.

363
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:24,984
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

364
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,319
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

365
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:30,572
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

366
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:33,156
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there...

367
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,291
Apologize.

368
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,044
What?

369
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:50,718
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologize.

370
00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:56,515
- For?
- You know perfectly well, Marie.

371
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,727
- Well, obviously I don't...
- Your lies.

372
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:01,520
To me.

373
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,065
The shoplifting.

374
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:06,859
All of it.

375
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:11,530
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

376
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,825
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it...

377
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:16,869
Apologize.

378
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:22,374
Now or never. I mean it.

379
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,044
Or it'll never be the same.

380
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,841
Why are you punishing me?

381
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,140
If you don't respect me enough to
apologize, to tell me the truth, then...

382
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,068
I need my sister back.

383
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:04,750
I'm sorry.

384
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:10,089
I'm sorry.

385
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:24,269
- What do you want, the gory details?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

386
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,271
No, you don't.

387
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,357
Keep you up at night.

388
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:34,238
So was it scary?

389
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:36,990
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

390
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,242
Jesus.

391
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:41,328
But you were way faster than him.

392
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:43,914
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

393
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:46,834
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

394
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,377
Kick ass and take names.

395
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,380
- Son.
- No, it's fine.

396
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:54,425
You know what it is?

397
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:58,303
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

398
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,431
I mean, you don't think about it.

399
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:03,308
You stomp them down.

400
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:06,478
Where do they come from?

401
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:10,566
Criminals, like the one you...

402
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:14,486
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

403
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,158
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

404
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:24,580
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

405
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,169
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

406
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,094
Cops.

407
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,388
Cops!

408
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,280
Wasn't sure it was you.

409
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:47,532
New car?

410
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,536
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

411
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,873
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.

412
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,007
Your half.

413
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:06,677
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

414
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,932
You're welcome.

415
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,183
Jesus.

416
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,854
Help me understand the math, okay?

417
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,940
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

418
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:23,068
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

419
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,070
$1,000 each.

420
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,197
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

421
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:32,244
Sixteen ounces should net to me $16,000.

422
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,414
Sixteen. Not 15.

423
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,417
Something came up.

424
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,253
Something came up?

425
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,548
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

426
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:49,344
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

427
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:54,099
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed...

428
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:59,646
- Or rather you got robbed.
- -but it doesn't matter.

429
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:03,358
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

430
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:05,277
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

431
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,446
And you're thinking this is acceptable?

432
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:10,741
It's the cost of business, yo.

433
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:12,492
You're sweating me over a grand?

434
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:17,038
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

435
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:19,582
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage

436
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,794
is just you making a fool of yourself.

437
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:25,839
I've got another technical term for you.

438
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,800
Non-sustainable business model.

439
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,261
You're focusing on the negative.

440
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:35,056
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

441
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,101
What happens when word gets out,

442
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:41,730
and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

443
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:44,858
Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman

444
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:49,154
drug lord, can be robbed with impunity.

445
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:50,655
Man, come on.

446
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,326
You think Tuco had breakage?

447
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:57,162
I guess it's true, he did.

448
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:58,497
He broke bones.

449
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:02,667
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

450
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,378
You want another grand?
Is that it?

451
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,839
- That's not my point.
- Take it. Here.

452
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,596
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

453
00:40:14,763 --> 00:40:16,973
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

454
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,890
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

455
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:21,353
So am I.

456
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,355
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

457
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:27,442
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

458
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,445
You've made
the division of labor very clear.

459
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:35,325
Yo, I mean, seriously

460
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:39,037
what the hell do you want me to do, huh?

461
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:07,274
Hey.

462
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,733
Sorry.

463
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,694
Wow, you snuck in.

464
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:12,988
Didn't even know you were home.

465
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,323
What you eating?

466
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,577
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

467
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,496
I thought we nixed those, huh?

468
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:23,415
Did we?

469
00:41:24,457 --> 00:41:29,087
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

470
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,798
I had a craving.

471
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:34,175
Once in a while is no big deal.

472
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,892
So where's Jr.?

473
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,060
Out.

474
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,606
With whom?

475
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,274
Louis.

476
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:55,363
Out where?

477
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:59,784
Somewhere. I don't know.

478
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,787
- He'll be back by 9.
- Okay.

479
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:08,335
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

480
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:10,128
Why don't you?

481
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:15,634
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

482
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,344
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

483
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:20,722
Just pick up the phone like I do.

484
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,860
Great.

485
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:40,825
Perhaps you might know something

486
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,202
about this.

487
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,123
Perhaps.

488
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,168
And then again

489
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,421
perhaps I don't, Walt.

490
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:57,092
Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state.

491
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,180
I'd like an explanation, please.

492
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:05,347
- You don't wanna go down that road.
- Why would you do this?

493
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:08,603
- You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
- Three and a half cigarettes

494
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,271
won't do a thing to the baby.

495
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,555
- Nothing.
- I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

496
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:15,318
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

497
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:21,491
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

498
00:43:23,076 --> 00:43:27,414
Skyler, this...
I mean, this is something that...

499
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,875
- This is so unlike you. Why...?
- Really?

500
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,003
How would you know?

501
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,841
No, thank you.

502
00:43:58,862 --> 00:44:00,030
Hank.

503
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:29,768
Jesus.

504
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:13,478
Yo.

505
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:25,490
You asked me what I want you to do.

506
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:38,336
I want you to handle it.
