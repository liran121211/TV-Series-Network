3
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,603
Come on!

4
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,078
Please.

5
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,590
Come on!

6
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,443
God.

7
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:11,563
Slow down.

8
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:13,306
Slow down.

9
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:16,907
Just... just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,032
Do it.

11
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,441
All right.

12
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:24,363
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,044
Listen to me.

14
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,088
Are you listening?

15
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:50,477
Everything is going to be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,416
Now, listen.
Calm down.

17
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:53,758
Just...

18
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:56,198
sit tight.

19
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,411
I know who to call.

20
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:27,598
Saul Goodman sent me.

21
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,718
Come on.
Inside.

22
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:48,267
Watch the door.

23
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,918
Where is she?

24
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,034
Any other drugs in the house?

25
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,775
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

26
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,499
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

27
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:42,513
Here's your story.

28
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,797
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

29
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:47,833
Say it.

30
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,053
Say it, please.

31
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,871
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:00,573
Say it. I woke up.
I found her. That's all I know.

33
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:02,630
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:03,607
Again.

35
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,698
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:07,731
Again.

37
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,669
- Again.
- I woke up.

38
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,646
I found her.
That's all I know.

39
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:14,758
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

40
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,651
Once you call it in,
the people who show up

41
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:25,357
will be with the Office
of Medical Investigations.

42
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,673
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

43
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:30,487
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

44
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,663
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

45
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:35,180
Typically,
Ods are not a high-priority call.

46
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,928
There's nothing here
to incriminate you,

47
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:40,227
so I'd be amazed if you
got placed under arrest.

48
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,137
However, if you do,

49
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,446
you say nothing.

50
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,385
You tell them you
just want your lawyer.

51
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,360
Then you call Saul Goodman.

52
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,916
And do I need to state the obvious?

53
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,484
I was not here.

54
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,590
You put on a long-sleeved shirt

55
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,265
and cover those track
marks on your arm.

56
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,922
Count down from 20,

57
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:20,011
and then you dial.

58
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,485
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

59
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,524
Do you want 2% or skim?

60
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:05,642
Two.

61
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,263
I'll be there in a minute.

62
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,979
You all right?

63
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,183
Flynn, get your butt in here.

64
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,092
My God. Mom, Dad, come here!
You got to see this!

65
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,333
Seriously.

66
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:02,977
What?

67
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,544
Look right there.

68
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,047
Look at that.

69
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,750
- Are those donations?
- Yes.

70
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,398
Actual donations for your dad?

71
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:16,924
Total strangers gave us

72
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,706
$490.

73
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,541
26 people.

74
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,801
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

75
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:28,520
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

76
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,149
And it's all real actual money.

77
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,830
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

78
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,322
And look what they're saying.

79
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,285
"Hang in there, Walt."

80
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,680
"Good luck."
"Hang in there."

81
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,994
Isn't this awesome?

82
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:51,387
That's...

83
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,397
that is something.

84
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:00,369
Don't you think a little
"thank you" is in order?

85
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:02,054
Yes, absolutely.

86
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:06,261
Thank you, son. Thank you.
This is a big, big help.

87
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:13,031
20 more bucks from Thunder Bay,
Ontario.

88
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:14,875
Damn.

89
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,874
$510.

90
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,485
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you</i>

91
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,460
<i>"Do-Not-Call-List." However,
if you're cool, leave it at the beep.</i>

92
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,810
How did I know you wouldn't
be answering your phone?

93
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,072
I'm on my way.
I'm going to be there momentarily.

94
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:42,717
I expect you on the porch,
bag packed,

95
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,427
ready to go.
No excuses.

96
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,625
You may not want to
be here for this.

97
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:50,706
I just...

98
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,162
woke up,

99
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:54,938
and I found her.

100
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,077
That's all I know.

101
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,822
What's her date of birth?

102
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,714
Your daughter's date of birth.

103
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:11,683
April...

104
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,563
April 4, 1982.

105
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:21,235
And mother's maiden
name and place of birth.

106
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:24,196
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

107
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:27,055
Bishop.

108
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:30,862
And place of birth?

109
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:31,924
Phoenix.

110
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:35,873
Phoenix, Arizona.

111
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:41,983
This is our address.

112
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:45,506
- Do you have someone who can drive you?
- I can drive.

113
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,845
Then, if you'd like
to meet us there,

114
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,460
we can complete the intake
and take our samples,

115
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:53,135
and then you can make
your arrangements.

116
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,723
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

117
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,852
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this!

118
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:28,384
- 40 from Te...
- Terre Haute.

119
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:40,592
It's me.

120
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:42,083
Are you there?

121
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,526
I'm just checking in.

122
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:51,386
Our friend says he thinks
everything went well.

123
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:52,756
And that's...

124
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,343
that's good.

125
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,361
So... listen.

126
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,347
Just call me, all right?

127
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:03,404
You've got to come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

128
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,917
All right.
I'm coming.

129
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,464
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

130
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,517
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

131
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:21,116
Of course, they're also saying they want
to be paid in private islands,

132
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,341
so dig deep.

133
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,162
Biggest donation

134
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,277
gets a six-pack of
my very own Schraderbrau.

135
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,245
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

136
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,770
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

137
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:36,792
Other than Gomie here pees sitting down,
here's what we know.

138
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,154
Christian Ortega, aka "Combo."

139
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,205
Shot dead by an unknown
assailant last month.

140
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,835
"Combo?" I hear you say.

141
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:48,328
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

142
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:50,871
No. He was a dipshit,
wannabe banger.

143
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:54,050
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a Baby Jesus

144
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,491
from a Knights of Columbus
manger back when he was 17.

145
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,366
This dude was so low-rep,

146
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,701
he never showed up on our radar.

147
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,604
So why am I talking about him?

148
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,560
Anyone?

149
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:05,942
Anyone?

150
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:07,442
Bueller?

151
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,355
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

152
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,172
How is it that the purest,
most professional grade

153
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:14,949
of meth we've ever come across

154
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,843
is being slung by the likes of that?

155
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:19,576
But wait. It gets better.

156
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:23,064
Since Baby Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck,

157
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,183
the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

158
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,708
Not a speck to be found in Albuquerque.
Now, why is that?

159
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,526
Because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

160
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,971
So says APD.
They think they got their man.

161
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:39,819
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

162
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,985
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.

163
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,522
APD thinks this is our mastermind.

164
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:48,297
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you, okay?

165
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,804
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup

166
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,352
every night at Los Lunas?

167
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:54,406
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes,

168
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:57,427
he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa.

169
00:17:58,249 --> 00:17:59,699
I've been thinking.

170
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,734
Top-shelf product like this,

171
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,082
it doesn't fall off
the face of the earth.

172
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,419
The way I see it, raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

173
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,455
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

174
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,430
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

175
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:16,248
Haven't had much luck inside
the land of enchantment.

176
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:19,127
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff

177
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:22,334
making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada.

178
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,527
In fact, everywhere

179
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:26,063
but here.

180
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,857
Almost as if somebody wised up,

181
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:31,189
stopped shiting where they eat.

182
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:33,632
Now,

183
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:37,206
I say Heisenberg's still out there.

184
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,297
I say he's gone regional.

185
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,337
Only he's still right here in town.

186
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:46,663
Come on, 2,800.

187
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,268
Come on, big 28.

188
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:50,809
You can do it.

189
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,984
Only 30 more dollars.
30 more.

190
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,975
$40!
2,810! Yes!

191
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,844
- Who's going to be next?
- Your guy found him?

192
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:07,534
Where is he?

193
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,499
Okay, listen.

194
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:11,047
I don't care.

195
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:12,681
You have your guy, pick...

196
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,769
Just shut...

197
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,943
Saul,
shut up and give me the address.

198
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:23,119
I don't recommend it.

199
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,789
APD's been known
to sit on this place,

200
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:29,364
keep an eye on the comings
and goings.

201
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:31,498
Are they here now?

202
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:33,606
Well, I don't see any sign,

203
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,384
but that's the point.

204
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,894
Police could be the least of it.

205
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:40,970
You could just get mugged or shot.

206
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:45,649
How about you go on home, Walter?

207
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:48,161
Let me handle this.

208
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,934
Look at me, son. Wake up.

209
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,917
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

210
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:35,677
Wake up.

211
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:39,547
It's me. It's Walt.

212
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,703
Let's get out of here.

213
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:50,297
- No, I'm good.
- Help me out, now.

214
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:54,474
Listen.

215
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:56,913
You are not good right here.

216
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,067
You are not good at all.
You hear?

217
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:02,326
Put your arms around me.

218
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:05,068
You're going to stand up,

219
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,520
and we're going
to walk out of here, okay?

220
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,106
We're going to take you someplace
nice and safe. That's it.

221
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:12,431
Now let's go. Come on. Here we go.

222
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,185
I killed her.

223
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,140
What?

224
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:46,495
I killed her.
It was me.

225
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,965
I killed her, man.
I killed her.

226
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,294
Look at me.

227
00:22:51,515 --> 00:22:52,912
You didn't kill anybody.

228
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,808
I loved her.

229
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:02,064
I loved her more than anything.

230
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,042
I haven't given much thought
to the programs, to be honest.

231
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,817
I guess they should be,

232
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,833
I don't know. Just...

233
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,608
use your best judgment.

234
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,040
There's no yellow dress here.

235
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,567
It's all black and gray.

236
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:24,545
When's the last time you saw
her ever wearing a yellow dress?

237
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:27,825
What about blue?

238
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:31,079
Blue's better than black, right?

239
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,899
Not dark blue.
More like...

240
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:36,679
not...

241
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:39,355
super-bright, either.

242
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,521
I mean, blue is blue.

243
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:44,712
No cleavage.

244
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:47,833
Long sleeves.

245
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:52,461
It's nice.

246
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:55,542
It's nice.

247
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:02,912
Big yawn, Holly.

248
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:06,647
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired, too.

249
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,655
There we go.

250
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,823
Would you mind turning
that thing down or off?

251
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:36,209
The dinging.

252
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,785
Just turn down the volume.

253
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:40,163
Dad, it's money.

254
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:44,252
Please do it.
The noise is disturbing...

255
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:45,703
the baby.

256
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,881
Marie, slow down. I can't...

257
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,260
Oh, my God.
You are kidding me.

258
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:58,360
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

259
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:02,393
Wait. Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

260
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,481
- Guess what.
- What?

261
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,109
- You are going to be in the newspaper.
- No way.

262
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,282
One of Aunt Marie's patients
works at the <i>Journal</i>.

263
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:14,633
When she told him about
the Web site and the donations,

264
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:17,241
he went to his editor,
and they're doing a story about you.

265
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,451
For real?

266
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,537
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

267
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:22,888
Awesome.

268
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:25,715
It'll mean more hits.

269
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,490
And more contributions.

270
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,291
East of Scottsdale?

271
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:36,934
Let me guess. Not talking.

272
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,560
Nope. Not a one.

273
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:42,811
Someone somewhere's
running one tight ship.

274
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,719
All right, Chief.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

275
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:48,966
You, too.

276
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:55,412
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

277
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:57,087
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

278
00:27:00,598 --> 00:27:03,246
Gentlemen,
this is supervising agent Hank Schrader.

279
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,500
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

280
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:09,662
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

281
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:11,912
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

282
00:27:12,037 --> 00:27:13,889
- It's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

283
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:17,561
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

284
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:18,844
Please, just Gus.

285
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,506
Got to tell you,
you guys make some killer chicken.

286
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:23,796
Thank you very much.

287
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:25,880
They are underwriting
this year's fun run,

288
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:28,059
and I thought I would
give them a tour.

289
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,975
Absolutely. Get to see what you're
supporting. We thank you gentlemen.

290
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,468
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

291
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:37,402
The Albuquerque office covers everything
from drug-related money laundering

292
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:40,408
to interdiction of illicit controlled
substances crossing the border.

293
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:44,328
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine,

294
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,682
which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

295
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:48,757
Terrible.

296
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:51,665
It is indeed.
Now, we've had some successes locally,

297
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,201
but overall the supply
seems to be growing.

298
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:57,938
But I got to tell you,
community outreach, like this fun run,

299
00:27:58,063 --> 00:27:59,892
one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

300
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:01,429
Anything we can do.

301
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,382
Gentlemen.

302
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,067
Is this one of your agents?

303
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:12,982
That's my brother-in-law.

304
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:15,461
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to...

305
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:16,943
I'm very sorry.

306
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,696
What sort of health issue?

307
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:21,046
Lung cancer.

308
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,177
That's a rough one.

309
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,037
You don't have to do that.

310
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,204
Please.

311
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:28,779
I'm happy to do it.

312
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:34,068
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

313
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:54,574
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

314
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,434
I'm going to have
my surgery on Friday.

315
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:03,359
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

316
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:06,845
But if not,

317
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:10,047
Saul will take care of things.
He's got your money.

318
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:11,872
He's keeping it for you.

319
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:28,220
Lingering on things doesn't help,
believe me.

320
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,241
Just try and focus on
getting better, okay?

321
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:34,095
I deserve this.

322
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,576
What?

323
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,025
What you said in the desert.

324
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:43,334
I get it...

325
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:45,503
what you meant.

326
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,778
I deserve whatever happens.

327
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:13,688
Shit!

328
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:31,025
There he is!

329
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:35,422
We're doing a feature
on Walter Junior.

330
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,847
We called you about 50 times.

331
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:41,338
I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

332
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,659
I know.
But I thought,

333
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:46,997
If it's good enough for the <i>Journal</i>,
then why not TV?

334
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:48,637
So I went for it.

335
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,305
This is him?

336
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,892
This is Dad. Great.

337
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,502
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Junior in the middle,

338
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:58,477
Mom and Dad on either side.

339
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,709
Mom and Dad?

340
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:04,539
How much money have
you raised so far?

341
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,918
$6,360.

342
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:11,701
But there's more
coming in all the time.

343
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,280
- That's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

344
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,691
It's been incredible.

345
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:20,407
Judging from the things you
and other folks have written about him,

346
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:22,482
your dad must be quite a guy.

347
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:25,714
He is. He's the best.

348
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:29,108
You don't want to lose him,
do you, Walter?

349
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:30,689
None of us do.

350
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:32,169
We love him.

351
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:37,686
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

352
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:41,697
Anybody.
He's a great father, a great teacher.

353
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,485
He knows, like, everything there
is to know about chemistry.

354
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:49,069
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

355
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:50,435
He's just...

356
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,267
decent,

357
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:56,794
and he always does the right thing,

358
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,932
that's how he teaches me to be.

359
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:03,007
Would you say he's your hero?

360
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,370
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,501
Totally.
My dad is my hero.

362
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:18,352
Does that put him to sleep?

363
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:21,425
This one just relaxes him a little.

364
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,100
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in in just a minute.

365
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:33,722
Here we are.

366
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,422
Relaxed yet?

367
00:32:58,038 --> 00:32:59,638
As a matter of fact...

368
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:06,102
I don't know what this stuff is,

369
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,611
but it's pretty great.

370
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:11,989
Yeah, it looks like it.

371
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,983
We'll be here when you wake up.

372
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,801
I'll be looking for you.

373
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,431
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

374
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:24,606
You better.

375
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,876
Where's your phone?

376
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,784
Your cellphone.
Did you bring it?

377
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:36,987
Which one?

378
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:45,515
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

379
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:06,220
First things first.

380
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:08,883
How old is the baby now?
And when do I finally get to meet her?

381
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:11,952
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

382
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,927
She's seven weeks tomorrow.

383
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,520
Seven, right?

384
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:17,413
I have a...

385
00:35:18,522 --> 00:35:19,646
a picture,

386
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,537
here somewhere.

387
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,870
She's beautiful.

388
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:29,073
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

389
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,237
How's your pain level, Walter?

390
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,307
Very low, basically.

391
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:37,491
Shortness of breath?

392
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,082
A bit, but much better.

393
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,211
Good.

394
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,635
Your margins look good.

395
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:45,682
Obviously,
I can't foresee the future,

396
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:48,570
but even conservatively speaking,
I can say that

397
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:51,242
you bought yourself
some real time here.

398
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,762
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

399
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,037
That's great.

400
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:57,529
That is great.

401
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:03,786
So, when could he get back
to his normal routine?

402
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:06,035
He can ease into it now.

403
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:09,928
And can he go back to work or...

404
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:11,835
I'd give it a few more weeks.

405
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:16,421
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

406
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:18,577
But he can be on his own?

407
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,127
Just more, independent.

408
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:26,245
Use your best judgment.

409
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:29,815
That's good news for you, honey?

410
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,211
One less baby in the house.

411
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,450
Welcome back.

412
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:50,791
Thanks.
It's good to be back.

413
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,267
Jesus.

414
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,750
We were all so sorry to hear...

415
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:02,428
Terrible thing.
Just...

416
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,676
But you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

417
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:09,501
- You've been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

418
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:11,336
After a certain point,

419
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:13,089
time off doesn't help,

420
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:16,079
so I figured I'd rather be here,

421
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:18,610
focus on work.

422
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,578
Sure.

423
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:20,812
Absolutely.

424
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:25,989
See you inside.

425
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,629
Truth Or Consequences altimeter,
2-niner-niner-8.

426
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:46,470
Pima 311,
contact Albuquerque Center 134.6.

427
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:50,726
Juliet 5 Bravo, ident say altitude.

428
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,882
Juliet 5 Bravo, roger.
Cleared direct to Winslow.

429
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,926
I think I may just keep this.

430
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:02,794
What do you think?

431
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,497
Doesn't look so bad, right?

432
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,039
What are you doing?

433
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:13,014
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

434
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,986
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

435
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,435
Marie will pick up Walter
Junior from school.

436
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,460
You'll have the house
to yourself for two days.

437
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:25,621
I want you to pack
your things and leave.

438
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:27,776
Why would I do that?

439
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:30,849
Hank has offered to help, since you
shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.

440
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:34,781
I want you gone by Monday morning.
I want...

441
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:36,985
I want you gone.

442
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:49,635
Can you at least tell me why?

443
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:53,208
Because you're a liar, Walt.

444
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:57,209
Two cell phones, after all.

445
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,013
What?

446
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,943
Right before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone,

447
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:04,218
and you said,

448
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:06,227
"Which one?"

449
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:08,903
When?

450
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:12,373
I was medicated.

451
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:14,660
I could have said
the world was flat.

452
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,385
You know what I think?

453
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,060
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

454
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:23,410
Honey, we have been over this.

455
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,981
Asked and answered, right?

456
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:27,978
Then it got me thinking

457
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,846
again about all
the strange behavior,

458
00:39:32,855 --> 00:39:35,125
not the least of which was
the disappearance.

459
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,666
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals,

460
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:39,732
checking the morgue.

461
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,104
Your fugue state.

462
00:39:45,478 --> 00:39:47,578
I had to believe that, didn't I?

463
00:39:48,544 --> 00:39:50,044
I had to find a way.

464
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:52,889
I mean...

465
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:56,452
who would lie about such a thing?

466
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:58,509
You tell me.

467
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:01,815
You tell me exactly what it
is you think I'm lying about.

468
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,781
What?
I'm having an affair.

469
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:06,719
- Is that what you think?
- Yes.

470
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:08,888
- For the last few weeks.
- With whom?

471
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:10,906
Who am I having an affair with?

472
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:12,951
My guess was Gretchen Schwartz.

473
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:16,178
Something was going on between you.

474
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,750
I just knew.

475
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:18,832
Jesus.

476
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,350
Get me a Bible to swear on,
if that's what it takes.

477
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:23,418
I am not having
an affair with Gretchen.

478
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:25,393
I know.
I know you're not.

479
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:27,047
Because I asked her.

480
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,749
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

481
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:35,124
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

482
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:37,255
So I finally left a message...

483
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,630
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

484
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,645
I thought that would get her attention,
and it did.

485
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,069
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

486
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:50,864
The money for your treatment,

487
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,078
Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

488
00:40:57,868 --> 00:40:59,414
They paid for nothing.

489
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:03,709
You refused every offer they made you.
But that didn't make sense

490
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:07,184
because I checked with Delcavoli
at the hospital, and...

491
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,301
not including your surgery,

492
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:11,667
we're nearly paid up.

493
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,317
Over $100,000.

494
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:17,748
Out of where?

495
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,218
Out of thin air?

496
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:30,335
But then...

497
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,876
I called your mother.

498
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:40,872
Thanks for that, too.

499
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,916
But I thought,
maybe she has some money that I don't

500
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,584
know about.
Maybe she contributed.

501
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:51,015
It's possible.

502
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:57,761
It turns out that not only is
the money not from your mother,

503
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,577
she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

504
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:08,622
You never went to see her.

505
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,827
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

506
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:15,485
You were gone for four days, and...

507
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:17,575
yet she swears...

508
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:20,761
that you were never there.

509
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:29,603
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

510
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,514
Could you...

511
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,237
just once...

512
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,367
do me the courtesy

513
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,140
of not denying it?

514
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:00,502
Don't do this, please.

515
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,650
Please don't go.

516
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:15,912
If I tell you the truth,

517
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:18,221
will you stay?

518
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:23,355
Stay, and I will
tell you everything.

519
00:43:25,263 --> 00:43:26,613
Whatever it is...

520
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,610
I'm afraid to know.

521
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,387
Wayfare, 5-1-5 radio check.

00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:04,281
