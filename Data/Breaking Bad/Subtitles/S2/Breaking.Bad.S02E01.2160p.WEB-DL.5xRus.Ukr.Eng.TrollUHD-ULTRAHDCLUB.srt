1
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:48,308
{\an8}What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,355
{\an8}We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,733
{\an8}It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,369
{\an8}Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,331
{\an8}Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,426
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:27,347
Just remember who you're working for.

8
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,851
{\an8}What did you say?

9
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,110
{\an8}I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,649
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,528
{\an8}Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,906
No, I'm just saying.

13
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,742
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:50,601
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:52,163
{\an8}Is that it?

16
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,374
{\an8}Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,794
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,215
{\an8}Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

19
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:12,392
{\an8}Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,397
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela...

21
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,245
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:37,649
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:44,340
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:39,521
Adjusting for inflation...

25
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,440
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation

26
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,150
say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:50,365
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:54,577
Remaining mortgage on the home, 107,000.

29
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:58,873
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:02,877
Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities

31
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,129
say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,883
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:14,889
{\an8}Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:20,645
{\an8}That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,773
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:29,059
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:32,448
That is what I need.

38
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:35,994
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,038
That's only 10 and a half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:43,793
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:49,173
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,617
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,384
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,018
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:44,411
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:47,899
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,776
- Oh, damn, Tuco.
- Shut up!

48
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,279
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,949
- Do something.
- Do something?

50
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:58,534
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:01,079
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,622
Do that... Do that thing.

53
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,170
No, there's not... There's nothing.

54
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,713
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:13,382
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,178
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,892
No.

58
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,176
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:59,512
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,514
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:09,605
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,692
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:50,021
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,793
What's the big hurry?

65
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:20,384
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.

66
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,512
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,152
You're done.

68
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,861
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:07,825
Hello?

70
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,216
<i>Are already married...</i>

71
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:24,842
Hello?

72
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,931
<i>Thank you to our viewers...</i>

73
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,058
Hey.

74
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:36,062
<i>The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>

75
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:38,981
Walt?

76
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,276
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:45,321
Walt.

78
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,662
Walt.

79
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,998
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

80
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,501
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,340
Are you okay?

82
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:07,759
Great.

83
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,307
New hat?

84
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:17,353
Yeah.

85
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,305
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,432
Do you want me to heat some up for you?

87
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:27,405
<i>But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas</i>

88
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,158
<i>like airports, golf courses...</i>

89
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,384
Where've you been?

90
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,387
What is...?

91
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:24,518
What are you doing?

92
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:26,770
Okay.

93
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:30,190
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,276
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:36,488
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

96
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:39,616
Okay. Yeah, just...

97
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,286
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:45,581
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:47,916
Stop it!

100
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:41,720
I know you're scared,

101
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:47,226
and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:53,273
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:02,157
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,233
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:20,861
Dead, man.

106
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:23,655
<i>Ruto</i> or <i>rute</i> or however the hell you...

107
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,823
- This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

108
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,951
- Conjecture isn't helping.
- Conjecture...?

109
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:31,413
- We need to state the facts.
- Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:34,874
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,758
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning

112
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:39,379
I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighborhood.

113
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:42,006
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,635
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:48,493
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,101
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,146
And that way...
That way he just kept staring at us

118
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,941
saying, "You're done."

119
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,193
"You're done"?

120
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,195
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,115
That means exactly how it sounds, yo.

122
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,868
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,287
Right now, Tuco's thinking, "Yeah, hey

124
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:17,000
they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:22,506
What happens when he decides "no"?

126
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,516
No.

127
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:35,477
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,615
- How would you do it?
- What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:52,369
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

130
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,540
All right.

131
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:59,543
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:02,963
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:06,591
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:10,929
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,015
So three shots?

136
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:18,061
- Three shots or, I don't know, two.
- Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:20,647
- Two would probably work, I guess.
- Okay, two shots.

138
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,231
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:25,819
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:30,657
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

141
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,909
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo

142
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,328
- he's probably coming at you, right?
- Yeah.

143
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,705
- You turn toward him.
- Yeah, just wheel on him...

144
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,689
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,291
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,336
- I don't know. Three shots.
- Three shots.

147
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,173
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:47,981
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,387
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:57,184
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,855
All right.

152
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:05,317
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,486
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:10,894
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:13,617
Well, let me see.

156
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:17,704
It's not...

157
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:30,217
How can you suggest that we kill a man,

158
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:33,094
and you can't even open the gun?

159
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:40,602
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

160
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:47,567
Yeah.

161
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,457
Call Skyler.

162
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:13,218
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

163
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:16,930
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

164
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:19,640
Well, aren't you the early bird,
up and out already?

165
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,477
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant

166
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,020
over by UNM tonight,

167
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:26,690
so let me know if you guys wanna hang.

168
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:29,025
Listen to me. "Hang."

169
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:32,487
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

170
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:34,322
I'm still hip.

171
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:37,576
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

172
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:40,662
I don't know, I just feel like Chinese.

173
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:46,042
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

174
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:51,256
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes

175
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:54,134
with mashed potatoes and meat loaf,

176
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:59,055
and try and figure out
how to use the little knives and forks?

177
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,766
I wonder if that ever happens.

178
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:05,562
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

179
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,065
Skyler didn't pick up?

180
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,485
Obviously she's not home.

181
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,537
Baby. Baby, wait up.

182
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:25,040
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

183
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:27,208
Dinner tonight. That new place.

184
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:31,212
- How late they serve?
- I don't know.

185
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,340
You got Dave at 8.

186
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,595
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you do. Remember?

187
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,347
No, that's Thursday.

188
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:45,018
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.

189
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,576
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

190
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:50,357
They were gonna charge us a penalty.

191
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:52,665
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

192
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,109
And I'm doing them, Hank.

193
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:57,113
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

194
00:21:57,322 --> 00:22:00,533
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

195
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:02,953
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

196
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:15,548
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

197
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:17,425
Oh, boy. I...

198
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:22,973
I think Dave is really helping you.

199
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:26,518
Yeah.

200
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:29,478
Yeah.

201
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:44,786
Sorry about that.

202
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,629
She's...

203
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:03,596
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

204
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:08,268
Hits two in the sand, two in the forest,

205
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:11,026
- and then he says, "Give me a four."
- Hey, Gomez.

206
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,773
Gomez? What do you got for me?

207
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:16,026
Come on. Chop-chop.

208
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,611
Good morning to you too.

209
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:25,493
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

210
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:28,580
- You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

211
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:30,138
The place smells like feet.

212
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,541
This is them. Check this out.

213
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:39,382
- Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite. So they tell me.

214
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:41,384
Burns about 5000 degrees.

215
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,719
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

216
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:47,432
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

217
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,729
Wait. I take that back.

218
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,780
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

219
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,653
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

220
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,697
It rolls. Jesus.

221
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,827
- So, what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

222
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:11,206
P2P?

223
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:14,292
They're cooking old school biker meth.

224
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:16,326
Who the hell still does that?

225
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:19,172
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

226
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:21,925
Pseudo's in short supply,

227
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:25,720
so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

228
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:28,473
That and the thermite

229
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:30,850
I'd say these two know their chemistry.

230
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,728
- But ranking them as burglars?
- Shit.

231
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:36,897
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

232
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:40,276
They got book learning
but no street skills.

233
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:41,835
Maybe they're college kids.

234
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:44,030
Chem students trying to make a big score.

235
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,282
Yeah, maybe.

236
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:49,077
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...

237
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:52,372
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

238
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:57,085
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them,

239
00:24:57,293 --> 00:25:00,130
and not those boys from Juarez.

240
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:27,634
Your daughter wants out.

241
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,333
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

242
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,341
<i>We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.</i>

243
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:06,673
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

244
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:08,383
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier</i>

245
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:12,220
<i>before you go out
and, you know, face the day.</i>

246
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:13,680
<i>I'm realizing now</i>

247
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:16,988
<i>it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone</i>

248
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,436
<i>owing to the extra baby weight...</i>

249
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:24,023
Hey, sweetie.

250
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:32,532
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

251
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:35,326
No.

252
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,746
No, no. Well, not all of it.

253
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:44,627
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...
My stomach, you know.

254
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:48,881
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

255
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:19,329
- How would he know where I live?
- You sure it was Tuco?

256
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,663
Who else could it be?

257
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:22,874
- Did you ever tell him my name?
- No.

258
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:25,132
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

259
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,253
- No.
- What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

260
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:29,630
- Did you tell them anything?
- I didn't say jack.

261
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:33,259
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

262
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:37,597
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

263
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:45,063
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

264
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:47,231
Oh, God. What happens then?

265
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:56,616
Look, it's got five bullets.

266
00:28:56,824 --> 00:29:01,245
I finally figured out how to...
Look, I just finally... I figured it out.

267
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:04,040
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

268
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:08,169
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

269
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,171
I mean, mathematically.

270
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:13,549
I've got a better idea.

271
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,678
Thank God.

272
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:19,222
All right.

273
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,766
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

274
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:27,105
- Beans.
- Beans?

275
00:29:27,855 --> 00:29:30,691
They're castor beans.

276
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,650
So, what are we gonna do with them?

277
00:29:33,694 --> 00:29:36,197
Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk?

278
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:38,032
Climb it and escape?

279
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:41,702
We are going to process them into ricin.

280
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:44,497
Rice and beans?

281
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:49,669
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

282
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:52,213
It's toxic in small doses.

283
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,882
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

284
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:57,885
All right.

285
00:29:58,094 --> 00:30:00,847
- All right. So...
- Don't touch them.

286
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:05,184
- You can get poisoned from beans?
- Yes.

287
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:09,939
Back in the late 70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

288
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,734
The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella

289
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,153
to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

290
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:19,837
And we're talking about an amount
not much bigger than the head of a pin.

291
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,286
But it... It killed him?

292
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,455
Oh, yes.

293
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:30,084
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device,

294
00:30:30,293 --> 00:30:35,298
and then no more Tuco.

295
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:18,883
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey, Hank.

296
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:21,093
How you doing?

297
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:24,263
Is this... This a bad time?

298
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:29,018
No, come on in.

299
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,779
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

300
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:43,699
What can I do for you?

301
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,789
Maybe we ought...

302
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:51,958
You wanna sit down first?

303
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,626
I don't know, Hank.

304
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:57,129
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

305
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,345
- Did she send you?
- Hell, no.

306
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:07,098
She's barely even talking to me.

307
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:09,141
That's why I'm here, okay?

308
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,479
Self-preservation. Big time.

309
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:18,401
Look

310
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:21,153
I know you gals have your ups and downs.

311
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:22,822
- I get it.
- Gals.

312
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,367
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

313
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:31,581
But if you could do me this huge favor
and just return her phone calls.

314
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:36,544
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

315
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:40,590
Communication. Communication, right?
Back and forth. Come on.

316
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,218
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

317
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:46,762
Just call her back.

318
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:54,687
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

319
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:57,982
That's right.

320
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:02,111
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

321
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,573
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

322
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:09,118
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

323
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:13,831
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologize.

324
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:15,875
Yeah.

325
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:21,547
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know...

326
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:29,930
You knew about this.

327
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,434
We're working on it.

328
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:36,771
I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave.

329
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,857
- And I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good, yeah.

330
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,693
But it's an ongoing process, Sky,

331
00:33:42,902 --> 00:33:46,572
and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

332
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:48,240
I mean, we gotta, you know.

333
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:52,161
We gotta support the shit out of her.

334
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:55,164
Do we?

335
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:56,707
Yeah.

336
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,877
I need support.

337
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:02,880
Me.

338
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:05,132
The almost-40-year-old pregnant woman

339
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,191
with the surprise baby on the way.

340
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,660
And the husband with the lung cancer

341
00:34:09,762 --> 00:34:12,639
who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

342
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:14,723
And he barely even speaks to me anymore.

343
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:17,812
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

344
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,772
And the overdrawn checking account.

345
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,526
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap,

346
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:26,487
and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet,

347
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:28,781
and we can't even afford to fix it.

348
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,992
But, oh, I see.

349
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:34,787
Now I'm supposed to go, "Hank, please

350
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:37,540
what can I possibly do to further benefit

351
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:40,459
my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister

352
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:43,668
who somehow always manages
to be the center of attention?"

353
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:49,760
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

354
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:08,362
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

355
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,438
That's all it takes?

356
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:46,150
That's all it takes.

357
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,904
So now what?

358
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:53,199
Now we arrange our next meet.

359
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,743
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

360
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,995
Business as usual.

361
00:35:58,204 --> 00:36:01,916
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

362
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:08,547
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
meth formula we've been working on.

363
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:09,799
Care to try it?"

364
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:12,760
Okay, well, what's new about it?

365
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,169
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

366
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:17,855
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

367
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,602
It gets the user insanely high.

368
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,188
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

369
00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:27,858
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

370
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:31,320
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

371
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:37,618
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72

372
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:40,454
it'll look like natural causes.

373
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:44,667
- What, like a heart attack?
- Yeah.

374
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,794
Or the flu, maybe.

375
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:49,880
His associates won't know
any differently,

376
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:52,967
and we'll be in the clear.

377
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:56,178
Not if Tuco kills us first.

378
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:15,489
Just keep it down.

379
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:17,825
Hey, Hank. What's up?

380
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,618
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

381
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:23,581
You been home yet?

382
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,459
No. Why?

383
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,044
<i>Well...</i>

384
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:32,613
Because I really screwed up.

385
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:36,051
<i>I apologize in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

386
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:39,095
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.</i>

387
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:44,310
- I should have just kept out of it.
<i>- Yeah, well, okay.</i>

388
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:46,103
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

389
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:50,024
Yeah, well, that... You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

390
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,776
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

391
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:55,905
Jesus, the wives, huh?

392
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:58,490
Hank, unfortunately, I really...

393
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:02,244
<i>Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

394
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:07,249
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.

395
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,292
You wanna see something really freaky?

396
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:12,671
- Well, I would, but...
<i>- Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>

397
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:18,093
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomey are at. Just a second.

398
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:23,349
<i>Hank.</i>

399
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:25,857
Hang on.
It should be coming through right now.

400
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,191
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

401
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,946
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>

402
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:40,115
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.

403
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,703
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

404
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:48,499
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>

405
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,838
- I'm taking this.
- No. It's my gun. I need it!

406
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,697
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

407
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:00,970
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've...

408
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:04,640
I've gotta get home. My family.

409
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:47,766
Skyler?

410
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:55,816
Walter, Jr.?

411
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:04,199
Skyler?

412
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:51,080
Hey.

413
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:54,166
Where's Walter, Jr.?

414
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:58,045
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

415
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:04,676
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

416
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:10,933
So where have you been this time?

417
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,317
Walt?

418
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,457
Walt?

419
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:55,894
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

420
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,239
Walt!

421
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:10,868
I'll be right there.

422
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,129
Yeah, I recognize these two knobjobs.

423
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,798
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit

424
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,207
named Tuco Salamanca.

425
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:28,969
- Guess he got tired of associating.
- Yeah.

426
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:31,805
- Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

427
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:34,308
Thanks.

428
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:40,079
The big one smells fresher.

429
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:43,257
You guys find a death wound?

430
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:50,991
I see lots of blood, but no bullet holes.

431
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,960
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

432
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,829
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

433
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:01,126
Let me get out of your way here, man.

434
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:14,848
Snap.

435
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:17,893
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

436
00:43:27,736 --> 00:43:29,988
Oh, this is beautiful.

437
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:32,991
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

438
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,000
We got the world's dumbest criminal.

439
00:43:35,118 --> 00:43:37,537
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

440
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:41,708
Big stuff here was moving this guy's body

441
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:45,254
when the stack must have shifted.

442
00:43:45,462 --> 00:43:49,883
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

443
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:54,721
- Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
- Don't you just?

444
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,030
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

445
00:43:57,224 --> 00:44:00,435
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

446
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:10,487
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

447
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:20,789
I don't know where to begin.

448
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,095
What the hell are you doing here?

449
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:25,312
Get in.

450
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:40,410
Get in.

451
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:57,344
Let's go.
