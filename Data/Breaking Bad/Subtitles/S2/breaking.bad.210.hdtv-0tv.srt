3
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:29,106
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

4
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,008
Thought I would.

5
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:34,009
That inhaler really seems
to be doing the trick.

6
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,197
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

7
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:37,260
Please.

8
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:39,158
You've earned it.

9
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:40,758
Don't push it.

10
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,371
Besides,
I want you well for the weekend.

11
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,704
Mom wants to par-tay.

12
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:52,286
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

13
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,097
Sunday afternoon, maybe?

14
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:58,122
Nothing too big.
Just family and a few friends.

15
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:00,595
We've got a lot to celebrate.

16
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,020
Don't you think?

17
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:06,236
Sounds good.

18
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,186
Now,

19
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,011
what are you supposed to do today?

20
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,163
Nothing.

21
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:27,745
Excellent.

22
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,643
Brownie points for taking a nap.

23
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,289
Can you meet?

24
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,381
I thought maybe you...

25
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,491
might have, you know,

26
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,022
kicked.

27
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,340
Signed off.

28
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,305
I was even checking the obits.

29
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:26,693
No such luck.

30
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,336
So where does it stand?

31
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:35,030
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches like,

32
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:38,112
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

33
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:40,356
What's the upshot?

34
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:42,696
The upshot.

35
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:49,817
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

36
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:54,374
Damn.

37
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,066
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

38
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:03,826
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

39
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,622
In fact,

40
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,772
the news is all good.

41
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:13,199
What do you mean, good?

42
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,223
You mean, like, good good?

43
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,337
You mean, like, remission good?

44
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:22,965
Remission.

45
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,175
Not to imply I'm cured.

46
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,843
I still have cancer.

47
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,556
But there's been a significant reduction
in the tumors.

48
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,734
How significant?

49
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:34,785
80%.

50
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:36,893
Dude!

51
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:38,242
No way!

52
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,316
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch, but...

53
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:46,307
"Options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

54
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,143
That's awesome!

55
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,419
Serious?

56
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,278
That's great, man.

57
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,672
I mean, my aunt, she never...

58
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:58,125
I mean, at your stage,
I didn't think that could happen.

59
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,499
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

60
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,175
You must be so psyched.

61
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,589
Of course. I am.

62
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,223
Now we...

63
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:17,042
I mean, what do we...

64
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:20,439
I almost forgot.

65
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:25,743
So,

66
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,316
how do you want to,

67
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,467
you know, proceed

68
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,319
in light of this kick-ass news?

69
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,466
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

70
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,141
Sell off what we have.

71
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:45,718
And then...

72
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,373
Then I guess...

73
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,407
I'm done.

74
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:17,798
Batter up!

75
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:19,123
Everyone?

76
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,584
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast,

77
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,481
with my non-alcoholic beverage.

78
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,690
Somebody kill the music.

79
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:31,435
I know one party
can't begin to repay

80
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,079
all your support and your...

81
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,736
your many, many kindnesses.

82
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,155
But then again,

83
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,335
Hank does make one mean Margarita.

84
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:50,124
We really do want to thank you.

85
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,870
These last few months have been...

86
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:57,423
a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

87
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,443
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

88
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,471
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

89
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,414
I'm gonna stop with the sappy stuff.

90
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,512
But it's true. It really is.

91
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,832
And for the first time
in a long time,

92
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,771
we are so excited about the future.

93
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:26,729
Anyway,

94
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:29,975
I want to also express my gratitude

95
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,572
to two very special people

96
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,732
who couldn't be here today.

97
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:38,347
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

98
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,126
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz,

99
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,030
for those of you
who don't know them are...

100
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,337
well, they're heroes.

101
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:51,715
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer

102
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,328
to pay for Walt's treatment.

103
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,844
And they did.

104
00:09:58,662 --> 00:09:59,464
So...

105
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,267
to Gretchen and Elliott.

106
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,274
How about the man of the hour?
Come on!

107
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,310
Speech!

108
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,827
It's kind of funny.

109
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,586
When I got my diagnosis,

110
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:26,101
cancer,

111
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,560
I said to myself,

112
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,121
"Why me?"

113
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:35,472
And then,

114
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,434
the other day,
when I got the good news...

115
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,662
I said the same thing.

116
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:56,593
Anyway,

117
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,786
thank you for coming.

118
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:04,408
Enjoy.

119
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,200
Cheers.

120
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,181
Inspirational.

121
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:15,059
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

122
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:16,508
I'll tell you that much.

123
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,862
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery,

124
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,096
5 or 6 ounces of C4,

125
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:24,599
that's how those cartel boys party.

126
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,453
But why a turtle?

127
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:30,114
That's the best part.
It was a...

128
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:33,108
What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

129
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:37,105
Not a metaphor, not an analogy...
It's a...

130
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,949
What's the word I'm looking for?

131
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:44,152
Anyway, "<i>Tortuga.</i>"

132
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:47,081
That was the name of our snitch.

133
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,915
Bean-speak for "tortoise."

134
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:52,146
Tortoise, turtle, what have you...

135
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,521
I never knew the difference myself.

136
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,263
Top me off there, will you, buddy?

137
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,254
Anyway,

138
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,459
poetic.

139
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:03,667
I guess, yeah.
Poetic. It was poetic.

140
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,391
That's the word.
I guess that's the word.

141
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:28,330
Go ahead.

142
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:34,101
Better not let your mom see.

143
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,665
I think I see a hair.
Maybe two!

144
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,836
- There's no worm in this, right?
- That would be Mescal.

145
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,061
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

146
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:04,375
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

147
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,885
Had this firearm
instructor who was...

148
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,172
He was a good ol' boy.

149
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,786
There you go. Thanks.

150
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,539
I mean, this guy could put 'em away
like he had two livers, okay?

151
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,174
Like a fish, okay?
Like a drunk fish.

152
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,542
We were drinking Mescal stupid.

153
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,578
But...

154
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:28,849
- What you doing there?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

155
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,561
The kid's 16.

156
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:35,147
What are you,
going for Father of the Year?

157
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,497
What are you looking at him for?

158
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:47,576
We're celebrating.
Come on.

159
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:22,927
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

160
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:26,304
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

161
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:34,748
Bring the bottle back.

162
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:39,794
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

163
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,491
My son! My bottle! My house!

164
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:48,466
It's all right.

165
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:50,341
What are you waiting for?

166
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,140
Bring it back.

167
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:02,008
Why don't we just call it a day?

168
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,427
All right, pal?

169
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,114
We good?

170
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:09,886
The bottle.

171
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:13,367
Now.

172
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,388
What's going on?

173
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:34,951
Here, sweetie.

174
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,758
This is your brain.

175
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,471
This is your brain on drugs.

176
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:22,407
You weren't supposed to wake up.

177
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,793
Ever or...?

178
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:29,622
I was just thinking that I'd bring it,
you know, in.

179
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,101
You want me to go back to bed?

180
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,994
I guess that'd be kind of...

181
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,430
Need some help?

182
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,105
I got it.

183
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,304
Just have a seat.

184
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:51,952
Is there any coffee?

185
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,597
Shit.
One second.

186
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,029
At least let me do that.

187
00:16:58,154 --> 00:17:01,204
I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

188
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,723
All right. Here.

189
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,713
You take the good one.

190
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,909
It's huevos rancheros.

191
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:17,743
I can tell.

192
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,450
Fork.

193
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,034
There you go.

194
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,559
So what are you up to today?

195
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,601
Working?
Whatever that means.

196
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,770
I'm all yours.

197
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:49,859
Really?

198
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,869
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

199
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,594
I just wanted to say that...

200
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,413
We'll talk tonight,

201
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:52,214
but I wanted to say that

202
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:58,133
I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday,

203
00:18:58,258 --> 00:18:59,608
but it wasn't me.

204
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm sorry.

205
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:07,932
Love you.

206
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:03,524
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

207
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,348
<i>We'll talk tonight,</i>

208
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:11,253
- <i>but I wanted to say that...</i>
- Hey, there.

209
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,240
- Who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

210
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:18,925
If I leave 'em at home, I'll wind up
eating them all myself, so.

211
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,637
They're actually leftovers.

212
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,255
We had a little
get-together for Walt.

213
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,392
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

214
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:29,739
Actually,

215
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,921
Walt's got...

216
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:38,444
He's been... battling cancer.

217
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,395
And last week, we got good news.

218
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,033
I'm so sorry.

219
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:46,429
But we're really optimistic.

220
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:47,412
Great.

221
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,039
Good news is great.

222
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:52,955
Yeah, it is. It really is.

223
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,994
Feel free to bring these any time.

224
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,705
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,689
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,339
Then again, what about tankless?

227
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,207
Sure. We got 'em.

228
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,481
The good ones will really run up
your price though.

229
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:39,191
Set you back about 1,200.

230
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,398
It's not an issue.

231
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,778
- You want installation, right?
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.

232
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:53,165
That's what I like to hear.

233
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,783
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

234
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:10,031
That's Hover Man.

235
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,971
He can surf, skate, glide,

236
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,369
whatever, 'cause he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

237
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:19,905
That's cool. Great lines.

238
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:27,428
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

239
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,352
That's Kanga Man.

240
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:33,393
Kanga Man.
Half man, half kangaroo?

241
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,950
And who's this in his pouch?

242
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:37,897
His sidekick Joey.

243
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,453
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know,

244
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:43,486
fights crime.

245
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:46,523
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:49,143
You know that, right?

247
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,078
Only female kangaroos have pouches.

248
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,796
I know.

249
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:56,557
But, you know,
it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:56,682 --> 00:22:58,918
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,088
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:06,512
And this is?

253
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:08,534
It's Backwardo.

254
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,598
Wait, no. I actually
changed it to Rewindo.

255
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:16,769
Anyways, he goes backwards.
He can make everything go in reverse.

256
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:19,225
Time and stuff?
Like time traveling?

257
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,774
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,094
He walks backwards.

259
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:27,879
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,742
He does it, like, really fast.

261
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,265
Look, say someone's coming
at him with a knife. Right?

262
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,373
It's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from 'em.

263
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,971
I was a kid

264
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:43,713
when I drew all these.

265
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,293
It was, like, four years ago.

266
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:49,057
They all look like you.

267
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,328
What?

268
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:53,010
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,260
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

270
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:00,855
Shut up.

271
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,691
Like you never wanted a superpower.

272
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,689
Is that your door or mine?

273
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:14,964
I don't know.

274
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:18,456
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:27,792
I gotta go.

276
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:28,883
Where?

277
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,441
Where?

278
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,184
Hold up.
Where are you...

279
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:17,153
Hey, Dad.

280
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,799
There you are.

281
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:20,537
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,286
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,316
Sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:30,634
Finally realized that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:31,986
Exactly.

286
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:36,335
I was in the neighborhood. Was wondering
if you wanted to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:37,563
Sure.

288
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,572
This your dad?

289
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,160
This is the new tenant.

290
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:50,173
Donald.

291
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,314
Jesse.

292
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,620
I'm sorry.
Did you need something?

293
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:05,308
Dad, why don't you come in?
It was nice seeing you.

294
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,883
- It was nice to meet you.
- You, too.

295
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Hey, Dad.

296
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:40,934
Hey, son.

297
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:42,855
Are you home early?

298
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:45,962
Oh, man.

299
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:49,868
Did you have a good day?

300
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,859
Now it is.
Finally, hot water.

301
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:54,320
No more toxic waste.

302
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:56,794
Yes, indeed.

303
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,117
Top-of-the-line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:01,237
Sweet.

305
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,314
Want to take her for a spin?

306
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:08,981
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:12,556
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:17,776
The pilot... in.

309
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,379
Ignition. Bingo.

310
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:24,223
Ready!

311
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:26,102
All right. Let her rip!

312
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:36,228
117,000 BTUs.

313
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:41,109
Built-in corrosion
resistant draft reducer,

314
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:43,619
safety thermocouple
at the pilot burner.

315
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:45,871
Sounds really good, Dad.

316
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,618
And the energy savings.
I mean...

317
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,754
Careful, careful, careful.

318
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,895
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make there. Are you okay?

319
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:55,351
I'm fine.

320
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:02,763
Son, about yesterday...

321
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:05,347
I'm sorry about the pool.

322
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,520
That was not your fault.
Not at all.

323
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:15,054
Your old man embarrassed himself,

324
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,769
and I'm not very proud
of my behavior.

325
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:20,818
I have to say I feel very foolish.

326
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:27,901
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

327
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:31,918
We're fine. Everything's fine.

328
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,838
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

329
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:41,500
But, son,
I owe you an apology most of all.

330
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:46,031
I should have used
better judgment all around.

331
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:50,421
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right,

332
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,457
and for that I'm very sorry.

333
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,900
But I kept up, right?

334
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:58,599
You and Uncle Hank.

335
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,560
I drank three.

336
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:10,324
I have some tools to put away.

337
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:19,538
You want to catch a movie later?

338
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:26,490
What?

339
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,567
What was that all about?

340
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:30,778
What?

341
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,025
Before. With your dad.

342
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,849
It wasn't about anything.

343
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,483
So I totally just misread
your total dis?

344
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:44,299
If anything,
I was doing you a favor.

345
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,460
A favor?

346
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:48,635
I told you.
He's a hard-ass.

347
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,842
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well...

348
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,450
- So what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

349
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:58,325
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

350
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,876
- How's that?
- I mean,

351
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,930
I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

352
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:08,177
I bought a filter.

353
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:11,052
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

354
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,829
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

355
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:14,923
So?

356
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:19,144
- So?
- You think I'm going to be all like,

357
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,593
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

358
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:23,964
"And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

359
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:26,717
That's all you think you're doing?

360
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,744
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't!

361
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:32,056
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

362
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,601
Us. All right?
I'm talking about us.

363
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:36,786
Us.

364
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,606
You and me.

365
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:43,857
Who's you and me?

366
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,801
I'm out of here.

367
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:47,540
Dad!

368
00:33:53,602 --> 00:33:54,414
Dad?

369
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:57,342
What?

370
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,414
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

371
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:03,761
Rot?

372
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:07,526
I'll show you.
Here.

373
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,645
Take a look at that.

374
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,466
See that?

375
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,426
Ever seen anything like it?

376
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,138
- It's wood.
- It's wood

377
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,224
that contains fruiting bodies.

378
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:22,142
Fruity what?

379
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,396
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

380
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:28,053
I don't really see anything.

381
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,610
Well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

382
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:34,238
Then you cut it all out.

383
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,865
You just cut it out and start fresh.

384
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,074
Well, better get to it.

385
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,956
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

386
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:46,245
Not if I can help it.

387
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:18,254
You bucking for a promotion?
Go home already.

388
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:19,912
I will.

389
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,122
Can I just ask...

390
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,658
the Keller account.

391
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,101
Keller account...

392
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:32,426
It's listed as a Current Asset
on this balance sheet,

393
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:36,928
but the invoice was never
presented to Accounts Receivable, so.

394
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:38,154
God.

395
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,550
One of these days I'm going to have
to sort through all the Dad stuff.

396
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:45,203
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships

397
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:47,285
with these little companies.

398
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:49,621
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

399
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:50,598
Or not.

400
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:52,957
Right.

401
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:57,654
Seriously, you're not
gonna make me lock you in, are you?

402
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,690
Jesus.

403
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:09,236
I'm fine.

404
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:14,338
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

405
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:18,046
I'll see you tomorrow.

406
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:26,099
What's wrong?

407
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:31,675
I guess it just

408
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,821
doesn't feel any different.

409
00:36:42,813 --> 00:36:43,625
The...

410
00:36:44,946 --> 00:36:45,953
good news?

411
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:48,189
I mean,

412
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,756
nothing's really changed.

413
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,655
It's just postponed.

414
00:36:57,096 --> 00:37:00,133
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

415
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:01,876
But...

416
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:06,498
lately, it just feels like...

417
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,016
More tunnel.

418
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:11,953
I'm sorry.

419
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:21,196
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

420
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:23,436
I don't know.

421
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:26,695
For me, it was the flu.

422
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,224
What?

423
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,803
My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:33,333
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got,

425
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,158
different circumstances,
but we were happy,

426
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:37,977
we were over the moon.

427
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:41,300
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,526
Flu. Boom.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,332
Couldn't get out of bed,
couldn't move.

430
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:49,336
Great timing.

431
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,845
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking,

432
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,072
Why now?

433
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,112
Being that rock...

434
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:09,428
Being that rock
takes everything you got.

435
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,782
Are you going to work today?

436
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,110
Skyler, there's rot.

437
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:09,656
Damn!

438
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,214
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

439
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,783
You don't have to do that.

440
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:45,226
You're buying the wrong matches.

441
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:49,125
- What?
- Those matches. They're the wrong kind.

442
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:52,956
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips,

443
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:54,964
not the matches themselves.

444
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:58,760
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

445
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:04,933
More striker strips.
You understand?

446
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,471
Those only have the one.

447
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:10,436
And don't buy everything
in one place.

448
00:44:10,902 --> 00:44:12,202
Do it piecemeal.

449
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,595
Different items, different stores.

450
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,420
Attracts less attention.

451
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,157
Are you following me here?

452
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:24,971
There he is.
That's the guy.

453
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:45,452
Stay out of my territory.
