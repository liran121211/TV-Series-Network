1
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:50,755
{\an8}Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:56,094
{\an8}- What's up, brother?
- Hey, bro.

3
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,362
This is stupid.

4
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:19,409
- You got a better idea?
- Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:22,745
- So when do we, you know?
- We don't, for now.

6
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,164
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:29,210
{\an8}Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,712
{\an8}Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal

9
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:36,300
{\an8}that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't...

10
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,060
{\an8}That's too expensive.

11
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:51,107
{\an8}Look, I can't leave my house,

12
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:53,859
{\an8}for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,737
{\an8}I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:59,782
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:03,661
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,549
{\an8}That's $600.

17
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,176
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,805
- Rest of what?
- Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,349
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:28,603
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,938
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:34,022
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:43,534
{\an8}Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:47,413
{\an8}As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:51,000
Where are you going?

26
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,003
I leave first.

27
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:15,316
{\an8}- Walt!
- In the kitchen.

28
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:31,958
Hey.

29
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,295
{\an8}Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:39,799
{\an8}Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,592
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:47,098
What?

33
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:52,103
- Good morning, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,856
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:57,942
{\an8}But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,363
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:05,616
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice

38
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:08,775
which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:13,082
{\an8}But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,128
{\an8}Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,673
I wanted to.

42
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:25,845
{\an8}- Grapefruit juice?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,557
{\an8}There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:32,143
{\an8}No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:37,857
{\an8}All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,567
{\an8}- Yeah.
- There you go.

47
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,278
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,448
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:48,242
{\an8}No, in terms of pure musicianship

50
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:51,411
{\an8}I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:54,081
{\an8}You wouldn't know any current bands.

52
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:57,474
{\an8}- That's besides the point.
- Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,170
{\an8}You too.

54
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,633
{\an8}- Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
- Boz Scaggs.

55
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:07,345
{\an8}Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:08,703
- Bye.
- You're welcome.

57
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:10,348
{\an8}Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:12,016
{\an8}All right.

59
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:18,272
Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,733
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Come to think of it

62
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:25,279
- I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
- Stop it.

63
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:28,658
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,326
Thank you.

65
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:33,913
Hey, listen

66
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:36,374
{\an8}in the calendar section

67
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,043
{\an8}all week long

68
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,547
there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

69
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:47,134
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published,

70
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:49,887
- and that sort of thing.
- Yeah?

71
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:55,935
{\an8}Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

72
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:58,938
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:12,535
Oh, and

74
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:16,622
you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:19,181
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,877
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot,

77
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:27,258
and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:33,931
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder

79
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,268
to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,397
And, well, the weird thing is that

81
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:45,401
the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same

82
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:48,738
as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design

83
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:52,616
if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,911
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound

85
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,456
other than the phone ring, but...

86
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,834
They so overcomplicate these things.

87
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:07,465
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,801
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,847
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home

90
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:18,142
we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,189
Skyler?

92
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,452
Skyler?

93
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:29,463
- Ready?
- Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:41,225
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,486
Jesse Bruce Pinkman

96
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:55,531
pursuant to Section 47-8-13

97
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,789
of the New Mexico Real Property Code

98
00:09:57,908 --> 00:09:59,993
you are hereby given notice to vacate

99
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:04,582
the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,918
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,796
- It's your Aunt Ginny's house.
- And she gave it to me.

102
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,342
You were allowed residentiary privileges.

104
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,804
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,849
Look, we talked about this, okay? I'd
sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,352
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:28,230
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,733
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:34,528
A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:37,031
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:44,079
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them

112
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:48,083
which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you,

113
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,252
so you're welcome.

114
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,671
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:54,757
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:58,844
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in,

117
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:03,474
and I found your laboratory.

118
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:08,479
You guys have your own key?

119
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,405
Manufacture of a Schedule II
controlled substance

120
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:21,367
is a second degree felony.

121
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:24,828
Under federal asset seizure

122
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:28,249
the government can take the entire house.

123
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:32,086
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:34,797
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life,

125
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:38,467
but you will not drag us down with you.

126
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:41,595
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:43,972
Otherwise,
your parents have authorized me

128
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,434
to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:51,230
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:56,360
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:59,738
Come on.

132
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,989
- Hi.
- Hey.

133
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:53,542
- I fixed the garage door.
- Great.

134
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,169
Yeah.

135
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:58,047
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,839
Okay.

137
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,762
- Where were you today?
- Out.

138
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:19,485
Is everything okay?

139
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,489
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,591
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings

141
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,676
the cancer support group.

142
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,720
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:49,640
Yeah.

144
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:52,768
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,895
You were right on the money about that.

146
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:58,440
It's good to, you know

147
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,402
talk about things.

148
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,029
I think that's great.

149
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,743
Yeah.

150
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,020
Jesse.

151
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,067
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:44,820
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,365
Yeah, no, I've just been

154
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:51,201
pretty busy. How'd you...?

155
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,164
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:57,749
Hey, listen.

157
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,128
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation

158
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:05,757
we had the other day,
and I completely get why

159
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,303
Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

160
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:13,223
- It's not just your father, Jesse.
- No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:18,645
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me

162
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:21,940
which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been

163
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:25,444
thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,238
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now...

165
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:31,825
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:35,787
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:39,374
The time for talking has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,753
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:44,338
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:47,841
- I thought it was just a wake-up call.
- We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:50,301
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:52,638
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:55,974
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:59,478
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:00,938
I earned this.

176
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,482
You did not make her lunch every day.

177
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,442
What did you do, huh?

178
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,362
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,864
- Don't start with me.
- Now what?

180
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:14,368
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,829
Great family, Mom.

182
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,959
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:36,473
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,476
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:41,061
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,398
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:47,901
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:54,408
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:59,746
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:03,875
Jeez.

191
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,389
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,475
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,893
Come in and say hello.

194
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:25,022
Hey, we've got omelets.
You want an omelet?

195
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,273
No, I'm good.

196
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,401
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chilies.

197
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,486
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,479
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,409
- Who's Flynn?
- Flynn.

200
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,620
He's your...

201
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:45,626
- Flynn?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,461
So?

203
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,547
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:53,342
- You ready?
- Like it.

205
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,302
- Bye, Mr. White.
- Okay.

206
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:58,680
Bye.

207
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,024
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,032
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,494
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,579
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,831
Don't take it personally.

212
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:28,001
He wants his own identity.

213
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:36,051
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,721
- About the blackout?
- Louis is his friend, Walt,

215
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,557
and your disappearance upset him.

216
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:50,023
Hey, I made omelets.

217
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,776
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:54,569
Where you going?

219
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:58,156
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:03,036
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:11,211
- White residence.
- <i>Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

222
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:15,549
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:18,927
- I know, but there's a problem.
- <i>I don't care. We agreed.</i>

224
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:22,286
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:24,839
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,812
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,899
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:39,197
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:40,866
Out.

230
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:45,954
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,165
Skyler.

232
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,721
- What?
- Yo, I get I shouldn't call,

233
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,390
but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:01,261
I just gave you $600.

235
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,920
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks,

236
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:05,223
but that was before my housing situation

237
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,357
went completely testicular on me, okay?

238
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,561
<i>You smoked the entire 600, didn't you?</i>

239
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,062
- What? No.
- <i>Yes.</i>

240
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:12,355
- No.
- <i>Look, Jesse</i>

241
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:14,114
<i>your problems are just that:</i>

242
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:15,984
Your problems.

243
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:18,904
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:22,991
- When the moment is right, I will call.
- <i>Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>

245
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,410
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:38,632
You son of a bitch.

247
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:45,347
Son of a bitch.

248
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:49,267
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:52,437
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:56,274
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:59,861
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,736
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:45,281
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,492
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:49,536
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:53,748
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:55,083
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,711
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,422
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:03,967
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:06,136
Yeah.

262
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:09,764
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:10,891
Too hot.

264
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,102
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:15,761
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:18,440
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:20,775
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:25,780
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:29,200
Damn. I'm hating, man.

270
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:32,453
That's why we need to get the
Hammer up and running, you know?

271
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:36,124
- Get you out of the house.
- How awesome would that be?

272
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,043
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:41,713
I cut all the green parts off like you...
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:45,508
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:46,843
Get back in the scene.

276
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:50,054
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:53,183
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich,

278
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,101
and then you take...

279
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,896
Mommy's home.

280
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,982
- Hi.
- Hello.

281
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:03,610
Hey, honey, you remember Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:07,697
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:09,699
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey.

284
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:12,451
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:17,040
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:40,647
Yeah, I used to not like carrots too.

287
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:48,697
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:01,418
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:06,256
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:07,914
You got other people to call?

291
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:10,468
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:12,846
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:16,474
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:20,519
- Sucks to be you, P.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,189
Here.

296
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:24,816
See you, man.

297
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:27,068
It's good to see you.

298
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:32,365
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and...

299
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:35,534
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:38,204
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:40,832
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:46,046
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:48,965
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,694
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:12,989
- You cannot be serious.
- Hey.

306
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,367
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:18,620
Not cool.

308
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:33,940
- Morning.
- Oh, hey.

309
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:35,566
Morning.

310
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:38,903
Where did...? Where did Mom go?

311
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:42,407
Out.

312
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,873
Where's breakfast?

313
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:56,170
Hey.

314
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,173
Let's go do something.

315
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,093
Like what?

316
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:05,138
Something fun.

317
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:09,892
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:14,188
- Is your foot on the... Okay. Good.
- Yeah. I got it.

319
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:18,526
Good.

320
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:22,405
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:26,159
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,661
Okay, let's slow down here

323
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,956
to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:35,126
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:38,170
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:42,175
- Much better than last time, huh?
- Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,677
Has he?

328
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:47,221
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,474
Don't forget the turn indic... Good.

330
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:52,101
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,188
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:59,108
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:01,944
Right hand.

334
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:04,989
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:11,412
- Are you using both feet?
- Yeah.

336
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:13,790
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:16,125
You can't use one foot on each pedal.

338
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:19,045
- Why not?
- Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:23,966
- Just stop, please. Right. All right.
- Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:27,542
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:30,723
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,600
- All right.
- Okay?

343
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:40,608
Okay, just... You don't have to...
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,694
Just... That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:47,740
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:50,159
Okay.

347
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,746
Don't... Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:56,374
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,500
The gas, the brake, the gas, the brake.

350
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:00,044
I can't do this.

351
00:31:00,711 --> 00:31:02,422
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,466
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:08,594
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:12,348
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,642
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:19,689
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:22,747
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,530
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:30,188
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:32,242
- Braking.
- You're using both feet again.

361
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:34,787
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:36,622
The brake. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,129
Okay.

364
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:45,548
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:48,259
I told you.

366
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:49,969
Flynn.

367
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:02,166
- Hands up, asshole!
- Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,876
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:07,129
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,174
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:13,010
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,179
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:19,392
- You smell like shit.
- It's a long story.

374
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,227
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here

375
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:23,479
750 for the repair.

376
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:27,107
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me,

377
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:31,904
and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,531
Okay.

379
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:35,783
Here's the thing.

380
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:37,368
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:39,954
But I can pay you this week, all right?

382
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:46,168
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:49,297
- I thought your word was your bond.
- It totally is.

384
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:53,175
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:56,721
But I will, soon.

386
00:33:57,138 --> 00:33:59,098
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:02,476
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:05,385
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:08,983
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:12,737
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:17,408
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:19,952
Please, all right? I really...

393
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:26,000
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,963
Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,069
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:55,988
There's something called
methylamine. Me... Meth...

397
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:58,616
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:02,119
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,170
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:19,512
Hey! Hey!

401
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,296
Skyler.

402
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:03,139
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,226
I was thinking maybe

404
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,895
this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,839
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:40,426
In Ireland.

407
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:45,139
Weird.

408
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,351
Sounds weird.

409
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:05,284
I wanted to apologize,

410
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:07,495
for everything.

411
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:10,831
My

412
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:14,376
Desire for privacy.

413
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:18,214
My emotional

414
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,800
unavailability.

415
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:25,513
Having cancer doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:30,082
I haven't been a good partner to you,

417
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,896
and for that

418
00:37:34,772 --> 00:37:36,649
I'm very sorry.

419
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:40,569
I love you.

420
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:44,323
And I love this family.

421
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:47,743
And I just

422
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:50,120
want to make sure that

423
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,207
we don't lose contact.

424
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,716
Thank you.

425
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:04,552
Okay.

426
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:11,350
I agree.

427
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,450
Is that it?

428
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:31,036
God.

429
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,414
God, how long are you gonna do this?

430
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:36,166
- Do what?
- This.

431
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,168
Not talking to me.

432
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:41,881
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,508
You are obviously angry with me
about something,

434
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:46,719
so let's talk about it.

435
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:56,645
Oh, God.

436
00:38:56,854 --> 00:39:01,901
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think

437
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:05,446
that I'm up to something.

438
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:10,534
- Like what?
- I have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:14,079
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

440
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,206
Is that why you asked me about the...

441
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:19,793
Some other phone? Because
you think that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:23,839
- I don't know.
- Okay.

443
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:25,925
So ask me.

444
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:28,928
Why?

445
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:32,431
- Would you even tell me?
- Yes. I would.

446
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,475
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:39,939
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,816
Now, what do I do to prove that to you?

449
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:46,487
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

450
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:48,530
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,866
You're not having an affair.

452
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:52,660
Congratulations.

453
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,318
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:56,580
Great job.

455
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,539
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:02,670
- I'm trying to talk to you, and you...
- Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:07,466
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,637
You want to know what you have to do?

459
00:40:11,845 --> 00:40:15,891
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,936
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:23,148
No more apologies.
No more of these... These obvious

462
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,985
desperate breakfasts.

463
00:40:27,403 --> 00:40:30,489
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:32,199
Good.

465
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,326
Then tell me.

466
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:37,413
Now.

467
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,592
Tell you what?

468
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,142
Skyler.

469
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:04,273
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:16,785
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,470
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:27,671
What the...?

473
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:46,732
- Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
- What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,443
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:53,072
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy

476
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,076
- kleptomaniac douchebags.
- Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:59,244
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal...

478
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:03,415
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:07,878
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:42:08,337 --> 00:42:11,172
- Nothing. I'm sorry. I just...
- What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:14,093
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:16,637
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:16,845 --> 00:42:19,056
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:21,934
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:25,854
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,440
Your half?

487
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:31,151
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,904
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:37,407
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,701
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:41,578
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:44,873
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:48,252
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,673
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:58,095
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow

496
00:42:58,303 --> 00:43:01,890
simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re...

497
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:23,996
Do it.

498
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:55,694
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,356
Want some breakfast?
