1
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,956
Hey.

2
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,252
You...

3
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,588
You selling?

4
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,465
I don't know what you're talking about.

5
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,801
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:39,308
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,019
I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,607
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,902
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,404
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,281
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,368
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:00:58,535 --> 00:00:59,703
That's yours, right?

14
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,872
What brown van?

15
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:04,208
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,543
It's a cop van.

17
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:09,797
Yeah, another one right over there.

18
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:13,217
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

19
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:15,469
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:18,097
Dude, I just wanna get high.

21
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,557
A flower van.

22
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,852
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,187
Seriously,
and I don't mean to disrespect,

24
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:28,982
but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck

25
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:31,166
there's no way I'm seriously thinking

26
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:34,655
that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:37,449
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:39,868
Think about it, boys.

29
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:43,914
All right. I'm hitting it.

30
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,542
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,794
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,965
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,176
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:59,179
Just to show you you're being an asshole.

35
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,473
I'm blinded by white.

36
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:02,725
Douchebag.

37
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,394
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:09,022
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:12,609
I mean, what are you complaining about?

40
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,945
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,030
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,074
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:21,827
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:24,079
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:27,499
I just need you to prove it, you know?

46
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,209
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:32,171
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,715
I don't know.

49
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:39,261
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,221
Which dude?

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,681
- That dude?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,392
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,895
True that.

54
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:51,565
This is so hard, you know?

55
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,862
I know.

56
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,906
It's simple.

57
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:03,535
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,621
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,998
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,920
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,422
- You a cop?
- No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:17,758
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:20,594
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:24,640
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:27,935
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,938
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,069
All right.

68
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,430
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,058
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:17,233
Albuquerque Police! You're
under arrest! Get down on the ground!

71
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:21,822
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach. Get on the ground!

72
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:25,951
- Hold it right there. Don't move.
- Stay down.

73
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,060
<i>I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>

74
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:55,188
<i>I better call Saul.</i>

75
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,737
{\an8}<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business...</i>

76
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:06,700
<i>- You are under arrest.
- I better call Saul.</i>

77
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,660
<i>Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

78
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:10,579
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>

79
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:13,206
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

80
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,417
<i>I believe that until proven guilty</i>

81
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:18,712
<i>every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.</i>

82
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:21,047
<i>And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.</i>

83
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,174
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

84
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,532
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.</i>

85
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,721
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>

86
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:33,101
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:35,903
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,818
{\an8}God, I wish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:45,364
{\an8}- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,616
{\an8}I'm just saying.

91
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:51,828
{\an8}Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,037
{\an8}You better seriously hope that airs out.

93
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,917
{\an8}My dad will keep your security deposit.

94
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:01,380
{\an8}He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.

95
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,215
{\an8}Yeah?

96
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:07,678
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:12,432
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,310
Well, listen.

99
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,314
Since I already lost my deposit and all

100
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:22,150
maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,698
No, thanks.

102
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:28,949
You sure?

103
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,869
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,372
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,670
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:50,012
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,055
Nothing.

108
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,267
I just have to go is all.

109
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,538
What's this?

110
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,874
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:22,586
{\an8}I'm in recovery.

112
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:28,425
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

113
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:34,931
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,516
Right on.

115
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,894
I respect that.

116
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:41,897
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:45,067
It's just a sometime thing.

118
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:49,321
But no more, like, in the house.

119
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:56,036
So you wanna go grab some dinner?

120
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:58,789
I could really go for some Chinese.

121
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,499
No, I better hit it.

122
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,877
We...

123
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:05,796
We cool?

124
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,949
{\an8}Your satellite is on, by the way.

125
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:16,598
{\an8}That screen is badass.

126
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,948
{\an8}I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:35,158
{\an8}He knows it.

128
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,077
{\an8}He's done nothing but apologize.

129
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,329
{\an8}Is this gonna be every weekend now?

130
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:43,667
{\an8}No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

131
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:48,463
{\an8}But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:51,049
{\an8}So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up

133
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:53,308
tell him he better wash those sneakers.

134
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:54,469
And I said bye.

135
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,972
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,808
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:01,768
What?

138
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:05,647
What, you don't even get casual Saturday?

139
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:06,940
I mean...

140
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,817
No, it's just you...

141
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:10,944
You look nice is all.

142
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,553
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

143
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:15,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:18,160
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

145
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:19,828
Okay.

146
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:21,538
- Bye.
- Bye.

147
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,970
{\an8}<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

148
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,629
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

149
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:44,227
<i>Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.</i>

150
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:48,023
<i>I... I need to talk to you. I...</i>

151
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:51,818
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:01,203
{\an8}Yesterday I got home and found him.

153
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:04,372
{\an8}He didn't even tell me he was coming.

154
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:08,293
- A man was killed?
- A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:12,547
{\an8}Three agents wounded, one lost his leg.

156
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:16,384
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,387
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:22,432
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.

159
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,060
{\an8}Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:28,521
{\an8}Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

161
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,775
{\an8}He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:37,864
{\an8}And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

163
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:03,682
Baby, not now.

164
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,894
It's... It's me, Hank. Sorry.

165
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,650
{\an8}Hey, buddy. What's...?

166
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,443
What's up?

167
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,364
I just...

168
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,950
Do you mind if I...

169
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:28,039
So...

170
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,460
How you doing?

171
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,755
{\an8}Oh, you know, lousy.

172
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:37,798
{\an8}Montezuma's revenge, big time.

173
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:43,388
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

174
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:45,307
Better not get too close.

175
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:48,518
Well, I'll take my chances.

176
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,530
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

177
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:03,908
Terrible.

178
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,203
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

179
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,163
It's like <i>Apocalypse Now</i> down there.

180
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:13,126
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

181
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:18,256
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.

182
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,802
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

183
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:26,014
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man

184
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:28,516
on the trail of those motherless bastards

185
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,101
you send him home.

186
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:34,230
I was, you know,
"He's out getting an evidence bag,

187
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,524
and so ends up without a scratch on him.

188
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:40,111
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

189
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:45,617
So are you home for good then?

190
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:49,079
No, no. It's...

191
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:53,166
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

192
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,506
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

193
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:02,759
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

194
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,678
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

195
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:12,602
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

196
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:22,987
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I...

197
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:27,075
You know, the things I deal with

198
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:31,496
you and me don't have much of a...

199
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:35,792
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

200
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:46,469
What if I told you we do?

201
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:58,440
I have spent my whole life scared.

202
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,570
Frightened of things that could happen

203
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,114
might happen, might not happen.

204
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:09,868
Fifty years I spent like that.

205
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:15,206
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.

206
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,628
But you know what?

207
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:24,215
Ever since my diagnosis

208
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:27,844
I sleep just fine.

209
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,101
Okay.

210
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:41,065
And I came to realize
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

211
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,485
That's the real enemy.

212
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:47,822
So...

213
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,493
Get up.

214
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,245
Get out in the real world.

215
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:59,626
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

216
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:17,352
Do it again. Go on.

217
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,601
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

218
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,204
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

219
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:34,077
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.

220
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,044
Not yours, I take it.

221
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:50,176
We got 10, 20, 30

222
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:55,431
44, five each.

223
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,728
Three pounds should be 48 each.

224
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:01,980
Who's short?

225
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:05,065
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

226
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,276
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

227
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,820
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter,

228
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:11,655
so he's probably still in the sack.

229
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:15,618
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

230
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:18,288
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

231
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:20,999
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

232
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,807
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

233
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:26,963
Jack off.

234
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,343
It's going straight to voicemail.

235
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,846
Voicemail?

236
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:39,100
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

237
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:45,565
- Combo.
- <i>Yo, what's up?</i>

238
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:48,026
You seen Badger?

239
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,820
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

240
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,179
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

241
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,299
Well?

242
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:17,639
They were too scared to tell me.

243
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,850
Badger got busted.

244
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,894
He's in jail.

245
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:01,224
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

246
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,643
Too slow! What's up?

247
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:05,645
Got more lives than a damn cat.

248
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,903
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.

249
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:12,193
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

250
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:16,155
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

251
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:19,617
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

252
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,183
You okay?

253
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:45,893
Hanging in?

254
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:47,854
What's it look like?

255
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,482
- What's this from A.P.D.?
- Been checking with them to see

256
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,193
if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

257
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,696
Sure enough, last night.

258
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,323
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.

259
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:02,869
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

260
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,128
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

261
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:08,583
Yeah. Well, all right.

262
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,586
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

263
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,172
I feel manipulated.

264
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,965
Thought we were gonna hang out.

265
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:17,675
We are hanging out, Badger.

266
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:20,261
You like Badger or Brandon?

267
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:25,516
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

268
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:26,893
Badger, listen.

269
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:28,895
Hey.

270
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,647
I'm trying to help you here, man.

271
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:36,486
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is

272
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:39,655
I think this can end very well for you.

273
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,992
What're you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

274
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,119
You sneaky Pete.

275
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:47,747
Which is which?

276
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,499
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

277
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,376
You guys get younger every...

278
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,253
What'd you say to baby face?

279
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:55,880
Did you say anything stupid?

280
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,257
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

281
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:00,802
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

282
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,304
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

283
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:06,766
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

284
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,268
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

285
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:13,105
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

286
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:17,652
All right.

287
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,571
Who do we have?

288
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:22,490
Brandon Mayhew.

289
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:25,993
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

290
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,579
Brandon Mayhew.

291
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:34,377
- Here we go. Public masturbation.
- What?

292
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:37,588
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home

293
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:41,300
with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

294
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:44,011
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

295
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,138
That ain't me, man. I...

296
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:51,102
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

297
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:54,188
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

298
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,690
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

299
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:59,360
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

300
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,488
Yeah, and felony quantity.

301
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:04,991
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

302
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:08,368
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

303
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:10,371
But good luck arguing that in court.

304
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:13,339
Let me get down to brass tacks.

305
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:15,292
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.

306
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,544
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy,

307
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,130
or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader,

308
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:23,301
and they're gonna
deliver me a check for $4650.

309
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:26,303
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

310
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:28,890
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

311
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:33,227
And I need that in a cashier's check
or a money order, doesn't matter.

312
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,897
Actually, I want it in a money order.

313
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,858
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

314
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,527
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

315
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:43,779
It's done just for tax purposes.

316
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,538
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard,

317
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:50,620
but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

318
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:51,871
Any questions?

319
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,792
You're gonna get me off, right?

320
00:21:57,877 --> 00:22:01,714
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

321
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:05,551
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

322
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:09,555
Son, I promise you this.

323
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:12,892
I will give you the best criminal defense

324
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,477
that money can buy.

325
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,579
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

326
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,483
Didn't I take these already?

327
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:23,819
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

328
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:25,780
It's bad for the liver.

329
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:29,449
Okay, who's next?

330
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:31,911
Did him. I did him.

331
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,538
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

332
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:37,672
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

333
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,752
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

334
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:44,715
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

335
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:47,551
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

336
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,888
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

337
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:53,015
Is that like the one your mom works at?

338
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:55,851
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

339
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,938
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

340
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:02,274
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

341
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:18,332
Sooner or later, this was gonna happen.

342
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,876
You want your exponential growth

343
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:23,285
guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

344
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,329
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

345
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:28,134
This is who he hires?

346
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,303
{\an8}What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

347
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:34,432
This is the guy I'd hire.

348
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:36,559
It's the guy you'd hire.

349
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,102
Look, you remember Emilio?

350
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:41,439
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

351
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:46,193
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

352
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:47,570
Dude is like Houdini.

353
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:49,678
Seriously, when the going gets tough

354
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,615
you don't want a criminal lawyer.

355
00:23:51,824 --> 00:23:55,161
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

356
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,204
Know what I'm saying?

357
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:00,875
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

358
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,335
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

359
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,671
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

360
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:10,009
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

361
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:12,117
And it's only his first dealing rap,

362
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:14,972
so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

363
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:18,558
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

364
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:23,689
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

365
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,442
Well, I don't need them seeing my face.

366
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,737
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

367
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:31,405
Dick.

368
00:24:31,614 --> 00:24:33,157
Fine.

369
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:36,327
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

370
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,579
Heads.

371
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,763
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

372
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:11,570
Mr. Mayhew.

373
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,782
Nice of you to come down. Please.

374
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:16,200
Look at you.

375
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:20,412
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

376
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:21,789
Joking.

377
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:24,083
I... Please, come on.

378
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,085
Come on. Please.

379
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,129
Hello.

380
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:31,507
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

381
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:38,973
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

382
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,021
I believe you have something for me?

383
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:48,648
Oh, yes.

384
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:55,573
- Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.

385
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:58,617
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

386
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,203
My real name is McGill.

387
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,789
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.

388
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:07,918
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

389
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,338
I digress.
Good things are happening.

390
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:15,384
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

391
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:17,219
That's wonderful, yeah.

392
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,805
There's still a few details
to be ironed out,

393
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:22,016
but now that the DEA is involved

394
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,895
I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

395
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:29,481
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

396
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,317
- Excuse me, the DEA?
- Yeah.

397
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:35,154
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

398
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:40,326
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news,

399
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:44,038
but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

400
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:45,289
I understand that.

401
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:47,415
What does that have to do with the DEA?

402
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,149
They're after some mystery man

403
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:51,878
some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

404
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:54,297
They want this guy
like the ax wants the turkey.

405
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,466
Seems young Brandon may have information

406
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,427
that could lead to his arrest.

407
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:00,930
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

408
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,849
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile,

409
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,983
and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.

410
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:10,189
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...

411
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:15,527
I just think that we should
review our options.

412
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,154
Options?

413
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,413
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.

414
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:23,160
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

415
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:25,661
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary,

416
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:28,374
and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

417
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:32,211
Look, look. What about reprisals?

418
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,213
I mean, if Badger...

419
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:39,927
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...

420
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:42,054
I mean, what if, God forbid

421
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:47,059
that they decide to take revenge?

422
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:49,103
What have you been telling him?

423
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:52,690
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

424
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:55,818
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

425
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,697
- Good.
- No, that's not good. That's terrible.

426
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:02,992
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

427
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,869
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

428
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,205
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

429
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:11,917
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

430
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:17,089
I've been told that
one of them killed another man

431
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:20,800
by crushing his head with an ATM machine.

432
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,430
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

433
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:28,100
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

434
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,909
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

435
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:33,729
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

436
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:37,163
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary

437
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,820
all's right with the world.

438
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:44,033
Ten thousand dollars.

439
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:00,466
Ten thousand, cash to you.

440
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:05,346
I'm not saying to throw the case.

441
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:10,476
Just no talking to the DEA.

442
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:14,021
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

443
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:16,190
Yes.

444
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,859
What's it going to be?

445
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:23,614
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

446
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:26,742
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

447
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,650
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

448
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:30,327
Threatened to call the police.

449
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:35,459
- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
- Like the Exxon Valdez.

450
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,587
So, what do we do about it?

451
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:51,373
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

452
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:52,518
No.

453
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:54,395
For safety.

454
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:56,188
What?

455
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,943
God, you are killing me with that booty.

456
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:15,229
Talk to me. Come on, talk to me, guys.
I don't know...

457
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:19,002
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

458
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:22,297
Oh, no, no, no!

459
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:25,426
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

460
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:28,429
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

461
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:33,183
Shut up, dude.

462
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,728
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

463
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:39,857
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

464
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:43,569
- Who?
- Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

465
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:46,363
Oh, I thought...

466
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:49,491
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

467
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,119
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

468
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:56,415
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

469
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:58,167
You should have taken it.

470
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,462
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

471
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,089
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

472
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,800
The uncle. That was your guy?

473
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:10,929
No offense, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

474
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:13,307
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

475
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:17,936
- But I'll take your money! Sure!
- No, that offer has expired, yo.

476
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:22,065
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

477
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:24,109
Just tell me what you need, all right?

478
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,293
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought,

479
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:28,837
and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

480
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:32,034
All right, listen to me very carefully.

481
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:34,119
You are going to give Badger Mayhew

482
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:37,456
the best legal representation ever.

483
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,917
But no deals with the DEA.

484
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,795
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

485
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,590
If he does, you're dead.

486
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:50,969
Why don't you just kill Badger?

487
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:56,891
I mean, follow me, but
if a mosquito is buzzing around you,

488
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:00,311
and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

489
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:03,815
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

490
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:07,433
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

491
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:11,156
- We're not killing Badger, yo.
- Then you got real problems, okay.

492
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,408
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy

493
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:15,369
like a proverbial ton of bricks.

494
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,745
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here,

495
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:19,779
but, hey, he's not gonna like prison.

496
00:32:19,873 --> 00:32:24,419
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

497
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,260
Mr. Mayhew?

498
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:37,599
Recognize your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

499
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,518
Go on.

500
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,277
- God.
- Take it easy.

501
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:51,113
Breathe in, breathe out.

502
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:55,242
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

503
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:57,828
That's better.

504
00:32:58,537 --> 00:33:02,165
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

505
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:03,875
Yeah? How?

506
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,984
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

507
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:11,881
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

508
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:15,053
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

509
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:18,155
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

510
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:19,975
Come on, make it official.

511
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,769
Come on, do it.

512
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:26,773
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

513
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:34,698
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

514
00:33:35,324 --> 00:33:36,366
- Go on.
- Be smart.

515
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,076
What?

516
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:43,665
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.

517
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:47,294
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

518
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,923
Okay, you're now both
officially represented

519
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:53,707
by Saul Goodman and Associates.

520
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,096
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment.

521
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:02,022
Take the ski mask off. Feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

522
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:05,687
Just do it.

523
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:13,695
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

524
00:34:13,904 --> 00:34:15,155
And we're sure of that?

525
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:19,284
No shanking!

526
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:22,829
All right, all right.

527
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:27,834
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

528
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,632
It's just a matter of who.

529
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:38,345
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside

530
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:42,057
your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

531
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:43,565
Time served, no probation.

532
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:47,104
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

533
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:50,315
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

534
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:52,734
You don't give us
the name of your supplier

535
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:56,029
- you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.

536
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:58,532
This young man is cooperating fully.

537
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,660
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

538
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:08,500
Okay, let's start with a name.

539
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:13,046
He just goes by Heisenberg.

540
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:14,631
Heisenberg, huh?

541
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,467
How old is this Heisenberg?

542
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:21,930
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

543
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,266
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

544
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:26,351
Medium height, medium weight.

545
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,563
- What color hair?
- No hair.

546
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:31,398
Dude is balder than you.

547
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:36,069
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

548
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:38,780
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

549
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:41,783
1975, breaking and entering.

550
00:35:41,992 --> 00:35:44,619
1982, grand theft auto.

551
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:47,164
1984, armed robbery.

552
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:51,710
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

553
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,795
Better known as Jimmy In-and-Out.

554
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:59,551
City, State, and Federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

555
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,971
Entire life behind bars.

556
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:05,724
Jimmy provides a very special service.

557
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:08,769
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

558
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,523
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

559
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,318
He's actually more comfortable inside.

560
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:18,945
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

561
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,157
Sometime during
the Clinton administration

562
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:27,370
Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

563
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:36,630
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

564
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,238
The buy is set for tomorrow.

565
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,009
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy,

566
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:44,268
and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound

567
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:45,931
of your finest meth.

568
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,397
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

569
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,817
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

570
00:36:57,025 --> 00:36:58,925
I'll represent him, and I guarantee

571
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:02,531
there'll be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

572
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:05,367
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

573
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:08,620
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

574
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,498
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

575
00:37:11,706 --> 00:37:13,708
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

576
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:17,003
Look, if this option is too expensive

577
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:20,632
you can still always... Badger
in the chow line.

578
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:41,027
Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?

579
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:59,629
All right. There's our boy.

580
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:03,091
Right on time.

581
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,277
- Go back.
- What? All right, all right.

582
00:38:35,624 --> 00:38:39,294
So, what do you think?
They see us?

583
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:41,546
No, man, I think we're good.

584
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,054
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.

585
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:50,931
Give me those back.

586
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,141
Just give them to me.

587
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,602
Oh, no.

588
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:57,354
Where the hell is Jimmy?

589
00:38:57,562 --> 00:38:59,564
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.

590
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:04,527
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

591
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,072
There's more than one kind of prison.

592
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,230
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

593
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:11,785
There he is... Wait a minute.

594
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:15,580
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What? What? Let me see.

595
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:19,292
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

596
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:26,007
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

597
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,718
Time to move?

598
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,054
Let's see the exchange.

599
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:36,851
No, no. Oh, shit!

600
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,188
- What?
- Now he shows.

601
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,610
Okay, let's do this.

602
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:51,074
No, no.

603
00:39:51,282 --> 00:39:53,827
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

604
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:56,121
We are screwed!

605
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,706
What are you doing?

606
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:00,083
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:06,006
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

608
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:18,059
Where's the stuff, man?

609
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:20,395
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

610
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:27,360
Get out. Go stop him.

611
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:30,196
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

612
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,781
Get out. I'll do something.

613
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,034
- What?
- Just go!

614
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:49,049
Hank, I thought that was you.

615
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:50,842
Schrader, I'm blocked.

616
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:53,928
- Walt, not a good time.
- How you doing? You feeling okay?

617
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:55,112
Schrader, I'm blocked.

618
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:57,724
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

619
00:40:57,932 --> 00:41:01,394
- Working? Oh, like DEA working?
- Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

620
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:03,563
Is something going down?

621
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:08,359
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

622
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:16,284
Walt, Walt.

623
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:18,578
- Walter, move your ass now.
- Okay.

624
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:20,687
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

625
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,791
- We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
- Should I back up?

626
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,501
- Go that way.
- Forward is better?

627
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:27,545
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

628
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:29,923
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

629
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:32,759
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

630
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:36,346
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

631
00:41:38,306 --> 00:41:41,559
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

632
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:51,194
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.

633
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:02,247
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

634
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:06,042
Come on, get him up.

635
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:17,554
Jesus!

636
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:20,390
I think they bought it.

637
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:25,145
<i>Absolutely.</i>

638
00:42:25,353 --> 00:42:28,731
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

639
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,484
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

640
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:36,447
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

641
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,870
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

642
00:43:08,563 --> 00:43:09,939
Hey.

643
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:13,401
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

644
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,071
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.

645
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:28,625
So you bought a bed.

646
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,169
Yeah.

647
00:43:31,753 --> 00:43:33,504
What is that, a king?

648
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:37,592
Pillow top?

649
00:44:13,753 --> 00:44:17,715
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

650
00:44:22,637 --> 00:44:24,180
You mind?

651
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:30,436
I was terrible at chemistry.

652
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:33,273
I'm more of a humanities guy.

653
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,067
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

654
00:44:36,276 --> 00:44:40,613
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

655
00:44:40,822 --> 00:44:42,572
My PI charged me for three hours,

656
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:45,618
so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

657
00:44:48,538 --> 00:44:51,666
So this is what, blackmail?

658
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:53,584
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

659
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:58,214
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

660
00:44:58,423 --> 00:45:00,967
I'm not in the shake down racket.

661
00:45:01,175 --> 00:45:03,718
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

662
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,973
Especially drug dealers.

663
00:45:07,348 --> 00:45:11,436
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

664
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:15,273
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

665
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:18,524
By the way, where do you keep the money?

666
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:22,989
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a
jelly jar buried in the side yard?

667
00:45:23,197 --> 00:45:26,325
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up,

668
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:27,809
but he won't be the last.

669
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,414
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

670
00:45:31,622 --> 00:45:33,041
I don't understand.

671
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:36,127
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

672
00:45:37,628 --> 00:45:40,715
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?

673
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,177
I'm no Vito Corleone.

674
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:47,138
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

675
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:48,847
But with some sound advice,

676
00:45:49,057 --> 00:45:51,434
and the proper introductions, who knows?

677
00:45:51,642 --> 00:45:53,768
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

678
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,689
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch

679
00:45:56,773 --> 00:45:58,473
you're on to something special.

680
00:45:58,649 --> 00:46:03,071
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

681
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:06,765
Food for thought, yeah?

682
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,542
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make

683
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:19,921
"Better call Saul!"
