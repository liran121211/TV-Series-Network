1
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:47,903
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn...

2
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,865
{\an8}You do know what a bond is?

3
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,288
{\an8}A strong force of attraction.

4
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,667
{\an8}Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

5
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:06,255
{\an8}The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

6
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,923
{\an8}No?

7
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:14,137
{\an8}Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

8
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:18,433
{\an8}Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

9
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,896
{\an8}- What hold us together.
- Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

10
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,106
{\an8}Bonds.

11
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:28,944
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

12
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,365
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

13
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:40,956
{\an8}What is "close"?

14
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:43,125
{\an8}There's no "close" in science, Barry.

15
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:46,253
{\an8}There are right answers
and wrong answers.

16
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,714
{\an8}"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

17
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:52,968
{\an8}Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

18
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:57,236
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

19
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:02,978
{\an8}And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

20
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,981
{\an8}Like, all night, hard.

21
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:10,485
{\an8}And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

22
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:16,533
{\an8}I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit...

23
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,119
{\an8}Couldn't you please just let this slide?

24
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,340
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

25
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,971
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

26
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,559
{\an8}<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

27
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:29,356
{\an8}Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

28
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:34,903
{\an8}Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

29
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,033
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the...

30
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,911
When I said, "Handle it."

31
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:47,249
{\an8}Well, don't. Just let it go.

32
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,959
{\an8}All right.

33
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:09,938
Come on.

34
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:13,150
Jesse, open the door.

35
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:18,113
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

36
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,245
Can I help you?

37
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:27,914
No. Thank you.

38
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:32,419
{\an8}Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

39
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:34,963
You're the manager?

40
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,632
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

41
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,721
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key...

42
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:46,600
- You have a key, right?
- Yeah, I have a key.

43
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,105
Look, the person who lives here

44
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,233
it's just very important
for me to see him.

45
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,320
- And you knocked, right?
- Yeah.

46
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,530
He didn't answer?

47
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,075
Which means...?

48
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:10,749
- Look, I'm his father, all right?
- You're Mr. Jackson?

49
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,504
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

50
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,713
And you are...?

51
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,300
- Jane.
- Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

52
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,469
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

53
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,514
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

54
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,683
- Wanna call him?
- No.

55
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,561
No. I...

56
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:35,232
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here,

57
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,902
so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

58
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,695
You understand?

59
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:44,032
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

60
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,076
I don't get involved in family.

61
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:48,619
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

62
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:49,746
Period.

63
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,665
Sorry.

64
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:59,923
Come on in, Dad.

65
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,346
- Thanks.
- You okay?

66
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,349
Yeah.

67
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:18,150
"Jesse Jackson"?

68
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,110
Do you even...?

69
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:25,115
Oh, I see you have a telephone, at least.

70
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:28,660
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

71
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,996
Whatever, man.

72
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,626
- Hey, give me my... Give...
- I will break this. I will break this!

73
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:40,463
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing

74
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,840
the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

75
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:46,761
- No. I've been taking care of business.
- What business?

76
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,471
What business?

77
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:53,351
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

78
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,110
This business.

79
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:08,450
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

80
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,706
- You didn't actually...?
- Hey, you said...

81
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,167
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

82
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,254
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

83
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,506
I meant get your money back.
I never meant...

84
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,717
- Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
- No!

85
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,887
Well, too late, yo, because dude's dead.

86
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,972
- Oh, God.
- All right? Way dead.

87
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,310
- Oh, God.
- Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

88
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:37,437
Here's your money.

89
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:43,443
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

90
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:49,157
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

91
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,855
I didn't say I killed him.

92
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,693
Tell me what happened.

93
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,532
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

94
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,035
- Crushed his...?
- Crushed his head

95
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:37,289
with an ATM machine right in front of me.

96
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,541
I mean, crushed it like...

97
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,212
Oh, my God, the sound

98
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,172
it's still in my ears.

99
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,092
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

100
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,556
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

101
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:59,728
Man, will you just please give me...?
Just give me my weed, all right?

102
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:02,397
It helps with my nausea.

103
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,984
So

104
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,237
You did not kill anyone?

105
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:13,074
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

106
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,118
I called the cops.

107
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,579
You called the cops?

108
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:21,291
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

109
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,585
And then they came in and busted her.

110
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:28,256
God, she was...
She was so zapped out of her mind.

111
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:31,842
You know? It's...
She did it for, like, nothing.

112
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,555
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

113
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:41,102
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

114
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,024
She couldn't identify her left ass cheek.

115
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:48,526
She was so zonked.

116
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,113
And she had this...

117
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,407
God, she had this kid.

118
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:58,036
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here,

119
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:03,208
but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

120
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,212
Look, she had a gun on me, all right?

121
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,596
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

122
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,640
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

123
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:22,852
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

124
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,773
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

125
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:36,282
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

126
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,494
<i>- Hey, it's Badger, man.
- What are you doing?</i>

127
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:43,498
<i>- Don't use your real name.
- What? That isn't my real name.</i>

128
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,750
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:51,297
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?</i>

130
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,008
<i>We got them just for you, </i>jefe.

131
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,678
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>

132
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:07,188
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

133
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,526
No.

134
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:14,654
You get on. All right?

135
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,824
I just want to forget. I just...

136
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,668
Sorry.

137
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,765
Hey.

138
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,185
Hey, what's up with that?

139
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,898
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

140
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,734
Well, yeah, hell, I know who it is, okay?

141
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:55,528
Scumbags kneeling down praying to him:

142
00:14:55,695 --> 00:15:00,909
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

143
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,128
I'm just... I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

144
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,049
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

145
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,679
- Sun Tzu.
- Son who?

146
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:24,682
Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote <i>The Art of War</i>.

147
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,602
"If you know your enemy as yourself

148
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,355
you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

149
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,777
Right on.

150
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,952
- Agent Schrader.
- Sir.

151
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:48,331
- Glad to have you onboard.
- Thanks.

152
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:52,418
- Everybody getting you settled in?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

153
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,964
And gals. And gals.
Guys... Guys and gals.

154
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,883
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

155
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,844
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

156
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,596
Yes, sir.

157
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,378
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

158
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,340
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

159
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:43,177
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

160
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:50,518
- Hey, watch it.
- It ain't real, dumb-ass.

161
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:51,853
Just watch it, is all.

162
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,855
You watch it.

163
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,742
I'm Heisenberg.

164
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,411
You're Heisenberg?

165
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,663
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

166
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:13,166
Let's get this over with.

167
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,001
Where's Jesse?

168
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,338
- Busy.
- Hey, that's cool.

169
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,964
Real cool.

170
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,716
Totally cool.

171
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:23,384
Hey, hey...

172
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:28,139
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

173
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:31,517
- Here?
- I'm just saying...

174
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,561
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

175
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:35,978
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations

176
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,398
as to who we work for.

177
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,818
And that's church, yo. For real.

178
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,575
What have you heard?

179
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,497
Did Jesse really...?

180
00:17:53,414 --> 00:17:56,167
I mean, did he really...

181
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:01,214
squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

182
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,757
Word.

183
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,263
Who's saying that?

184
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,518
Damn man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

185
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:16,396
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money,

186
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,356
but today everybody's paying up.

187
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,484
True that. Serious.

188
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,569
But, like...

189
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,447
He really did it?

190
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,751
You didn't hear that from me.

191
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:09,824
Big lunch.

192
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,876
Thank you.

193
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:27,967
- Here you go.
- Very good, Ms. White.

194
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,887
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

195
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,388
Thank you.

196
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,641
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

197
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,976
Really?

198
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,061
When are you due?

199
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:44,275
- Several months.
- Congratulations.

200
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:49,238
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

201
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:50,865
Family.

202
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:55,077
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

203
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:04,754
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I... I think he'll remember me.

204
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:07,757
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

205
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:10,259
You know, if it's okay, I'll just...

206
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,930
Ma'am...

207
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,738
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

208
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,448
Hey, Ted.

209
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:34,951
- Come in, come in.
- Okay.

210
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,787
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

211
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:39,497
Come on, sit down right here.

212
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,958
Okay. Thank you.

213
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:48,798
- You look great.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

214
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:51,323
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

215
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:53,803
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

216
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,764
I'll bet. One of each.

217
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,225
How's Walt Jr.?

218
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:03,062
Oh, tenth grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

219
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,929
He's... He's taller than I am now.

220
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:10,862
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3 ", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

221
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,614
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

222
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,408
Good genes.

223
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:23,291
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

224
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,668
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

225
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:28,004
- They're gorgeous.
- Yes, they are.

226
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,840
And they know it.

227
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,842
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

228
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:34,719
Yeah.

229
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:39,056
So the big office, huh?

230
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:40,975
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

231
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:43,144
Weird, isn't it?

232
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,688
I still think of it as my dad's.

233
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,231
I miss him.

234
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,983
Me too.

235
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:55,031
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

236
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,366
Yeah, he'd be proud.

237
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:01,078
Walt? How's he doing?

238
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:06,250
Oh, he's... He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

239
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:09,879
- Great. He's still teaching?
- Yeah.

240
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:14,884
- You tell him I said hello.
- I will definitely do that.

241
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,018
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...

242
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:28,522
I was applying for the data-entry job.

243
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,567
You're kidding.

244
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:34,070
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

245
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,739
Yeah. Well

246
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:39,408
the economy, you know, so...

247
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:43,162
Well, you, data-entry?
That'd be a mistake.

248
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,876
How about

249
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,879
get your old job back?

250
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,927
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me

251
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,444
the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

252
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:03,349
Your work would be cut out for you,

253
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,268
but we could use your help.

254
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,776
Okay.

255
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:19,782
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

256
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:21,283
Hey. Hello.

257
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,911
- Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
- Now, look at this.

258
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:25,955
Here, here, here and here.

259
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:29,250
What does that look like to you?

260
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,879
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

261
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:37,675
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

262
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:39,635
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

263
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:43,305
- Because it's not our territory?
- Because we lack initiative.

264
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,807
- Initiative.
- Yes.

265
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,976
You need to employ more dealers.

266
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:49,519
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

267
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:53,983
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

268
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,235
Exponential growth, that's the key here.

269
00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:02,199
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

270
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:05,077
We go rolling into these neighborhoods

271
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:08,122
other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

272
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:11,000
Sure, they won't like it,

273
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:14,086
but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

274
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,255
- No. Listen, Jesse...
- No.

275
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,090
Jesse.

276
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:25,306
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

277
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:29,310
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, it's all over town.

278
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:32,021
Somebody crossed you, you got angry

279
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:35,316
you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

280
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,533
- That's not how it happened.
- Who cares

281
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:41,093
as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

282
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:44,533
- Oh, my...
- No, don't you see how great this is?

283
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,829
Look, you... You are a...

284
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,834
Jesse, look at me.

285
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,630
You are a blowfish.

286
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,049
- What?
- A blowfish. Think about it.

287
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:04,386
Small in stature, not swift, not cunning.

288
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:05,888
Easy prey for predators,

289
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,390
but the blowfish has a secret weapon

290
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:10,935
doesn't he? Doesn't he?

291
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:15,064
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

292
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,985
- I don't even know...
- The blowfish puffs up.

293
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:23,948
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

294
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:26,742
And why? Why does he do that?

295
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,619
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

296
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:30,830
Intimidating.

297
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,250
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

298
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,211
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

299
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:40,381
You see, it's just all an illusion.

300
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:43,592
Yes, it is. It's nothing but air.

301
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:46,595
Now

302
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:49,932
who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?

303
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:53,561
- Nobody.
- You're damn right.

304
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,815
- I'm a blowfish.
- You are a blowfish.

305
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,582
- Say it again.
- I'm a blowfish.

306
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,693
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm a blowfish.

307
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:04,697
- You're a blowfish. That's right.
- Yeah!

308
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:07,783
Blowfishing this up.

309
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:46,822
Hello?

310
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,950
The <i>SkyMall</i>.
Give me the <i>SkyMall</i>, would you?

311
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:57,124
Vanco

312
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,878
new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

313
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,758
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

314
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:09,261
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

315
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,973
You know what? I'll teach you.

316
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:20,022
It means, "Let's make a deal."

317
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,524
So go ahead. We're waiting.

318
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,819
Okay.

319
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,365
Right here.

320
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:32,284
"Item SS4G:

321
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:37,039
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball

322
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,041
hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

323
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,835
Vanco, write this down.

324
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:44,421
Oh, man, watch out.

325
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,885
"66100ZBG: Large size floor runner."

326
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:53,305
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor

327
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,392
except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

328
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,854
I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my<i> casa</i>.

329
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,231
We'll get you three.

330
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,483
- No, you give me 10.
- Five.

331
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:09,863
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

332
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,204
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

333
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,999
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

334
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,002
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

335
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:25,170
Schrader...

336
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:31,844
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

337
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:36,515
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

338
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:41,312
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

339
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:48,444
I take my time, but I always win.

340
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,699
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

341
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,410
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

342
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,539
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

343
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,834
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

344
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,711
Definitely two of those, huh?

345
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:09,465
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

346
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,344
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

347
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,096
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

348
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:19,391
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

349
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,061
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

350
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,854
They keep him busy every second.

351
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:26,071
He's already got some
big operation going.

352
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,650
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about

353
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:31,195
except it's on the other side
of the border.

354
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:32,988
Wow, that sounds exciting.

355
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:35,741
He's being safe, right?

356
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,035
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

357
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:41,246
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

358
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,833
Speaking of riding desks

359
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,002
got myself a job today.

360
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:49,838
You did not.

361
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,135
As big as you are?

362
00:29:56,678 --> 00:30:00,849
- Thank you.
- You know I just mean...

363
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,684
Where? With who?

364
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:06,605
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

365
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,815
Beneke.

366
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:11,693
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

367
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,110
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

368
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:19,201
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

369
00:30:19,368 --> 00:30:22,746
- Just what you want in an executive.
- And he apologized profusely.

370
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:26,542
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

371
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,461
It will not happen again.

372
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,507
Is money that tight?

373
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:38,429
Yeah.

374
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,765
You know we can always help out.

375
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:44,435
No, Marie.

376
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,410
You know Walt. He would just...

377
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:53,152
- Speak of the devil.
- Hey. Hi, Marie.

378
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,070
How are you? What's up?

379
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:58,323
Nothing much. How's things with you?

380
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,908
- Good. Good.
- Hi, honey.

381
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,827
- Dinner'll be about an hour and...
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

382
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:06,623
- Everything okay?
- Everything's perfect.

383
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:31,732
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

384
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,942
So? Same thing.

385
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,694
Not the same thing.

386
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,711
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

387
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:43,160
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

388
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:48,457
It's... It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

389
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:49,875
You're pushing it.

390
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,836
- Morning.
- Morning, Honey.

391
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:55,088
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

392
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:58,383
Dad, notice anything?

393
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,054
Is there a funeral today?

394
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,271
- A funeral?
- Well...

395
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,682
- Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
- No, no, no.

396
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:07,893
Mom got a job.

397
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,520
A job? Why?

398
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:12,336
Well, do I need to get out
the checkbook and show you?

399
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:15,609
No, I... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

400
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:18,611
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labor.

401
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:22,115
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

402
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:24,993
Where?

403
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:27,412
Beneke.

404
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,207
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

405
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:34,086
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit

406
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:37,297
- in the first place?
- They've gone green since then.

407
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:41,176
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

408
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:44,137
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

409
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:48,225
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

410
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:49,560
Yeah.

411
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:50,811
Who's running things?

412
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:53,272
Ted. The son.

413
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:58,819
Anyway, I have got to go.

414
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:02,614
I don't wanna be late my first day back.

415
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,575
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

416
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:06,577
- Bye.
- Bye.

417
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,203
Okay.

418
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,790
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

419
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:16,169
Bye.

420
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:29,558
Hey.

421
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,145
You left your cave.

422
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:35,355
Yeah.

423
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:38,191
I was... I'm missing my TV.

424
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:39,858
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

425
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:42,529
You know, snag a big-ass wide-screen.

426
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,990
So...

427
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:46,908
Yeah.

428
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,244
What you drawing?

429
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:53,165
Damn.

430
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,750
That's good.

431
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,627
Make a hell of a tat.

432
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:57,961
That's the plan.

433
00:33:58,128 --> 00:33:59,338
Really?

434
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,382
I work part-time, down at the ABQ Ink.

435
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,675
Right on.

436
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:08,388
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

437
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,183
I used to do a little of that.

438
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:15,771
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

439
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,400
What stopped you?

440
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:25,739
You know, just...

441
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,866
So tell me something.

442
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:32,454
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

443
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,583
That's way too big a commitment.

444
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:49,012
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

445
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,683
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

446
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,268
Yeah.

447
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,854
Right on, man. Keep it real.

448
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:06,488
"Pinkman," huh?

449
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,115
Yeah.

450
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:10,575
I thought your name was "Jackson."

451
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,969
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

452
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:30,429
Are we...?

453
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,139
Are we just on mañana time?

454
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:33,682
They'll show.

455
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:34,891
Yeah?

456
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:36,643
Why is that?

457
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,952
You got more catalogs
for him to clean out?

458
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,650
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

459
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:11,136
Hey, something I need to know about?

460
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,722
What? Oh, that? No, man.

461
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,892
We were just singing your praises.

462
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,393
Glad to have you.

463
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,353
Welcome aboard.

464
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,459
Hey, is that your guy?

465
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,296
Hey, I think that's your guy.

466
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,716
What the hell is he doing down there?

467
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,368
Schrader, where you going?

468
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:03,290
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

469
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,516
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw

470
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,963
a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

471
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:23,977
Hey, welcome to...

472
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,129
My leg.

473
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,027
<i>...headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.</i>

474
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:16,655
The game has changed, yo.

475
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,658
This is our city, all right?

476
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,410
All of it. The whole damn place.

477
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,663
Our territory.

478
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,665
We're staking our claim

479
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,627
that we sell when we want, where we want.

480
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:33,588
Now, we're gonna be kings, understand?

481
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,340
Well, I'm gonna be king.

482
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,009
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

483
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,845
- I wanna be a knight.
- But first things first.

484
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,139
We gotta get more dealers.

485
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:45,850
You know, foot soldiers, right?

486
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,852
Now, they'll be working for you.

487
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,147
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

488
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,441
You follow me?

489
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,443
Layered, like nachos.

490
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,362
Exponential growth.

491
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:01,157
Now, that's success with a capital S.

492
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:02,909
Straight up, straight up.

493
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:04,119
For shizzle.

494
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:05,370
Frigging awesome.

495
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,925
Well, we're set.

496
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:22,637
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

497
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,931
Cheddar, Mr. White.

498
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:29,352
Fat stacks, dead presidents, cash money.

499
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,647
Gonna own this city.

500
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,899
We're not charging enough.

501
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,527
What?

502
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:40,864
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

503
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:43,700
Simple economics.

504
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:05,263
Oh, hey, Ted.

505
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,598
Come on in.

506
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:09,726
- Looks like they got you all set up.
- Yeah. It's perfect.

507
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:13,020
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

508
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,154
And that's very nice.

509
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:16,714
- I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
- Yeah.

510
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,527
Listen, I...

511
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:23,740
I wanted to thank you for having me back.

512
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,785
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

513
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,125
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

514
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,960
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

515
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,463
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

516
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,131
Hey, how is Denise doing?

517
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,134
We split up, about a year ago.

518
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:46,638
I'm sorry.

519
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:50,266
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

520
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,977
- Together since high school.
- Yeah.

521
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,146
- I remember that.
- Anyway...

522
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:58,233
I don't know, people change.

523
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,526
Yes.

524
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:02,320
Anyway, I just wanted to welcome you.

525
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,031
Welcome you back. And...

526
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:07,742
I'll see you around the vending machines.

527
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:09,452
Okay.

528
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:14,541
We should have lunch one day.

529
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:16,000
Like old times.

530
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,336
Sure.

531
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,764
Oh, hey.

532
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:55,308
Hey, yourself.

533
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,273
So listen. My...

534
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,526
My name is not really Jesse Jackson.

535
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:10,365
It's Jesse Pinkman.

536
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:13,451
And that guy you met

537
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:18,373
he's not my dad.

538
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:31,094
You're not gonna kick me out, are you?

539
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:34,138
Because I actually really like it here.

540
00:44:36,015 --> 00:44:38,434
I don't make it my business what you do.

541
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:41,562
So long as you don't do it here.

542
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:52,115
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

543
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,620
Wanna see?

544
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:27,358
It's got that thing where the blacks

545
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:31,696
are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

546
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:37,243
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

547
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,581
So it'll really rock the house.

548
00:45:42,498 --> 00:45:44,250
But I'll, you know...

549
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:49,714
I'll keep it way down, of course.

550
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:02,894
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

551
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:09,067
Come on, come on.
