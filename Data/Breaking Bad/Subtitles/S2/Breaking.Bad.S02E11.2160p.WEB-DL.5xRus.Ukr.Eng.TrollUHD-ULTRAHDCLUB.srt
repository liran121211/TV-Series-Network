1
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,744
- What's up?
- How's it going?

2
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:40,167
All right.

3
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,610
What you need?

4
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,199
You buying or you just stopping to envy?

5
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:18,956
Yeah. Punk bitches.

6
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:05,836
<i>Please leave your message
for 505-127-5223.</i>

7
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,006
<i>Record your message after the tone.
To send a numeric page...</i>

8
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,340
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:14,052
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,513
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,016
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,819
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,026
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:38,595
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments

15
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:42,015
that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,475
Absolutely.

17
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,060
As you know

18
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:48,271
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,234
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:56,947
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,949
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,909
{\an8}Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country

23
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,643
{\an8}performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:07,165
{\an8}He's got a good track record.

25
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,959
{\an8}Pretty good.

26
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,712
{\an8}It sounds

27
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:14,131
{\an8}aggressive.

28
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,466
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,469
{\an8}Understand that
if you don't have this surgery

30
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,986
{\an8}you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,307
And it will.

32
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,186
{\an8}Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:31,481
{\an8}Maybe a lot, probably a little,

34
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,151
but that's all.

35
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,153
In my opinion

36
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,655
{\an8}if you're willing to take some risk

37
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,991
{\an8}then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:51,585
{\an8}How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:54,588
I'd say between 170,

40
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:57,215
and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:57,382 --> 00:05:01,011
{\an8}For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can,

42
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:04,014
{\an8}but mine isn't even the biggest expense.

43
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:09,686
{\an8}This is obviously a big decision,

44
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:13,190
{\an8}and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,609
No.

46
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,069
I'll do it.

47
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:28,038
{\an8}Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:32,334
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:39,716
{\an8}I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,011
{\an8}I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal,

51
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,013
{\an8}for another couple of weeks,

52
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,516
{\an8}and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,977
That's tricky.

54
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,234
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

55
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,777
So two weeks and change?

56
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,196
{\an8}I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:04,613
{\an8}That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,078
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,081
Yeah.

60
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,767
{\an8}Fourteen messages...

61
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,853
{\an8}God.

62
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,399
{\an8}- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's me.

63
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:41,027
{\an8}<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,612
{\an8}Working.

65
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,155
{\an8}What is it?

66
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,910
{\an8}Combo's dead.

67
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:51,121
<i>Shot.</i>

68
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:53,957
Which one is he?

69
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,793
{\an8}You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,462
{\an8}- <i>Jesse, listen...</i>
- That figures.

71
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:13,768
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,605
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:20,066
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him

74
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,987
{\an8}trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:29,492
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean

76
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,494
what'd you expect?

77
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,039
I don't know.

78
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,916
You don't know?

79
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,960
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,006
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:49,471
But make sure you bust up your cell and
toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,351
I appreciate what you're saying and all,

83
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:58,980
but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

84
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,441
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,527
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,114
We're on the verge

87
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:12,535
of making some serious coin, Skinny.

88
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:15,205
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:21,044
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,005
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge

91
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:27,092
maybe we were doing okay, but that whole

92
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,595
- thing to the head thing, the ATM?
- Yeah?

93
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,555
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,725
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,232
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:48,071
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

97
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,739
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:53,076
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,245
We'll get by.

100
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:59,249
- All right? We'll make it.
- Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,584
I'm out.

102
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,473
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:19,686
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,689
- How about "your fault"?
- No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:26,150
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,778
- Doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,862
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

108
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,617
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

109
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,870
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:41,166
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:46,296
It was some kind of turf dispute,

112
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,631
and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,550
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:54,637
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

115
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:57,390
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,559
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,314
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:07,317
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,820
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,489
Better?

121
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,867
Yeah, it's...

122
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:22,123
looking a little more positive.

123
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,090
I may have more time than I thought.

124
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,127
Outstanding.

125
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,630
Now, as to your dead guy:

126
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,632
Occupational hazard.

127
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,092
Drug dealer getting shot?

128
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:36,346
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

129
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,641
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

130
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,020
Thirty-eight and change.

131
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:46,106
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

132
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,524
Pounds.

133
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,987
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

134
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,281
Guys!

135
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,367
Why the long faces here?

136
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:59,702
You're sitting on a gold mine.

137
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,996
A gold mine we can't sell.

138
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,499
We need a proper infrastructure.

139
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,043
We need foot soldiers and we need dealers

140
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,170
on a street level that are rock solid.

141
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:12,382
We need muscle and we need enforcers.

142
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,551
Payback. That's what we need.

143
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,224
God.

144
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:26,354
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

145
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:33,403
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

146
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,114
We need your help.

147
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,410
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

148
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,287
Ready for this? Here goes.

149
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:46,416
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

150
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,085
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

151
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:51,713
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

152
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,342
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

153
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,761
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

154
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,598
What, some tattooed speed freak?

155
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:05,226
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

156
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,228
Somebody who treats your product

157
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,815
like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

158
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,235
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

159
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:18,781
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

160
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,619
You know someone like that?

161
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:26,789
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

162
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,875
Who knows another guy.

163
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:32,921
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

164
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,966
Well, what's his name?

165
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,761
I have no idea.

166
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:44,432
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

167
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,769
You know, from what I do hear about him

168
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,979
he sounds a little like you.

169
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:57,779
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

170
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,596
<i>He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

171
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,826
<i>Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

172
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,580
<i>And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.</i>

173
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,832
I need you to leave.

174
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,802
Look, there's

175
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,889
some stuff about me you don't know and...

176
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,436
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,772
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:39,112
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

179
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:47,870
One of my guys

180
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,457
a friend who worked for me

181
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,835
got murdered.

182
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,964
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:03,886
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go

184
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:08,141
being that you're in a program
and all and...

185
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,187
You could come with me to a meeting.

186
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,815
No.

187
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,527
No meetings.

188
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:23,990
We could just get out of here.

189
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:30,663
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

190
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,333
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,084
I just...

192
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:39,047
All right, I really just need you to go.

193
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,321
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

194
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:45,114
Thank you.

195
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,064
You're late.

196
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:20,858
Yeah.

197
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:23,861
We're in the big time now.

198
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,781
So where's the kingpin?

199
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:30,201
Your guess is as good as mine.

200
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:36,374
So you get the dude's name?

201
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,209
Nope.

202
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,671
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names

203
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:44,966
what we look like,
but not the other way around?

204
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:50,555
Why don't you get yourself some food?

205
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:53,098
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals

206
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:54,892
looking like a couple chumps?

207
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,895
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

208
00:16:58,354 --> 00:16:59,647
Fine, thanks.

209
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,861
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

210
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,155
I don't get you, man.

211
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:11,159
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

212
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:15,705
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

213
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,665
Yeah, what about after?

214
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:21,252
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

215
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,969
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

216
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,257
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

217
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:30,052
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

218
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,680
We got a guy killed.

219
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,019
You know what?

220
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:40,730
This is bullshit.

221
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,775
- I'm out of here.
- Hey.

222
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:56,788
I think she's waking up from a nap.

223
00:17:56,954 --> 00:18:00,416
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

224
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,714
We have to keep an eye on your fluids.

225
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,508
You're on the low side of normal.

226
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,302
What? How low?

227
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:14,719
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

228
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:18,356
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

229
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:21,312
Hey.

230
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,648
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

231
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,817
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

232
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:28,027
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,655
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

234
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:32,949
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:34,367
Look at her.

236
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:35,993
- Look.
- Yeah.

237
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,830
God. It's like she's here already.

238
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:42,625
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

239
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,127
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

240
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,171
It's time to make a decision.

241
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:50,508
- You know what I'm gonna say.
- The C-section?

242
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,969
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

243
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:59,100
Well, my last labor
was pretty tough, so...

244
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:02,228
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:05,245
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:09,694
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for

247
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:11,362
a week from Friday?

248
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:16,033
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

249
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,582
We have a birthday.

250
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,625
The 16th.

251
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,961
- I like it.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,464
You know, speaking of birthdays

253
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:34,218
I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

254
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:37,221
It's an hour before closing.

255
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,473
You're supposed to be taking it easy.

256
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,975
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday,

257
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,809
and I've gotta pick up the cake.

258
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:45,479
Why you?

259
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:50,192
Because I said I would...?

260
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,987
It is the least I can do.

261
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:56,115
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

262
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:57,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:48,292
Let's get out of here.

264
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,711
You know, go do something.

265
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,006
Seriously.

266
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:57,635
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

267
00:20:58,177 --> 00:21:00,179
Let's take a drive.

268
00:21:04,183 --> 00:21:05,810
Sure.

269
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:27,372
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

270
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:29,417
We're halfway through the job.

271
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:34,505
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

272
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:38,300
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

273
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,760
I gotta go.

274
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:41,971
Dean, I gotta go.

275
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,348
Okay, all right.

276
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,187
Happy birthday!

277
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,356
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,776
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

279
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,696
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

280
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:02,533
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

281
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,620
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

282
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:10,041
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

283
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:14,879
- Wait. Skyler?
- Yes?

284
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:16,672
I wanna hear it first.

285
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:19,133
Absolutely not. No way.

286
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,650
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

287
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:24,554
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

288
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:28,558
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

289
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:32,229
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

290
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:35,316
And I'm enormous now.

291
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:37,735
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

292
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,237
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

293
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:42,865
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

294
00:22:43,032 --> 00:22:44,825
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

295
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,747
- <i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>
- It's obscene.

296
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:52,917
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>

297
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:08,598
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

298
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:15,439
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

299
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:23,197
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

300
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:27,701
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

301
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:32,289
<i>Happy birthday</i>

302
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,961
<i>To you</i>

303
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:42,632
That was fantastic.

304
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,677
Isn't she great, huh?

305
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:47,263
Okay, here we go.

306
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,401
- He wasn't there.
- <i>Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

307
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:03,218
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

308
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,488
Nobody came.

309
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:07,324
<i>All I know is my contact
said he was there.</i>

310
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:09,785
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

311
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:11,829
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

312
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:13,539
- Where was he?
- <i>Who knows?</i>

313
00:24:13,706 --> 00:24:16,417
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens

314
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:18,419
didn't like the cut of your jib.

315
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:23,007
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

316
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,675
What? What do you mean?

317
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,261
No deal. No dice.

318
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,430
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

319
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:30,890
Wait a minute.

320
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,683
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

321
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:37,117
<i>I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?</i>

322
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,609
He's skittish, like a deer.

323
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:44,862
Call him back.

324
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,114
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

325
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:49,950
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

326
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:52,411
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

327
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,955
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

328
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,749
Second of all, it's over.

329
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:59,418
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual</i>

330
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:02,004
<i>all you get is the one shot.</i>

331
00:25:03,214 --> 00:25:04,465
Look

332
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:07,301
I'll see if I can scrape
something else together,

333
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,261
but don't get your hopes up.

334
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:12,223
<i>No one else handles that kind of bulk.</i>

335
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:13,974
Damn it.

336
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:57,658
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

337
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:06,587
Can I help you, sir?

338
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:10,716
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,679
And five minutes of your time.

340
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,942
- What can I do for you?
- Have a seat.

341
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:32,279
Please.

342
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:48,003
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:52,091
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:56,845
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,057
I believe that person was you.

346
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:03,811
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:06,563
I don't think I am.

348
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:12,403
Sir, if you have a complaint

349
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:15,071
I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:17,658
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,121
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with

352
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,623
is very careful.

353
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,834
A cautious man.

354
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,546
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:36,301
If you are who I think you are

356
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,929
you should give me another chance.

357
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:46,854
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:51,483
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,695
Your partner was late and he was high.

360
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,615
Yes. Yes, he was.

361
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:02,619
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,000
You have poor judgment.

363
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:11,544
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

364
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:14,798
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:19,011
- I've been told it's excellent.
- It is impeccable.

366
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,680
It is the purest

367
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:25,350
most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,895
That is not the only factor.

369
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:32,065
You could charge twice
the current rate for what I provide,

370
00:29:32,232 --> 00:29:34,735
and your customers would pay it.

371
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:37,029
Hands down.

372
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:44,203
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,413
You won't see him.

374
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,374
You won't interact with him.

375
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:51,585
Forget he exists.

376
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:55,422
I have to ask.

377
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:58,258
Why?

378
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:00,260
Why him?

379
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:05,474
Because he does what I say.

380
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:09,353
Because I can trust him.

381
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,106
How much product do you have on hand?

382
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:15,776
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:18,612
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:26,703
Will I hear from you?

385
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:30,749
I have your numbers.

386
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,924
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:56,731
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs,

388
00:30:56,817 --> 00:31:00,028
but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:03,782
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,534
Dribs and drabs.

391
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:07,911
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller

392
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:11,498
the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:16,795
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:23,468
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:26,680
I found six other instances

396
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:30,392
of revenues being under-reported.

397
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:34,104
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,691
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

399
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:40,235
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,237
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:44,948
I let them roll their overages
into the next order,

402
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:47,200
and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

403
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,036
Obviously, we forgot,

404
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:53,248
or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:56,793
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see

406
00:31:56,877 --> 00:32:00,547
the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,008
Right.

408
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,801
Right,

409
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:09,640
but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage

410
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:12,225
to try and sort this out.

411
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,397
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,901
In a few cases

413
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:25,572
I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,327
Ted.

415
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:42,130
All right.

416
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,509
You got me.

417
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:50,931
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:54,518
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

419
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,895
about saving a company.

420
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:58,897
I'm thinking about people's jobs

421
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,982
about their mortgages and pensions,

422
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:04,403
and their college funds for their kids.

423
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:06,446
Not to mention my own.

424
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:09,241
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

425
00:33:09,408 --> 00:33:11,118
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,245
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

427
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:16,748
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,417
- If I don't keep up...
- Ted.

429
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,461
People go to prison for this.

430
00:33:27,426 --> 00:33:30,554
My dad built this company from nothing.

431
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:33,890
We make things here.

432
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:37,144
The people who work here are like family.

433
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:41,440
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:47,112
Sky...

435
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:51,908
don't report this.

436
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:54,494
Please.

437
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:59,374
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:06,673
But I can't be a part of it.

439
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,219
I know.

440
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:14,097
I know. I just wish...

441
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:16,933
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:20,896
I don't want you to go.

443
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,708
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

444
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,669
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

445
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,713
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

446
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,464
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

447
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:50,598
<i>Even Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>

448
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,844
<i>Combo's people, his ma, grandma, cousins</i>

449
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:55,013
<i>everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>

450
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,891
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

451
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:00,060
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>

452
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:02,145
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

453
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:05,440
<i>I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

454
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:08,610
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

455
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:12,030
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

456
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:15,325
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

457
00:35:57,784 --> 00:35:59,786
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:50,003
Hold that.

459
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:53,840
What's it feel like?

460
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,304
There's a chill.

461
00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:02,766
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,517
And then...

463
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:05,852
You'll see.

464
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,275
I'll meet you there.

465
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:25,664
Take that off.

466
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:56,231
Phones off, please.

467
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,376
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:19,379
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:22,048
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:38,481
Yes.

471
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:54,379
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,875
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,503
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

474
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,590
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

475
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,341
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,385
Oh, owner. Okay.

477
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:10,471
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:12,849
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:17,604
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,523
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,901
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

482
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,862
No, no.

483
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:28,031
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

484
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:29,741
Gus.

485
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:30,950
Thank you.

486
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,707
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:41,377
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:42,921
- One hour.
- What?

489
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:44,505
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:48,301
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

491
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:50,511
One hour. If you miss it

492
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:53,431
don't ever show your face in here again.

493
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,190
Exit 13 off the 25 South, to a truck...

494
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:05,526
- Come on! Come on!
- <i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

495
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:08,529
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

496
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:10,573
Pick up the phone.

497
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,118
I'm coming by. I need the product.

498
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:16,120
I need the product now.

499
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:06,004
Oh, God.

500
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:18,933
Jesse.

501
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:23,980
Jesse!

502
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:26,232
Jesse.

503
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,818
Jesse.

504
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:51,424
Jesse. Jesse.

505
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,385
Jesse.

506
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:18,368
Jesse.

507
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,161
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

508
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:22,038
Jesse.

509
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:25,416
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

510
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,751
Wake up!

511
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:28,544
Come on, damn it.

512
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:30,046
Wake up.

513
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,423
Where'd you put it?

514
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,466
- Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

515
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,470
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

516
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:39,430
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

517
00:44:40,223 --> 00:44:42,266
Under the sink.

518
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:49,625
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
