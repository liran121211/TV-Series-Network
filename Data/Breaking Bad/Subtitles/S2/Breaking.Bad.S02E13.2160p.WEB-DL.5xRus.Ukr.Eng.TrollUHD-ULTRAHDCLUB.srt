1
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,467
Come on.

2
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,721
Come on.

3
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,973
Come...

4
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,018
Come on. Come on, baby.

5
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:08,690
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

6
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:38,887
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

7
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,043
Yeah.

8
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:16,257
{\an8}Slow down. Slow... Slow down.

9
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,511
{\an8}And just... Just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,346
Do it.

11
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:23,598
{\an8}All right.

12
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,351
{\an8}Now, what happened?

13
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:42,951
All right. All right. Now

14
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:47,956
listen... Listen to me.
Are you listening?

15
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,001
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,254
No, no... Listen. Calm down.

17
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,964
{\an8}Just...

18
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:00,385
{\an8}Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:28,913
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:41,301
Come on. Inside.

21
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,518
Watch the door.

22
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,064
{\an8}Where is she?

23
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,282
{\an8}Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:36,249
{\an8}Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,295
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:43,631
Here's your story.

27
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:48,136
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,221
Say it.

29
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:55,810
{\an8}Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,816
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,033
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,445
Again.

33
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,329
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,074
Again. Again.

35
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,244
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,831
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,213
Once you call, the people who show up

38
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:26,925
will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,510
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,013
{\an8}Police officers may arrive, they may not.

41
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,380
{\an8}Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:37,018
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,562
There's nothing to incriminate you,

44
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:42,146
so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:47,654
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,989
You tell them you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:52,408
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:56,037
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,958
I was not here.

50
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:12,085
You put on a long-sleeved shirt,

51
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,278
and cover those track marks on your arm.

52
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:21,479
Count down from 20, and then you dial.

53
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,036
{\an8}Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

54
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,273
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,111
- Two.
- Two. All right.

56
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,490
Thank you.

57
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,954
Junior.

58
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,170
Junior.

59
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,214
- Flynn.
- What?

60
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,800
Flynn.

61
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,763
Flynn.

62
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,474
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,146
You all right?

64
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,697
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,743
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,953
Seriously.

67
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:08,336
- What?
- Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:11,964
Are those donations?

69
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,031
- Yes.
- Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:21,641
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:26,687
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,358
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,945
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,032
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

75
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:42,370
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:46,874
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

77
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:50,002
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:56,509
That's... Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:01,180
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:05,476
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,896
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:15,444
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:20,408
Damn.
Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,377
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

85
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,504
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>

86
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,507
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

87
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,343
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,678
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:47,393
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,589
Sir, you may not wanna be here for this.

91
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:58,488
I just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,532
That's all I know.

93
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,034
What's her date of birth?

94
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:12,877
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:15,297
April...

96
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:19,384
- April 4th, 1982.
- Okay.

97
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:24,264
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

98
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:27,809
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

99
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:30,645
Bishop.

100
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:35,650
- And place of birth?
- Phoenix.

101
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,612
{\an8}Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:44,534
This is our address.

103
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,078
Do you have someone who can drive you?

104
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,622
I can drive.

105
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,873
Well, then if you'd like to meet us there

106
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,501
we can complete the intake
and take our samples,

107
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:55,920
and then you can make your arrangements.

108
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,464
Okay?

109
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,217
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:28,787
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,997
- Forty from Te...
- Terre Haute.

112
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,207
Walt.

113
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,718
<i>It's me.</i>

114
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,054
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>

115
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:50,517
I'm just checking in.

116
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,063
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,607
That's... That's good.

118
00:15:57,774 --> 00:16:01,986
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:07,158
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,081
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:17,502
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,755
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,135
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,429
Biggest donation

125
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,473
gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,184
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,228
Smallest donation gets two six-packs.

128
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,565
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down

129
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:39,882
here's what we know.

130
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:42,402
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,196
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:47,031
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:51,202
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:54,038
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,791
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus

136
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,669
from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:03,757
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,800
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:09,429
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,638
Bueller?

141
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:13,105
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

142
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:16,074
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade

143
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:20,899
of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,567
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:25,904
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck

146
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,239
the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:31,284
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:36,873
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,168
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,796
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

151
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:48,718
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:51,011
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,848
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup

154
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:55,332
every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,675
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes

156
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:01,064
he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,565
I've been thinking.

158
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:07,278
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,405
Raw talent's bound to pop up somewhere.

160
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:12,322
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,870
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:19,331
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,001
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff

164
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,268
making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada.

165
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,551
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:34,681
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,225
Now

168
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:40,645
I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,815
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:46,234
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:50,154
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:53,658
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,494
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:57,412 --> 00:19:00,331
Fo... Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:02,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

176
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:06,796
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:08,798
Your guy found him?

178
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:11,050
Where is he?

179
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,260
Okay, listen.

180
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,970
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:15,805
You have your guy pick...

182
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,016
Saul. Just shut... Saul.

183
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:21,519
Saul, shut up and give me the address.

184
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,316
I don't recommend it.

185
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,735
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place

186
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,530
keep an eye on the comings and goings.

187
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,616
Are they here now?

188
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:38,703
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:41,998
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,167
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:49,547
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:51,758
Let me handle this.

193
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:23,039
Yo.

194
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,766
Jesse.

195
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,981
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,151
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Hey.

197
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:36,988
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:39,240
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just...

199
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:42,702
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,995
Jesse.

201
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,914
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:50,752
No, no, no.

203
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,962
- I'm good.
- Come on. Help me out now.

204
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:56,507
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

205
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:59,844
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

206
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:02,263
You are not good at all. You hear?

207
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:06,142
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

208
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:07,685
You're gonna stand up,

209
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:10,354
and we're gonna walk out of here, okay?

210
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:12,721
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

211
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:16,110
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

212
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:46,057
I killed her.

213
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:49,310
- What?
- I killed her. It was me.

214
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:51,311
- I killed her, man. I killed her.
- No.

215
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:54,482
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

216
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,067
You didn't kill anybody.

217
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,737
I loved her.

218
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:06,119
I loved her more than anything.

219
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,258
No, no. No.

220
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,879
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

221
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:12,226
I guess they should be...

222
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:18,544
I don't know.
Just use your best judgment.

223
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:22,173
There's no yellow dress here.

224
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,968
It's all... It's all black and gray.

225
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:30,803
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,477
What about blue?

227
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:37,980
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:41,817
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...

229
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,071
Not super-bright, either.

230
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:47,948
I mean, blue is blue.

231
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:51,744
No. No cleavage.

232
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:54,997
Long sleeves.

233
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:59,502
Yeah. It's nice.

234
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:02,755
It's nice.

235
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:10,262
Big yawn, Holly.

236
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:13,474
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

237
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:18,521
- Okay, sweetie.
- Yes.

238
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:22,483
Yes!

239
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:25,152
Here we go.

240
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:28,989
Here we go. Yes.

241
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:38,374
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

242
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,293
Junior. Hey.

243
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:45,214
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

244
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:49,885
- Dad, it's money.
- Just please do it.

245
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,721
Okay, the noise is disturbing the baby.

246
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:57,560
Marie, slow down. I can't...

247
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,731
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

248
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,443
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

249
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,447
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna... Let me
tell him, and I'll call you right back.

250
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,032
Okay.

251
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:15,368
- Guess what.
- What?

252
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:18,080
- You are gonna be in the newspaper.
- No way.

253
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:20,373
One of Marie's patients
works at the <i>Journal.</i>

254
00:26:20,457 --> 00:26:22,876
She told him about the website
and the donations,

255
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,337
and they're gonna do a story about you.

256
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:26,547
- For real?
- Yep.

257
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:29,758
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

258
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:31,552
Awesome.

259
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:36,348
- It'll mean more hits.
- And more contributions.

260
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:43,063
East of Scottsdale?

261
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,691
Let me guess. Not talking.

262
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:48,360
Nope. Not a one.

263
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:51,447
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

264
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:56,243
All right, chief. Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

265
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,203
Yeah. You too.

266
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,959
Agent Schrader, can you spare a moment?

267
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:06,253
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

268
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:12,092
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

269
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:16,388
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

270
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:18,431
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

271
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:20,643
Paul Canterna of Canterna Real Estate.

272
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,727
- Hey, it's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

273
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:26,398
And Gustavo Fring of Los Pollos Hermanos.

274
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:28,692
- Please, just Gus.
- Hi, Gus.

275
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,653
You guys make some killer chicken.

276
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:32,488
Thank you very much.

277
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:35,240
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run,

278
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:37,325
and I thought I would give them a tour.

279
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,120
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:42,414
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:43,999
Yes, the Albuquerque office

282
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,918
covers everything
from drug-related money laundering

283
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:50,002
to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:53,842
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine

285
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:57,012
which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,598
- Terrible.
- Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,433
We've had some successes locally,

288
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,768
but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

289
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:07,480
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run

290
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,858
one of the most powerful weapons we have.

291
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:11,276
Anything we can do.

292
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:12,943
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Hank.

293
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,238
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

294
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,115
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:18,784
Is this one of your agents?

296
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:22,955
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297
00:28:23,122 --> 00:28:25,206
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to...

298
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,711
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:33,549
- Lung cancer.
- Oh, that's a rough one.

300
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:39,555
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

301
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,548
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

302
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,664
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

303
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm gonna have my surgery on Friday.

304
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,423
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

305
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:19,428
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

306
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:22,890
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

307
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:38,530
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:42,951
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay?

309
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:45,996
I deserve this.

310
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:48,457
What?

311
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:53,337
What you said in the desert.

312
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:57,257
I get it, what you meant.

313
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,847
I deserve whatever happens.

314
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,245
Oh, shit.

315
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:43,428
There he is!

316
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:47,307
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

317
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:49,852
We called you about 50 times.

318
00:30:50,018 --> 00:30:53,480
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:57,147
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the<i> Journal</i>

320
00:30:57,276 --> 00:31:00,863
then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:03,532
- This is him?
- Yes.

322
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:05,075
This is Dad. Great.

323
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:08,620
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle

324
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:10,706
Mom and Dad on either side.

325
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:12,332
Mom and Dad?

326
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:17,171
How much money have you raised so far?

327
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:21,383
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,677
But there's more coming in all the time.

329
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:26,722
- Wow, that's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

330
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:30,392
It's just... It's been incredible.

331
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,894
Judging from things you have
written about him

332
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:38,734
- your dad must be quite a guy.
- Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:41,403
You don't wanna lose him, do you, Walter?

334
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,741
None of us do. We love him.

335
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:50,746
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:54,833
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,600
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,132
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

339
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,762
He's just decent.

340
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,474
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:14,102
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:19,107
- Would you say he's your hero?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

343
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:21,944
My dad is my hero.

344
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:32,037
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,665
This one just relaxes him a little.

346
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:37,750
We're almost ready. We'll be
taking you in, in just a minute.

347
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:39,503
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:44,633
Well...

349
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:49,805
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

350
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,910
Relaxed yet?

351
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,246
As a matter of fact...

352
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:23,005
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:26,466
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:31,388
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:35,017
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:37,853
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,813
Yeah, you better.

358
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:44,359
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:47,904
Where's your phone?

360
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:50,324
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,200
Which one?

362
00:33:55,704 --> 00:34:00,959
I'm pretty sure he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,678
Okay.

364
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:23,590
Well, first things first.

365
00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:26,217
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,304
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

367
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,723
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,990
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

369
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:37,645
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture

370
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,689
here somewhere.

371
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,151
- She's beautiful.
- Thanks.

372
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:46,446
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

373
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:51,451
- How's your pain level, Walter?
- It's...

374
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:53,620
Very low, basically.

375
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:55,747
Shortness of breath?

376
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:58,708
- A bit, but much better.
- Good.

377
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,628
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,338
I can't foresee the future,

379
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:05,354
but even conservatively speaking

380
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:08,315
I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,763
There's no reason not to be optimistic.

382
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,765
That's great.

383
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:17,560
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00:36:18,895 --> 00:36:22,315
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

385
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,901
- He can ease into it now.
- Okay.

386
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:30,490
- And can he go back to work or...?
- I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,911
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:37,705
But he can be on his own?

389
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:41,167
I mean, just more, you know, independent.

390
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:44,170
Yes. Use your best judgment.

391
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:46,297
Well...

392
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,092
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393
00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:51,594
One less baby in the house.

394
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:05,149
- Don, hey.
- Hey, Stew.

395
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,819
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:09,988
Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:16,577
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:19,539
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:21,958
Terrible thing. Just...

400
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,878
But you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

401
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:28,756
- You been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

402
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:32,677
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help,

403
00:37:32,844 --> 00:37:36,431
so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:40,893
- Focus on work.
- Sure. Absolutely.

405
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,895
Yeah.

406
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:45,898
Well, see you inside.

407
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,903
Continue to descend through 1500.

408
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,073
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

409
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,077
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

410
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:02,040
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

411
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:07,128
Pima-311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

412
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:10,840
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

413
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:15,678
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:18,473
I think I may just keep this.

415
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:19,766
Sky?

416
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:22,935
What do you think?

417
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,814
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,276
What are you doing?

419
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:33,071
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,241
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

421
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,375
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:42,705
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:46,084
I want you to pack your things and leave.

424
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,294
Why would I do that?

425
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,714
Hank has offered to help. You
shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,133
- Skyler.
- I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,968
I want...

428
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:57,595
I want you gone.

429
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:11,317
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,654
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,491
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:20,952
What?

433
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,204
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone,

434
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:28,167
and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:39:29,419 --> 00:39:30,670
When?

436
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:33,423
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:35,800
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,067
You know what I think?

439
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:42,098
I think you accidentally told the truth.

440
00:39:42,432 --> 00:39:45,184
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,353
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,481
Then it got me thinking again

443
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:54,277
about all the strange behavior.

444
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:56,946
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:59,615
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals

446
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:01,742
checking the morgue.

447
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,704
Your fugue state?

448
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,876
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:12,545
I had to find a way.

450
00:40:13,796 --> 00:40:18,718
I mean, who would lie about such a thing?

451
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:20,720
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:24,056
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:27,393
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,854
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:32,732
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:35,318
Well, my guess was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,864
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,576
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:45,661
I am not having an affair with Gretchen.

460
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:48,873
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:55,003
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,089
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,467
So I finally left a message:

464
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:03,262
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,140
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:09,936
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:13,773
The money for your treatment

468
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:19,028
Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

469
00:41:20,613 --> 00:41:22,448
They paid for nothing.

470
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:25,076
You refused every offer they made you.

471
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:26,660
But that didn't make sense

472
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:29,371
because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital,

473
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:32,750
and not including your surgery

474
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,961
we're nearly paid up.

475
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:38,005
Over $100,000.

476
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:43,594
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,063
But then

478
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:57,733
I called your mother.

479
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:01,320
Yeah.

480
00:42:02,363 --> 00:42:04,240
Thanks for that too.

481
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:07,326
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money

482
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,539
that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:14,792
It's possible.

484
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:21,424
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother

485
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:26,679
she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:32,226
You never went to see her.

487
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,063
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,647
You were gone for four days,

489
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:41,611
and yet she swears

490
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:44,447
that you were never there.

491
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,539
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:56,459
Skyler.

493
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,337
Could you

494
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:02,089
just once...

495
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:08,846
do me the courtesy of not denying it?

496
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,607
Skyler.

497
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:22,902
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:25,404
I...

499
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:28,240
Skyler, please, don't go.

500
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:41,921
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,009
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:43:48,302 --> 00:43:50,179
Whatever it is

503
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:53,265
I'm afraid to know.
