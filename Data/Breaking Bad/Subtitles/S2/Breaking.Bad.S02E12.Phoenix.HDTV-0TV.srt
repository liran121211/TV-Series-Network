1
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:35,729
Skyler, I'm so...

2
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,228
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie.
How...

3
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,663
Oh, God.

4
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:44,623
Oh, thank God.

5
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:46,988
Is she beautiful?

6
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,879
I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

7
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,889
Some accident up ahead.

8
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,017
Christ.
Today of all days, huh?

9
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,061
Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

10
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:24,125
Excuse me.
Skyler White?

11
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,319
307.

12
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:40,328
Skyler, I'm so sorry.
I'm just...

13
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:42,049
Are you okay?

14
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,311
Meet your daughter.

15
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:00,146
Hi, there, girl.

16
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:02,486
Hi, there, Holly.

17
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,331
Congratulations, Walt.

18
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,439
I'm sorry, I didn't see you here.

19
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,693
Ted drove me here.
Thank God.

20
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,719
I mean, this little
bundle of joy of ours

21
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,412
was practically on rails.

22
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:22,534
Halfway here I thought he was gonna have
to pull over and deliver her himself.

23
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:26,739
Then, I'm glad

24
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,190
it didn't come to that.

25
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,457
No problem at all.

26
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,240
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can, you three,

27
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,957
can be alone, okay?

28
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,828
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

29
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,357
I really...
I can't begin to thank you...

30
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,119
Don't think anything of it.
It's my pleasure.

31
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,794
Congratulations again.

32
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,262
She's beautiful.

33
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,170
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Take care.

34
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,277
Are you okay?

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,210
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's okay.

36
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,667
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,170
Where's everyone else?

38
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,265
Downstairs.

39
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,157
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

40
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:24,281
He has been such a trooper.
He even changed his first diaper.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,308
Did he?

42
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,239
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:36,478
Anything at all?

44
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:37,803
Actually, yes.

45
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,456
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

46
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,305
I think you get it in your head,
"C-section." You know?

47
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:47,309
But I'm just so glad
the way it all worked out.

48
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,146
Doing it natural instead.

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,429
It just couldn't have
gone any better.

50
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:53,354
Good.

51
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:57,959
Let me...

52
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:00,766
go get your things.

53
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:03,407
And I'll...

54
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,179
get my stuff, too, okay?

55
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,788
I'll spend the night.

56
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,825
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

57
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:59,814

www.sub-way.fr

58
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:43,593
Dad.

59
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,073
I was in the shower.

60
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,236
I overslept.

61
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,018
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

62
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:02,733
Baby, I gotta go.

63
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,879
Somebody broke in.

64
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:45,757
Come on.

65
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:47,595
Damn.

66
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,178
Oh, God.

67
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:55,387
Oh, Christ.

68
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:02,653
This week was tough.

69
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:03,928
Toughest yet.

70
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,508
You know why?

71
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:07,426
I knew this day was coming.

72
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,101
- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

73
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:12,222
Yeah, and as it got closer,
it got worse.

74
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:16,079
I was scared shitless I wouldn't
make it. I really didn't think I would.

75
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:18,504
Called in sick three days in a row.

76
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,538
I know my boss was pissed.

77
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,817
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't want to see anybody.

78
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,668
You guys know how that is.

79
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,666
All it'd take is one friend

80
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,346
and I'd be out rippin'
and runnin' again.

81
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,621
But I made it.
I really made it.

82
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,949
I got one year clean to the day.

83
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,354
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

84
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,274
You getting enough sleep?

85
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:03,649
Actually, no.

86
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,804
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

87
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:12,825
A guy wants his whole back done up.
Him on his chopper, flames all around.

88
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:16,748
I keep showing him the design
and he keeps asking for changes, like,

89
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,972
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

90
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:22,350
And I'm like, "A, this ain't
the Sistine Chapel.

91
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:25,775
"And B, I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

92
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:28,966
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

93
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:32,178
- You need to avoid those type of...
- I know...

94
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:33,695
and I do.

95
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,730
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

96
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,769
It's actually really corporate.

97
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,354
So, how's your job?

98
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,739
Oh, you know.
Same old, same old.

99
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:55,242
Doing backup training
on my days off.

100
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,143
God, they're hiring anybody now.

101
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:59,288
No experience at all.
It's scary.

102
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:06,285
You seeing anyone?

103
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:11,881
You?

104
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,678
What about that guy next door?

105
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,221
What do you mean?

106
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,858
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation

107
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:20,701
of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,726
He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,626
Dad, he's our tenant.

110
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,241
End of story.

111
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:31,024
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

112
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,403
Isn't she beautiful?

113
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,165
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

114
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,752
And why not?

115
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:56,473
Good stock.

116
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:01,128
I'll get it.

117
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,008
Nobody's there.

118
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:14,535
Beat ya!

119
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,266
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

120
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:20,922
Just Carmen.

121
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,839
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard?

122
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,501
<i>Good news.
She's just so beautiful.</i>

123
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:29,918
Well, Holly.

124
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,038
<i>7 pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

125
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,822
Everybody is doing just fine.

126
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,886
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

127
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,171
I am trying to tell you, man.

128
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:43,251
Last night, somebody
broke in my place, yo.

129
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,977
- <i>I got robbed.</i>
- What?

130
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,187
Somebody, they got all of our...

131
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:48,913
<i>our stuff.</i>

132
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:50,981
All of it.

133
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,309
You get me, Mr. White?

134
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,115
<i>The blue stuff.
It's, like, uncanny.</i>

135
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,383
They new exactly where to look!

136
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:04,329
I mean, say something, man!
Yell at me or something! Come on!

137
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,843
God!

138
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,963
Hank, come on!
People are starving to death out here!

139
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,638
All right, all right.
Had to get a beer.

140
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,779
All right, guys.
Here we go.

141
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:38,488
We got mild, medium
and <i>muy caliente</i>.

142
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,805
I got dibs on the breast.

143
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:44,524
- Los Pollos Hermanos?
- Yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

144
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,696
This joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

145
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,598
That baby's hungry.

146
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,568
Give me that baby.

147
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,274
Aw, sweetie.

148
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,634
Come on. Jeez, Sky.
Not at the table. We're eating.

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,137
Hank, it's only a breast.

150
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,390
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- You are so provincial.

151
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,410
Remember the day when you were talking
to me about child-proofing?

152
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,631
What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

153
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,711
Actually, I was thinking
more of an alarm system.

154
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:22,749
They've got these new systems out there,
"sonar systems" that would...

155
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:25,724
anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

156
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:28,031
That sounds expensive.

157
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,094
Well, yeah, but...

158
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:32,709
for the baby, I mean...

159
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,169
Why don't...

160
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,414
Why don't you let
Marie and I get that for you guys?

161
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:38,589
Absolutely.

162
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:42,713
No, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

163
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,549
We'll take care of it.

164
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,205
Back at work soon?

165
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:50,533
Since you're scheduled
for surgery, I just thought

166
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,970
it might be a good idea
to have some money coming in.

167
00:12:57,196 --> 00:13:00,546
Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

168
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,820
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

169
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,172
Money-wise,

170
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,080
we'll manage.
I promise you that.

171
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:14,127
What? You guys got a printing press
in the garage churning out 50s?

172
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,168
I wish.

173
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,916
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

174
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,557
That's right.
Everybody pitches in.

175
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,216
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

176
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,501
I'll get her.

177
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:35,706
I'll get her.

178
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,413
Good girl.

179
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,859
That's a good girl.

180
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,269
My little girl, huh?

181
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,629
Do you want to see something?

182
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:10,611
Come here.

183
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,633
Oh. I know, I know.

184
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:32,361
You want to see what
your daddy did for you?

185
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,032
Let me show you.

186
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,675
Here. Come here.

187
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:42,976
Want to see?

188
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,568
That's right.

189
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:00,211
Daddy did that.

190
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,553
Daddy did that for you.

191
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,716
This place looks exactly the same.

192
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,506
Why don't you have computers and shit?
It's the 20th century.

193
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,968
What the hell are you doing here?

194
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,709
You took the stash!

195
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,303
I heard all those phone messages
and I figured it out.

196
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:34,259
You figured it out?
Congratulations, Einstein.

197
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,518
You left me to freak out
all day long,

198
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,437
like I dropped the ball!
And you were the one who took it!

199
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,103
Shut up.

200
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,915
You lower your voice.

201
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,365
"Like" you dropped the ball?

202
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:55,079
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

203
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,123
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

204
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,491
What was that?

205
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,280
Heroin?

206
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:04,418
Jesus.

207
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:07,653
I was on my day off.
What I do on my day off...

208
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:10,149
Day off? We were on-call,
you junkie.

209
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:12,262
On-call for the biggest
deal of our lives.

210
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,033
And I just managed to pull it off by
the skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

211
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:19,351
You made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

212
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:24,047
Son of a bitch.

213
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:28,069
How much?

214
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,495
How much what?

215
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,870
How much did you get for the deal?

216
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:37,738
1.2 million.

217
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:41,137
600,000 each.

218
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,080
480,000.

219
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:45,224
Saul's cut is 20%.

220
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:49,543
So, where's my money?

221
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,010
What?

222
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,087
You are joking, right?

223
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,258
If I gave you that money,

224
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,146
you would be dead inside of a week.

225
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,973
Look, I'm off the heroin.

226
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:11,057
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

227
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,657
And the... And the meth.

228
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,838
You know, I can take it or leave it.

229
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,121
I'm clean, Mr. White.

230
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:21,258
For real.

231
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:34,678
Prove it.

232
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:36,114
Pee in that.

233
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:39,124
- How gay are you? Seriously.
- Pee in it.

234
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,810
They're selling testing kits
at the drug stores.

235
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:45,151
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

236
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:47,857
No, huh?

237
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:50,895
Well, I guess, until then,

238
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,970
you'll just have to depend on
the kindness of strangers to get high.

239
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,794
That and your little
junkie girlfriend.

240
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:27,294
Not on her tummy, Walt.

241
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,619
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

242
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:33,803
I'll put her on her side.
Do you want to hold her back?

243
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,574
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up,

244
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,717
I'll roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

245
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,138
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

246
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,813
It's hypo-allergenic.

247
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:51,684
I think a towel will do.

248
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,934
What is it?

249
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,641
Your son.

250
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,806
He's just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

251
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,114
I told you it's not ready yet.

252
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,189
Honey, just show it to them.

253
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,919
My God, son.
That's wonderful.

254
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:36,841
This is beautiful.

255
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,191
SaveWalterWhite.com.

256
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,639
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

257
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,260
Wait a minute.

258
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,126
You're not asking for money,
are you, son?

259
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:52,106
That's the whole idea.

260
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,443
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

261
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,706
But we can't ask for money.

262
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:09,235
I appreciate it.
I really do.

263
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:16,685
This was all his idea.

264
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,593
He worked so hard on it.

265
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,565
Just let him help.

266
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,732
You can't ask him to take it down.

267
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:26,485
It'll crush him.

268
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:28,378
It's charity.

269
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,431
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of

270
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:35,699
dirty word?

271
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,117
This is insane.

272
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,409
I have so much cash on-hand

273
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:53,830
that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

274
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:57,255
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

275
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:01,136
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

276
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:03,845
It's insane.

277
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:07,098
Well, I guess that's
why gangsters had molls.

278
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,651
What?

279
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,434
Gun molls.

280
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:12,812
Haven't you ever seen <i>White Heat</i>?

281
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,397
I've seen <i>White Heat</i>,
but I don't see how that pertains.

282
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:19,907
Maybe you need a moll
more than you need a wife

283
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:22,158
who you can't trust
with your secrets.

284
00:21:22,283 --> 00:21:25,992
What good is money that doesn't spend?
If a tree falls in the forest...

285
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,788
You get the point.

286
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,704
So communicating is out?

287
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:31,981
Out.

288
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,038
Well, let's see.
What else is there?

289
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:36,696
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money

290
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,821
"down by the railroad tracks."

291
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,698
Works for me.

292
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,051
Uncle Murray.

293
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,464
"Oh, many is the happy memory
of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.

294
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,102
"We lost track of
the old pervert years ago,

295
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,720
"but what do you know?
He kicked it and left me millions."

296
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,567
It cannot be blind luck or some

297
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,986
imaginary relative who saves us.

298
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,502
I earned that money, me.

299
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,716
And now my son created
his own website...

300
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:11,704
"SaveWalterWhite.com..."
soliciting anonymous donations.

301
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,707
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

302
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:22,684
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

303
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:25,637
Cyber-begging.
That's all that is.

304
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,681
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

305
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,475
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

306
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:36,318
I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

307
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:38,773
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- No, I know.

308
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,270
You're thinking that I should be
funneling my money

309
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,695
into my son's website,
but absolutely not, no.

310
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,800
I am not going to have
my family think that some

311
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:49,196
mystery benefactor saved us.

312
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:52,325
Not some mystery
benefactor, singular.

313
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,400
That would raise too many questions.
However... stay with me here...

314
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,200
Zombies.

315
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,631
I got a guy who knows this guy
who knows this <i>Rain Man</i>-type.

316
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:07,200
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus.

317
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,346
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

318
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:11,478
Wait.

319
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:14,116
He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

320
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:17,035
This guy can hijack random desktops

321
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,690
all around the world, turn 'em into
zombies that do his bidding.

322
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:22,203
For instance,

323
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:25,561
he can make it so, 20 or 30,000

324
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:28,948
little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

325
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,464
10, 20, 50 bucks a pop,

326
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:34,829
all paid in-full, nice and neat,
untraceable,

327
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:38,819
from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White,

328
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,318
Cancer Saint.

329
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,845
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

330
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,598
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

331
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:55,850
Not too much.

332
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:58,860
I mean, like...
like, who's he, right?

333
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:01,085
I mean, first off, I taught him.

334
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:04,822
He's always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

335
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,912
Now the cotton.

336
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:24,127
Needle?

337
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,548
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

338
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,442
My point exactly.

339
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:47,406
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

340
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,889
How much does he owe you, anyway?

341
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:56,796
480.

342
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,350
Well, hell, I'd be mad, too,
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

343
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:06,087
480,000.

344
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:08,785
What?

345
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,184
What?

346
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,270
Thousand.

347
00:25:16,972 --> 00:25:19,125
Not on your back, baby.
In case you throw up.

348
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,450
On your side.
Sleep on your side.

349
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:32,113
She's all like,

350
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:36,099
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

351
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,974
"I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

352
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:41,600
"I'm conversing
about life and death."

353
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,837
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

354
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:46,753
Hell, Becky knows.

355
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:53,814
Dad?

356
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,554
I overslept.
I'm on my way.

357
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:11,898
Dad?

358
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:15,114
Dad, wait.

359
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:17,671
It's not what it looks like.

360
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,497
Dad, just wait.
Let me talk to you for one second.

361
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,221
Come on!

362
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:39,207
Stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

363
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:41,682
- Son of a bitch.
- Dad, let him go!

364
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:48,690
Get away from me, man.
Back off.

365
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,449
- Back off!
- Everybody just calm down!

366
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,140
What's with you, yo?

367
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:56,596
- 'Cause I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

368
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:59,064
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

369
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,775
I got civil rights!

370
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:04,914
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

371
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:07,174
I pay my rent.

372
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,312
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

373
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:14,924
Look, as it so happens,
we were just...

374
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,442
we were just talking
about that and...

375
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,356
And I was gonna tell you, okay?
If you would just let me.

376
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:21,678
18 months.

377
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:25,268
You have been clean for 18 months, Jane.
Why? Why do you do it?

378
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,458
I backslid, okay?

379
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,492
Like, what?

380
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,952
What, you think I'm proud of this?

381
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,942
Like, I do it on purpose?

382
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:36,412
Lying to me,

383
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,604
shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser!

384
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:41,327
It takes one to know one!

385
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,203
His name is Jesse, and you don't know
the first thing about him.

386
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,306
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

387
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:50,084
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

388
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,132
Thank you for not being judgmental

389
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,862
24 hours a day.

390
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:59,260
'Cause that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

391
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:04,965
You know what you need?
I'll tell you exactly.

392
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,323
What are you doing?

393
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,978
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

394
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:11,733
Come on!

395
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,027
Dad, don't.

396
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,155
I have tried ten years
of love and understanding.

397
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,281
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

398
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:25,453
I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

399
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,188
- No. It's on-going.
- Daddy.

400
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,875
It's illegal activity.
I'd like to talk to somebody.

401
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,753
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

402
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,279
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

403
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,936
- I want you in rehab.
- Okay. I'll go first thing tomorrow.

404
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:40,926
Not tomorrow. Today.

405
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,036
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

406
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:46,562
The last time I went to rehab,
all my houseplants died

407
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:48,935
because you didn't water them, so...

408
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,314
Please?

409
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:55,236
I'll go.

410
00:28:58,912 --> 00:28:59,862
Tomorrow.

411
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:08,079
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

412
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
Tomorrow.

413
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:34,964
You meant all that?

414
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:38,427
I don't know.

415
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:41,895
I just think if we had enough money,

416
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,188
nobody could make us do anything.

417
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,610
Just let it ring.

418
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:18,905
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

419
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,429
It's okay, Holly.

420
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,538
Good luck with that. But I'm sure
he'd be glad to, write some...

421
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:35,326
Actually, here he is right now.
So hold on a second.

422
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,502
- What?
- It's one of your...

423
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:42,438
one of your old students.
He wants a letter of recommendation.

424
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:49,576
Honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

425
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:52,192
This is Walter White.

426
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,879
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling...

427
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:02,049
It's Jane.

428
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,361
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

429
00:31:04,668 --> 00:31:06,518
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

430
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,246
Of course.
It really has been a long time.

431
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,828
Get somewhere you can talk.

432
00:31:13,134 --> 00:31:14,134
Sure. Yes.

433
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:17,462
I am looking into that as we speak.

434
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,714
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

435
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:26,773
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

436
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:28,616
No more, no less.

437
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,336
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

438
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:31,931
480,000.

439
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:37,663
He told you about the money.

440
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:39,388
<i>He told me everything.</i>

441
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:46,304
So, what is this?

442
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:50,961
Some kind of blackmail or something?

443
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:54,620
This is me telling you to do right by
Jesse and bring him what you owe him.

444
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:56,466
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

445
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:59,477
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

446
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:01,393
Well, I call it blackmail.

447
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,500
Dialing my number.
Talking to my wife.

448
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,884
<i>And what's your end of this?
How much heroin</i>

449
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,252
does a half a million dollars buy?

450
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:13,711
For your information,

451
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:17,601
<i>I am holding Jesse's money for him,
he will receive every last dollar of it.</i>

452
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:19,243
He will... not you...

453
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,331
at a time when I see fit.

454
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:23,774
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

455
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:26,694
<i>Now, you tell him,
if he gets clean...</i>

456
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,864
- If you both get clean...
- <i> You know what?</i>

457
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,491
I take that back. This is blackmail.
Because what I know about you...

458
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,064
<i>High school teacher turned drug dealer
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>

459
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,142
<i>that'd make one hell of a story.</i>

460
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,665
<i>National news, I'll bet.</i>

461
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:43,011
Do right by Jesse tonight

462
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:45,286
or I will burn you to the ground.

463
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:54,680
Shit.

464
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:59,226
He's a high school teacher.
What's he gonna do? Give you a B-minus?

465
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,794
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

466
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:07,241
You wouldn't really
go to the cops, would you?

467
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:10,237
We won't have to.
He'll pay.

468
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:13,098
What if he doesn't?

469
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:14,873
Jesse, it's your money.

470
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:17,011
You're in the right here.
He's in the wrong.

471
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:19,016
He's not stupid.
He'll pay.

472
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:25,505
What is it, really?

473
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:28,464
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

474
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,239
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

475
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:37,279
It's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

476
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:40,368
And by extension, neither are you.

477
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,340
I mean, he's my partner.

478
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:53,535
I'm your partner.

479
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:13,363
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

480
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:29,432
<i>If that mockingbird won't sing</i>

481
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:33,203
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring</i>

482
00:34:33,901 --> 00:34:37,217
<i>If that diamond ring turns brass</i>

483
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:41,154
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass</i>

484
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,199
<i>So hush, little baby Don't you cry</i>

485
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:49,314
<i>Daddy loves you and so do I</i>

486
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:08,718
She's finally asleep.

487
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:16,494
What are you doing?
Learning about elephants?

488
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:31,376
Honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

489
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,840
Not you.

490
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,143
Nice job wearing the pants.

491
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,402
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

492
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:39,539
I guess you don't.

493
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,976
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

494
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:50,813
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

495
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,878
You are making a mistake.

496
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:12,145
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

497
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,613
This is freedom.

498
00:37:14,256 --> 00:37:17,091
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

499
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:18,786
"I can be anybody."

500
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:21,335
What do you want to be?

501
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,575
Where do you want to go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

502
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:28,142
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

503
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,217
Right on.

504
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,740
New Zealand. That's where
they made <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

505
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:35,544
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

506
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:38,692
Right? Like, you can paint
the local castles and shit

507
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:40,757
And I can be a bush pilot.

508
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,506
New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

509
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:47,528
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

510
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,006
But first we gotta get clean.

511
00:37:57,131 --> 00:37:59,178
And not because
anybody's telling us to.

512
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:01,053
We do this for us, right?

513
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:03,127
Absolutely.

514
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:04,982
- For us.
- All this here...

515
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:07,216
We're not gonna just shoot
this up our arms.

516
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:08,462
We're not.

517
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:09,614
Hell, no.

518
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,364
We're better than that.

519
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,839
We're way better than that.
I say...

520
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:17,836
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

521
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,755
We can do that.

522
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,056
Definitely.

523
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:30,893
Excuse me.

524
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:41,537
What can I get you?

525
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:45,403
Give me a Fat Tire draft, please.

526
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,029
Damn it.

527
00:38:56,558 --> 00:38:57,608
Hey, honey.

528
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,911
No. I don't know what to tell you.

529
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:05,253
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

530
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:09,442
Do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

531
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:12,403
What if we went up
a size and just kind of...

532
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:15,207
All right.
No, I understand.

533
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:18,335
All right. I'll just...
I'll just keep looking.

534
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:21,505
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

535
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:31,633
Well played.

536
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,735
They found water on Mars.

537
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:46,958
They have indeed.

538
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:49,404
Don't exactly know what to do
with that information,

539
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,555
but God bless 'em, they found it.

540
00:39:56,015 --> 00:39:57,218
Actually, they

541
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:01,057
theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen

542
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:05,086
and process that into providing
fuel for man's space flights.

543
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,188
Ostensibly turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

544
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,366
So, it's a...

545
00:40:14,154 --> 00:40:15,996
We live in an amazing time.

546
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,928
To water on Mars.

547
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:21,543
To water on Mars.

548
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:26,196
So, what'd you have?

549
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,421
Girl or boy?

550
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:30,346
A little girl.

551
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:31,856
That's nice.

552
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,563
Congratulations.

553
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,582
I have a daughter.

554
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,834
How old?

555
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,528
Old enough to know better.

556
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,081
27 next month.

557
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:46,759
You have other kids?

558
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:48,208
Just the one.

559
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,860
I've got a 16-year-old boy.

560
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,841
Well, he's almost 16.

561
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:57,593
There's a spread.

562
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:03,837
But he helps out, though. He's even
changing some diapers now, so...

563
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,346
It's more than I managed
to do when I was his age.

564
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:10,812
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

565
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:13,860
Maybe so.

566
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,725
So, any advice?

567
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:20,310
Having a daughter.

568
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,611
Any advice?

569
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,116
Not really.

570
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,646
Just love them.

571
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:26,882
Just...

572
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:29,246
I mean, they...

573
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:31,189
they are who they are.

574
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:36,895
I've got this...

575
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:39,022
nephew.

576
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:45,467
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

577
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:49,464
But you can't infantilize them,

578
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:51,839
you can't live their life for them.

579
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:54,845
But still, I mean, there is

580
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:56,985
that frustration.

581
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:01,244
God, that frustration
that goes along with,

582
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:06,064
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

583
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,117
But of course, they don't.

584
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,985
What do you do with
someone like that?

585
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:16,705
Family.

586
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:22,939
Family.

587
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,490
You can't give up on them.
Never.

588
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:29,172
I mean, what else is there?

589
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,277
It's me!

590
00:43:26,182 --> 00:43:27,682
I just want to talk.

591
00:44:35,378 --> 00:44:36,256
Wake up.

592
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:38,544
Wake up.

9999
