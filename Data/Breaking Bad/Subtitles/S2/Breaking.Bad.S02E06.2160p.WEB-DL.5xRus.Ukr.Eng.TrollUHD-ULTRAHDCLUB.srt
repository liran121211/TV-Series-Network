1
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:40,191
- Yo.
- Yo.

2
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,651
What up?

3
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:42,986
Damn, bitch.

4
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:51,619
- You got something for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,752
- Is this a five or an S?
- Five, yo.

6
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,838
No, wait. S.

7
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:05,925
- No, no. Yeah, five.
- Yeah?

8
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:11,097
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:12,265
Hey, man.

10
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:15,602
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:18,563
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,273
Hey.

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,191
So they got names?

14
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:26,654
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

15
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,740
Him, they call Spooge.

16
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:34,162
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

17
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,372
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked

18
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,458
by a guy named Spooge?

19
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,293
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,088
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,007
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

22
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:49,385
- Did I say that?
- Because I'll go do it myself.

23
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,806
- It's just I'm on probation and all.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,684
So you gonna do it?

25
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,187
Yeah.

26
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,648
Good. Right on.

27
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:08,071
Because these two, they need to get got.

28
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:41,456
{\an8}Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

29
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,541
{\an8}Where's my...?

30
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:48,588
{\an8}Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

31
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,924
{\an8}Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

32
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,718
{\an8}Where's my money?

33
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,345
{\an8}Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

34
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,681
{\an8}Come on.

35
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,521
{\an8}I will mess you up.

36
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:08,691
{\an8}That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:11,444
Your funeral, jack.

38
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:17,450
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:20,453
{\an8}Yeah, <i>mucho loco.</i>

40
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,790
{\an8}Do not test me.

41
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:35,927
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

42
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:38,888
{\an8}Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,391
{\an8}Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:45,186
{\an8}Looks like it's gonna be a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:48,439
{\an8}Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:52,777
{\an8}- You have a great day.
- Right on. You too.

47
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,462
God. Shit.

48
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,665
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,504
Hello?

50
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:54,857
<i>Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery</i>

51
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:57,318
<i>tonight in the steel knockout.</i>

52
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,446
<i>Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

53
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:02,990
{\an8}<i>That's 15 easy installments.</i>

54
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,202
{\an8}<i>And, folks, the knockout is only...</i>

55
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,163
{\an8}Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,958
{\an8}<i>Now, Terry put this one together...</i>

57
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,752
{\an8}Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,879
{\an8}<i>... and I'm here to tell you...</i>

59
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:22,260
{\an8}<i>Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...</i>

60
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,303
<i>Already done it.</i>

61
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,639
<i>Tonight, folks...</i>

62
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:36,983
<i>Do you realize how long it's been</i>

63
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:41,779
<i>since we've offered this sword
in this set?</i>

64
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:48,327
{\an8}<i>Much less the wakizashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.</i>

65
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:50,204
<i>It's no wonder...</i>

66
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:53,499
<i>It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now...</i>

67
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,834
What's your name?

68
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:58,337
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm...</i>

69
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:02,008
My name's Diesel.

70
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,176
<i>...eleven, 12, 13...</i>

71
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,514
{\an8}<i>... sixteen, 17, 18, 19...</i>

72
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:11,267
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:15,104
Like, I don't know, <i>Mister Rogers'?</i>

74
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:19,483
<i>Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.</i>

75
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,653
<i>Folks, custom pieces...</i>

76
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:32,288
<i>Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess,</i>

77
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,749
<i>but there's a reason for that.</i>

78
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:40,212
<i>Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.</i>

79
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,050
<i>These knives possess edges like...</i>

80
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,146
So when are your folks coming home?

81
00:08:57,313 --> 00:09:01,734
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:06,572
I'm hungry.

83
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,746
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

84
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:16,749
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

85
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:21,921
<i>We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...</i>

86
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:25,257
<i>Okay, that's all I officially remembered.
Good luck.</i>

87
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,302
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

88
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,350
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz</i>

89
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,602
<i>calling to say hello.</i>

90
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,969
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both</i>

91
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,481
<i>hoping everything's well.</i>

92
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,776
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected,</i>

93
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,405
<i>so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

94
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:49,782
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

95
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:54,620
- Hello?
<i>- Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

96
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:58,290
<i>This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

97
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,626
No. No, not at all.

98
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:03,295
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:04,880
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

100
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:09,593
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work,

101
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,139
<i>and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

102
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,224
And I really hope we didn't worry you.

103
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:18,394
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:19,979
That's wonderful.

105
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:25,025
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this,

106
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,155
and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:31,615
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant</i>

108
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:35,494
about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

109
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:38,761
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just...

110
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:44,128
- What? What is it?
<i>- I can't</i>

111
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:47,840
begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:52,303
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

113
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,140
It saved us.

114
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:01,228
I don't know if I...

115
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,195
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,609
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:10,279
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:13,157
So I just

119
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:17,620
finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,626
<i>Anyway...</i>

121
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,253
End of speech.

122
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,131
So I do... I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:34,220
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:39,266
- How about this afternoon?
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

125
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:45,564
Monoalkenes, diolefins

126
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:49,360
trienes, polyenes.

127
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:53,030
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,282
But when you start to feel overwhelmed,

129
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,743
and you will

130
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,081
just keep in mind that one element

131
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,541
carbon.

132
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,254
Carbon is at the center of it all.

133
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,216
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,927
Nowhere that we know of in the universe.

135
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:22,059
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

136
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:24,895
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:30,067
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
No. Okay.

139
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,907
I like to think of it...

140
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:41,412
I like to think that the diamond,

141
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,747
and the woman who wears it on her finger

142
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,084
are both formed from the same stuff.

143
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:53,257
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,802
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,723
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:06,020
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:11,150
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process,

148
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,777
for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,155
I mean, this is way back in the 50s.

150
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:21,535
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling

151
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:26,457
electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

152
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:30,252
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,424
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:42,848
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,354
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,492
Anyway...

157
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,829
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper

158
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,646
paid to a carbon-based man,

159
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:13,462
for something he made out of carbon.

160
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,281
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

161
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,220
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:25,933
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,395
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

164
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,897
That's a great look for you.

165
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:39,321
- But you're feeling good?
- Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:41,699
It's...

167
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,367
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:48,455
I'm glad to...
You know, I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,666
We're happy too.

170
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:54,545
And I just...

171
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,718
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

172
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:07,766
Is everything okay?

173
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:14,148
Just please feel comfortable coming to me

174
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:19,111
with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

175
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,239
You know, completely confidential.

176
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:24,366
Okay?

177
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,623
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

178
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,377
Oh, man.

179
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,808
Let me see it.

180
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,897
- Dad, let me see it.
- Don't worry about it.

181
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:01,445
Hey, let's go.

182
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:37,523
<i>Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...</i>

183
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:40,859
Hey.

184
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:44,530
Peekaboo.

185
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,536
No?

186
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,124
Peekaboo.

187
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,548
Oh, man.

188
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,719
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:12,808
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,450
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching

191
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,481
I gave you advice, take it or leave it.

192
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:27,698
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,671
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

194
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,299
- You shut up, you...
- You shut up!

195
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,218
- You're the one who dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

196
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:49,428
I didn't drop.

197
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,930
- Shit! You dropped it.
- Shut the hell up about it.

198
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:53,432
- You shut up!
- You shut up.

199
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,104
Get up.

200
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,776
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:28,050
- You know who might have done it?
- I have an idea.

202
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,430
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:38,101
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads

204
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:43,482
we tie them up, drive them way
out into the desert, strip them naked

205
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:49,071
then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,741
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,829
You with me?

208
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,960
Scorpions?

209
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:08,131
Scorpions are good.

210
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,425
Yeah.

211
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:19,309
Nice.

212
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:36,994
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

213
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,788
Who is this?

214
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,685
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:04,021
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

216
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,606
- Mom.
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

217
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:09,400
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

218
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:12,487
- Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
- Nice to meet you too.

219
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:13,864
Oh, Walt.

220
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,492
Look who's here.

221
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:18,702
- Gretchen.
- Hi.

222
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,955
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

223
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,708
Look at you. You're looking good.

224
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,925
Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.

225
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:28,628
I know it was for me.

226
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,424
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

227
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:34,009
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

228
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,429
- For good luck, right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

229
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,346
- We could use some of that.
- Yeah.

230
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:43,727
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:49,733
- It was a really good thing.
- You're very welcome.

232
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,070
- We're gonna find a way to repay you.
- No, no, no.

233
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,406
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:00,744
You know, I hate to say it,

235
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:04,081
but I really need to get going.

236
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:05,916
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,251
- You can't stay for dinner?
- I wish I could,

238
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:11,713
but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

239
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,923
Okay. Okay.

240
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,928
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

241
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:19,429
Yeah, hopefully.

242
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:22,474
Gretchen, your purse.

243
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,561
Well, good to see you.

244
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:31,525
And you and Elliott
are welcome any time. Really.

245
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:36,029
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

246
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:38,365
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

247
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:42,494
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

248
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:46,581
- Okay. Bye now.
- Drive safely.

249
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,294
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

250
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,255
I'll be right back.

251
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,760
Gretchen.

252
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,762
Hey.

253
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:08,311
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

254
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,355
What did you...?

255
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,734
We need to talk.

256
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:18,989
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

257
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:23,243
Please. Please.

258
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:42,095
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

259
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:46,433
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

260
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,978
- I just wanna say, man...
- What? What do you wanna say?

261
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:51,695
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:55,275
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,777
- Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
- Shut up!

264
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,779
Jesus.

265
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:03,325
- Serious, I might have a concussion.
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

266
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:05,491
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

267
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,204
Shut up.

268
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:10,540
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:13,126
Turn them out, everything on the table.

270
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,544
Do it!

271
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,051
All right, turn around.

272
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,510
Turn around.

273
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,305
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

274
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,064
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,620
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any...

276
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,414
- We shot it all.
- Yeah?

277
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,918
- Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
- Yeah.

278
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,253
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,257
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now,

280
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:05,428
or I grab a flashlight and some pliers
and go exploring.

281
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:07,555
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,769
There you go.

283
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,983
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:22,278
All right, so, what, you hold the crystal
and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:23,446
Division of labor.

286
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:28,827
All right, there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,121
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:33,748
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:35,834
- You shut up.
- You shut up, skank.

290
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,878
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:42,757
This really isn't getting any better, man.
It's turning cranial.

292
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:46,469
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:49,848
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial,

294
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:52,851
for being such a pussy.

295
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:58,815
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:24:58,982 --> 00:25:02,902
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,868
All right.

298
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:13,496
You two are never getting high again.

299
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:16,291
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,169
Not another needle, not another ball

301
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:23,423
not one toke, not till I get what's mine.

302
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,677
Yeah, we got you covered, man, sure.

303
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,056
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,848
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,477
- Where?
- Backyard.

306
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:38,396
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Backyard. Go check it out.

307
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,691
- Hurting. Painful.
- Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:45,612
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,823
Hey, don't move.

310
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:53,870
Come on.

311
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:57,540
See?

312
00:25:57,707 --> 00:26:01,002
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,047
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,049
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:09,219
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:11,721
Get high.

317
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,602
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:20,021
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,732
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:24,549
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

321
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,060
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

322
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,697
<i>In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

323
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,201
<i>What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumbass?</i>

324
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,578
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

325
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,123
<i>All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

326
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,583
<i>- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?</i>

327
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,463
<i>- For real?
- I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

328
00:26:54,222 --> 00:26:56,224
Oh, my God.

329
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:00,311
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:04,065
- It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
- You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,692
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,987
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:11,156
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,158
At least I got persistence.

335
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:16,244
The law of averages, lucky number seven.

336
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:20,999
- Don't listen to that skank.
- Stop calling me that.

337
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,293
I ain't no skank!

338
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,837
- Skank, skank, skank...
- Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,547
Sit, sit.

340
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:31,843
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:34,637
Now chill.

342
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,141
You, get that thing open.

343
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:42,520
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:48,985
Where's the kid?

345
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:52,030
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:55,200
What are you asking me for?

347
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:15,053
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,620
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:22,584
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:27,440
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:30,193
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,154
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:34,739
Are you serious?

354
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:38,156
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:39,661
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, Diesel

356
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:42,977
this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

357
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:46,334
Get out of the way.

358
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,170
Get out of the way!

359
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,396
So you didn't tell anyone.

360
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:09,983
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

361
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:14,445
- Well, what does that mean?
- That means exactly what it means.

362
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:17,949
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:23,955
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:25,290
All right.

365
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:30,795
First let me say,
I very much regret involving you in this.

366
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:32,964
This was...

367
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:37,010
This entire thing was unfortunate.

368
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,470
Unfortunate?

369
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:44,017
And I apologize deeply.

370
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,144
Thank you.

371
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:50,982
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:56,571
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:00,825
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:06,247
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it

375
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:07,832
how are you paying for it?

376
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:12,795
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

377
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:16,257
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:19,093
You tell your wife and son

379
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,512
that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,349
Why are you doing this?

381
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,020
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:32,523
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes

383
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:34,358
thanking me for saving your life.

384
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:38,571
- Why would you do that to her?
- As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:43,493
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

386
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,702
All right?

387
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:47,538
I will explain the whole thing to them.

388
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:50,208
And while you're at it, explain it to me.

389
00:30:53,086 --> 00:30:55,463
I don't owe you an explanation.

390
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,300
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologized.

391
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:02,303
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

392
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,473
There. I've apologized twice now.

393
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,559
I'm humbly sorry.

394
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,228
Three times.

395
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:12,397
Let me just get this straight.

396
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:14,982
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment

397
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,651
no strings attached.

398
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:19,070
An offer which still stands, by the way.

399
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,948
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever,

400
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:26,577
and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

401
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:28,704
Without our knowledge, against our will

402
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:30,832
you involve us in your lie.

403
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:36,921
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:42,885
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:47,765
What happened to you?

406
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,770
Really, Walt.

407
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,772
What happened?

408
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:57,775
Because this isn't you.

409
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:04,699
What would you know about me, Gretchen?

410
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:09,328
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

411
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,873
That I should go begging
for your charity?

412
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,918
And you waving your checkbook around

413
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:19,672
like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget

414
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,039
how you and Elliott...

415
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:24,302
How you and Elliott cut me out?

416
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:26,304
What? That can't be how you see it.

417
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:30,057
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

418
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:32,101
That cannot be how you see it.

419
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:34,311
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left...

420
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:36,313
You are always the picture of innocence.

421
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,983
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

422
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,737
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

423
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:44,905
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

424
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:48,159
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room,

425
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:50,953
and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

426
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,831
What? Did I dream all that?

427
00:32:53,998 --> 00:32:56,542
That's your excuse

428
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,545
to build your little empire on my work?

429
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:02,006
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

430
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:05,259
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

431
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:08,179
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

432
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,187
I don't even know what to say to you.

433
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:19,941
I don't even know where to begin.

434
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:30,576
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,706
Fuck you.

436
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:13,244
Hey.

437
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:19,834
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:35,182
Hey.

439
00:34:56,787 --> 00:34:59,707
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,650
No, what are you doing?

441
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:07,006
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,883
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,637
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,764
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:19,727
Bedtime.

446
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:26,025
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,658
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:35,743
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,621
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:41,457
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:14,490
Oh, hey.

452
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:17,118
Should I ask where you've been?

453
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,954
Never mind.

454
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:23,165
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,085
Skyler.

456
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:35,636
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:47,732
Walt.

458
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,901
We need to talk.

459
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,540
Just say it.

460
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,219
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:31,942
What did she say exactly?

462
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:39,283
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,329
She said something like:

464
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:48,751
"I'm sorry to have to do this,

465
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:53,547
but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:56,842
I wish you the very best."

467
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,888
And that was it.

468
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,145
Yeah.

469
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:13,067
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,277
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,905
I was so stunned, but...

472
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:23,035
I called her back,
and she didn't pick up.

473
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:34,255
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:42,012
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon,

475
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,850
and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave,

476
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,353
and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:55,151
Walt.

478
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:57,862
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:05,202
Where were you tonight?

480
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:08,664
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:12,585
I was with Gretchen.

482
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:16,046
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:21,802
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

484
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:24,889
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:28,225
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing,

486
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:30,311
and beating around the bush...

487
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:34,398
Okay, what...? Tell us what?

488
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,902
Well...

489
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:40,912
There was a lot of

490
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:44,575
business phraseology being tossed around.

491
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:50,331
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"

492
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:52,582
"quarterly decline," yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:57,046
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

494
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:02,509
They're broke.

495
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,096
- You are kidding me.
- No.

496
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:09,683
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,521
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

498
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:17,399
Well, apparently, Gray Matter

499
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:21,445
is no more immune than anyone else.

500
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,490
That is...

501
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,369
Jesus, that's...

502
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:33,123
Yeah.

503
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:49,473
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,645
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,899
Listen.

506
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:01,676
Not to sound selfish,

507
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:05,823
but as far as we go

508
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,493
we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:16,458
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:18,168
Hey.

511
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:26,969
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

512
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:29,138
Okay.

513
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:41,734
And yet

514
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:46,071
she still drives a Bentley.

515
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:55,372
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:10,721
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:14,641
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:17,727
You're designing a safe,
where you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:19,313
Nowhere.

520
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,441
I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,735
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:27,071
You put your weak spot on the bottom.

523
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:31,992
Oh, baby, that H is bringing me down.

524
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,495
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:37,706
I need to... I need to even out.

526
00:42:37,873 --> 00:42:41,209
- Let me get a hit of that crystal.
- Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:42,628
Come on, baby.

528
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:45,839
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:49,968
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,012
I ain't no skank.

531
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:56,600
I would appreciate an apology.

532
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,271
What?

533
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:04,274
I am trying to take the high road here.

534
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:05,818
Are you gonna do right?

535
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:07,111
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:43:07,277 --> 00:43:10,823
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,785
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole,

538
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:18,497
and assist me and shut up.

539
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,128
I ain't no skank.

540
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:26,296
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

541
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,967
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

542
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:31,969
You listening to me, skank?

543
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:33,846
You hear me, skank?

544
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:38,142
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

545
00:43:38,308 --> 00:43:42,229
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

546
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:45,607
I ain't no skank.

547
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:48,402
No, no, no. Don't. No.

548
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:07,504
I ain't no skank.

549
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:08,565
<i>911.</i>

550
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:24,331
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

551
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:27,751
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:30,753
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:33,137
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:36,760
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

555
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,108
Here you go.

556
00:45:51,275 --> 00:45:55,946
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

557
00:45:56,113 --> 00:45:59,783
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

558
00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:04,788
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

559
00:46:04,955 --> 00:46:07,916
You stay right here. Okay?

560
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:18,427
You have a good rest of your life, kid.
