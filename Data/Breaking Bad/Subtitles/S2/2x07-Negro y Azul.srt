00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,311
<i>The city's called Duke</i>
<i>The state's called New Mexico</i>

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,274
<i>Among the gangsters</i>
<i>The gringos' fame is inflated</i>

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,352
<i>'Cause of the new drug they created</i>

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,918
<i>They say the colour is blue</i>
<i>And the quality pure</i>

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,674
<i>This potent drug's runnin'</i>
<i>Through the city</i>

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,792
<i>And no one could stop it</i>
<i>If they wanted to</i>

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,110
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because</i>
<i>They weren't getting respect</i>

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,836
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"</i>
<i>Who owns the market now</i>

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,319
<i>No one knows the man since</i>
<i>They've never seen his face</i>

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,390
<i>The cartel's 'bout respect</i>
<i>And they ain't forgiving</i>

11
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,834
<i>But that homey's dead</i>
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,154
<i>Heisenberg's fame has got</i>
<i>Down to Michoacan</i>

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,593
<i>From way far away</i>
<i>They want to taste that meth</i>

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,195
<i>That blue stuff has crossed the border</i>

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,431
<i>Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name</i>

16
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,432
<i>Looks just like Mexico</i>
<i>In all the drugs it's hiding</i>

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,557
<i>Except there's a gringo boss</i>
<i>And he's known as "Heisenberg"</i>

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,359
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because</i>
<i>They weren't getting respect</i>

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,996
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"</i>
<i>Who owns the market now</i>

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,319
<i>No one knows the man since</i>
<i>They've never seen his face</i>

21
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,509
<i>The fury of the cartel</i>
<i>Ain't no one escaped it yet</i>

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,754
<i>But that homey's dead</i>

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,111
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

24
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,431
What the hell are they thinking?

25
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,029
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

26
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,350
Politics, man. Politics.

27
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,037
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

28
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,310
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.
