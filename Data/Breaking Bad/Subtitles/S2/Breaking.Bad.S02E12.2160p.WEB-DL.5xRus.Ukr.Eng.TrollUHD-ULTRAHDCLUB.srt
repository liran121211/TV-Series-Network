1
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:38,312
Skyler, I'm so...

2
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,316
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

3
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:47,071
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:49,532
Is she beautiful?

5
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:57,331
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

6
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,125
Some accident up ahead.

7
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,253
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,425
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

9
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,510
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,360
Excuse me. Skyler White?

11
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,029
- 307.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:42,835
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...

13
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,712
Are you okay?

14
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:50,217
Meet your daughter.

15
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,732
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

16
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,901
Congratulations, Walt.

17
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,907
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

18
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:15,701
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:20,456
I mean, this little bundle of joy of ours
was practically on rails.

20
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,291
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over,

21
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,252
and deliver her himself.

22
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:31,425
Well, that...
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

23
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:33,511
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:36,055
No problem at all.

25
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,141
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can...

26
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,228
You three can be alone, okay?

27
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,064
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

28
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:48,943
- I really can't begin to thank you.
- Don't think anything of it.

29
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,111
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

30
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:52,778
- Thank you.
- She's beautiful.

31
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,448
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

32
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:55,908
Okay. Take care.

33
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,117
Bye.

34
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,462
Are you okay?

35
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,589
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is okay.

36
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,134
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,307
- Where's everyone else?
- Downstairs.

38
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,267
Hank and Marie took Junior for dinner.

39
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:26,605
He has been such a trooper.
He even changed his first diaper.

40
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,732
- No.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,319
Did he?

42
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,241
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:39,785
- Anything at all?
- Actually, yes.

44
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,580
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

45
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:45,582
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

46
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,503
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

47
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,047
Doing it natural instead.

48
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,508
It just couldn't have gone any better.

49
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,218
Good.

50
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:03,684
Let me go get your things.

51
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:08,272
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

52
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,024
- I'll spend the night.
- Okay.

53
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,370
{\an8}Dad.

54
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:49,205
I was in the shower, hey.

55
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,292
I overslept.

56
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,255
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

57
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:58,006
Yeah.

58
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:05,389
{\an8}Baby, I gotta go.

59
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:08,892
{\an8}Okay.

60
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,241
{\an8}Somebody broke in.

61
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,035
{\an8}Okay.

62
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,013
Oh, no. No, no, no!

63
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,557
Come on.

64
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,642
Damn.

65
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,063
{\an8}Oh, God.

66
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,358
{\an8}Oh, Christ.

67
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,656
{\an8}This week was tough.

68
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,282
{\an8}Toughest yet.

69
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,661
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

70
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,247
{\an8}- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

71
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,458
{\an8}Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,584
I was scared shitless I wouldn't make it.

73
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,168
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:20,672
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,841
I know my boss was pissed.

76
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:26,053
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,520
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,588
All it would take is one friend,

79
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:32,392
and I'd be out ripping and running again.

80
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,728
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:37,898
{\an8}I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,589
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:05,884
- You getting enough sleep?
- Actually, no.

84
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,596
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:12,266
- Yeah?
- A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:15,060
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,730
{\an8}I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,024
{\an8}"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:24,111
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:28,532
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,201
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:33,318
You need to avoid those type of people.

93
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:36,456
I know and I do.

94
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,002
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,963
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,049
{\an8}Thank you.

97
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:52,890
{\an8}So how's your job?

98
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:54,975
{\an8}Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

99
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,477
Doing backup training on my days off.

100
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:01,481
{\an8}God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

101
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:09,072
{\an8}You seeing anyone?

102
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,743
No.

103
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,119
You?

104
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,914
What about that guy next door?

105
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,457
What do you mean?

106
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,001
Well, he seemed to have some expectation

107
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,794
{\an8}of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,088
{\an8}He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:26,924
Yeah.

110
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:28,467
Dad, he's our tenant.

111
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:30,510
End of story.

112
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:32,638
Why would I get involved with a tenant?

113
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:35,766
Okay.

114
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,518
There you go.

115
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:49,863
Oh, yes.

116
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,157
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

117
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,868
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

118
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,454
Yeah. And why not?

119
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,414
Good stock.

120
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,877
I'll get it.

121
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:05,379
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:08,382
Hello. Hello?

123
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:11,760
Nobody's there.

124
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,553
Oh, well.

125
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,349
Beat you.

126
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:19,893
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

127
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,561
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

128
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:23,313
Just Carmen.

129
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,150
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

130
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,736
<i>Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,322
Well, Holly.

132
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,366
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

133
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,119
Everybody is doing just fine.

134
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:40,135
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

135
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,416
I am trying to tell you, man.

136
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:45,544
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

137
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,212
- <i>I got robbed.</i>
- What?

138
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,925
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

139
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:53,844
All of it.

140
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:58,056
You get me, Mr. White?

141
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,350
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>

142
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,769
They knew exactly where to look.

143
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,820
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

144
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,109
<i>Mr. White.</i>

145
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,738
God!

146
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:15,407
Oh, no.

147
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:21,621
Okay. Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:30,922
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

149
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,175
All right. I just had to get a beer.

150
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:34,926
Finally.

151
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,720
All right, guys. Here we go.

152
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:40,724
We got mild, medium and <i>muy caliente</i>.

153
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,143
{\an8}I got dibs on the breast.

154
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,480
{\an8}- Los Pollos Hermanos?
- Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

155
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:49,983
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

156
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,235
That baby is hungry.

157
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:53,820
Give me that baby.

158
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,156
Oh, sweetie, yes.

159
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,023
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

160
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,908
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

161
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:04,331
- Not at the table. We're eating.
- Hank, it's only a breast.

162
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,626
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- Oh, you are so provincial.

163
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,295
Hank, remember the day

164
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:12,880
when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

165
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,007
Yeah.

166
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,759
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

167
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:20,639
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was thinking
more of an alarm system.

168
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,810
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would...

169
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,229
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

170
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:28,438
Oh, nice.

171
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:31,483
- Wow, that sounds expensive.
- Well, yeah.

172
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,363
- But for the baby, I mean...
- Well, why don't...

173
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:39,615
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

174
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,160
- Absolutely.
- No, no. Thank you.

175
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,871
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

176
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,748
We'll take care of it.

177
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:48,834
"Back at work soon"?

178
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,586
Since you're scheduled for surgery

179
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:56,049
I just thought it might be a good idea
to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:02,764
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:07,060
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

182
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:12,315
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

183
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:16,194
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

184
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,404
I wish.

185
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,621
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

186
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,410
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,872
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:36,173
I'll get her.

189
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,425
I'll get her.

190
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,270
Yes. Good girl.

191
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,814
That's a good girl.

192
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:55,275
My little girl, huh?

193
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,706
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,585
Come here.

195
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,588
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:22,636
Yeah.

197
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:30,810
Hey.

198
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:34,648
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

199
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,652
Let me show you.

200
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,696
Here. Come here.

201
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:45,784
Wanna see?

202
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:03,051
That's right. Daddy did that.

203
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:11,393
Daddy did that for you.

204
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:25,380
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,925
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,718
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:32,845
- Get out.
- No. You took the stash.

208
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,097
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

209
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,184
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,151
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something,

211
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:45,900
- and you were the one who took it!
- Shut up.

212
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,736
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:55,576
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:59,539
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:02,333
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,670
What was that, heroin?

217
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:08,714
Jesus.

218
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,675
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off...

219
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,095
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

220
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,389
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

221
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:20,059
I just managed to pull it off by
the skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:24,272
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:27,984
Son of a bitch.

224
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:32,196
How much?

225
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:37,160
- How much what?
- How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,748
One-point-two million.

227
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,376
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,378
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:50,131
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:51,841
All right.

231
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:54,010
So where's my money?

232
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:56,721
What?

233
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:00,808
You are joking, right?

234
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,896
If I gave you that money

235
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:07,273
you would be dead inside of a week.

236
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,069
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

237
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,656
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

238
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:17,783
And the... And the meth.

239
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:21,329
You know, I could take it or leave it.

240
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:24,123
I'm clean, Mr. White.

241
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,917
For real.

242
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:38,804
Prove it.

243
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:40,348
Pee in that.

244
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:43,392
- How gay are you, seriously?
- Pee in it.

245
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,937
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

246
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:49,482
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

247
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:51,984
No, huh?

248
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:55,727
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend

249
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,866
on the kindness of strangers to get high.

250
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,869
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

251
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:31,232
Not on her tummy, Walt.

252
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,193
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

253
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,029
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

254
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:38,990
- Yeah.
- Right there.

255
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,701
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit up

256
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:46,664
I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

257
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,959
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

258
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,587
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, yeah?

259
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:55,089
Well, I think a towel will do.

260
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,678
Skyler, what is it?

261
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:05,933
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

262
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,359
- I told you it's not ready yet.
- Honey, just show it to them.

263
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:37,340
My God, son. That's wonderful.

264
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:38,966
Flynn.

265
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,552
This is beautiful.

266
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:45,139
SaveWalterWhite.com.

267
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,559
Well, I, for one, am telling everybody.

268
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:54,065
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

269
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:56,233
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

270
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,570
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

271
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:03,574
- See.
- But we can't ask for money.

272
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:06,702
Walt.

273
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,872
Okay.

274
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:14,126
I appreciate it. I really do.

275
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,837
Show me what else you put on.

276
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:22,968
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

277
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,179
- Just let him help.
- Skyler.

278
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:29,266
It's... You can't ask him to take it down.

279
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:33,396
- It'll crush him.
- Skyler, it's charity.

280
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:40,695
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

281
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,373
This is insane.

282
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,667
I have so much cash on hand

283
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,878
that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

284
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:01,382
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

285
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:04,499
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

286
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,137
I mean, it's...

287
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:07,972
It's insane.

288
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:11,225
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

289
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:13,018
What?

290
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:14,729
Gun molls.

291
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,897
Haven't you ever seen <i>White Heat?</i>

292
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,567
Yeah, I've seen <i>White Heat</i>,

293
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,778
- but I don't see how that pertains.
- Maybe you need a moll

294
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:25,656
more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

295
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,324
- Just...
- What good is money

296
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:30,160
that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest...

297
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:33,831
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

298
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:36,417
Out.

299
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,084
Let's see. What else is there?

300
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,587
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money

301
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:42,465
down by the railroad tracks."

302
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,217
No? No? Works for me.

303
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:47,219
Uncle Murray.

304
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,513
Oh, yeah.

305
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,307
Yeah, "Oh, many is the happy memory"

306
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,434
of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.

307
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:57,229
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago,

308
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:00,649
- "but he kicked it, left me millions."
- No, no.

309
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:06,113
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

310
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,866
No, I earned that money, me.

311
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:11,617
And now my son created his own website

312
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:15,790
SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

313
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:19,668
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

314
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:26,967
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

315
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:30,471
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

316
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:33,808
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

317
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,602
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

318
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,063
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

319
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:42,983
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- I know. I know.

320
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,569
You're thinking that I should be
funneling money

321
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:47,853
into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

322
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,658
I am not going to have
my family think that some

323
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:53,035
mystery benefactor saved us.

324
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:56,205
Not some mystery benefactor, singular.

325
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:58,749
That would raise too many questions.
However...

326
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,001
Stay with me here.

327
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:02,753
...zombies.

328
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:07,758
I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this <i>Rain Man</i>-type.

329
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:11,344
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

330
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:14,473
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

331
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,102
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

332
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,938
This guy can hijack random desktops

333
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:24,817
all around the world, turn them into
zombies that do his bidding.

334
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:29,488
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000

335
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:33,033
little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

336
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,286
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop

337
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:38,747
all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable

338
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:42,877
from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White

339
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:45,212
cancer saint.

340
00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:49,091
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

341
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:57,558
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

342
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,060
Not too much.

343
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,730
I mean, like, who is he, right?

344
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:05,649
I mean, first off, I taught him.

345
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:08,903
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

346
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:21,498
Now the cotton.

347
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:28,421
Needle?

348
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:33,761
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

349
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:38,599
My point exactly.

350
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:51,111
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

351
00:24:55,824 --> 00:24:58,077
How much does he owe you, anyway?

352
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,789
Four hundred and eighty.

353
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:05,334
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

354
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,753
No, no.

355
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,297
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

356
00:25:12,091 --> 00:25:13,300
What?

357
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:16,804
What?

358
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:19,056
Thousand.

359
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:23,059
Not on your back, in case you throw up.

360
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:27,913
On your side. Sleep on your side.

361
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,007
And she's all like:

362
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:41,761
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

363
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:44,639
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

364
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,684
"I'm conversing
about life and death."

365
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:50,603
I mean, this here, what we've been doing

366
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,856
hell, Becky knows.

367
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:00,071
Dad?

368
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:02,449
I overslept. I'm on my way.

369
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:18,298
Dad?

370
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:21,301
Dad, wait.

371
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:23,969
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

372
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:26,306
Dad.

373
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:31,018
Dad, will just wait? Let me...
Just talk to you for one second.

374
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:32,145
No, Dad.

375
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:34,647
Dad, come on.

376
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:39,652
Dad?

377
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:44,157
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

378
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:46,701
- Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
- Son of a bitch.

379
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:51,498
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

380
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:54,542
- Get away from me, man. Back off.
- Jesse.

381
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,859
- Jesse, no!
- Back off!

382
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,713
- Okay, everybody just calm down!
- What's with you, yo?

383
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,299
- Because I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

384
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:04,593
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

385
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:06,179
All right? I got civil rights.

386
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,139
Dad, no! Okay!

387
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:10,850
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

388
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:13,853
I pay my rent.

389
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:18,023
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

390
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:20,610
Look, as it so happens, we were just...

391
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,528
We were just talking about that now.

392
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:24,864
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

393
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,534
- If you would just let me.
- Eighteen months.

394
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,162
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

395
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,541
I backslid, okay?

396
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,501
Like, what?

397
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:38,711
What, you think I'm proud of this?

398
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:40,755
Like I do it on purpose?

399
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:42,382
Lying to me

400
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:45,552
shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

401
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:46,968
It takes one to know one.

402
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:50,055
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

403
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:52,892
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

404
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:55,979
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

405
00:27:56,729 --> 00:28:01,066
Thank you for not being judgmental
24 hours a day.

406
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:05,154
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

407
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:08,241
Okay.

408
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:10,868
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

409
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:12,036
What are you doing?

410
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:14,872
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

411
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,876
- Dad. Dad, no, don't.
- Come on. Come on!

412
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,129
- Dad, no. Don't.
- I have tried 10 years

413
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:22,839
of love and understanding.

414
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:26,175
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

415
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:27,760
Dad, no.

416
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:31,347
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

417
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:34,809
- Dad. Daddy, no.
- No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

418
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:36,852
- I'd like to talk to somebody.
- Daddy.

419
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:39,688
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

420
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,872
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

421
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:44,568
- I want you in rehab.
- I'll go first thing tomorrow.

422
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,404
Not tomorrow. Today.

423
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,866
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

424
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:54,037
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

425
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:59,626
Daddy, please?

426
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:01,044
I'll go.

427
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,796
<i>Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?</i>

428
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,299
Tomorrow.

429
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,842
<i>Hello?</i>

430
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,013
<i>Hello?</i>

431
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:13,973
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

432
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:20,647
Tomorrow.

433
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,000
You meant all that?

434
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:44,379
I don't know.

435
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:48,007
I just think if we had enough money

436
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:51,511
nobody could make us do anything.

437
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,375
Oh, just let it ring.

438
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:25,044
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

439
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,965
It's okay, Holly.

440
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:31,384
It's okay, sweetie.

441
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:33,302
Good luck with that.

442
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:37,056
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some...

443
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:41,978
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

444
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:44,313
- What?
- It's one of your...

445
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,526
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

446
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:52,071
Oh, okay. Thanks.

447
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:55,408
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

448
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:59,829
- This is Walter White.
- <i>Hello, Walter White.</i>

449
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,458
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling...

450
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:08,129
It's Jane.

451
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:10,256
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

452
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:11,799
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

453
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:16,971
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

454
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:18,788
Get somewhere where you can talk.

455
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,603
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

456
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:29,609
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

457
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:32,570
All Jesse wants is what's coming to him.

458
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,280
No more, no less.

459
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:35,948
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

460
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:37,784
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

461
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:45,583
- He told you about the money.
- <i>He told me everything.</i>

462
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:52,799
So, what is this?

463
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,636
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

464
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:58,887
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

465
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,473
Bring him what you owe him.

466
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,099
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

467
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:05,561
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

468
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,230
Well, I call it blackmail.

469
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:11,192
Dialing my number.
Talking to my wife.

470
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:13,402
And what's your end of this?

471
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:16,989
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

472
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,243
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him,

473
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:23,579
<i>and he will receive
every last dollar of it.</i>

474
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:25,164
He will, not you

475
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:26,999
at a time when I see fit.

476
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,669
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

477
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:32,588
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean...</i>

478
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:34,855
- If you both get clean...
- <i>You know what?</i>

479
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,759
I take that back. This is blackmail.

480
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:39,344
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher

481
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:42,181
<i>turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA</i>

482
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:45,518
<i>that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.</i>

483
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:51,482
Do right by Jesse tonight,
or I will burn you to the ground.

484
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:01,941
Shit.

485
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:07,154
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

486
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:09,907
Send you outside to clap the erasers?

487
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:15,871
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

488
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,249
We won't have to. He'll pay.

489
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,834
And what if he doesn't?

490
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,920
Jesse, it's your money.

491
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:27,591
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

492
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:33,931
What is it, really?

493
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:36,517
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

494
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:40,271
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

495
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:45,985
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

496
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:49,446
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

497
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:57,454
I mean, he's my partner.

498
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,418
I'm your partner.

499
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,886
<i>The largest land animal in all the planet</i>

500
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,681
<i>lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society</i>

501
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:17,975
<i>led by the eldest female in the herd.</i>

502
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:22,980
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

503
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:19,286
She is finally asleep.

504
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:26,877
What you doing, learning about elephants?

505
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:41,892
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

506
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,722
Jesse.

507
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,933
Not you.

508
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:38,907
Nice job wearing the pants.

509
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,292
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

510
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,878
I guess you don't.

511
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,425
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

512
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:02,431
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

513
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,600
You are making a mistake.

514
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,382
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

515
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,120
This is freedom.

516
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:28,165
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

517
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,667
I can be anybody."

518
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,336
Who do you wanna be?

519
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:35,672
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

520
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,176
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

521
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,469
Right on.

522
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:43,847
New Zealand. That's where
they made <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

523
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,934
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

524
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,019
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

525
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:52,189
And I can be a bush pilot.

526
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,983
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

527
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,279
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

528
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,205
But first, we gotta get clean.

529
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,422
And not because anybody is telling us to.

530
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:15,504
- We do this for us, right?
- Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

531
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,798
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

532
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:19,925
We're not.

533
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,636
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

534
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,472
We're way better than that. I say...

535
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,518
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

536
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,940
Yeah, we can do that.

537
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,234
Definitely.

538
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,240
Excuse me.

539
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:53,584
What can I get you?

540
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,796
Give me a Fat Tire draft, please.

541
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,554
Damn it.

542
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,100
Hey, honey.

543
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,978
No. I don't know what to tell you.

544
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:17,482
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

545
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:21,403
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

546
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,489
What if we went up a size
and just kind of...

547
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,326
All right, all right. No, I understand.

548
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:30,537
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

549
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:34,416
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

550
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,377
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

551
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:39,212
Thank you.

552
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,465
God.

553
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,676
Well played.

554
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,563
They found water on Mars.

555
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:58,982
They have indeed.

556
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,734
Don't know what to do
with that information,

557
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,321
but, hey, God bless them, they found it.

558
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:08,784
Oh, well, actually

559
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:13,705
they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen,

560
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:18,126
and process that into providing
fuel for man's space flights.

561
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:22,673
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

562
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,675
So it's a...

563
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,513
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

564
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:34,643
- To water on Mars.
- To water on Mars.

565
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:40,816
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

566
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,361
- Little girl.
- That's nice.

567
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:45,862
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

568
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,030
Thank you.

569
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,700
- I have a daughter.
- Yeah?

570
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,535
How old?

571
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,203
Old enough to know better.

572
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,039
Twenty-seven next month.

573
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,837
- You have other kids?
- Just the one.

574
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:07,509
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

575
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:11,847
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

576
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,433
But he helps out, though.

577
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,519
He's even changing some diapers
now, so...

578
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,939
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

579
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:24,735
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

580
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:28,196
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

581
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:31,783
So, any advice?

582
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:35,620
Having a daughter. Any advice?

583
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:37,622
No, not really.

584
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,416
Just love them.

585
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,251
Just... Yeah.

586
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:45,005
I mean, they are who they are.

587
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,258
Yeah.

588
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:53,555
I've got this nephew.

589
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,853
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

590
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:06,401
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

591
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:10,489
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

592
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,199
You know, that...

593
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:15,786
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

594
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:20,040
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

595
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,336
But of course, they don't.

596
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:29,132
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

597
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,218
Family?

598
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:37,599
Yeah. Family.

599
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:40,811
You can't give up on them. Never.

600
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:44,064
I mean, what else is there?

601
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:32,904
Jesse, it's me.

602
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:42,163
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

603
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,620
Jesus.

604
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:39,512
Jesse.

605
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,102
Jesse.

606
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,398
Jesse, wake up.

607
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:53,234
Jesse, wake up.

608
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:23,974
No, no, no.
