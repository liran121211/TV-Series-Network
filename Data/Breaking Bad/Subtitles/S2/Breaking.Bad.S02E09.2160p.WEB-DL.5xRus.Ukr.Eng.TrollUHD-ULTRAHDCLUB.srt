1
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:26,530
These people.

2
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,073
Pathetic.

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,244
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,413
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:37,875
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,461
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,255
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:46,175
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

9
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:50,471
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

10
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,141
Yeah, it's a PET/CT.

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,810
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:00,397
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,442
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:07,655
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:09,490
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:12,534
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week

17
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,370
to get the results.

18
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:17,539
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:19,448
I could take one look at Walt's,

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,877
and tell you immediately how he's doing.

21
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:24,880
- Really.
- Doctors like people to think

22
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:28,550
that they're so much smarter
than the technicians,

23
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,888
but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:40,437
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:42,690
Excuse me.

26
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,828
You all right in there?

27
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,872
Yeah.

28
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:04,211
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,963
Yes.

30
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,384
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:37,661
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,958
- So how'd we do?
- You did fine.

33
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,297
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:51,355
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,010
Sorry.

36
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:34,802
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,597
{\an8}But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:41,475
{\an8}Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:45,646
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,898
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:50,400
{\an8}Weeks.

42
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,236
{\an8}Maybe.

43
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:53,862
{\an8}Sorry to hear it.

44
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,741
{\an8}I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:00,702
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,622
How much money are we laundering?

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,960
{\an8}At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,421
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,883
{\an8}We've had some extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:16,552
{\an8}Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,099
{\an8}All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar

52
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:25,853
minus my fee, which is 17 percent

53
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:29,231
{\an8}comes to $9960.

54
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,068
{\an8}Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:36,822
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,408
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:42,911
Make hay while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,170
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,716
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,429
{\an8}Actually, I...

61
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:06,101
{\an8}I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:13,233
{\an8}- Really?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:16,904
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:24,077
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:30,792
God, Walt.

66
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:34,880
I need you to stay positive with me here.

67
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:38,467
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:39,885
{\an8}I'm all for positive,

69
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:44,556
{\an8}but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,183
{\an8}It...

71
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,227
{\an8}It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,812
I know.

73
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:54,399
{\an8}Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,735
{\an8}You know, forgive me.

75
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:01,031
Look

76
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:04,159
I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if...

77
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:05,994
If

78
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,205
I'm no longer around.

79
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,668
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:19,216
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:24,346
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:29,309
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:34,022
{\an8}A 30-minute discourse

84
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:37,693
{\an8}about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:41,238
{\an8}And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:47,703
{\an8}I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

87
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:06,555
{\an8}I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,059
{\an8}Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:14,396
Yeah.

90
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:27,409
{\an8}- We should do something.
- Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:30,120
No, something else.

92
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:33,123
{\an8}We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,209
{\an8}Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,462
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,175
{\an8}Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:45,343
{\an8}She's a painter.

97
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:47,919
You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,973
No, is that bad?

99
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:54,936
- Boy, you need some educating.
- Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:58,273
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:02,069
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,863
So romantic.

103
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:07,783
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:12,829
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,332
It's the shit.

106
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,584
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:21,379
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.

108
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:23,882
Really?

109
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:30,222
- Is there still cereal?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,357
{\an8}<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

111
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:43,318
{\an8}<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

112
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:46,738
<i>- Hello? Jesse, pick up...</i>
- Hold on, hold on.

113
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,032
Sorry, one sec.

114
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:56,748
- What?
<i>- I've been trying to reach you.</i>

115
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,157
Where's your drop phone?

116
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:02,977
- I've been busy.
<i>- Well, clear your social calendar.</i>

117
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:06,675
- We have to cook.
<i>- What? Today?</i>

118
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:09,333
<i>No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.</i>

119
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,763
<i>Now, we're going to need
all new glassware</i>

120
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:14,474
heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

121
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:17,769
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:20,980
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:23,692
<i>Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating</i>

124
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,403
do not constitute plans in my book.

125
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,861
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?</i>

126
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:31,947
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:36,288
- You're going to a museum, huh?
- Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:39,541
- Georgia O'Keeffe?
<i>- She's a painter, duh.</i>

129
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,299
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,504
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,313
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:49,551
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,053
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:55,640
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,183
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:00,312
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,733
- Tuesday? Four days straight?
- Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:08,278
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>

139
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:12,449
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,868
- What?
- <i>It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

141
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:18,205
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you...

142
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,706
<i>Hell, no.</i>

143
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:22,665
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,003
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

145
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,258
<i>- Come on.</i>
- All right, all right. Go.

146
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,345
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,853
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:38,064
I really wish you didn't have to do this.

149
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,644
Me too.

150
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,752
But I'll be back before you know it,

151
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,523
and you can always call if you need me.

152
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:50,362
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,290
Love you.

154
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,087
- Fly safe, okay?
- Okay.

155
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,737
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading</i>

156
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,197

157

162

You brought a meth lab to the airport?

163
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,440
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

164
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,816
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

165
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,361
- Yeah.
- With reflux condensers?

166
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,155
Yes. Like I said, yes.

167
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:20,076
- Just go. Drive. Go, go.
- Okay.

168
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:24,289
Good morning to you too, man.

169
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:24,099
- Stupid...
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

170

What? Funyuns are awesome.

171
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:28,894
- God.
- Hey, more for me.

172
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:31,981
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,484
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:39,155
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,784
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:47,372
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,332
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:56,047
- Hey, let me use yours, would you?
- Absolutely not.

179
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:58,549
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,842
- You know that.
- It's not business, all right?

181
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,386
- It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

182
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,181
- What, female?
- Maybe.

183
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,225
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,727
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

185
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:13,690
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

186
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,693
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:20,822
- Drinking water?
- Yup.

188
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,699
Is that all we've got?

189
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:26,828
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,002
Oh, God.

191
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:43,845
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

192
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:47,348
- Oh, our "workstation."
- That's right.

193
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:51,769
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,578
Considering it's our only set,

195
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,733
and we are a million miles from nowhere.

196
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,909
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,449
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:12,410
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,329
That's the last of it.

200
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,376
- How many total?
- Nineteen.

201
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:23,546
So dollar-wise?

202
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,381
How much?

203
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,718
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds

204
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:33,681
that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds at...

205
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,392
- What are we selling for these days?
- Forty a pound.

206
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:39,376
- Forty thousand dollars?
- Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:42,398
All right, that's 40 times 42

208
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:45,610
minus distribution charges...

209
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:49,030
What?

210
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:51,991
What?

211
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,036
Six hundred seventy-two thousand dollars.

212
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,914
- All in?
- No.

213
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,750
Each.

214
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,335
Each?

215
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,255
- Each.
- Six hundred and...?

216
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:08,925
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:12,595
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:17,475
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:21,562
Yes! Yes!

220
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,403
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,947
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,657
Perfect timing, yo.

223
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:35,743
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean?

224
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:36,994
We're done cooking.

225
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:40,081
I am not done until this barrel is empty.

226
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,457
Look at this.

227
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,919
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:48,256
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:50,758
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,928
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane,

231
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:57,056
and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,851
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

233
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,770
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:05,356
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle,

235
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,066
and glass up the rest.

236
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:08,317
Come on.

237
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:11,362
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,239
Grand Slam?

239
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,616
Hot shower?

240
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:16,951
A bed?

241
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,710
- Separate rooms.
- Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,256
What the hell?

243
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:34,051
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,767
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place

245
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,650
where did you put them?

246
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,482
- I left them right here in the ignition.
- Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,983
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,777
- The buzzer didn't buzz.
- The what?

249
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:54,279
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in

250
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:56,156
to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,867
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,536
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,498
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:05,999
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,794
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,714
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:12,998
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,342
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,011
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,055
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

261
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:23,389
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:26,103
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,689
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:30,858
- Jesus.
- Okay, just...

265
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:38,950
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:40,785
Okay.

267
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:42,203
How?

268
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,631
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,008
Oh, damn it.

270
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,345
What's it taste like?

271
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:01,013
Bad, huh?

272
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:10,523
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

273
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:13,818
Okay. There.

274
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,780
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:27,415
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

276
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:33,254
What the hell's wrong with this thing?

277
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:36,382
- You have to really pull.
- I am.

278
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:38,384
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:41,304
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

280
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:44,932
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,477
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:51,772
Oh, jeez.

283
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:19,759
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...

284
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:22,637
Well done.

285
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:25,723
God.

286
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:49,163
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:51,499
Hear me now.

288
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,086
Damn it.

289
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:03,886
Stupid.

290
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:10,184
Okay, now we have to use your phone.

291
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:12,693
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

292
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:14,897
You hooked it up wrong and blew it up.

293
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:17,733
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

294
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,068
How do you know?

295
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:22,821
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:24,823
- That's what I know.
- There was a fire.

297
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,659
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:29,017
Is that what you were...?
You were thinking?

299
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:31,121
Now that we have identified the problem...

300
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,416
You and thinking, that's the problem.

301
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:38,671
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:41,132
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

303
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,052
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,679
God.

305
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:51,976
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:55,271
- Roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

307
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,276
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:03,654
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:08,325
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,411
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,080
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:14,582
All right, so you ready?

313
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,878
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:23,716
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:25,884
All right... No, big arrows, giant arrows.

316
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,179
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

317
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:31,765
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,769
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:37,688
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:42,151
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,153
About another 15 miles.

322
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:47,114
- Really? That far?
- Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:50,575
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,330
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:58,042
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

326
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,919
Leave now.

327
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,921
Here.

328
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:03,798
He's coming.

329
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:12,597
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel

330
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,226
who broke his leg mountain biking,

331
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:18,104
and he had to drink urine for...

332
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:21,190
You know, just until
the forest ranger found him.

333
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:27,571
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:33,452
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:37,498
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

336
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,335
All right.

337
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:53,472
Come on.

338
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:57,642
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,104
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:02,857
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:06,861
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,530
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:11,740
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:15,035
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:17,329
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:19,915
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:22,834
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:25,087
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you...?

349
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:29,008
Phone's dead.

350
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:35,598
Now what?

351
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:41,645
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:46,483
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,769
What's this?

354
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:26,065
I'm trying to

355
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:29,026
trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:31,820
Seriously?

357
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,240
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,283
The commutator.

359
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,411
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:44,583
Usually this little piston engine
turns it,

361
00:27:45,668 --> 00:27:48,879
but considering that it's lying here
completely totaled...

362
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:55,261
Anyway.

363
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,307
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:04,895
It'll take longer, a lot longer,

365
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:07,940
but theoretically

366
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:11,110
it should work.

367
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,613
Theoretically.

368
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,328
It has to work.

369
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:24,039
You understand?

370
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:35,426
Can I try?

371
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,682
Yeah.

372
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,635
How much longer?

373
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:22,473
I don't know.

374
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,573
Now?

375
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:41,408
Hey.

376
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:44,036
Mr. White.

377
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:58,759
Hey.

378
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:01,637
Yeah?

379
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:07,267
Yo, man, you hanging in?

380
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,978
Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:30:12,272 --> 00:30:15,859
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

382
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,365
No, give it a little longer

383
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:23,700
just to make sure we're...

384
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:40,801
Methylamine doesn't spoil

385
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,511
does it?

386
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:49,309
No. That's not why we're here.

387
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,865
Yo.

388
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,867
Lie much?

389
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,626
Here, push.

390
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:32,144
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:35,022
Now.

392
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,150
Go on.

393
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:43,614
Please, please, please.

394
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,550
Yes. Yes.

395
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:10,307
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

396
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:13,018
No. God.

397
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,190
Please. Please.

398
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:38,502
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

399
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,713
Why? Why?

400
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,388
Mr. White.

401
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:51,223
Mr. White!

402
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:00,482
What are you doing?

403
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,819
Mr. White?

404
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,030
Oh, God.

405
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:25,090
I have this coming.

406
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:29,136
What?

407
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,932
I have it coming.

408
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:38,061
I deserve this.

409
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:40,439
Hey, snap out of it.

410
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:44,610
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

411
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:46,361
Right?

412
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:51,199
All I ever managed to do

413
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:54,745
was worry and disappoint them,

414
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,289
and lie.

415
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,083
Oh, God.

416
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:03,211
All the lies.

417
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:06,882
I can't even...

418
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,177
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

419
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:13,972
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:17,809
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:22,314
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,777
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,782
Your body

424
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,869
is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:41,166
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,835
And when they're gone

427
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:47,881
your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:54,137
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:58,350
You go marching out there,

430
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:02,437
and within an hour, you will be dead.

431
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:06,733
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now,

432
00:35:06,942 --> 00:35:08,860
and think of something scientific.

433
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:12,322
Something... Something scientific, right.

434
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:15,492
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:18,412
You made poison out of beans, yo.

436
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,832
All right, look. We got...

437
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,170
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:29,547
How about you take
some of these chemicals,

439
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:32,217
and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,345
And we can just send up a signal flare.

441
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:38,849
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help,

442
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:41,768
or a homing device,

443
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:43,812
or build a new battery or...

444
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,856
Or wait, no.

445
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:48,414
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV,

446
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:51,987
and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:55,073
You know, like a...
Like a dune buggy.

448
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:58,785
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or...

449
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:03,957
What? Hey. What is it?

450
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,501
What?

451
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:10,255
Do you have any money?

452
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:11,590
Change, I mean. Coins.

453
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:14,593
- Yeah, I got a bunch from the...
- Okay.

454
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,636
- Yes.
- Gather them.

455
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:20,724
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws,

456
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:24,477
and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:28,148
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:30,525
- Solid zinc, okay.
- And... And bring me...

459
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:33,111
Bring me brake pads.

460
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,907
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,868
- Okay. Brake pads, okay.
- Brake pads.

462
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,499
What are we building?

463
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:49,211
- You said it yourself.
- A robot?

464
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,546
- A battery.
- Yes.

465
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:53,673
Move!

466
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:09,064
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

467
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:11,441
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:15,445
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:19,533
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,409
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,954
Well, think about it.

472
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:27,833
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,794
It's no more than an anode and a cathode

474
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,129
separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:37:33,964 --> 00:37:35,924
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:39,761
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide,

477
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,180
and graphite from your brake pads.

478
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:46,560
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:51,064
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:53,859
Then... Here, I'll show you.

481
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,611
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,697
This.

483
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:01,616
It's zinc.

484
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:06,913
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:10,542
- So the sponge is the electrolyte?
- Yeah.

486
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,629
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,967
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:21,428
Good.

489
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:27,183
Good. And now, what shall we use

490
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:30,103
to conduct this beautiful current with?

491
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:35,650
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,325
Wire.

493
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:46,953
Copper.

494
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:49,205
- Oh, I mean...
- Copper.

495
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:50,874
Right.

496
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:55,962
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:59,049
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:02,177
We've only got material enough for six.

499
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,267
Okay.

500
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:15,273
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:16,983
All right.

502
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:20,946
Cathode.

503
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,619
Anode.

504
00:39:27,827 --> 00:39:30,830
Damn. That is good.

505
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,376
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:55,355
Come on.

507
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,985
<i>Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact</i>

508
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:44,487

511
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,954
It's fine.

512
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:07,260
I know I can trust you to...

513
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,555
Yeah.

514

Hey, whatever happens

515
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:18,104
your family will get your share.

516
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,525
Thank you.

517
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:33,119
So...

518
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:40,126
I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

519
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:45,465
Yeah.

520
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,111
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

521
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,033
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:17,288
- I know. I know, enough already. It's...
- I'm teasing.

523
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:19,499
Everything in its time.

524
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:23,920
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:28,883
- Yeah.
- You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,056
- Oh, my God.
- I wanna clarify.

527
00:42:35,265 --> 00:42:38,015
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:40,562
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:42,938
To classify someone as in remission

530
00:42:43,022 --> 00:42:45,822
we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

531
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:48,319
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:50,178
Technically speaking

533
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,324
a tumor can remain
the exact same size it was before,

534
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,994
and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:42:56,202 --> 00:42:59,747
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage III adenocarcinoma

536
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,958
I'd like to see, I hope to see

537
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:05,795
at least a 25-to 35-percent
reduction in tumor mass

538
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:11,509
something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:43:11,718 --> 00:43:13,553
Everybody still with me?

540
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:18,683
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:22,270
Walt, your tumor has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,236
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

543
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,488
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.

544
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:35,116
Is...? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:40,371
- Mom, yeah.
- Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,833
- Okay, but, I'm... Wait...
- Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:46,669
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

548
00:43:46,878 --> 00:43:49,923
- Oh, my God.
- My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:54,385
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:04,812
That's great.

551
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:09,651
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:13,738
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:17,075
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,701
See that scary-looking thing there?

555
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:23,706
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

556
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,293
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:29,462
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,590
Tissue inflammation? I...

559
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:34,759
Are you sure about that? I mean, I...

560
00:44:34,968 --> 00:44:40,765
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,935
- What?
- You probably have a tear

562
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:45,893
in your esophagus from coughing.

563
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:48,829
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:52,526
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,560
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:58,199
- I'm sorry, I just...
- No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:02,161
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:06,665
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:08,699
But now at least we have some options

570
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:11,713
the most important of which is time.

571
00:45:12,964 --> 00:45:15,341
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:19,220
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

573
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:24,559
- Yes.
- Yeah.

574
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:25,935
Oh, my God.
