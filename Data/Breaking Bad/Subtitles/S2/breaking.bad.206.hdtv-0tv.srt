1
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:40,896
What up?

2
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:42,500
Damn, bitch.

3
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:48,856
Got something for me?

4
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,490
Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,264
Is this a 5 or an S?

6
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,078
5, yo.

7
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:01,368
No, wait. S.

8
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:04,045
Yeah, a 5.

9
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,569
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,783
Hey, man.

11
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:15,496
I'm slinging mad volume and fat-stacking
Benjis, you know what I'm saying?

12
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:18,471
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

13
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,407
So they got names?

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,122
Hers is, like, I don't know.

15
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:26,247
She's just this woman is all.

16
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:28,062
Him they call Spooge.

17
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:30,445
Spooge?

18
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:32,929
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

19
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,861
So let me get this straight.
You got jacked

20
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,586
by a guy named Spooge?

21
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,920
Yo, what's his name matter?

22
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:43,456
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big!

23
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,300
But if you're looking for
a reason not to go do this thing...

24
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:49,775
- Did I say that?
- 'Cause I'll go do it myself, right?

25
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,342
It's just I'm on probation and all.

26
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,451
So you gonna do it?

27
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:00,114
Good. Right on.

28
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,107
'Cause these two,
they need to get got.

29
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,174
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:10,108
www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

31
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,984
Where's my money, bitch?

32
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,929
Where's my money?

33
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,963
That's good.

34
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:56,687
Come on.

35
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,741
I will mess you up.

36
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,705
Is that how you want to play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,436
Your funeral, Jack.

38
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:15,504
Do not mess with me.
I will bury you 'cause I'm crazy.

39
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,030
You know. <i>Mucho loco</i>.

40
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,990
Do not test me.

41
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,258
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

42
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,181
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:39,844
Sorry.

44
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:44,058
I think it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,093
Yeah, High 70s.

46
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:49,112
You have a great day.

47
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,731
Right on. You too.

48
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:08,717
God! Shit!

49
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:46,047
Anybody home?

50
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,908
<i>Tonight, you will receive</i>

51
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,090
<i>the ultimate fixture of cutlery.</i>

52
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:56,443
<i>Tonight, in this steel knockout...</i>

53
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,762
Yo, is anybody else home?

54
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,827
Where's your folks?
They here?

55
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,305
What's your name?

56
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,090
My name's...

57
00:07:59,021 --> 00:07:59,971
Diesel.

58
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,441
Yo, don't you want to watch
something other than this?

59
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,374
Like, I don't know, <i>Mr. Rogers</i>?

60
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,701
So when your folks coming home?

61
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,167
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?

62
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,993
When is he getting back?

63
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,610
I'm hungry.

64
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,765
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

65
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,154
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

66
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,268
<i>We'll be thinkin thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences and...</i>

67
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:23,574
<i>Okay, that's officially
all I remember. Good luck.</i>

68
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,672
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

69
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:32,554
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz,</i>

70
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,539
<i>just calling to say hello.</i>

71
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:38,025
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today,
and I was just thinking about you both,</i>

72
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,578
<i>hoping everything's well.</i>

73
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:42,857
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected,</i>

74
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,784
<i>so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

75
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,930
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

76
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:54,345
<i>This is Skyler White.</i>

77
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,615
<i>Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

78
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,694
No, not at all.

79
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:01,586
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

80
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,018
<i>Very well, thank you.</i>

81
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,749
Walt is actually at work today.

82
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,689
It's his first day back at work,

83
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,244
<i>and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

84
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:13,747
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

85
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,321
I'm just so glad to hear that
everybody's fine. That's wonderful.

86
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:22,701
I'm so very, very long overdue
in telling you this,

87
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:25,082
and I just have to take
Walt at his word

88
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,670
<i>that he's been passing it along for me.
I mean, he's been so adamant about</i>

89
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,688
wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself.

90
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,551
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just...

91
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:41,169
- What is it?
- <i>I can't...</i>

92
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,657
begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

93
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,287
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

94
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,313
It's saved us.

95
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:58,949
I don't know if I...

96
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:02,399
Walt keeps saying, "Don't bother them.
It's no big deal."

97
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:04,074
But it is a big deal.

98
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:05,802
To me.

99
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:07,695
And to all of us.

100
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:09,648
So I just...

101
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,092
finally wanted to...

102
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:14,667
say thank you.

103
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:20,950
<i>Anyway.</i>

104
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,292
End of speech.

105
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,088
So, I do hope
we get to see you soon.

106
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,489
Truly, anytime you're in town,

107
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,149
anytime at all is good for us.

108
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,916
How about this afternoon?

109
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,744
Monoalkenes,

110
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,452
diolefins,

111
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,071
trienes, polyenes.

112
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:50,736
The nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

113
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,518
But when you start to feel overwhelmed,
and you will,

114
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,654
just keep in mind that one element.

115
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,134
Carbon.

116
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,454
Carbon is at the center of it all.

117
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:09,149
There is no life without carbon.

118
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:12,773
Nowhere.
That we know of in the universe.

119
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,701
Everything that lives,

120
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,323
lived, will live.

121
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:19,046
Carbon.

122
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,152
Carmen is carbon.

123
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:26,044
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.

124
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,778
Did you...

125
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,246
I like to think of it...

126
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,428
I like to think that the diamond

127
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:41,611
and the woman
who wears it on her finger

128
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:42,986
are both formed

129
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,805
from the same stuff.

130
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,841
Or, say the diamond
and the man who invented it.

131
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,770
That got your attention, right?

132
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,238
The man who invented the diamond.

133
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
All right.

134
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:02,956
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

135
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,691
Dr. Hall invented the first

136
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:11,535
reproducible process for
making synthetic diamonds.

137
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:14,793
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.
Now, today,

138
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:19,212
synthetic diamonds are used
in oil drilling,

139
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,578
electronics,
multi-billion dollar industries.

140
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,447
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

141
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,765
And he made them a fortune.

142
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,788
I mean, incalculable.

143
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:39,171
You want to know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

144
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,485
A $10 US Savings Bond.

145
00:13:57,428 --> 00:13:58,285
Anyway.

146
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,323
A Savings Bond printed on
carbon-based paper

147
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,340
paid to a carbon-based man

148
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,565
for something he made out of...

149
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:09,981
carbon.

150
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:15,766
It's so nice to have
you back with us, Walt.

151
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:18,543
And you're looking
great, by the way.

152
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,279
A little skinnier.
Which is definitely no tragedy.

153
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:26,921
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

154
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,996
That's a great look for you.

155
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,329
But you're feeling good?

156
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,421
Absolutely. 100%.

157
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,292
I'm glad to be back at work.

158
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,067
I'm glad to...

159
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:45,761
I'm happy to be here. Really.

160
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:47,421
We're happy too.

161
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,831
And I just...

162
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:56,282
It's good.

163
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,489
It's great.

164
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,892
Is everything okay?

165
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:09,248
Just please feel comfortable

166
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:10,838
coming to me

167
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:12,953
with any problems,

168
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:14,579
any issues.

169
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:16,155
Anything at all.

170
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,003
You know, completely confidential.

171
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,441
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

172
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,650
Man.

173
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,619
Let me see it.

174
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,672
Dad, let me see it.

175
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,158
Don't worry about it.

176
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:57,998
Let's go.

177
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,583
Peekaboo.

178
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:53,609
Peekaboo.

179
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,416
Ah, man.

180
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,311
You stay right here, all right?

181
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:23,925
I mean it.

182
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,380
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

183
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,603
You're the one who dropped it.

184
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,856
I didn't drop it!
I didn't drop shit!

185
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,915
- You dropped it!
- Shut the hell up about it.

186
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,860
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

187
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,338
Get up!

188
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:59,497
Shut up!

189
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:01,329
Both of you!

190
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,599
You know who might have done it?

191
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:23,244
I have an idea.

192
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,696
Here's what I think.

193
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,971
You ID 'em.
And then together,

194
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:34,320
you and I put a bag
over their heads.

195
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,075
We tie 'em up,

196
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:38,402
drive 'em way out into the desert,

197
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:39,827
strip 'em naked,

198
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,870
then bury them up to their necks

199
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,275
on a huge mound of fire ants.

200
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,321
Saw it in that old Western.

201
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,385
You with me?

202
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:57,894
Scorpions?

203
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:03,237
Scorpions are good.

204
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:15,312
Very nice.

205
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,141
Damn, Dad.

206
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,083
Check it out.

207
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,702
Who is this?

208
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:57,905
So, this is Walter Jr. or Flynn.

209
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,323
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

210
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,938
- Mom...
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

211
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:05,476
This is Mrs. Schwartz, whom
you've heard so much about.

212
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,613
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.

213
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,338
Nice to meet you, too.

214
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:13,251
Look who's here.

215
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,816
Always nice to see you.

216
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,355
What a nice surprise.

217
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,798
Look at you.
You're looking good.

218
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,334
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

219
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,009
I know it was for me.

220
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,537
You have a good shaped head.

221
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,396
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

222
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,521
- For good luck. Right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

223
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,389
We could use some of that, huh?

224
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:36,628
Mrs. Schwartz?

225
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:39,904
Thank you so much for
what you'v done for my dad.

226
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,053
It was a really good thing.

227
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,421
You're very welcome.

228
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,478
We're going to find
a way to repay you.

229
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,907
We don't want to ever hear that.

230
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,223
You know what?
I hate to say it,

231
00:20:57,211 --> 00:21:00,327
but I really need to get going.

232
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,374
- That's too bad.
- You can't stay for dinner?

233
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,742
I wish I could, but unfortunately

234
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,300
I have to try to beat the traffic.

235
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,770
Well, I hope we get a chance to...

236
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,105
to catch up real soon.

237
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,273
Hopefully.

238
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:17,882
Your purse.

239
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,527
Good to see you.

240
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,764
And you and Elliott
are welcome any time. Really.

241
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:32,387
And I, for one, am gonna be much
better about keeping in touch.

242
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:34,600
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

243
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:35,919
Nice meeting you.

244
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,453
Likewise.

245
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,695
- Bye now.
- Drive safely.

246
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,504
What am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

247
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,079
I'll be right back.

248
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:05,919
What did you...

249
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:10,388
We need to talk.

250
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:14,273
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

251
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,191
Please.

252
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,420
Please.

253
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,478
Where's my money, bitch?

254
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,054
I ain't going to keep asking nice!

255
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:41,442
Yo, all right?
I want my money and my dope!

256
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:42,610
Come on!

257
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:46,253
- I just want to say, man...
- What? What do you want to say?

258
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:47,907
I just want to go on record.

259
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,364
You hit me really, really hard.
I think I'm seeing double.

260
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,570
Maybe I need to go see a hospital.

261
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:54,615
Shut up!

262
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:59,502
- Serious, I might have a concussion!
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

263
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,629
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

264
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,797
Shut...

265
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:04,103
up.

266
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,773
Empty your pockets.

267
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:09,303
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

268
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,310
Do it!

269
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,226
All right, turn around.

270
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:18,656
Turn around!

271
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,545
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

272
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:29,191
All right. Shoes.
Give them here.

273
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,715
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any...

274
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,245
We shot it all.

275
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,178
Shot an ounce in a day and a half.

276
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:53,149
All right, tell you what.

277
00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:57,477
Both of you pull it
out of your butts right now

278
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:01,355
or I grab a flashlight and some pliers
and go exploring.

279
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,733
What's it going to be?
Come on!

280
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,326
There you go.

281
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,027
All right, come on.
On the table.

282
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:18,398
So what? You hold the crystal,
and she holds the H, huh?

283
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,052
Division of labor.

284
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:24,319
All right, there's
maybe an 8-ball here.

285
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,167
Where's the rest of my meth?

286
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:30,045
Yo, for real?
She up and lost it, yo.

287
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,178
- You shut up!
- Shut up, skank.

288
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,056
Shut up! Stop it!

289
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,935
This really isn't getting any better.
It's turning cranial.

290
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:42,773
You see this gun, huh?
It's got five bullets.

291
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,180
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial,

292
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,955
for being such a pussy.

293
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:53,963
Hey, baby.

294
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:56,326
Come here, baby.

295
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,876
Come here, baby.

296
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,303
All right.

297
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,553
You two are never
getting high again.

298
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:12,468
I will make it my life's mission.

299
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:15,185
Not another needle,
not another ball,

300
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,002
not one toke,

301
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,977
not till I get what's mine.

302
00:25:21,975 --> 00:25:23,855
We got you covered, man, sure.

303
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:27,304
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,694
You're damn right,
plus interest. Where?

305
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:31,051
Backyard.

306
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:34,490
Right hand to the man, dog.
Backyard. Go check it out.

307
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,095
- Get...
- Hurting. Painful.

308
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:41,781
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:44,870
Don't move.

310
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:49,221
Come on!

311
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,265
See?

312
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:55,830
Me and the slit just boosted it.

313
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,262
She's like ant, man.

314
00:25:57,387 --> 00:26:00,319
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

315
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:02,233
What the hell am I supposed
to do with this?

316
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:05,396
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

317
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:06,874
Get high.

318
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:13,783
That's my bank.

319
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,199
So?
It's FIDC insured.

320
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:18,286
It's a victimless crime.

321
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,788
- Where the hell did you get this?
- Bodega. Way across town.

322
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:25,875
In, out, like bam.
It was smooth as silk.

323
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,378
What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumb ass?

324
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,846
We roll like the breeze, for real.

325
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,476
All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.

326
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,802
- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?

327
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,596
- For real?
- I'm telling you.

328
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,930
A victimless crime.

329
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,533
Jesus! Come on already!

330
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,632
It's about to give, man.
I'm sensing it.

331
00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:59,127
You don't know what you're doing.
I thought you told me

332
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:01,352
you boosted, like, six of these.

333
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:02,859
Boosted.

334
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,610
It's not like he ever got one open.

335
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:08,709
At least I got persistence.
The law of averages,

336
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,369
lucky number 7.

337
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:12,737
Don't listen to that skank.

338
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,933
Stop calling me that!

339
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:17,794
I ain't no skank!

340
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,919
Skank, skank, skank ass skank!

341
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,569
Sit.

342
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:25,976
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face!

343
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:28,172
Now chill!

344
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:31,882
You, get that thing open.

345
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:35,800
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

346
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:42,488
Where's the kid?

347
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:46,524
The kid! The little kid!

348
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,499
What are you asking me for?

349
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:17,820
What the hell kind
of mother are you?

350
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:20,948
How about you feed the kid
a decent meal every now and then?

351
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:24,569
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:27,417
Get him some decent TV to watch.
What is this shit?

353
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,040
Are you serious?

354
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,418
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:37,089
Diesel, this whole thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

356
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:40,634
Get out of the way.

357
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:42,573
Get out of the way!

358
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,854
So you didn't tell anyone.

359
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:03,379
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

360
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,591
What does that mean?

361
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,601
It means what it means.

362
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,563
It's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:17,707
All right. Fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:21,564
All right.
First let me say

365
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:25,337
I very much regret
involving you in this.

366
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,512
This was...

367
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,485
This entire thing was...

368
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:31,039
unfortunate.

369
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,662
Unfortunate?

370
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,240
And I apologize deeply.

371
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,200
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,193
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,706
You told me your insurance was
covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,091
If you won't take our money

375
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:02,155
and your insurance isn't covering it,
how are you paying for it?

376
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,059
This is not an issue that concerns you,
Gretchen, okay?

377
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:10,349
Excuse me. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,546
You tell your wife and son

379
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:16,012
that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:17,787
Why are you doing this?

381
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,862
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,740
The look on Skyler's face...
She's sitting there, tears in her eyes,

383
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,302
thanking me for saving your life.
Why would you do that to her?

384
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,978
As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:34,123
Just please

386
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:37,501
allow me to do this
in my own way in my own time.

387
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,961
All right?

388
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,994
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

389
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,508
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

390
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:49,879
I don't owe you an explanation.

391
00:30:50,004 --> 00:30:53,745
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologized.

392
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,670
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

393
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,569
There. I've apologized twice now.

394
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:02,204
I'm humbly sorry.

395
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,234
Three times.

396
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,696
Let me just get this straight.

397
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:10,844
Elliott and I offer to pay for
your treatment, no strings attached...

398
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:13,428
an offer which still stands,
by the way...

399
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:16,013
and you turn us down out of pride,

400
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:18,526
whatever,
and then you tell your wife

401
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:20,878
that in fact we are
paying for your treatment.

402
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:25,132
Without our knowledge, against our will,
you involve us in your lie.

403
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:29,495
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:37,012
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:41,296
What happened to you?

406
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:46,135
Really, Walt.

407
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,441
What happened?

408
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,208
Because this isn't you.

409
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:58,040
What would you know about me?

410
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,218
What would your presumption

411
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,407
about me be, exactly?

412
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,173
That I should go begging
for your charity?

413
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:10,219
And you waving
your checkbook around,

414
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:13,264
like some magic wand,

415
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,225
is going to make me forget how you

416
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,602
and Elliott cut me out?

417
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,646
What? That can't be how you see it.

418
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,511
It was my hard work, my research, and
you and Elliott make millions off it.

419
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:26,591
That cannot be how you see it.

420
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:28,712
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left...

421
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:30,759
You are always
the picture of innocence.

422
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,325
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

423
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,278
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

424
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,475
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

425
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,501
You and my father and my brothers,
and I go up to our room,

426
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,364
and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

427
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:47,955
What? Did I dream all that?

428
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,162
That's your excuse...

429
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:53,842
to build your little
empire on my work?

430
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:56,865
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

431
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,227
You abandoned us... me, Elliott.

432
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,479
Little rich girl just
adding to your millions.

433
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,428
I don't even know
what to say to you.

434
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,434
I don't even know where to begin.

435
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:20,684
I feel so...

436
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:23,765
sorry for you, Walt.

437
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:29,044
Fuck you.

438
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:11,514
Little man,

439
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:13,263
you hungry?

440
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:53,154
What are you doing?

441
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,904
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,766
Baby, get up and help me!

443
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:06,566
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,741
Get up, damn it!
Get our dope!

445
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:13,535
Bedtime.

446
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:18,338
Here we go.

447
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,434
Who's the big tough guy now?
Is that you?

448
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:31,040
You're the big man?
Try and hit me now, bitch!

449
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,188
Try and hit me now!
Try and hit me now, bitch!

450
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,380
Should I ask where you've been?

451
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:12,922
Never mind.

452
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,903
We're long past that, I suppose.

453
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,051
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

454
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:43,504
We need to talk.

455
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,347
Just say it.

456
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:09,922
They're cutting off the money.

457
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:24,255
What did she say, exactly?

458
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,689
Not much. It was...

459
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:33,835
abrupt. She said...

460
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,000
something like...

461
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,628
"I'm sorry...

462
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,438
"to have to do this,
but Elliott and I

463
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:46,713
"can no longer continue
to pay for Walt's treatment.

464
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:49,146
"I wish you the very best."

465
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,339
And that was it.

466
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,350
She sounded apologetic.

467
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:08,894
I guess, it was quick.
She got right off the phone.

468
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,924
I was so stunned, but...

469
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,016
I called her back,
and she didn't pick up.

470
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:23,408
So...

471
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,790
what do you know about this?

472
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:35,296
She and I had a perfectly
nice visit this afternoon,

473
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:39,407
and then you come home, and all of
a sudden she's in a big hurry to leave,

474
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:42,682
and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

475
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:51,044
What do you know that I don't?

476
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,689
Where were you tonight?

477
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:01,964
I drove up to Santa Fe.

478
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,142
I was with Gretchen...

479
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:08,908
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

480
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,178
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

481
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:18,053
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

482
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,830
There was a lot of...

483
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:23,855
hemming and hawing and beating
around the bush from both of them...

484
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:26,331
What... Tell us what?

485
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:34,615
There was a lot of

486
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:38,310
business phraseology
being tossed around,

487
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:39,635
Things like...

488
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,291
"cash poor" and "leveraged"

489
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:45,798
and "quarterly decline,"
yada, yada, yada.

490
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:48,923
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

491
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,304
They're broke.

492
00:39:56,452 --> 00:39:58,084
You are kidding me.

493
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,867
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

494
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:04,942
And all these big banks and...

495
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,417
Fannie Mae and...

496
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:08,697
Apparently,

497
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,151
Gray Matter is no more immune

498
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,870
than anyone else.

499
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:16,992
That is...

500
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,619
Jesus, that's...

501
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,201
She could have just...

502
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:40,651
told me herself.

503
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,071
Well, they're prideful people.

504
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,145
Listen.

505
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:55,565
Not to sound selfish,

506
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:57,906
but as far as we go,

507
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,373
we'll get through this, okay?

508
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:07,509
They've already paid
for most of my treatment,

509
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,543
right?

510
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:16,682
We're going to make it.

511
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,161
All right?
I promise.

512
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,782
And yet...

513
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,787
she still drives a Bentley.

514
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:47,203
Keeping up appearances or...
I don't know. Who knows?

515
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,936
Baby, that don't make any sense.

516
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,482
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

517
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,551
Say you're designing a safe. Where
are you going to put your weak spot?

518
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:11,676
Nowhere.

519
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:13,796
I made it, like...

520
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:15,167
strong.

521
00:42:15,438 --> 00:42:17,668
Jesus! On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:19,870
You put your weak
spot on the bottom.

523
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:22,433
Baby, that H is...

524
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:24,749
bringing me down.

525
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:28,295
- You took too much. I told you.
- I need...

526
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:32,197
I need to even out.
Let me get a hit of that crystal.

527
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:33,925
Hell, no.
You've lost your share.

528
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,453
Come on, baby.

529
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:38,597
It's all I need
is just a little hit.

530
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:42,315
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

531
00:42:42,964 --> 00:42:44,769
I ain't no skank.

532
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,990
I would appreciate an apology.

533
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:54,010
What?

534
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:56,885

Remember peekaboo?
Can you go peekaboo like this?

551
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:21,274

You keep them closed just like that.
