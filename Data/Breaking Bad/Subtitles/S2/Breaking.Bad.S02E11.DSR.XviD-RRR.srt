1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,817
Now why aren't we exploiting that?

2
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:03,486
It's not our territory.

3
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:05,421
They're not gonna do
a thing about it.

4
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:08,224
Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

5
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,192
- What's this?
- I'm in recovery.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,562
You know, pot is, like,
stepping stones.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,398
How do you want to proceed?

8
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:16,966
Sell off what we have.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,335
Then I guess I'm done.

10
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:20,803
Nothing's really changed.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,272
We sell when we want, where we want.

12
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,858
This is our city.

13
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,533
We're gonna be kings.

14
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:00,322
What's up?

15
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:33,442
What you need?

16
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,110
Yo, you buyin', or are you
just stopping to envy?

17
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,548
Punk bitches.

18
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:30,633
<i>Please leave your message

00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:36,084
<i>Record your message after the tone.

20
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,342
Bounce, little man.
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,

21
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,137
getting eyeballed hard.

22
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,586
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

23
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,461
Get your ass up here now.

24
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,655
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

25
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,770
What are you waiting for? Go!

26
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:44,605
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

27
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:57,703
www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

28
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,671
We've made such headway
with your treatments

29
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,946
that now it's time we talked
about sealing the deal.

30
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:10,227
Absolutely.

31
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,778
As you know,

32
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,137
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

33
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:19,203
That may no longer be the case.

34
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,451
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

35
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,913
Maybe a pretty good option.

36
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,994
Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons
in the country

37
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,454
performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

38
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,970
He's got a good track record.

39
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,457
Pretty good.

40
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:37,964
It sounds...

41
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:40,973
aggressive.

42
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:43,299
Yes. Very much so.

43
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:46,540
Understand that if you
don't have this surgery,

44
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:48,838
you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

45
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:50,618
And it will.

46
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:55,328
Now, through the treatment you've had
already, we've bought you some time...

47
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,177
Maybe a lot, probably a little,

48
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:00,527
but that's all.

49
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:02,581
In my opinion,

50
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:05,453
if you're willing to take some risk,

51
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,857
then this offers the best chance.

52
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,351
How much would it cost?

53
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,434
I'm not on your insurance.

54
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,336
I'd say between 170,000

55
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,714
and 200,000, all in.

56
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:27,698
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can,

57
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:29,946
but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

58
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,246
This is obviously a big decision.

59
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:40,431
And you folks are gonna
want to take some time to discuss it.

60
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,293
I'll do it.

61
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:54,690
Don't you think we should at least
talk this through first?

62
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,553
I just think it's the way to go.

63
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:04,213
I have to say I think

64
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:05,981
it's the right choice.

65
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:11,599
I recommend that we let the pneumonitis
heal for another couple of weeks,

66
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,223
and then we'll have at it.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,827
That's tricky.

68
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:23,593
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

69
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,894
So two weeks and change?

70
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,155
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

71
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,374
That way, Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

72
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,293
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

73
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:56,630
14 messag...

74
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:58,850
God.

75
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,440
It's me.

76
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:07,615
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

77
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:09,183
Working.

78
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,812
What is it?

79
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:15,466
Combo's dead.

80
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:17,351
Shot.

81
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:20,823
Which one is he?

82
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,942
You did not just say that to me.

83
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,295
- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.

84
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,610
What's the word on the street?

85
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,377
No one's dropping no names.

86
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,849
Combo rang me before it went down.
Said dudes were mad-dogging him,

87
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:50,327
trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

88
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,539
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean,

89
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,893
what'd you expect?

90
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:00,761
I don't know.

91
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,389
You don't know?

92
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,431
Is that all you got?

93
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,279
I'll do right by Combo's people.

94
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,390
Make sure you bust up
your cell and toss it.

95
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,441
We'll figure it out.

96
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,282
I appreciate what
you're saying and all,

97
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:24,845
but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

98
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,291
I'm on probation, man.

99
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,588
Fast track to Los Lunas.

100
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,572
We're on the verge

101
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,603
of making some serious coin.

102
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,071
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

103
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,877
This game we playing, we don't got
the street cred to survive it.

104
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:52,353
Back when everyone thought you killed
Spooge, maybe we were doing okay,

105
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:53,828
but that whole...

106
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,755
thing to the head thing, the ATM?

107
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:59,422
His junkie bitch copped to it.

108
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,537
The whole town knows it wasn't you.

109
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:08,992
Everyone knows?

110
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:14,351
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

111
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:16,875
'Cause we like you and all.

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

113
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,085
We'll get by.

114
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:23,816
We'll make it.

115
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,452
Sorry, Jesse.

116
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:27,804
I'm out.

117
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:41,765
We have had a bit of a setback.

118
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:46,535
Sorry, that's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

119
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:49,842
- How about your fault? How about that?
- Don't lay that on me.

120
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,073
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

121
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:55,544
- That doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys!

122
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:58,648
Who do I look like, Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

123
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:01,450
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

124
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:03,719
Now, setback. Go.

125
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,195
One of our dealers was murdered.

126
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,646
It was some kind of turf dispute,

127
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,139
and apparently we lost.

128
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:17,924
And then everyone quit on us.

129
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,500
We have absolutely no distribution.

130
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,406
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

131
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,409
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

132
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,180
There's your silver lighting.

133
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:34,150
How about you?
How's the health situation?

134
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,929
It's better.
Do you mind?

135
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,949
Better?

136
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:48,254
It's looking a little more positive.

137
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:50,933
I may have more time than I thought.

138
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,387
Outstanding.

139
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:55,072
Now, as to your dead guy,

140
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,299
occupational hazard.

141
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,329
Drug dealer getting shot,

142
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:03,304
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

143
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,482
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

144
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:10,886
38 and change.

145
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:12,955
38 ounces? Grams?

146
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,357
Pounds.

147
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:19,829
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

148
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,267
Guys!

149
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,175
Why the long faces here?

150
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,569
You're sitting on a gold mine.

151
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,838
A gold mine we can't sell.

152
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,306
We need a proper infrastructure.

153
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,967
We need foot soldiers and dealers

154
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,978
on a street level
that are rock solid.

155
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:39,215
We need muscle,
and we need enforcers.

156
00:11:39,674 --> 00:11:41,384
Payback.
That's what we need.

157
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:47,529
God.

158
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:52,736
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

159
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,269
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

160
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,485
We need your help.

161
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,387
Let's start with some
tough love, all right?

162
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,322
Ready for this?
Here goes.

163
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,881
You two suck at peddling meth.

164
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:12,961
Period.

165
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:16,203
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

166
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:18,578
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

167
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:22,985
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

168
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:25,778
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

169
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:28,470
What?
Some tattooed speed-freak?

170
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,059
What you two need is
an honest-to-God businessman.

171
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,028
Somebody who treats your product

172
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,239
like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

173
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:41,131
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

174
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:45,499
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

175
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:49,632
You know someone like that?

176
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:51,880
Let's just say I know a guy

177
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,305
who knows a guy.

178
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,665
Who knows another guy.

179
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:59,471
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

180
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,470
Well, what's his name?

181
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,427
I have no idea.

182
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,267
He's very low profile.

183
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,042
He's careful like that.

184
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,543
From what I do hear about him,

185
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,678
he sounds a little like you.

186
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,347
I need you to leave.

187
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,956
Look, there's...

188
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,429
some stuff about me
you don't know, and...

189
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,286
Like you're a drug dealer?

190
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,601
I kind of got that.

191
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,926
You pay in cash,
and you use an alias, so...

192
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,818
One of my guys,

193
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,661
a friend who worked for me...

194
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:20,676
got murdered.

195
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:24,847
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

196
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:28,836
I'm gonna smoke some crystal,

197
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:32,663
and I just think you should go,
being that you're

198
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,857
in a program and all and...

199
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,029
You could come with me to a meeting.

200
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:46,057
No meetings.

201
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,168
We could just get out of here.

202
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,676
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

203
00:14:56,801 --> 00:15:00,182
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

204
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:01,476
I just...

205
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,922
All right, I really
just need you to go.

206
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:12,373
Sir?

207
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:13,928
Enjoy your meal.

208
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,673
You're late.

209
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,729
We're in the big time now.

210
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,417
So where's the kingpin?

211
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,586
Your guess is as good as mine.

212
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,879
So you get the dude's name?

213
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:11,995
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names,

214
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,450
what we look like,
but not the other way around?

215
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,656
Why don't you
get yourself some food?

216
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:25,203
So we won't both sit here with our Happy
Meals, looking like a couple chumps?

217
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:27,997
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

218
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:29,678
Fine, thanks.

219
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,316
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

220
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,234
I don't get you, man.

221
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,091
A week ago you talked
like you were all ready to hang it up.

222
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:45,781
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

223
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,805
What about after?

224
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:51,195
After, you gonna make up
some new magic number?

225
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,233
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

226
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:56,558
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

227
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:59,262
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

228
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,609
We got a guy killed.

229
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,667
You know what?

230
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:10,806
This is bullshit.

231
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,112
I'm out of here.

232
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,051
I think she's waking up from a nap.

233
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:30,493
She is certainly going to want
to get out and stretch those legs soon.

234
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:38,826
We'll keep an eye on your fluids.
You're on the low side of normal.

235
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,805
What? How low?

236
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:44,971
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

237
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:49,074
We'll just have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

238
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,877
Oh, man, you would
not believe the traffic.

239
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,195
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

240
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,125
Sorry.

241
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,756
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

242
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:02,876
Oh, my God.

243
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,442
Look at her.

244
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,565
Look.

245
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:09,021
God. It's like she's here already.

246
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:12,277
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

247
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,255
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

248
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,239
It's time to make a decision.

249
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,457
- You know what I'm going to say?
- The C-section?

250
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,255
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

251
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:28,207
My last labor was
pretty tough, so...

252
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:32,455
For the baby, I say yes.

253
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:35,241
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

254
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:37,198
It's best
we take her a little early.

255
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:39,523
So why don't we schedule it for...

256
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,430
a week from Friday?

257
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:46,135
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

258
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,243
We have a birthday.

259
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:54,242
The 16th.

260
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,043
I like it.

261
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:00,433
You know, speaking of birthdays,

262
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,063
I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

263
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:06,553
It's an hour before closing.

264
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:09,554
You're supposed
to be taking it easy.

265
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,067
We're having a little get-together
for Ted's birthday

266
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:14,312
and I've got to pick up the cake.

267
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:15,356
Why you?

268
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,484
Because I said I would.

269
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,570
It's the least I can do.

270
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:18,232
Let's get out of here.

271
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:20,455
You know, go do something.

272
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:23,404
Seriously.

273
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:27,605
You know that museum
in Santa Fe you talked about?

274
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,866
Let's take a drive.

275
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:35,233
Sure.

276
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,527
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's already been drilled and cut,

277
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:59,652
We're halfway through the job.

278
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:02,250
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.</i>

279
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,569
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

280
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,744
I gotta go.

281
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,085
Dean, I gotta go.

282
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,237
Happy Birthday!

283
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:25,861
My God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

284
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:28,798
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

285
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:30,920
Wait a minute.

286
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:33,845
Are you making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

287
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:36,878
Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

288
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:40,109
China's undercutting us at every turn...
I'm at a loss.

289
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,370
Wait.

290
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,749
I want to hear it first.

291
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:49,350
Absolutely not.
No way.

292
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:51,956
You cannot deny
your employer his birthday wish.

293
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,624
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

294
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,898
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

295
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:02,298
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

296
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:05,412
And I'm enormous now.

297
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:07,789
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

298
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:10,306
Not that I ever did.
I mean, come on.

299
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,942
You guys, these candles
are getting wax all over the place.

300
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,460
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

301
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,696
It's obscene.

302
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,785
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

303
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,668
<i>To you</i>

304
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,752
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

305
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,140
<i>To you</i>

306
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:49,803
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

307
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:53,139
<i>Mr. President</i>

308
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:57,317
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

309
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:02,409
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

310
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,695
<i>To you</i>

311
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:12,625
That was fantastic.

312
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:14,618
Isn't she great, huh?

313
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:16,912
Okay, here we go.

314
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,652
- He wasn't there.
- <i>He was there all right.</i>

315
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:33,925
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours. Nobody came.

316
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,592
<i>All I know is my contact
says he was there.</i>

317
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,177
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

318
00:24:39,302 --> 00:24:41,030
Yes, I'm positive.

319
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:42,732
- Where was he?
- <i>Who knows?</i>

320
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,667
Maybe he stayed out
in the parking lot,

321
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,811
checked you out with a telephoto lens.
Didn't like the cut of your jib.

322
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:48,798
Anyway,

323
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:52,141
it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no go.

324
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:54,810
What?
What do you mean?

325
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,578
No deal. No dice.

326
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,514
Shot at and missed, shit on and hit.

327
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:02,886
Wait a minute. How can he make
that decision without even meeting me?

328
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:05,988
<i>I told you he's very cautious
who he does business with.</i>

329
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:09,788
All right?
He's skittish, like a deer.

330
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:13,802
Call him back.

331
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:16,103
<i>I'm sorry.
I can't do that.</i>

332
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:18,804
Yes, you can.
Call him, Saul.

333
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,616
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

334
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:24,065
I called a guy who called
a guy who called a guy.

335
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,675
Second of all, it's over.

336
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:28,586
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual,</i>

337
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,887
<i>all you get is the one shot.</i>

338
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:33,001
Look,

339
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:36,430
I'll see if I can scrape
something else together,

340
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:38,120
but don't get your hopes up.

341
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,738
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

342
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,158
Damn it.

343
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:25,761
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

344
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:34,593
Can I help you, sir?

345
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:37,992
Diet Coke, please.

346
00:27:40,988 --> 00:27:42,988
And five minutes of your time.

347
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:55,907
What can I do for you?

348
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,026
Have a seat.

349
00:27:58,884 --> 00:27:59,734
Please.

350
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:15,387
I would like to know
why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.

351
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,803
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

352
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,130
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

353
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,454
I believe that person was you.

354
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:31,497
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

355
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,297
I don't think I am.

356
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:40,403
Sir, if you have a complaint,

357
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,740
I suggest you submit it through
our e-mail system.

358
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:45,374
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

359
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:49,974
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with

360
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,399
is very careful.

361
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:53,754
A cautious man.

362
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:57,841
I believe we're alike in that way.

363
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:01,157
If you are

364
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:03,384
who I think you are,

365
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:06,429
you should give me another chance.

366
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:14,370
I don't think we're alike
at all, Mr. White.

367
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,552
You are not a cautious man at all.

368
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:22,144
Your partner was late,
and he was high.

369
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,418
Yes, he was.

370
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:29,577
He's high often, isn't he?

371
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,221
You have poor judgment.

372
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:38,845
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

373
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,064
Are you familiar with my product?

374
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:45,088
I've been told it's excellent.

375
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,706
It is impeccable.

376
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:48,926
It is the purest,

377
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,541
most chemically-sound product
on the market anywhere.

378
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,025
That is not the only factor.

379
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,441
You could charge twice

380
00:29:57,566 --> 00:30:01,566
the current rate for what I provide,
and your customers would pay it.

381
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:03,494
Hands down.

382
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:08,682
Now, who I choose to do business
with on my end

383
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,608
is not your problem.

384
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,672
You won't see him.

385
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:15,757
You won't interact with him.

386
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,601
Forget he exists.

387
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,647
I have to ask.

388
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:25,029
Why?

389
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:26,528
Why him?

390
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,659
Because he does what I say.

391
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,043
Because I can trust him.

392
00:30:37,894 --> 00:30:40,022
How much product
do you have on hand?

393
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,090
38 pounds.

394
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,127
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

395
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:53,293
Will I hear from you?

396
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,506
I have your numbers.

397
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,525
You can never trust a drug addict.

398
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:23,584
Look, I mean, it's all kind
of little dribs and drabs,

399
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,820
but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

400
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:30,095
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

401
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,939
Dribs and drabs.

402
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:34,845
Once you add it all up, though,
and with Keller,

403
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,086
the revenues are almost 10% less
than was actually received.

404
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:42,396
And this is every quarter,
for the last two years.

405
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:49,125
When I saw that, I got worried,
so I checked Accounts Receivable

406
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:52,438
on other customers.
I found six other instances

407
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,608
of revenues being under-reported.

408
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,665
And I've only just started
to look into it.

409
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:04,233
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

410
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,683
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

411
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:08,846
Most of the time, they overestimate.

412
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:11,495
So I just let them roll their overages
into the next order

413
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,783
and if I don't,
they'll go elsewhere.

414
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:15,459
Obviously, we forgot

415
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,148
or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

416
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:23,759
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see,

417
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:26,927
the money's coming in.
Ventually, as you can see.

418
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:28,796
Right.

419
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:30,965
Right, but...

420
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,088
I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage,

421
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,510
to try and sort this out.

422
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,779
And most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

423
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,440
In a few cases,

424
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:51,686
I found Xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

425
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,784
All right.

426
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:11,284
You got me.

427
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:16,270
We're talking nearly a million
dollars of undocumented revenue.

428
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,113
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

429
00:33:20,963 --> 00:33:22,613
about saving a company.

430
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,189
I'm thinking about people's jobs,

431
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:28,307
about their mortgages and pensions

432
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,559
and their college
funds for their kids.

433
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,810
Not to mention my own.

434
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,364
It doesn't mean that you
have to break the law.

435
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:36,682
Yes, it does.

436
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,423
It's right there in the books.
Business is terrible.

437
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:43,029
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

438
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,540
If I don't keep up...

439
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:47,147
People go to prison for this.

440
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:56,686
My dad built this
company from nothing.

441
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,030
We make things here.

442
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,967
The people who work
here are like family.

443
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:07,703
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

444
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:17,549
Don't report this.

445
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:19,945
Please.

446
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,789
I'm not gonna turn you in.

447
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,350
But I can't be a part of it.

448
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:36,821
I know.

449
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:39,573
I know. I just wish...

450
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,479
I'm sorry.

451
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,776
I don't want you to go.

452
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:07,306
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

453
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,828
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

454
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:12,828
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

455
00:35:12,996 --> 00:35:16,860
<i>The whole crew was representing. Even
Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>

456
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:19,219
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins,</i>

457
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:21,297
<i>everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>

458
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,766
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

459
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,232
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>

460
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,277
<i>It was like this shiny,
white pearlescent.</i>

461
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:31,726
<i>Like, I'm pretty sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

462
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:34,251
<i>So we're definitely
talking high-end.</i>

463
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:38,072
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

464
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:40,905
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

465
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,968
I like to mix some ice with it.

466
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:15,384
Hold that.

467
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:19,956
What's it feel like?

468
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,975
There's a chill.

469
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,546
Don't freak out.
It passes.

470
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,533
And then...

471
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:31,968
you'll see.

472
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:38,237
I'll meet you there.

473
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,153
Take that off.

474
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:20,102
Phones off, please.

475
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:39,992
Pipes, I guess.

476
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,559
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

477
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:45,638
Eyes on your paper.

478
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,835
Excuse me, where's the manager?

479
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,110
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?

480
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,770
I met a man here last week.
A black gentleman. He's thin. Glasses.

481
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,538
Yes, sir.
That's the owner.

482
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:31,834
Owner.

483
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:34,769
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

484
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:36,944
He could be at any one of them.

485
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,784
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...

486
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:44,720
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't give that out.

487
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:49,354
Is this about a complaint? I'd be
happy to refer you to our website.

488
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,228
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

489
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:53,292
Gus.

490
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,895
38 pounds, $1.2 million.

491
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,606
Truck stop,
2 miles south of exit 13 on the 25.

492
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,681
One hour.

493
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:08,644
- What?
- One hour. You in or out?

494
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:12,882
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

495
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,894
One hour.
If you miss it,

496
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:17,569
don't ever show your face
in here again.

497
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,728
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

498
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:30,253
- Come on! Come on!
- <i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

499
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,486
Pick up the phone.

500
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:34,463
Pick up the phone!

501
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:38,148
I'm coming by.
I need the product.

502
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:40,343
I need the product now!

503
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:44,601
Wake up!

504
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:49,650
Wake up.

505
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:56,612
Where'd you put it?

506
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,215
- Where is it? Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

507
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,889
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

508
00:45:02,014 --> 00:45:03,619
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

509
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:05,621
Under the sink.

510
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,742
Not now!
