1
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:28,929
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:32,766
{\an8}Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,019
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

4
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:38,939
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,857
{\an8}Don't push it.

6
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,194
{\an8}Besides, I want you well for the weekend.

7
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,949
{\an8}Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:52,828
{\an8}It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:55,372
{\an8}Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,458
{\an8}Just family and a few friends.

11
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,920
{\an8}We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,466
Sounds good.

13
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,855
{\an8}Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,690
{\an8}Now

15
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,776
{\an8}what are you supposed to do today?

16
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:28,321
{\an8}- Nothing.
- Excellent.

17
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,786
{\an8}Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:10,423
Can you meet?

19
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:17,722
I thought maybe you might have, you know

20
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,391
kicked.

21
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,935
Signed... Signed off.

22
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,729
I was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:26,940
No such luck.

24
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:30,986
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:35,448
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,535
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:40,453
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:42,789
The upshot.

29
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:50,130
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,301
Damn.

31
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,889
Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds.

32
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:04,477
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:07,314
In fact

34
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:10,483
the news is all good.

35
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,236
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,865
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,257
What, you mean, like, remission good?

38
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:26,917
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,534
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumors.

40
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,089
How significant?

41
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,467
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,844
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,139
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch,

44
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:46,353
but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,522
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,441
That's... That's great, man.

47
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,196
I mean, my aunt, she never...
I mean, you know, at your stage

48
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,615
I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,283
Yeah.

50
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:02,994
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,997
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,042
Of course. I am.

53
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,629
Okay, now we...

54
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,050
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:20,220
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:28,561
So how do you want to

57
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,815
you know, proceed

58
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:34,693
in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,075
We'll take our time and stay cautious.

60
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,285
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:46,121
And then...

62
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,919
Well, then I guess

63
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:55,755
I'm done.

64
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,945
- Batter up.
- Everyone?

65
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:22,407
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast

66
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:27,579
- with my non-alcoholic beverage.
- Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:31,624
I know one party can't begin to repay

68
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:37,047
all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:39,549
But then again

70
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:44,304
Hank does make one mean margarita.

71
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,684
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,313
These last few months have been

73
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:58,651
wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:01,404
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:04,657
- All right.
- Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,493
We all are.

77
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:13,166
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,335
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:19,005
And for the first time in a long time

80
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:22,175
we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,805
Okay, anyway

82
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:29,682
I want to also express my gratitude

83
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:34,854
to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,024
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,984
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz,

86
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:43,196
for those of you
who don't know them, are...

87
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:47,158
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:51,287
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer

89
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:54,290
to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,044
And they did.

91
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,838
So

92
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,048
To Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,969
- To Gretchen and Elliot.
- Cheers.

94
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:09,055
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,640
- Speech.
- Yes.

96
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,350
- Speech.
- Yeah, Dad.

97
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:14,936
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,898
Well, it's...

99
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,650
It's kind of funny.

100
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:26,322
When I got my diagnosis, cancer

101
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:30,702
I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,162
"Why me?"

103
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,915
And then

104
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,420
the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,967
I said the same thing.

106
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:56,769
Anyway.

107
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,981
Thank you for coming.

108
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:03,776
And enjoy.

109
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:07,614
- All right, cheers.
- Yeah.

110
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,157
Cheers.

111
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:11,576
Inspirational.

112
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:15,121
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,372
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:20,084
A little mercury switch, 9-volt battery

115
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:24,422
five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,425
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:30,261
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...

118
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,078
It was a... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:36,809
Not a metaphor, not an analogy, it's a...

120
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,520
Walt, what's the word I'm looking for?

121
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:42,857
Anyway

122
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:46,819
Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,322
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:54,244
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,829
Hey, top me off there, will you, buddy?

126
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:58,706
Anyway.

127
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,749
Poetic.

128
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:04,963
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,090
I guess that's the word.

130
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,152
Go ahead.

131
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,701
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:54,053
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:58,471
- There's no worm in this, right?
- No, that would be mescal.

134
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,893
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,271
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:07,775
Had this firearm instructor who was...

137
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:10,735
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,240
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,076
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,245
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,581
But... Hey, hey.

142
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,753
Walt, what you doing there?

143
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:28,778
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:31,924
The kid's 16.

145
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:34,552
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,348
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,398
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,196
That's all right.

149
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,291
No.

150
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,132
Jesus.

151
00:14:19,097 --> 00:14:22,850
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:26,229
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,815
Hey.

154
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:34,570
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:39,617
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:43,663
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,545
- It's all right.
- What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,963
Bring it back.

159
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,681
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,517
All right, pal?

161
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:10,231
- We good?
- The bottle.

162
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,359
Now.

163
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,660
What's going on?

164
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,500
Jesus.

165
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:35,965
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,009
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,054
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:48,603
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,105
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,116
This is your brain.

171
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:08,831
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,720
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:25,139
Ever or...?

174
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:30,978
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,689
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,484
No, I guess that'd be kind of...

177
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,029
No.

178
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:44,158
Need some help?

179
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,285
No, I got it.

180
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,581
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:52,625
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:56,045
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,214
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:01,592
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:13,187
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:16,399
It's huevos rancheros.

187
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,527
- I can tell.
- Yeah?

188
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,574
- Fork.
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,793
There you go.

190
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:40,548
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:44,260
- Whatever that means.
- No.

192
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,931
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:50,349
Really?

194
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:35,895
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

195
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,440
Hi.

196
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:43,903
I just wanted to say that...

197
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,321
No.

198
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,367
We'll talk tonight,

199
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:53,371
but I wanted to say that

200
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:58,376
I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday,

201
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,503
but it wasn't me.

202
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:04,882
And I'm sorry.

203
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:08,886
Love you.

204
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,877
Oh, boy.

205
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,816
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

206
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,234
<i>No.</i>

207
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:10,156
<i>We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that...</i>

208
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:11,741
Hey there.

209
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:15,870
- Wow, who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

210
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:19,636
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so...

211
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:25,755
They're actually... They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:27,882
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,968
Actually

214
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:32,803
Walt's got...

215
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:38,934
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:42,646
- Skyler...
- And last week we got good news.

217
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:46,984
- I'm so sorry.
- But we're really optimistic.

218
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,527
Great.

219
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,363
- Great. Good news is great.
- Yeah.

220
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,033
Yeah, it is. It really is.

221
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,705
Well

222
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:02,792
feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,543
Yeah.

224
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,973
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,772
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,524
Yeah?

227
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:30,653
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:33,989
Sure. We got them.

229
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:36,826
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:40,120
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:43,541
It's not an issue.

232
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:47,753
You want installation, right?

233
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:52,508
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.
- That's what I like to hear.

234
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:07,273
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:10,526
That's Hover Man.

236
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:13,612
He can surf, skate, glide

237
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,367
whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:21,078
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,877
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:31,088
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:33,883
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:38,386
- And who's this in his pouch?
- His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:42,182
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know

244
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,976
fights crime.

245
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:47,146
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,773
You know that, right?

247
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:52,568
Only female kangaroos have pouches.

248
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:54,236
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:56,906
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:59,407
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,578
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:09,168
- And this is?
- It's Backwardo.

253
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,088
Wait, no. I actually...
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:15,382
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,341
He can make everything go in reverse.

256
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,511
Time and stuff? Like time traveling?

257
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:22,264
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:25,267
He walks backwards?

259
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,646
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:31,231
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:34,360
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:37,876
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,740
Okay.

264
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:42,450
Yo, I was a kid

265
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,203
when I drew all these.

266
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,956
It was like four years ago.

267
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,918
- They all look like you.
- What?

268
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:53,963
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:54,672 --> 00:23:56,298
No.

270
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:59,510
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:01,887
Oh, shut up.

272
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,139
Like you never wanted a superpower.

273
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:15,901
- Is that your door or mine?
- I don't know.

274
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,113
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:29,331
- I gotta go.
- Where?

276
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,501
Hey, where?

277
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,674
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:49,643
Jane.

279
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:03,073
Jane.

280
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:18,839
- Hey, Dad.
- There you are.

281
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,300
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:24,470
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,806
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,225
Finally realized that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,979
- Exactly.
- Well, I was in the neighborhood.

286
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,940
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:38,400
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:43,322
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:46,283
- Yes.
- Hello.

290
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,743
Hi.

291
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,661
This is the new tenant.

292
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:52,498
- Donald.
- Jesse.

293
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,170
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:03,926
- No.
- Dad, why don't you come in?

295
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:05,719
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:08,889
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

297
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:39,627
Hey, Dad.

298
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,800
- Hey, son. Are you home early?
- No.

299
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,635
Oh, man.

300
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,265
It was a good day?

301
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:55,477
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:57,688
Yes. Yes, indeed.

303
00:26:57,855 --> 00:27:01,400
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,985
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

305
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:07,281
- Hey, want to take her for a spin?
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:10,159
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:13,579
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:15,372
Okay.

309
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:19,334
Pilot in.

310
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,212
Ignition. Bingo.

311
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,006
Okay.

312
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,593
- Ready.
- All right. Let her rip.

313
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,685
Hundred and seventeen thousand BTUs.

314
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,897
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,524
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draft reducer

316
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,194
safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

317
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,487
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,865
And the energy savings. I mean...

319
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:52,201
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:55,267
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,040
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

322
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:02,753
Son

323
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:07,382
- about yesterday...
- I'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:12,888
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,849
See, your...

326
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,602
Your old man embarrassed himself,

327
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:21,063
and I'm not very proud of my behavior.

328
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,067
I have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:31,782
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:35,327
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,414
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:45,921
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:49,800
I should have used
better judgment all around.

334
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,012
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right,

335
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,390
and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,850
But I kept up, right?

337
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:04,940
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,533
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:18,096
Hey.

340
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,516
Yo.

341
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:23,852
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,690
Yo.

343
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:33,320
- What?
- What was that all about?

344
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:35,614
What?

345
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:38,241
Before. With your dad.

346
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,994
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:46,249
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:48,710
If anything, I was doing you a favor.

349
00:30:48,877 --> 00:30:50,504
A favor?

350
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,423
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,343
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well.

352
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,888
- So, what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

353
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:03,433
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,186
- How's that?
- I mean

355
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:10,482
I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

356
00:31:11,566 --> 00:31:12,734
I bought a filter.

357
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:15,320
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:18,573
You acted like you didn't even know me.

359
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,242
So?

360
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,912
- So?
- You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,247
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:28,834
And by the way, I'm sleeping with him"?

363
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,660
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:34,429
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't.

365
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:37,008
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:40,762
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,390
- Us.
- Yeah.

368
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:45,600
You and me.

369
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:49,604
Who's you and me?

370
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,114
I'm out of here.

371
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,467
Oh, boy.

372
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,187
Dad?

373
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:01,987
Dad? Hello?

374
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:04,406
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:08,535
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

376
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:11,371
- Rot?
- Yeah. Here.

377
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:13,999
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,250
Take a look at that.

379
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:20,714
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

380
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:24,676
- It's wood.
- It's wood

381
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,595
that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,513
Fruity what?

383
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:31,975
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,227
I don't really see anything.

385
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:37,897
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,734
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:43,361
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:47,157
Well, better get to it.

389
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,452
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,121
Not if I can help it.

391
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:23,151
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:27,238
- Go home already.
- I will. I will.

393
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,993
Hey, can I just ask

394
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:35,705
- the Keller account?
- The Keller account?

395
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:39,584
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet,

396
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:43,838
but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so...

397
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,090
Oh, God.

398
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:48,510
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:52,077
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships

400
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,224
with these little companies.

401
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:58,019
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:35:59,062 --> 00:36:00,522
Right.

403
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:04,234
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,403
Sky?

405
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,656
Skyler?

406
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,534
Jesus.

407
00:36:14,744 --> 00:36:16,996
No, I'm fine.

408
00:36:18,123 --> 00:36:22,293
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

409
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:25,338
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,888
What's wrong?

411
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:39,352
I guess it just...

412
00:36:42,063 --> 00:36:45,567
doesn't feel any different.

413
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:53,074
The good news?

414
00:36:54,284 --> 00:36:58,413
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,250
It's just postponed.

416
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,255
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:13,928
But lately, it just feels like...

418
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,515
More tunnel.

419
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,768
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,526
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:31,321
I don't know.

422
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:33,907
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,786
- What?
- My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,452
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got

425
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:43,124
different circumstances,
but we were happy

426
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,959
we were over the moon.

427
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:48,421
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:51,633
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,719
Couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't move.

430
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:57,806
- Great timing, huh?
- Yeah.

431
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,852
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,646
"Why now?"

433
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,692
Being that rock.

434
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,320
You know

435
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:17,242
being that rock takes everything you got.

436
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,083
Yeah.

437
00:39:20,263 --> 00:39:22,307
<i>...causing the housing prices to trend.</i>

438
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:26,019
<i>Foreclosures are being fueled
by a spike in...</i>

439
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,234
<i>The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.</i>

440
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:37,196
<i>With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending</i>

441
00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:39,866
<i>the housing market is unlikely to rebound</i>

442
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:42,744
<i>spelling more pain for the economy.</i>

443
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,546
Yeah.

444
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:14,317
Are you going to work today?

445
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,863
Skyler, there's rot.

446
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:29,415
I'm going back.

447
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:05,720
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

448
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,187
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night.

449
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,608
Oh, damn.

450
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,570
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

451
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:25,031
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

452
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:57,647
<i>Get organized. Storage containers
to meet every need</i>

453
00:42:57,814 --> 00:43:00,441
<i>big or small, on Aisle 3.</i>

454
00:43:00,608 --> 00:43:04,320
<i>Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.</i>

455
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,544
<i>Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.</i>

456
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,922
<i>Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?</i>

457
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:25,758
<i>Go to Aisle 10 to go green.</i>

458
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:33,147
<i>Get a manager on Checkout 4, please.</i>

459
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,434
<i>Manager to Checkout 4.</i>

460
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:47,029
<i>Pest problems? No problem.</i>

461
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:51,033
<i>Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.</i>

462
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,452
You're buying the wrong matches.

463
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:56,122
- What?
- Those matches.

464
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:57,582
They're the wrong kind.

465
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,960
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips

466
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:03,045
not the matches themselves.

467
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:06,966
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

468
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:13,139
More striker strips.
You understand?

469
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,100
Those only have the one.

470
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,811
And don't buy everything in one place.

471
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:20,271
Do it piecemeal.

472
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:23,941
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

473
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,405
Are you following me here?

474
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:37,663
<i>You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.</i>

475
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,833
<i>We have everything you need
to do the job right.</i>

476
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:47,089
- Thanks.
- Sure.

477
00:44:47,256 --> 00:44:49,342
- Next.
- Hi. Here you go.

478
00:45:19,538 --> 00:45:21,707
- You didn't buy my stuff?
- No, I didn't.

479
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,501
We don't have time for this.

480
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,219
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

481
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:54,365
Stay out of my territory.
