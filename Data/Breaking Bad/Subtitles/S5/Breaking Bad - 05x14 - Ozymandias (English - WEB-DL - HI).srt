1
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:19,487
Mm-hmm.

2
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:22,574
Yo, so what's next?

3
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:24,025
We wait.

4
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:28,947
You don't got, like, eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

5
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,448
The reaction has begun.

6
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:33,001
Yeah, I... I know.

7
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,452
So how long?

8
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:35,787
Well, if we had a freezer,

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,989
the condensed liquid
would cool more quickly,

10
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,507
because, of course,

11
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:41,993
this is an exothermic reaction,

12
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,328
which means "giving off heat,"

13
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,514
and our desired product is...

14
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,218
Put me into a coma,
why don't you?

15
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:52,470
What did you just say?

16
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:56,140
What... what? Nothing.

17
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:58,476
Huh.

18
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:06,017
No, no, no.
Not in here.

19
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:09,237
Duh.
Like I'm an idiot.

20
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:12,490
Yeah.
Like you're an idiot.

21
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,292
Dick.

22
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:26,888
Ah, God. Jesus.

23
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,473
God.

24
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,507
Shut up.

25
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,709
Oh, wow.

26
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,069
Huh.

27
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,825
Bogdan... Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,578
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

29
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:53,031
He's... he's got a stick
up his butt?

30
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:56,117
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

31
00:01:56,168 --> 00:02:00,038
So anyway,
he's insisting that I...

32
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:04,258
He's demanding
that I stay and, uh,

33
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:06,010
look over his system,

34
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:08,262
and I cannot get out of it.

35
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:11,132
Yeah.

36
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:14,969
[Phone beeps]

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,421
[Sighs]

38
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,759
[Phone rings]

39
00:02:21,777 --> 00:02:22,777
Hello.

40
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,261
<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

41
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,780
Hey, you.
What's going on?

42
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,031
<i>Nothing much.</i>

43
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,401
I... I was...
I was just, um,

44
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:33,121
calling to...
say I'm sorry,

45
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,289
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

46
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:38,076
Bogdan.
He's got a bug up his butt.

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,112
That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner.

48
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,130
So...

49
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,215
In fact,
you could take pity on us

50
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,500
and bring a pizza home.

51
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,920
They're having
a two-for-one at Venezia's,

52
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:51,639
and at this point I could
eat a whole one by myself.

53
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:52,807
Yeah, yeah, sure.

54
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,059
I can...
I can pick up a pizza.

55
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,762
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

56
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:58,846
<i>He better not.</i>

57
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,431
Trust me.
He does not want to piss off

58
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,066
a hungry, pregnant woman.

59
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,651
Ooh.
What's that sound?

60
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:07,438
<i>I just sold
your favorite piece.</i>

61
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:09,640
The hideous crying clown.

62
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:10,942
<i>Wow.</i>

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,911
Yeah, and I got nine bucks
more than I paid for it.

64
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:16,347
Shows what I know about art.

65
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:17,815
<i>Hey, what do you think
about Holly?</i>

66
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,452
<i>For the baby's name.</i>

67
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:22,987
Do you like it?

68
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,023
I think I really like it.

69
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:28,426
Holly. Yeah. It's nice.

70
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,094
Let me think about it.

71
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,879
Just feels right, you know?

72
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,514
It's my new favorite.

73
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,333
Well, it's a front-runner,
for sure.

74
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,169
[Jesse] Hiyah!

75
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:42,273
[Continues grunting]

76
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,341
Listen, I was thinking, um,

77
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,695
maybe we can have a little
family time this weekend?

78
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,147
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

79
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,181
Yeah, you know.

80
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,866
Just take a drive.

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,485
The almost four of us.

82
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,654
Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail,

83
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:59,657
stop at tinker town, maybe
grab some lunch in Madrid.

84
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:03,027
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

85
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,913
<i>I know.
So why don't we just do that?</i>

86
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:06,914
<i>Take a little break?</i>

87
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:09,667
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>

88
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:13,054
Holly.
It's growing on me.

89
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:15,139
Yep. Me too.

90
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,725
All right,
well, I had better go

91
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,710
and get this in the mail.

92
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:20,845
<i>Why don't you call me</i>

93
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,230
<i>when you're on
your way home, okay?</i>

94
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,765
Will do. Love you.

95
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,883
<i>Love you too.</i>

96
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,655

Ah.

Whoa.
Simmer down there, sparky.

105

What the hell
did we just walk into?

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,106
[Todd] Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

107
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,757
He was right here before.

108
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:24,593
[Jack] - Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
[Frankie] - No.

109
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:28,397
What do you figure?
He may be headed down that gully there?

110
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,232
That's the way I'd go.

111
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,285
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,071
Jack.

113
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,656
These guys are DEA.

114
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:45,331
[Groans]

115
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:47,666
[Walt]
No! Jack, no!

116
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:49,251
Jack! Jack! Jack!

117
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,253
No! No, don't!

118
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,339
Jack, don't. No.

119
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,509
No, Jack!
Jack, no!

120

[Groans]

121
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,512
Jack, no.
Don't kill him.

122
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:00,763
Uh-uh, back it up.

123
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,264
Don't kill him.
Don't kill him, Jack.

124
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:03,298
Get back here.

125
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:04,517
The hell not?
He's DEA.

126
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:07,853
No, he's...
he's family.

127
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:10,106
Say again?

128
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,074
He's my family.

129
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,410
He's my brother-in-law.

130
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:16,412
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us

131
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:20,666
you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

132
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Did you know about this?

133
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,953
I called you off, remember?

134
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,538
I told you not to come.

135
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,206
Well, it seems to me
we did you a solid.

136
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,375
You weren't
supposed to be here.

137
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:30,726
Too late now.

138
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:32,928
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here.

139
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:35,698
Hmm? Yeah,
you and your brother-in-law

140
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:38,267
don't seem to be
getting along too well.

141
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,186
It doesn't...
doesn't matter.

142
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,670
It doesn't concern you.

143
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:43,005
We just wasted
his partner here,

144
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:44,023
and he's wearing a bullet.

145
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:47,576
So, yeah,
I'd say it does concern me.

146
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:50,446
This is...
between him and me.

147
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,148
No cavalry comin'?

148
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:53,783
No.

149
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,401
You bet your ass
the cavalry's comin'.

150
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:56,452
No! No, no.

151
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,320
Jack.
[Grunts]

152
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,740
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

153
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:05,244
Not yet.

154
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:09,799
Hank.

155
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:14,253
Nothing can change
what just happened,

156
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:17,173
but you can walk
out of here alive

157
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,508
if you just promise us

158
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:23,596
that you'll...
you'll let this go.

00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,181
[Scoffs]

160
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,516
Yeah, I thought as much.

161
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,517
Sorry, man.

162
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,552
Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

163
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,104
No, no, no, listen!
I have money!

164
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:36,325
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

165
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:39,195
[Sighs]

166
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,230
It's $80 million.

167
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,455
80 million.

168
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:58,047
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

169
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,883
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

170
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,518
[Walt] You can go anywhere.

171
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:05,187
You can do anything.
Think about it.

172
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:10,109
You can have any future
that you want.

173
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,228
Jack.

174
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:15,614
80... million.

175
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,235
And all you've got to do

176
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,537
is let him go.

177
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,272
That's a hell of an offer.

178
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,958
What do you think, Fed?

179
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:27,710
Would you take that deal?

180
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,279
It's Hank.

181
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:35,084
His name is Hank.

182
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:38,153
How about it, Hank?

183
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:39,630
<i>Should I let you go?</i>

184
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:48,464
My name is ASAC Schrader.

185
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,966
And you can go fuck yourself.

186
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:56,906
Hank... listen to me.

187
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,074
You gotta tell him.

188
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,277
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

189
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:04,580
Please. Please.

190
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:08,050
What?
You want me to beg?

191
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:13,655
You're the smartest guy
I ever met.

192
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:18,594
And you're too stupid to see...

193
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:20,963
he made up his mind
ten minutes ago.

194
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,224
Do what you're gonna do.

195
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:35,444
[Gunshot echoes]

196
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,561
[Walt whimpers]

197
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:12,014
[Jack]
Pretty specific directions.

198
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,216
You know, most people
tell me to be somewhere,

199
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:15,434
they say, "West on the 40,

200
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:18,404
this or that exit,
second gas station on the left."

201
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:19,855
You know?

202
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,492
This here?
This is a whole other story.

203
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:24,576
That fancy phone of yours,

204
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:26,862
where does it say
this is exactly?

205
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,369
Yeah...

206
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:41,760
Look at this.
Even brought a shovel.

207
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,847
[Frankie] Jack.
No sign of Pinkman.

208
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:51,220
All right.

209
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,389
Says this is it right here.

210
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:55,557
So dig.

211
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:11,240
[Clunk]

212
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,792
[Laughter]

213
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:23,135
[Kenny]
What's that? A barrel?

214
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,971
Couple barrels?

215
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,844
[Laughs]
Jesus.

216
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:32,895
Hell yeah!

217
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,346
Oh, Jesus.
Would you look at that?

218
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:35,397
[Laughter]

219
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,483
Hell yeah!
Goddamn.

220
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:40,269
Whoo!

221
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:45,157
What are you waiting for?

222
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,909
Yeah, boss.

223
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:47,943
Hell yeah.

224
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:48,977
Let me get on this side.

225
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:49,995
Out of there, man.

226
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,664
Oh...

227
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:16,171
[Muttering quietly]

228
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:36,708
Okay.

229
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:39,328
Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

230
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:40,829
Seriously?

231
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,998
Jack.

232
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,200
That's, like,
10 or 11 million right there.

233
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:46,718
You sure you wanna do that?

234
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,554
You gonna make me say it again?

235
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:51,056
Go. Go. Chop, chop.

236
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,758
Jesus. What's with
all the greed here?

237
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,761
It's unattractive.

238
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:02,434
Hey.

239
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,902
Hey.

240
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:06,104
I'm leaving you a barrel.

241
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:09,775
Boys are gonna load it for you.

242
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:12,027
You got the keys
for these cuffs?

243
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,535
[Handcuffs rattle]

244
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:25,174
I'm sorry for your loss.

245
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,247
My nephew here,
he respects you.

246
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:33,915
He would never forgive me

247
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:39,354
if things...
went another way.

248
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:40,439
Also, I'll be honest,

249
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:41,890
you caught me
in one hell of a good mood.

250
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,258
So here's what's gonna happen.

251
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:44,476
You're gonna get in your car

252
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:47,112
and you're gonna
drive out of here.

253
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,147
All right?

254
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,234
No hard feelings.

255
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:55,270
Understand me?

256
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,373
We square?

257
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:00,375
Hey, man,
I gotta know we're square.

258
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,611
Or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

259
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:19,272
Pinkman.

260
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,516
Pinkman.

261
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,315
You still owe me.

262
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:31,440
If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

263
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,811
Found him.

264

265
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:47,422
[Jesse] No!

266
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:50,125
Get off me!

267
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,710
Get off!

[Grunts]

269
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,798
No. No.

[Gun cocks]

271
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,949
Good to go?

272
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,074
Hey, Uncle Jack.

273
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:33,218
Well, he was out here
with those feds.

274
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:34,419
Right?
Working with them.

275
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,537
Shouldn't we maybe find out

276
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,139
what he told them first?

277
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,225
'Cause, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

278
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,895
that might not
be too good for us.

279
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,066
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.

280
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,219
I mean, I can do it.

281
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:55,023
Me and him, we got...
we got history.

282
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:58,727
And then, you know,

283
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:03,081
we'd take care
of the job after that.

284
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:05,117
Works for me.
Work for you?

285

- Let's go.
- No.

No!

No!

289
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,014
Wait.

290
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,860
I watched Jane die.

291
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,437
I was there.

292
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:45,774
And I watched her die.

293
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:52,297
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

294
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:55,667
I could have saved her.

295
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:58,754
But I didn't.

00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:32,511
Hi.

306
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,315
Hello.

307
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,533
That truck belong to you?

308
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,355
It does.

309
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:45,358
I'd like to buy it.

310
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,526
It's not for sale.

311
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:55,835
[Coughs]

312
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:14,136
Hey, Walt, it's me.

313
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,972
Um, just thought
I'd try you again.

314
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,358
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

315
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:24,647
so, um, just give us a call
whenever you can.

316
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:27,650
Bye.

317
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:29,618
Hey, Aunt Marie.

318
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:32,621
Hey, sweetie.

319
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,240
I haven't seen you for a while.

320
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,458
What have you been up to?

321
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,793
Oh, you know.
This and that.

322
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:38,994
Your mom and I need to talk,

323
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:41,697
so... thought I'd stop by.

324
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:44,867
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

325
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:47,470
This isn't the best time.

326
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:50,005
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

327
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,040
Why don't we go
into your office?

328
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:00,266
I... I got it.

329
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:03,269
Okay, honey.
Thanks.

330
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,234
Marie, I have nothing to say.

331
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:20,419
Well, I do.

332
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:23,673
So you can just
sit there and listen.

333
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,543
I got a call from Hank.

334
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:30,078
He arrested Walt
three hours ago.

335
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,464
It's over.

336
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:34,633
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

337
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:36,552
Hank and Steve Gomez

338
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,938
are working with
a former associate of Walt's,

339
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:41,974
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

340
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:43,609
and Pinkman has supplied them

341
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:46,946
with everything they need.

342
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,816
Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

343
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:53,319
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

344
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:02,077
I almost didn't come here.

345
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:05,381
Christ, I barely
even know who you are,

346
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:06,515
and I sure as hell don't know

347
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,751
if I can ever trust you again.

348
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,961
And then I think about
how you are so upset with Walt

349
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:21,831
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

350
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:24,233
and all of this
makes me believe

351
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,702
that there has got
to be hope for you,

352
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:30,005
that whatever
he did to you can be undone.

353
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:39,181
All I know... all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

354
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:40,916
is that you are my sister.

355
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:45,054
And so I'm here.

356
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:50,059
Marie.

357
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,093
Everything changes now.

358
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:54,430
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

359
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:57,165
Hank will help you
as much as he can.

360
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,184
I know he will.

361
00:25:58,218 --> 00:26:02,721
And... I will support you
through this.

362
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,192
But I have conditions.

363
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:07,226
I want you to give me

364
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:08,644
every single copy
of that obscenity

365
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:10,346
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

366
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,851
That DVD.
Every single copy.

367
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:18,487
You understand me?

368
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,322
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

369
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:23,292
Yes.

370
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:27,196
Good.

371
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,832
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here,

372
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:32,635
because you are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything, Skyler.

373
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,905
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

374
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,406
Not a bunch
of uniformed strangers.

375
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,226
No. No.
No, he cannot... No.

376
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,879
You tell him. Or I will.

377
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:46,015
There's no way around this.

378
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:49,685
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

379
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,955
[Sighs]

380
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:10,372
[Whimpering]

381
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,888
No.
[Groaning]

382
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:45,374
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

383
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,743
Come on.
Man, please.

384
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:49,211
Hey, please.

385
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:51,797
I told you where
to find the tape, okay?

386
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:54,166
Hey, just... just... just go.

387
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:55,501
Just... just go there.

388
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:56,969
Just go to his house
and get it.

389
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:58,003
We're on it.

390
00:27:58,054 --> 00:28:00,506
Get it!

391
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,675
No one else knows about it.

392
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:04,510
Just me and his partner.

393
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:05,561
[Todd] Okay.

394
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:07,763
No one else knows!
I swear!

395
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:16,772
[Groans]

396
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:31,313
[Grunts]

397
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:02,578
Let's cook.

398
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:17,104
You're completely
out of your mind.

399
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,672
It's the truth.

400
00:30:18,707 --> 00:30:19,757
It is, Flynn.

401
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,209
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

402
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:23,911
You're full of shit,
is what you are.

403
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:24,929
Both of you.

404
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:26,881
If... if this is true,

405
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:29,133
then how could you
keep this a secret?

406
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:34,805
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

407
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,390
I'll be asking myself that

408
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,108
for the rest of my life.

409
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:40,644
So you're saying
all of this time

410
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:42,279
you were lying about this?

411
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:44,264
I mean, so you're saying...

412
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:45,566
you're a liar.

413
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,701
You... you just admitted it.

414
00:30:47,736 --> 00:30:51,538
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

415
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:53,290
Which lie is it?

416
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:56,043
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

417
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,662
Right here, right now.
Believe it.

418
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,113
You know what?

419
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,115
This... this is bullshit.

420
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,751
This is bullshit.

421
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:05,219
I wanna talk to dad.

422
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:06,787
Your dad's in custody.

423
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:08,889
You won't be able to talk to him
for a while, sweetie.

424
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:10,007
I'm calling Uncle Hank.

425
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:11,392
I've tried.
He's not answering.

426
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:14,228
Probably because he is in the
thick of it with your father.

427
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:17,264
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

428
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:18,349
but if you could just breathe.

429
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,184
Just try to breathe,
and just trust...

430
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:23,070
Really? Really?
Try to breathe?

431
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:26,974
Oh, my God.

432
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:29,827
[Door closes]

433
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:32,845
Go home.

434
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,297
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

435
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:37,653
I'll stop by later.

436
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,874
[Bell dinging]

437
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:10,884
[Dinging continues]

438
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:14,254
Flynn?

439
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:17,057
Could you put
your seatbelt on please?

440
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:20,277
[Dinging continues]

441
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:23,613
Please.
It's not safe.

442
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:25,899
You're shittin' me, right?

443
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:34,241
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

444
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:37,377
then... then you're
as bad as him.

445
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:50,140
[Skyler] Whose truck is that?

446
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:58,899
[Walter, Jr.]
Dad?

447
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,267
Listen.

448
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:03,603
I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

449
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:06,690
Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?

450
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:08,024
No, just...

451
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:10,277
They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

452
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:11,695
No, just come inside,
please. Now.

453
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:12,913
Come inside. Come on.

454
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,948
[Walt] Go, go, go, go.

455
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:17,501
[Walter, Jr.] Dad, stop.
Just talk to me please.

456
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:18,869
Our priority
right now is to pack.

457
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,820
Uncle Hank,
they said he arrested you?

458
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:23,490
I will discuss
all of this later, okay?

459
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:24,541
Just tell me what...

460
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,009
Just listen to me!

461
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:27,761
I need you to go
into your bedroom right now

462
00:33:27,795 --> 00:33:29,212
and grab anything
that's important.

463
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:30,464
You understand?
Go. Now.

464
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:32,132
Both of you.
Go.

465
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:35,835
Walt.

466
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:37,521
Why are you here?

467
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:40,006
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

468
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,608
For you and the kids.
Right now.

469
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:42,842
This is our priority.

470
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,311
Hank had you in custody.

471
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:46,947
- He wouldn't just let you go.
- I...

472
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:47,948
Where is he?

473
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,149
- I...
- Where's Hank?

474
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:51,117
I...

475
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:52,736
I negotiated...

476
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:53,787
Negotiated?

477
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:54,821
Uh, yes.

478
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:58,492
What does that mean?

479
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,210
It means...

480
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:01,912
we're fine, okay?

481
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,530
We are. We're fine.

482
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:05,215
Everything is gonna be fine,

483
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:06,917
but we need to leave right now.

484
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:08,168
All right?
Can we do that?

485
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:09,719
What happened?

486
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:11,755
Where is Hank?

487
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,423
Why do we need to leave?

488
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:17,093
I need both of you to trust me.

489
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:19,179
Right now, okay?

490
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:21,381
Please just work with me here

491
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:25,185
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

492
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:29,105
Where... is... hank?

493
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:35,104
Skyler.

494
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:42,953
I have $11 million in cash

495
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:45,338
right outside.

496
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,341
We can have a fresh start.

497
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:51,711
Whole new lives.

498
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:54,764
All we have to do is go.

499
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:57,634
We have to go right now.

500
00:34:57,685 --> 00:35:00,303
That's all we have to do.

501
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:06,276
You killed him.

502
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:12,532
You killed Hank.

503
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,700
What?

504
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:14,734
No. No. No.

505
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:15,735
You killed him.

506
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,037
No, no. No!
[Gasps]

507
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:19,039
I tried to save him.

508
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,408
Uncle Hank
is dead? I...

509
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:22,876
Mom, it can't be true.

510
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,544
- Just stop, please.
- It just can't be true.

511
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:27,247
Everything... everything
is gonna be okay.

512
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:28,965
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

513
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,634
But we need to leave right now.

514
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:33,720
Dad, what's going on?
Talk to me.

515
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:36,590
Just stop for one second.

516
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:38,391
Look, I told you
to get your things.

517
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,676
Stop walking away.

518
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:40,727
There is no time

519
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,228
tell me about Uncle Hank.

520
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:43,263
No, just drop it!

521
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:44,797
But... what's wrong
with you?

522
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:47,150
We're going.
We're going right now.

523
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:48,602
You have to tell me.
Dad, wait.

524
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:50,236
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What...

525
00:35:56,661 --> 00:35:59,145
Get out.

526
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:02,115
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

527
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:03,149
Enough.

528
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:06,052
Mom, what are you doing?

529
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:08,288
Skyler,
put the knife down please.

530
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:09,489
I promise you,
everything...

531
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:14,177
Don't say one more word.

532
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:18,598
Get out of here.
Now.

533
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,883
Skyler.

534
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:20,884
Get out.

535
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,886
Aah!

[Walter, Jr.]
Stop it. Just stop!

539
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,112
Stop please.
Stop.

540
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,531
Get away from us!

Just stop! Stop!

542
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:39,819
Just stop it!

543

544

Stop, dad.

545

Stop it now. Stop.
