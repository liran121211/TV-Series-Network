1
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:12,322
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
- Hey, Dan.

2
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:14,323
I'm looking for something
in a Markowski.

3
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:17,560
That'd be, uh,
Dennis Markowski?

4
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,528
That's the one.

5
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,701
Oh, and I've got my, uh,
paralegal with me today.

6
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:28,170
Paralegal?
Coming up in the world.

7
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,719
You know it.

8
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:50,491
Hey, Dennis.

9
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,526
Have a seat.

10
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,218
<i>You hear about Chow?</i>

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,454
Yeah, people say
he skipped town.

12
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,290
He's dead.

13
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,293
It wasn't me.

14
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,395
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

15
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,797
It was a mistake
made by a third party

16
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,432
who has since been dealt with.

17
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,765
You got it?

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,434
- Yeah.
- The second thing...

19
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:40,038
The deal you had with Fring--
it's still in place.

20
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,205
Okay.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,207
Don't "okay" me.

22
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:45,276
You got something to say?

23
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:49,914
Mike, I'm keeping
my mouth shut.

24
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:52,049
The laundry
was right above the lab.

25
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,817
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

26
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:57,054
I'm looking
at eight years minimum.

27
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:59,256
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

28
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,125
I'm no rat, and you know it.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,127
What else is there to say?

30
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,962
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

31
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:08,331
The deal is the deal.

32
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,536
How's the deal the deal?

33
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,538
The feds took away
my hazard pay.

34
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,375
My wife comes to me and asks me
where the mortgage is coming from.

35
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:20,776
I got nothing to tell her.

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,379
I knew the risks. We all did.
But that wasn't the deal.

37
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,282
And I know for a fact they got
Holt and Perez yesterday.

38
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:30,452
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay,

39
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:31,987
sooner or later,
someone's gonna flip.

40
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,655
No one's flipping.

41
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,324
Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

42
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,326
I appreciate what you're
saying and all,

43
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,661
but the man is dead.

44
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:43,664
Okay? The lab's
a hole in the ground.

45
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,333
- I just don't see it.
- I've got something new.

46
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,670
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

47
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,739
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

48
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,908
- How?
- "How" is my business.

49
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:56,209
Hanging tight's your business.

50
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,911
Your family's gonna be fine.

51
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,614
You will be made whole.

52
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,149
Now, you got my word.

53
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,385
You need more?

54
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:10,923
No, Mike. I'm good.

55
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,427
Who's next?

56
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,229
That's your choice.

57
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,764
APD's got Martinez across town.

58
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,332
Up in Sandoval.

59
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,434
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

60
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,271
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

61
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,707
You don't mean
to get to them all today?

62
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,342
Yeah, I do.

63
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:34,612
Hey, let's go!
Open up!

64
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:52,145
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

65
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,758
Back here!

66
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,645
Oh, hi.
How was your day?

67
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,851
Um, are-- are you
moving back in?

68
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:48,852
Yeah.

69
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,087
I'll keep the condo for now,

70
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,056
selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

71
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:57,426
But, yeah, I'm home.

72
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,962
It's time.

73
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:04,700
Do you, uh, really think
that's-- that's a good idea?

74
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:07,836
Yes.

75
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:40,534
So you bring him here? Come on.
The three of us? We're the three amigos!

76
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:42,368
All for one, one for all.

77
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:46,039
We don't need a fourth amigo.

78
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:49,274
Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

79
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:53,712
- Mike's okay. - He's okay? He said
he was gonna break my legs.

80
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:56,081
And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

81
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:59,151
'Cause he gave me the dead mackerel eyes.
He meant it.

82
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,587
Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

83
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,523
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

84
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:07,825
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

85
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:14,532
Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

86
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,900
Duly noted.

87
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:20,737
All right.
Let him in, Huell.

88
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,118
Mike,
I'm extending you the--

89
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,086
Uh-huh.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,223
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules...

91
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:44,693
Division of labor--
I handle the business.

92
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:47,062
Making the stuff--
that's your end.

93
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,030
I don't tell you how to mix

94
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,765
your chemicals and whatnot,

95
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,968
and you do not tell me

96
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,736
how to take care of business.

97
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,772
Is that absolutely clear?

98
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,446
Sure.

99
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,482
All right.
Let's take the tour.

100
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,589
Hey, you're okay with that?

101
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:15,689
Yes.

102
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,991
He handles the business,

103
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:20,093
and I handle him.

104
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,900
Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

105
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:29,503
You need
an ongoing business--

106
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:31,771
someplace you can slide in,
do your thing,

107
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,105
and remain anonymous.

108
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,773
I'm not gonna mince words.

109
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:36,775
This is your best bet.

110
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,611
Got machines running,

111
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:41,347
forklifts,
people coming and going.

112
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:44,350
You're gonna stay
way under the radar.

113
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,851
And the owner's solid.

114
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:48,219
He can't wait to throw up
a curtain wall,

115
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:50,921
stack some boxes in front of it,
give you all the space you need.

116
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:53,891
After that, he's got his
business, you've got yours,

117
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:55,593
and never the twain shall meet.

118
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,762
It's outstanding.
Am I right?

119
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:01,166
Machines like this--
gotta be plenty of power.

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,733
What about the smell?

121
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:04,035
Ah. More good news.

122
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,735
I've been here
when it's up and running.

123
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,338
This place stinks already.
You'll blend right in.

124
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:09,873
How many employees?

125
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,441
Ha. I knew you'd ask.

126
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,577
Sixteen illegals,

127
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:16,846
all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

128
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,882
You'll want to vet them,
I'm sure.

129
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,983
Yes, indeed.

130
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,918
So what do you say, maestro?

131
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,354
Huh?
Is it unanimous?

132
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,057
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school,

133
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,727
I haven't seen
one of these in years.

134
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,996
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

135
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,364
You know what this is?

136
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,399
It's a corrugator.

137
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,167
It uses steam and salt

138
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:41,600
to crimp kraft paper
for cardboard.

139
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:45,507
And it makes a hell of racket doing it,
which is great, right?

140
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,242
No.

141
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,910
Steam and salt.

142
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:52,346
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

143
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,483
Shit.
It'll ruin the product.

144
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:59,019
Well, you can't just
hop down to Costco

145
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:01,188
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

146
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:05,359
What-- fine. Fine.
Moving on.

147
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:13,266
Spacious, isolated location,

148
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,734
no humidity,

149
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,669
and you get all
the free tortillas you want.

150
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:20,406
That's the special feature
of this place.

151
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,208
Yeah... I don't know.

152
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:24,376
It'll make the tortillas
smell like cat piss.

153
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,045
Somebody's bound to notice that.

154
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,881
All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

155
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:33,017
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

156
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,254
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

157
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:37,188
Anything food-related

158
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,591
is gonna have unannounced
government inspections.

159
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,730
All I'm asking is that
you keep an open mind.

160
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:54,838
Dennis' already set some spaces
behind these keepball games.

161
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,806
No.

162
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,041
Hell, no.

163
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:09,218
I know it's a long shot.

164
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,354
All I can say
to recommend this one

165
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,657
is we're talking about
an owner here who is--

166
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,459
how should I put it--
highly amenable.

167
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,667
Okay. I get it. Just say no,
and we'll go get dinner.

168
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,235
All right.
So I'll start.

169
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,969
No way we're cooking in here.

170
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,072
No space,
nowhere for the smell to go.

171
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,641
Look at that door.

172
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,777
That thing rolls up,
and we're open to the world.

173
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:37,779
I don't know
if anybody noticed,

174
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,080
but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

175
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,082
The hammer comes down,

176
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,319
it's gonna be
Custer's last stand.

177
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,423
It's perfect.

178
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:50,757
What?

179
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,360
How are we gonna fit
a lab in here?

180
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,263
Who said here?

181
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,712
<i>The house is infested.</i>

182
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:15,981
Termites,
cockroaches, whatever.

183
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:19,719
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

184
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:22,587
Truck rolls up,
homeowners leave.

185
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:24,756
The crew tents the house.

186
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,392
They bomb the place
with poison.

187
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,795
The house stays like that
for days.

188
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:31,963
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

189
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,599
Now, maybe there's a strange
smell coming out of it.

190
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,434
Does someone think
to investigate? No.

191
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:39,937
Anyone go inside?
Hell, no.

192
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,275
And that's where we'll cook.

193
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:51,014
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

194
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,282
So we pick the one
that's best for us--

195
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,585
enough floor space,
easy access.

196
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,253
Once the tent is up,

197
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,188
we go in, we cook a batch,

198
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:02,691
we bomb the place, and leave.

199
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:05,962
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

200
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:09,899
Set up the lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

201
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,035
It's challenging but doable.

202
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,339
Tell me about these guys.

203
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:19,241
Uh, Mr. ponytail
on the sidewalk-- that's Ira.

204
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:22,077
He's the owner.
On the roof is Sandor.

205
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,645
The ladder's Fernando,

206
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,313
and down below--
that's Todd.

207
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:26,982
The pest control operation
is legit.

208
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:28,751
I mean, they're licensed,
they're bonded,

209
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,052
they do as good a job
as anyone in town,

210
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:34,555
but they're also top-drawer
second-story men.

211
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,757
"Second-story"?

212
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,925
B&E artists.

213
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,927
They're burglars.

214
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,863
Yeah. I mean, hey,
they play it smart.

215
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:44,231
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

216
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,568
They copy the keys, locate
the valuables and alarms,

217
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,003
and they sell that information
to other crews.

218
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,838
Or, after a decent interval,

219
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,140
they'll come back and lift
the goods themselves.

220
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,075
And you know them how?

221
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,812
Oh, I've been pulling their
chestnuts out of the fire,

222
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,314
legally speaking,
for five years.

223
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,982
Ira and his guys are good.

224
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,183
I mean, they know how
to keep their mouths shut.

225
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,319
And if you buy them,
they're gonna stay bought.

226
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,855
You can check
into them yourself.

227
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,325
I will, if it comes to that.

228
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,161
So, do we take a vote?

229
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,999
Why?

230
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,814
♪

231
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,369
We sound great.
Rock on, man.

232
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,171
Solid.

233
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:03,673
That Yamaha's got
a real nice touch.

234
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:06,676
You like the sound?
It's huge, huh?

235
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,979
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're
looking for something else today.

236
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,513
You got any roadie cases?

237
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:13,515
- For sure, what size?
- Biggest you got.

238
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,118
That'll fit through, like,
a regular-size doorway.

239
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,987
You got it.
Follow me.

240
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,058
Top of the line.

241
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:26,560
Recessed hardware, foam lining,
quarter inch laminated walls,

242
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:29,130
three-inch casters.

243
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:31,399
Height is good, width is good.

244
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,900
How much weight will this hold?

245
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,568
It's rated for 900 pounds.</i>

246
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:37,038
So unless your band plays lead
bricks, you should be okay.

247
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,442
We're gonna need, uh--

248
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,711
Hey, man, I'm trying
to do business over here, bitch.

249
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,016
Sorry. He's, like,
overly enthusiastic.

250
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,185
Anyway, um,
I'm gonna need four of them.

251
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,087
Four?
That gonna be layaway?

252
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:56,256
I need to see
a bunch of IDs for that.

253
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,923
No, man, cash.

254
00:14:57,957 --> 00:15:00,059
Okay. Hey,
uh, you know what?

255
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:03,929
I'll throw in stenciling.
What's your band called?

256
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:15,573
Damn, brother!

257
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:19,277
Not asking no questions, but it sure
looks like you're back in business.

258
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:22,080
No joke. You way back
in business, man.

259
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:25,667
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

260
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:28,619
Oh! You're stacking
the benjies

261
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:31,588
- till the rubber band pops.
- Yeah, yeah.

262
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,857
All's we're saying is,
we know you're major league now.

263
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,893
But if there's ever anything
else you need from us...

264
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:39,329
Any way we can get in
on this at all.

265
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,765
Little stuff, big stuff...

266
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,268
We would be all over it.

267
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,837
You know, uh, maybe someday.

268
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,409
That's cool.

269
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:55,511
I guess we better...
hit it then.

270
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,580
Yeah. Keep on
keeping on, brother.

271
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,549
Later.

272
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,619
Okay, it is the same job as always.

273
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,288
You go out, you inspect,

274
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:08,823
you deal with the customers,
regular drill.

275
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:10,492
Everything's the same

276
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:13,361
except for one
important detail.

277
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,703
- No stealing.
- No stealing.

278
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:25,139
Not a toothpick, not the spare
change between the couch cushions,

279
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,808
not the panties
out of the hamper.

280
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,342
Nothing.
And I mean nothing.

281
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,877
And if you're out
with your buddies

282
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:32,580
and they ask if you got
a hot tip on a B&E,

283
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:34,247
you tell them you got nada.

284
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,249
You're out of the game.
The bottom line is

285
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:39,152
that these houses are out
of bounds now and forever.

286
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,521
Got it?

287
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,523
All right.

288
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:46,359
From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

289
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,962
Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

290
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:51,063
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

291
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,564
You don't
say "good morning."

292
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:56,602
You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

293
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,638
On the other hand,

294
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,606
if they tell you to jump,

295
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,407
you don't ask what for,

296
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,909
you jump.

297
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,511
Now, you need a name for them?

298
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:09,414
You call them "yes, sir"
and "no, sir."

299
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:15,153
You got any problems,
you come to me.

300
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:17,188
Here's the deal...

301
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,223
The finishing tank's
a tight fit.

302
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:21,292
And with this motor
you've got here on top--

303
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,293
The agitation motor.

304
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:25,228
The agitation motor
here on top,

305
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,931
the tank's not gonna
fit in the box.

306
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:29,767
It's just, uh--
it's just too tall.

307
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,135
Now, I thought we'd
put a collar on the tank

308
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,204
and carry
the motor in separately,

309
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,906
alongside the condenser.

310
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:37,908
And on the day, we just kind of

311
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:40,042
twist it into place,

312
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:42,178
you know,
while we're setting up.

313
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,782
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

314
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,851
- That's good.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,786
That will work.

316
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,888
And Joe and his guys
can build it, right?

317
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:55,858
Yeah. You know, they're, uh--
they're up for it.

318
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,694
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminum work.

319
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,629
And, you know,

320
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,664
I figure if they
can pull off the magnet,

321
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,666
they can handle this.

322
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,935
Now, listen,
about the smell--

323
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,071
about keeping it out of people's
drapes and furniture and whatnot--

324
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,172
when I was down in Mexico,
they, uh--

325
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,977
there was this big--
big plastic hospital tent

326
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,546
they set up inside of the...

327
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,848
Oh, shit. Sorry.

328
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,084
Oh, hi. Sorry.

329
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,186
No, no, no.
We were just, uh, wrapping up.

330
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,988
Um, this is my, uh...

331
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:29,789
Friend. Hi. Walt.

332
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,357
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

333
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:34,360
This is,
uh-- this is Brock.

334
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,162
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

335
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:38,064
I've heard a lot about you.

336
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,566
- Hi.
- Hi.

337
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,401
I understand
you were in the hospital

338
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:44,870
and Jesse told me
that you were very brave.

339
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,373
Yeah.
A man of few words.

340
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:50,809
I'm sorry. He mostly just
wants to play his game.

341
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,611
Oh, I know that.

342
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:56,148
I have two of my own.
A boy and a girl.

343
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,351
Well, I should, uh--
I should go.

344
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:02,521
I was thinking I could
make us all some dinner.

345
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,256
Are you sure
you don't wanna--

346
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,791
Yeah. Won't you stay
for a beer at least?

347
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,895
Sure. Why not?
A beer sounds good.

348
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,181
Thank you.

349
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:11,931
<i>- How are you today, sir?
- Hello. We're good. Good. How are you?</i>

350
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,966
- Family all packed up,
ready to go? - Yeah.

351
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,671
Okay, here you're acknowledging
that you've removed all pets

352
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:22,306
and plants from the house
and that food has been removed

353
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:24,976
- or double-sealed in the bags we provided.
- Uh-huh.

354
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:27,278
And this acknowledges
that you've removed or bagged

355
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:29,213
any medicines, tobacco,
and pet foods.

356
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:31,950
Better make sure you got any medicine you
might need for the next couple of days.

357
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,617
- It's already in the car.
- Okay.

358
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:36,954
Holy crap. How much
poison are you using?

359
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:40,290
It's not how much, it's getting
it to where it's needed.

360
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,026
Those are your foggers.

361
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,161
They disperse the fumigate
into the structure

362
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,830
where it'll eliminate
any nymphs or larvae

363
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:52,068
as well as the full-grown blattodea.
So, we have all your keys?

364
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:54,470
Any extras on here
you might wind up needing?

365
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,305
- No. I'm good.
- Okay.

366
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,308
This last one here acknowledges
that you have been informed

367
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,878
that you may not
reenter the premises

368
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,146
until it has cleared
the post-fumigation inspection.

369
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,582
So you're gonna
get them all, right?

370
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,818
We'll kill 'em dead.
That's a guarantee.

371
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,856
Sir?

372
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,390
Sir?

373
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,392
Yes?

374
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:57,963
There's a nanny-cam
in the living room clock.

375
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:01,767
I disabled it.
I just thought you should now.

376
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:05,370
What's your name?

377
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,606
Todd, sir.

378
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,540
<i>Oh!</i>

379
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,076
Cheers.

380
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:17,718
Mmm.

381
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:19,453
You know, I gotta say,

382
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:23,656
seeing you with Andrea
and that little boy...

383
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,992
It was nice.

384
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:29,229
- Yeah. It's good right?
- Yeah.

385
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:33,366
Yeah. And the way she looks at you?

386
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,801
- Oh-ho.
- You think?

387
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:37,737
Oh, definitely.

388
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,443
So, is it, um--
is it moving

389
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,979
in any particular direction?

390
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,747
Uh, I don't know.

391
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,383
Maybe. Yeah. You know,
sometimes I think,

392
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,885
you know,

393
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,286
if it feels right, then...

394
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,155
If it feels right,
it feels right.

395
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,925
Sometimes you just
gotta listen to your gut.

396
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,496
I mean, instant family.

397
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,932
What more can you ask, right?

398
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,068
Absolutely.

399
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,903
<i>Cut the cards.</i>

400
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:17,341
Have you thought about
what your plan is?

401
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:21,178
You know,
vis-a-vis honesty?

402
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,948
What do you mean?
How much she knows about this?

403
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,516
Mm.</i>

404
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,351
Um...

405
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:31,487
She doesn't know anything.

406
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,789
I mean, you know,
she's not stupid.

407
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:36,025
She knows
I'm into something, but--

408
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,494
she could make
a pretty good guess.

409
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:41,063
But I never told her anything.

410
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,064
I'm not gonna.

411
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,766
Okay.

412
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,669
I mean it.

413
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,439
I know you do.

414
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:53,942
Jesse, I can't pretend
that this doesn't affect me.

415
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:58,613
It does. But with everything
that we've been through

416
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:00,614
the two of us...

417
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:03,583
This has to be your decision.

418
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:05,319
I mean, you've earned that.

419
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:09,056
Seriously?

420
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,690
Yeah.

421
00:27:14,162 --> 00:27:16,463
Secrets create barriers

422
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:19,065
between people.

423
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,768
I'm speaking from experience,
believe me.

424
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,569
All that you've done,

425
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:29,208
it's a part of you, and...

426
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:35,147
I mean, if you choose to spend the
rest of your life with this person,

427
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,251
then you'll have to decide

428
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,822
how much you'll share with her.

429
00:27:42,856 --> 00:27:47,059
Meaning what?
Like... everything?

430
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:51,563
Like Gale?

431
00:27:58,337 --> 00:28:01,506
I'm just trying to say
that I trust you,

432
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,442
and I know you'll make
the right call.

433
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:16,820
If she loves you,

434
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:18,889
she'll understand.

435
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,794
They're leaving streaks.

436
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,463
This more ethnic-looking one--
he's doing a great job.

437
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,799
But the other one
is going back and forth

438
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,567
like he's scrubbing a wall.

439
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:35,371
They have to go in circles,

440
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:37,806
or you're going
to leave streaks.

441
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,542
That's pretty basic, right?

442
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,778
Uh, I don't mean
to tell you your business.

443
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,146
It's just-- it's--

444
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,983
it's simple quality control.

445
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:55,088
So, I've got some good news.

446
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,624
Guess what.

447
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:58,626
What?

448
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,662
No, really.
I want you to guess.

449
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:04,532
- Really, I really...
- Okay.

450
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,000
Hank's back at work.

451
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:08,735
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

452
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:11,571
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

453
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:14,974
Merkert and all the rest-- they just
about laughed him out of the office

454
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:18,745
when he told them about
that-- that chicken man.

455
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,581
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

456
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:24,017
If it were me,
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

457
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:26,785
Do I sound bitter?

458
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:28,754
But it's--
it's what he wants, right?

459
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,722
Yeah, it's doing him good.

460
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:34,293
I mean, his PT
is going gangbusters.

461
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:36,228
He's hardly using
his cane at all.

462
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:39,398
And thank you for that, really.

463
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,867
I mean, God knows where he'd be

464
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,770
if we had to go through
his health plan.

465
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:46,772
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

466
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:48,774
So, speaking of which,

467
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:50,508
we have another
big event coming up.

468
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:53,511
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

469
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:55,513
Walt's birthday.

470
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:58,115
Whatever you need, I'm here.

471
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:00,785
Mm, yeah. I, um...

472
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:03,187
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

473
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:04,688
What are you talking about?

474
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:07,357
Of course we're
gonna do something.

475
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:10,961
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

476
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:12,629
I...

477
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:14,631
So it's been a whole year.

478
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,067
Listen, I've had
my problems with Walt.

479
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:19,502
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically beg--

480
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,571
Whatever.
Water under the bridge.

481
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,207
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

482
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,841
What are you doing?

483
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:29,678
You don't smoke.

484
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,713
You haven't smoked
since college.

485
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,582
You can't be serious!

486
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,383
With the baby and Walt?

487
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,419
Skyler, you're not smoking
around the baby, are you?

488
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,087
And you can't smoke here.

489
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:41,977
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

490
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:44,741
You can't force your
employees to breathe--

491
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,428
I know for a fact
that that is illegal.

492
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:48,497
Marie, shut up.

493
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,164
What?

494
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,533
I'm sorry. Please don't
speak to me like that.

495
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,435
- I am simply saying that you--
- Will you shut up?

496
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:57,104
- Hey--
- Shut the hell up.

497
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:59,573
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Skyler...

498
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,708
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop--

499
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:04,411
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

500
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,546
Shut up! Shut up!

501
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,714
Shut up!

502
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,371
That's a 5.23.

503
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,307
5.23.

504
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:26,410
Last one.

505
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,614
5.26.

506
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,716
5.26.

507
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,287
That comes to 49.27.

508
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:40,389
Good yield, right?

509
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,659
That is an excellent yield.

510
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:49,932
All right.

511
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:26,299
Hey Marie.

512
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:30,770
How you doing?

513
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:36,242
Where is Skyler?

514
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:37,810
In the bedroom.
She's resting.

515
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:41,446
Is everything okay?

516
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,617
Breakdown? What does that--
what does that mean?

517
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,613
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

518
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:49,155
But I've never seen her
like that, ever.

519
00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:53,826
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

520
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,894
Nothing.

521
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:59,630
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

522
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:01,499
Did you know she's smoking?

523
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,434
Occasionally, maybe.

524
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:06,470
It's not a regular thing.

525
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:09,174
Oh, I just wish
I had gotten your message.

526
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,075
"Messages," Walt.

527
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,377
Plural. I probably
called you five times.

528
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:21,484
I'm not leaving here until I
know what's got her so upset.

529
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:28,658
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

530
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:31,060
Please, God, tell me
the cancer isn't back.

531
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,898
No. It's not the cancer.

532
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,499
Well, something happened.

533
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:43,339
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

534
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:45,606
It's time to tell me
the truth, Walt. All of it.

535
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:48,844
I mean it.

536
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:52,013
You're right.

537
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,421
You heard about Ted Beneke?

538
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,423
The accident?

539
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,192
What accident?

540
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:07,194
Oh...

541
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:09,296
Um...

542
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:11,732
A couple weeks back,

543
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,568
Ted took a fall--
a bad one.

544
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:16,636
He gave himself a concussion,

545
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:19,272
and, uh, fractured
a couple vertebrae.

546
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:21,440
He's still in the hospital.

547
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:23,376
He may never walk again.

548
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,678
Oh, my God.
I-- I didn't--

549
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:28,081
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

550
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:29,815
Yeah.

551
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,652
But that couldn't explain...
Skyler's--

552
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:39,892
Uh... Yes.
Yes, it could.

553
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,465
You do know, right?
You...

554
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,833
You must know.

555
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,438
Oh, God.

556
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:59,143
She was having an affair...

557
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:01,145
with Ted Beneke?

558
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,514
Listen, listen.
It wasn't--

559
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:05,815
it-- it wasn't...

560
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:09,019
ongoing or anything, and...

561
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:13,056
Well, Skyler and I
have been trying

562
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,591
to put things back together.

563
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:21,696
And then-- then the accident
happened, and she got...

564
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,801
Marie, I'm begging you.

565
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:27,303
Please, keep this to yourself.

566
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:29,538
I don't want Hank
to think less of her...

567
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,240
or me.

568
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,511
When did you, um...

569
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:40,949
Was she--
I'm gonna go.

570
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:43,550
Okay. All right.

571
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:07,739
Thank you.

572
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,208
- I'm just...
- Yeah.

573
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:46,276
<i>Ouch! That looked nasty.</i>

574
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:07,762
Hey, you okay?

575
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:09,731
I'm good.

576
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,536
Really?

577
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,938
Yeah.

578
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,252
<i>Aahh!</i>

579
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,968
<i>Come on. You want</i>
<i>to fuck with me?</i>

580
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,603
<i>Okay.</i>

581
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,439
<i>You little cockroaches.</i>

582
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:59,511
Okay. Come on.
Wait. Wait for it.

583
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:01,846
- This is it.
- Wait. Wait for it.

584
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:04,049
Wait.

585
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,452
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>
<i>Okay!</i>

586
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,852
"Say hello to my little friend!"

587
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,524
Nice, just...

588
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,194
Hey, mom, uh, feeling better?

589
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:19,130
Hey. Hey, why don't you join
us, if you feel up to it?

590
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:22,066
We have popcorn.
I think there's some pizza left.

591
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,367
If you're up to it.

592
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:26,136
Yeah, mom. Join us.

593
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,508
- Oh, my God. Look. Look.
<i>- You whores!</i>

594
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,276
This... oh.

595
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,512
Everyone dies in
this movie, don't they?

596
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,583
Ahh!

597
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,390
Okay.

598
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:52,595
For you and you and me.
367,000 dollars each.

599
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,564
Ooh. Wait a minute.

600
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,100
After the dealers
got their cut,

601
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:04,039
we should be looking
at 1,379,560.

602
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,540
Mike, you're short.

603
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,977
You're almost 300,000 short.

604
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,646
You're forgetting
about the mules.

605
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,313
They get a flat 20%.

606
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:13,981
- The what?
- The drivers.

607
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:17,352
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

608
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,024
And so, transportation
is worth 20%?

609
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,193
They are taking a risk.

610
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:31,031
$275,000 worth of risk?

611
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:34,201
Wow.

612
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:36,470
What did Gus pay his mules?

613
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:39,306
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

614
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,807
He didn't need them.

615
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:43,677
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

616
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:47,393
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

617
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,266
And you know
where they are now?

618
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:51,684
Government impound.

619
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:54,687
You don't like paying 20%?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

620
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:55,921
Hey, hey, hey.

621
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:58,257
There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

622
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,025
That's for one cook.

623
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,860
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade,

624
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:04,862
my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

625
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:07,098
The methylamine
was free this time.

626
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,600
But brace yourself,

627
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:11,469
because the next barrel
is gonna cost big.

628
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:16,074
Can we continue, or you got
anymore burning questions?

629
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:21,078
Okay, kid.

630
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:24,748
You fronted us 120,000
to get us going.

631
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:31,888
So that's 40,000
from him and me.

632
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:34,156
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

633
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:35,425
Okay.

634
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:39,962
Now, Ira gets 110,000
for our piece of the business

635
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:42,632
and 25,000 per cook.

636
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,701
That is 45,000...

637
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:48,003
from each of us.

638
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:56,778
Ira's guys get
10,000 each per cook.

639
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:06,454
Goodman's cut--
18,000 from each.

640
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:17,097
Legacy cost--

641
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:19,433
$351,000.

642
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:21,368
That's 117,000 each.

643
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:22,835
"Legacy cost"?

644
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,971
I got nine guys.

645
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:27,974
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

646
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,376
and they know a lot.

647
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,278
And right now,
some of them are in jail

648
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:33,146
and more will be soon.

649
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,415
The feds Rico-ed
their hazard pay,

650
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:38,617
so <i>we</i> are gonna make 'em whole.

651
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,620
<i>"We</i> are gonna make them whole"?

652
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:43,622
What is this "we"?

653
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:45,991
These were Gus's employees,
not ours.

654
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,260
They might have been
Gus's employees,

655
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,429
but they're my guys.

656
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:54,460
So what are they doing
to further our interests?

657
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,714
The cops are looking
at them very closely.

658
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:01,039
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

659
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:05,143
So we are paying them, why?

660
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:09,313
Because it's what you do.

661
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,182
Ohh.

662
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:13,617
It's what you do.

663
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:18,923
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.

664
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:20,858
We make 'em whole.

665
00:42:20,892 --> 00:42:23,627
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

666
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:25,128
Huh.

667
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:27,396
It sounds like
a simple shakedown,

668
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:29,398
simple as that.

669
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,334
We're paying for their silence.

670
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:33,269
That's blackmail.

671
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:37,606
Business is my end.

672
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,076
This is business.
End of story.

673
00:42:42,378 --> 00:42:44,412
This is your problem.

674
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:46,348
It should come out of your end.

675
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:48,951
Hey. Hey.
Just take it out of mine.

676
00:42:49,953 --> 00:42:52,888
All right?
Go for it.

677
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:56,024
I don't care.
Just take it.

678
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:05,958
No...

679
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,459
Jesse, thank you,

680
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:09,503
but... no.

681
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:11,205
I'll pay my share.

682
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:14,174
Go ahead.

683
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:21,934
Let me tell you something.

684
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:26,186
This...

685
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,221
is how it's gonna be

686
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:31,223
from here on out.

687
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:35,594
My guys are ongoing expenditure

688
00:43:35,628 --> 00:43:39,731
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

689
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:51,976
137,000.

690
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,115
That's less than with Fring.

691
00:43:58,117 --> 00:43:59,583
Listen, Walter.

692
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:02,652
Just because
you shot Jesse James...

693
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:05,989
don't make you Jesse James.

694
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,017
Tomorrow.

695
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:32,615
So how are you feeling?

696
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,483
Okay, I guess.

697
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:39,321
Broke it off with Andrea.

698
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:41,156
I had to.

699
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,828
She's gonna tell Brock.

700
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:48,330
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

701
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:50,331
It's the right thing to do,
but, you know--

702
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:52,066
I meant this.

703
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,802
How are you feeling
about the money?

704
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:56,904
You're looking at it wrong.

705
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:58,573
When we worked for Gus,

706
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,875
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

707
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:03,410
This last batch was great,

708
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,812
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

709
00:45:05,847 --> 00:45:09,415
We maybe cleared less money, but
we got a bigger piece of the pie.

710
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,286
It's like you said,
now we're owners,

711
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,254
not employees.

712
00:45:18,392 --> 00:45:21,560
I've been thinking
about Victor.

713
00:45:21,595 --> 00:45:23,328
Yeah?

714
00:45:23,363 --> 00:45:28,100
Yeah. All this time

715
00:45:28,134 --> 00:45:31,336
I was sure that
Gus did what he did

716
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:33,372
to send me a message.

717
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,643
Maybe there's another reason.

718
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:40,545
Like what?

719
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:46,116
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

720
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,952
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

721
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:54,525
Maybe he flew
too close to the sun,

722
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,693
got his throat cut.

723
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:31,868
