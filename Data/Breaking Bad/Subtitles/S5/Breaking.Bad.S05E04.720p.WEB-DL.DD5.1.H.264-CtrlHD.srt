1
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:03,994
I gotta say,
when you first brought her in,

2
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:05,528
I had my doubts.

3
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:09,031
But your little darling's
got nine lives.

4
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:16,105
Rear-wheel assembly took the
brunt of the impact, so, uh...

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,506
Yeah.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,309
CV shaft, boots,
joints, axle--

7
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:22,676
Replaced all of it.
No way around it.

8
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:25,579
I went after market
on most of the parts here.

9
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:28,216
You want me to swap in
factory parts, that's fine.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,951
But using after-market's the only
way we'll keep it under blue book

11
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:34,222
and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

12
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,224
Nothing beats free.

13
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:38,825
Uh, swapped out
your air filter,

14
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,328
topped off your fluids.

15
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,781
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

16
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:45,241
I know, right?

17
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,367
Oh, and I noticed you had

18
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:49,569
some sort of gunky buildup

19
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,571
in the front end here.

20
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,373
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

21
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,175
Then I remembered
that you had me replace

22
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,259
that front fender
a few months back

23
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,109
when you ran over that deer.

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,548
We went at it
with the steam hose,

25
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,383
cleaned it up for you.

26
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:07,719
Hardest part was the paint.

27
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:10,588
Fern green.
Interesting tint.

28
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:12,323
Anything else?

29
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:15,460
That's it.
Zero balance, like I said.

30
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:18,530
Sign here, you're good to go.

31
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,599
People like to joke,

32
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:27,171
but I really, really like this car.
She's sturdy hell.

33
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:30,574
I'm betting you get another
200,000 miles out of her.

34
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,430
Hey, Benny.

35
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,832
What would you give me for it?

36
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,568
What's the blue book, you mean?

37
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:03,605
No. I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

38
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,274
Well, I'm not
really looking for--

39
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:08,643
$100?

40
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:10,245
Fifty?

41
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:13,147
Insurance company just shelled
out 1,900 for the parts alone.

42
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:15,149
Then it's a bargain.

43
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:18,552
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

44
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,454
You sure about this?

45
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:21,822
Sure as shooting.

46
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:24,992
I'll check the register.

47
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:26,627
Dad?

48
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:30,130
Fifty bucks?
Are you crazy?

<i>- Fifty One -</i>

51
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,805
Gotta be kidding me.

52
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,362
Oh, Christ.

53
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,247
I'm at work right now.

54
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:00,937
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

55
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,039
<i>This is a heads-up.</i>
<i>You got visitors.</i>

56
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:06,642
Visitors? What--
You mean today?

57
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:09,311
<i>I mean 30 seconds.</i>

58
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:15,884
Come in.

59
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:20,488
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

60
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:24,417
Agent Hank Schrader,
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

61
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,115
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

62
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,864
Uh, yes, we did.

63
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:32,066
What can I do for you?

64
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:12,027
Navy plants,
powder-blue shirt.

65
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,616
Hey, buddy.

66
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,312
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- They got Ron.

67
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:01,382
- Ron's done.
<i>- Okay.</i>

68
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,451
No. No.

69
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,620
Not okay, Mike.

70
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,689
Not okay. The--

71
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,524
The look he just gave me

72
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:13,060
was the very antithesis
of "okay," okay?

73
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,461
<i>Breathe, Lydia.</i>

74
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:16,854
<i>No one's talking to the police.</i>

75
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,805
I just had like 14 DEA agents

76
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,570
barge into my office,
screaming and yelling at me,

77
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:25,873
and they were swarming
all over the warehouse, okay?

78
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:27,374
The warehouse!

79
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:29,776
Besides, Ron was my guy.

80
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,711
Remember?
I don't have a guy anymore.

81
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,170
Ron fixed security and pulled
the barrels and drove the truck.

82
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,949
You can't expect me
to do that stuff.

83
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,451
I mean, let's be realistic.

84
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:47,325
- Mike, this is crazy.
- I'll send a new guy.

85
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,519
Are you crazy?

86
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,253
My car almost has
500 horsepower.

87
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:20,090
- It would totally smoke.
- Horsepower isn't everything.

88
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,591
Don't you know that?

89
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,929
You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension

90
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,931
and weight of the car.

91
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,366
And listen, one more factor that
you're not thinking about--

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,034
The experience of the driver.

93
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,836
- And I totally got you there.
- Please. Please.

94
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,304
- I got you.
- You drive like a geezer.

95
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,140
Really?
I drive like a gee--

96
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,876
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?
I don't think so.

97
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,582
Bullshit you ever did donuts.

98
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,045
Whoa.
Watch your language.

99
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,379
- And, yes, I did.
- Seriously?

100
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,381
Yes, seriously.
And if you show me

101
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:49,817
just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

102
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,153
- Yeah? Yes?
- No.

103
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,221
- No, I won't. I take that back.
- Yes. Yes. No--

104
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,390
- Just a joke. I'm just--
- You're saying yes.

105
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,791
No! No, no.
That was kidding.

106
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,960
- We didn't shake on it. No.
- Yes. Yes.

107
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,561
- We are now.
- That doesn't count!

108
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,565
I know you don't approve.

109
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:13,273
But mine... we'll call it a
birthday present to myself.

110
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,307
And Junior's...

111
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,510
People will just chalk that up

112
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:21,080
as me being a softy.

113
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,551
And besides...

114
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:28,320
I didn't actually buy
either one.

115
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:32,223
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

116
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:34,225
Okay?

117
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,895
Oh.

118
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,107
We can afford it now.
Hmm?

119
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,511
You're back at it.

120
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,747
Well, yeah.

121
00:09:56,781 --> 00:10:00,851
We have to make up
that 600,000 we lost.

122
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:15,031
What do you think
about boarding school?

123
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,033
Boarding school?

124
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,335
For who--
For Junior?

125
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,938
There's this place
in northern Arizona,

126
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:24,940
and it's supposed to be

127
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,308
one of the top ten
in the country.

128
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,879
He's a year away from college.

129
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:34,381
Why on earth would we do that?

130
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:37,484
I don't know.
I just...

131
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:39,787
Just thinking about the kids.

132
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,656
Mmm. Holly, too?

133
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,292
Where are we sending
our eight-month-old?

134
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:48,996
Peace corps?

135
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,030
No. I just...

136
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,735
A new environment

137
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,004
might be good for them.

138
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:00,039
What does that mean?

139
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,658
What's wrong with
their environment?

140
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,747
Skyler...

141
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,786
What's wrong
with their environment?

142
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,390
Nothing.

143
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:26,831
Hey.

144
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:31,582
Listen, I know these
last few weeks

145
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,671
have been rough.

146
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,339
The threat to Hank

147
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,141
and this whole thing
with Beneke.

148
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:42,145
But there's absolutely nothing

149
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,848
for you to be afraid of
anymore, okay?

150
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,850
I mean, clear sailing
from here on out.

151
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,751
I promise.

152
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:53,089
You know, I want us to try

153
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:56,192
and start looking forward
to things again.

154
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,162
Speaking of which, my birthday.

155
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,697
Hmm?

156
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:03,199
I don't know--

157
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,201
I don't know
what you have planned,

158
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:09,138
and with everything
that's been going on lately,

159
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,572
I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

160
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:14,582
But I think

161
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,745
a little celebration
might be good.

162
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,981
For all of us.

163
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:24,352
You know, a birthday party.

164
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:27,754
What do you think?

165
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,558
Yeah?

166
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,160
Okay.

167
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:36,330
And maybe, if I may be so bold,

168
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:39,823
chocolate cake
with chocolate icing?

169
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,406
Life is good, Skyler.

170
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,543
Ohh...

171
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:05,917
Mmm. Thank you.

172
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,132
Hey, mom, you forgot something.

173
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,562
- Hmm?
- Dad's bacon.

174
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:12,464
That's okay.
I can do it.

175
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,499
No. Mom has to.

176
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:20,105
Well, it is
sort of a tradition.

177
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,777
Watch this, Holly.

178
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,212
Watch what she does with bacon.

179
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:31,682
Watch it. Watch it.

180
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:34,485
What is she doing?

181
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,821
What is she doing?
Hmm?

182
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:43,660
That's a pretty small "1."

183
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,662
Kind of is.

184
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:48,665
Just a little.

185
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,569
Ah, now you're talking.

186
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:55,037
- No. No.
- Good move.

187
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,805
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

188
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,807
Very good.
Family teamwork.

189
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,110
Making sacrifices.
Very important.

190
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,412
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Thank you, buddy.

191
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,014
You want some?

192
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:07,350
Guy's some piece
of work, isn't he?

193
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:09,184
Six feet under
and half a face--

194
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:11,019
he's still screwing with us.

195
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,455
So, what's next?

196
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,523
Oh, I don't know.

197
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,892
This Madrigal thing seems
hinky, though, you know?

198
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:21,429
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
over here in Germany,

199
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:24,165
and 5,000 miles away,
you got this guy.

200
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,166
There's gotta be someone
in the middle, you know?

201
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:28,302
Someone we're missing.

202
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:34,207
What about that, uh,
Lydia what's-her-name?

203
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,042
You know, lady banjo eyes
at the warehouse?

204
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,411
In this world?
No way.

205
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,046
Too uptight.
Too together.

206
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,448
Maybe.

207
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,751
She was wearing
mismatched shoes.

208
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:47,053
How together can she be?

209
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,559
Gentlemen,
how goes it with Fring?

210
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,096
You know, just, uh,
working through the grief.

211
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,166
How soon before
you submit a final?

212
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,136
Well, we've been
kicking around some ideas.

213
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,170
Had you asked me that
a couple of weeks ago,

214
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,373
- I'd have said this was
just a mop-up job, but... - But?

215
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,043
Well, no one on Fring's crew
is talking to us.

216
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,278
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

217
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,847
Which makes it likely there's somebody
out there keeping them in line.

218
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,451
Our money is on this guy--
Michael Ehrmantraut.

219
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,553
He's Fring's head
of "corporate" security.

220
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,556
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

221
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,059
We're putting together a
surveillance team as we speak.

222
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,194
Okay?
The other thing is--

223
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:35,166
This may be unrelated, but the blue meth
is... is making a bit of a comeback.

224
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,334
- Tell him, Gomie. - Yeah. Some small
amounts on the street-side pulls.

225
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,403
Lab's telling us
it's the same stuff.

226
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,638
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out,

227
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:46,176
or it could be
somebody's rebooting,

228
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,113
using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

229
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,814
I thought we had
Fring's cooks--

230
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:53,848
the unsubs in the lab fire.

231
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,951
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

232
00:15:56,986 --> 00:16:00,322
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.

233
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:03,458
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

234
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,429
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

235
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,101
Hank, I gotta say,

236
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:17,471
your work here
has been stellar.

237
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,473
Really first rate.

238
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,309
Thank you, sir.

239
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:24,612
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

240
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,947
You know, I have to
get back to El Paso.

241
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:30,550
This office needs an ASAC,

242
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:32,985
and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

243
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,154
If you were to put in
an application,

244
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,592
and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

245
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,827
I have no doubt this DO
would be well served

246
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,395
with you at the helm.

247
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,265
Wow. That's, uh...

248
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,335
I'm not sure what to say.

249
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:51,337
It's a big step up.

250
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:53,105
It's not without its headaches.

251
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,906
Politics may take
some getting used to.

252
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,342
Plus, you'd be overseeing
every case in the office,

253
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:59,244
so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days,

254
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:00,778
Fring included.

255
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,715
Much as I hate losing
a good field man,

256
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,284
that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

257
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,820
What do you say, Hank?

258
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,124
You want it?

259
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,293
Well,

260
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,695
considering my wife would
murder me if I said "no"...

261
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,600
Yeah. I want it.

262
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,835
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

263
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,912
Can you, uh,

264
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:39,315
finish up for me?

265
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,784
It's-- it's my birthday.

266
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:44,820
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

267
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:47,322
I probably have
a birthday party

268
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,824
waiting for me, you know, so...

269
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:53,227
Uh, yeah. Cool.
Yeah, no problem.

270
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:55,530
Hey, uh, happy birthday.

271
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,466
Thanks.

272
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:23,589
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

273
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:32,899
Where's your mom?

274
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:35,334
Uh, kitchen.

275
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,875
Hey.

276
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:44,676
Oh, hey.

277
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,249
So, what's the plan?

278
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:54,452
Um, Hank and Marie
are on their way,

279
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:57,488
roast chicken and potatoes
for dinner,

280
00:18:57,522 --> 00:18:59,290
rocky road for desert,

281
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:05,230
and, uh, chocolate cake,
as requested.

282
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:20,210
What's up?

283
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,211
Me?

284
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,713
Nothing.

285
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:29,051
Thought you'd be more jazzed
about the new job.

286
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,220
No! What--
No! I am!

287
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,489
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay...

288
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:36,325
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

289
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:43,098
Marie, you've been moping
around the last few days.

290
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,301
Marie?

291
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,072
What's up?

292
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,608
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I...

293
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,610
I made a promise to someone.

294
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,247
To who?

295
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,885
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

296
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,390
Are you gonna give me
a hint at least?

297
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:12,258
It involves infidelity.
That's all I'm gonna say.

298
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:18,531
Oh, shit.
I knew it.

299
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,069
Knew what? What did you--
What did you know?

300
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,671
Well, I mean, I didn't know it,
but I've been saying it forever.

301
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:28,907
Walt's second cell phone,
you know?

302
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:31,343
Sorry, babe, but I was way
ahead of you on this one.

303
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,880
Way ahead of me.
Oh.

304
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,252
Well, it wasn't Walt.

305
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,356
Skyler?

306
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:51,095
No way.

307
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:57,335
Hey.

308
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:00,170
- Hey! There she is!
- Hey! Hi!

309
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:02,105
- Hey!
- Hey!

310
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,474
- Hey, buddy. Yeah.
- Welcome. Welcome.

311
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,475
Happy birthday!

312
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:10,313
I'm in the center lane
going about 60,

313
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:13,283
and I had no choice but just
tear butt out of there.

314
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,650
Just bwaaa!
So sweet.

315
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:17,719
Yeah, you know, highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

316
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:19,654
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

317
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,523
You'll help me out,
right, Uncle Hank,

318
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:23,525
now that you run the DEA?

319
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,761
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled brat
car wash millionaire nephew?

320
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:29,498
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

321
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,233
All right.

322
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:35,069
- Well, I'm outta here.
- Okay.

323
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,138
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

324
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:41,409
- Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
- Thanks.

325
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:43,378
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

326
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:45,013
- All right. Have fun.
- Bye, drive safe.

327
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,107
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

328
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,449
- Slow down.
- Never.

329
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,859
A hell of a couple cars
there, Walt.

330
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:02,028
Honey, for my next birthday,

331
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:03,829
I'm gonna take
a page here from Walt

332
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:06,132
and buy myself a jet plane.

333
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,834
Well, maybe
I over did it a little.

334
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:10,769
But with these
new lease rates--

335
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:13,406
I mean,
they're mighty attractive.

336
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:24,282
Great dinner, Skyler.

337
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:27,752
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I tell you.

338
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,221
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

339
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:31,556
How do you do that?

340
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,044
- A potato ricer.
- A ricer?

341
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,728
You don't hand mash?

342
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:41,665
No.

343
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,975
- Well, uh...
- Boy, it has...

344
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:56,011
It has been quite a year, huh?

345
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:58,013
Do you know that, uh,

346
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,350
it's almost exactly a year ago

347
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:03,386
that I got my diagnosis?

348
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,321
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

349
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:08,290
- Seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's, uh...

350
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:11,793
One year ago tomorrow.

351
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:14,529
Day after my 50th.

352
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,929
Honestly, I never thought
I'd make it this far.

353
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:23,304
The cancer and surgery

354
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:25,939
and Hank being shot--

355
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:27,741
It's just...

356
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:30,211
So many dark days.

357
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,346
Well...

358
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,483
There's Marie's talking pillow.

359
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:38,351
Remember that?

360
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,052
It was...

361
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,256
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

362
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:49,929
I think I was too scared

363
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:51,797
or too angry or...

364
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:55,134
I don't know.
I just wanted to quit.

365
00:23:56,336 --> 00:24:00,305
But you guys--
You got me through it somehow.

366
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,308
Kept me going.

367
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:08,313
And that happened again
and again and again.

368
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:10,948
I mean, there were times

369
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,452
when I was sure I was done for.

370
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,854
But then someone

371
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,056
or something

372
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,494
would come through for me.

373
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,396
God. And Skyler--
I can't--

374
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,166
Honey, remember that
first week of chemotherapy?

375
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,601
That night
on the bathroom floor?

376
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,935
What you said to me?

377
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:37,908
I was so sick.

378
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:41,343
It was rough going at first.

379
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:43,445
But Skyler--

380
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,881
She was right there, of course,

381
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:48,850
putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

382
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:50,951
And she's singing to me.

383
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:54,255
And this would go on and on,

384
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,957
day after day.

385
00:24:56,992 --> 00:25:00,628
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom,

386
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:05,332
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

387
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:08,335
And my head
was in Skyler's lap,

388
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:11,572
and I was just asking her

389
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:14,274
if this could all be over.

390
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:19,979
It was too hard. It was...
I just wanted it to stop.

391
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,715
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

392
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,587
Whoa. Hey-o. Pool party.

393
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:30,856
What are you doing, Skyler?

394
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,492
What is she doing?
Walt?

395
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:36,529
Hey, uh, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

396
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:37,895
What do you think?

397
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,031
Skyler, Hank asked you
a question.

398
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:43,735
You need to get out n--
Skyler!

399
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:46,070
She's gonna come up, right?

400
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:47,521
She has to.

401
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,081
Skyler, you need to get out.

402
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:13,382
Oh, my God.

403
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:16,051
Wha-- Okay.

404
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,987
Okay. It's gotta be...

405
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:24,660
Nope.

406
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:27,496
Okay...

407
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:30,498
Come on!
How am I supposed to...

408
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:45,612
Hey.

409
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,180
Wait.

410
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:50,183
Wait, wait.
Who are you?

411
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:53,053
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the--

412
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,055
Hold on. Hold on.

413
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,857
Who sent you?

414
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:59,960
Who sent me?
Who do you think?

415
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:04,664
- No. I'm asking you.
- Mike...

416
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:06,131
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

417
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,334
And this Mike person--

418
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,470
What's his last name?

419
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,073
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico,

420
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:15,842
and I got
a 900-mile drive back.

421
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,243
That's 14 hours
if I don't stop.

422
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:21,613
So, the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

423
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:28,920
Uh, Ehrmantraut.

424
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:31,623
Okay? Satisfied?

425
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,662
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
apologize for being careful.

426
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:40,664
With all that's been happening
around here, for all I knew,

427
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,867
you were one of those undercover
people they send into high schools.

428
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:46,937
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day if
we're getting ganged by prison guards.

429
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:48,972
Oh, no doubt.

430
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,740
So, uh,
where's the--

431
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:53,276
Up there.
Number 22356.

432
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,412
That's the one I erased
from the inventory,

433
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:57,447
so it has to be that one.

434
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:01,384
- Can you reach it?
- With a forklift.

435
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:03,085
You got one?

436
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:25,773
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Stop!

437
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,878
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

438
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:32,379
What?

439
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:35,483
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

440
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:56,201
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

441
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,771
No. No, of course not.

442
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,608
No, no.

443
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,643
I just...

444
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:15,186
She and I are
having some issues.

445
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,890
Yeah, yeah. I, uh--
I might've heard

446
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,925
a little bit about that.

447
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,195
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

448
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,196
You know, said that,

449
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,465
you know, you guys were...

450
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,401
having some issues.

451
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:37,941
So, uh, what's the next move?

452
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,277
It may be good to have
her talk to someone.

453
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,279
- Oh, I agree.
- Yeah.

454
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:46,148
Well, I'm gonna
get on that first thing.

455
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:47,483
Yeah.

456
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:50,019
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

457
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:53,188
She seems really happy
with him.

458
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:55,190
Not that Marie's
an advertisement

459
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:57,792
for advanced mental health
or anything.

460
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,595
You know...

461
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,798
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

462
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,271
Some birthday, huh?

463
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:23,382
She's gonna try
and get some sleep.

464
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,418
Oh, okay.

465
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:32,625
What was that?

466
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,862
- I don't know.
- I mean, was she trying...?

467
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:39,064
No, not in
a swimming pool. No.

468
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:41,700
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

469
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:46,337
But, uh, we both, uh,

470
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:48,674
think that...

471
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:52,077
she should talk to someone.

472
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:55,446
I'm gonna get you
Dave's number.

473
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,048
Okay.

474
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,753
Listen, Walt, I--

475
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:05,355
I can't help but sense

476
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,758
that there may be some issues

477
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:09,726
between you and Skyler.

478
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,828
None of our business,
of course.

479
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:14,631
And, Hank, I don't know if you

480
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,067
- picked up on any of--
- He knows--

481
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:19,469
He knows I know.

482
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:30,278
These things happen
in a marriage,

483
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:32,894
but it isn't unfixable.

484
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:37,786
I think what would
be great is if

485
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:40,922
you two had some space

486
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:44,358
to work through this stuff.

487
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:45,893
So--

488
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:50,064
And keep an open mind here.

489
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:53,234
What if we took the kids
for a while?

490
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:56,604
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

491
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,774
We'll look after them for a
day or two, or however long,

492
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:04,144
and leave you and Skyler

493
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:06,446
to look after each other.

494
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,915
Uh, that's very generous
of you, Marie,

495
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,485
but I-- I just don't see
how that's a solution.

496
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,287
And-- I mean--

497
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:19,491
Besides, Junior and Holly--
That's a lot of work.

498
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:21,293
No, it isn't.

499
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:23,295
Junior's independent,

500
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:26,732
and my niece
is only the easiest,

501
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,901
most delicious baby
that was ever born.

502
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:32,070
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah.

503
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:33,071
Yeah.

504
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:35,073
Absolutely. Yeah.

505
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:36,741
It's a good idea.

506
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:39,110
I think it's a great idea.

507
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:43,114
Just the thing for both of you.

508
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:51,188
Marie,

509
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:54,664
this idea--

510
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,258
was it yours?

511
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,129
Actually, it was Skyler's.

512
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:04,801
Uh-huh.

513
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:07,570
She really needs this, Walt.

514
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,507
Yep.

515
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:22,718
I gave Marie bottles.

516
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:26,321
They'll stop and pick up
diapers on their way.

517
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:29,457
I spoke with Junior
on the phone,

518
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:31,659
and after much discussion,

519
00:33:31,694 --> 00:33:34,161
he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes.

520
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:38,933
And so, voila, the kids
are out of this environment.

521
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,936
What a coincidence.

522
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,705
I know you're awake.

523
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:52,746
What was that about?
Can you explain it?

524
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:58,017
I don't want the children
here anymore.

525
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,053
It isn't safe.

526
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:05,057
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

527
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:07,059
It has never been more safe.

528
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:08,994
"Never been"?

529
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:12,164
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house

530
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:14,633
to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

531
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,302
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

532
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:19,504
And I dealt with him.
It's over.

533
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,005
It is not.

534
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,374
You're right back
in the meth business again.

535
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:26,778
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

536
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:29,713
So wait.
Now that you're in charge,

537
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:33,409
it's what, it's gonna be smooth
sailing from here on out?

538
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,820
I don't see why not.

539
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:38,789
I keep the work
at work, Skyler,

540
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:41,224
and nothing will ever impact
you or the kids.

541
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,527
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

542
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:47,063
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

543
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:49,465
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

544
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,102
I thought you were the danger.

545
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:02,178
Is that what
your pool stunt was about?

546
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:04,880
Trying to protect
my children from me?

547
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:06,949
Not just you...

548
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:09,150
There's blood on my hands too.

549
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:11,920
What blood? Beneke?

550
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:14,779
He's in the hospital
because of me.

551
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:17,064
- No.
- Because of what I did.

552
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,027
Skyler, you can't beat
yourself up over this thing.

553
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:21,863
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

554
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:24,365
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control,

555
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:27,067
but you did what you had to do
to protect your family.

556
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,536
And I'm sorry.
That doesn't make you a bad person,

557
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,238
it makes you a human being.

558
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:34,808
Stop it, Walt.
Just stop.

559
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,344
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

560
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,912
I'm in it now.

561
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:41,480
I'm compromised.
But I won't--

562
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,450
I will not have my children
living in a house

563
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:46,385
where dealing drugs

564
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:48,787
and hurting people
and killing people

565
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:51,457
is shrugged off
as "shit happens."

566
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:53,525
We're back at it?
Fine.

567
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,283
But the kids stay away,
and that's that.

568
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,356
That's that?
That's what?

569
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:00,765
I got them out of this house.

570
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:03,101
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

571
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,370
They spend a day or two,

572
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:08,106
Junior stays up late watching
movies, and then what happens?

573
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,741
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

574
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:13,531
They come home.
To this house.

575
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:14,678
To their parents who love them.

576
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:17,214
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

577
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:20,851
- How many times do I have to say
that they are not in-- - I said no.

578
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:24,275
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

579
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:33,529
What are you gonna do
to stop it?

580
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:39,907
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

581
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:41,676
Like what? I mean, specificly.

582
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,239
What is your next move?

583
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:45,540
My next move
is maybe I hurt myself.

584
00:36:45,574 --> 00:36:47,675
Make it clear
we need more time.

585
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,245
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

586
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,880
No, more like
you're still struggling.

587
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,316
So maybe next time,
I have you committed.

588
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,952
Put you in some
inpatient facility

589
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,787
while I take care
of the kids myself.

590
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:00,789
Is that what you want?

591
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:04,358
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck,

592
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:06,360
give myself a black eye,

593
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,095
say that you beat me

594
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,932
when you found out
about my lover.

595
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:15,403
I see.

596
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,737
So you want to involve Ted?

597
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,239
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

598
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,774
bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

599
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,710
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

600
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,580
that his father
is a wife-beater.

601
00:37:27,614 --> 00:37:30,116
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

602
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:32,852
I could send Junior
away to school.

603
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:35,162
Oh. Now here's
the conversation...

604
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,430
"So, honey, I know you've
only got one year left in high school,

605
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:41,126
but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

606
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:44,330
leave all your friends behind, and
go to boarding school in Arizona."

607
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:46,865
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

608
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:48,924
a solution to your problem.

609
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,113
How are you going
to save our kids

610
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:53,871
from this terrible environment?

611
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,673
- I--
- What are you gonna do?

612
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,141
Are you gonna run off
to France?

613
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,943
Are you gonna close the
curtains, change the locks?

614
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:00,945
This is a joke.
Come on, Skyler.

615
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,449
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

616
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,585
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

617
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,221
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

618
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,291
I-- I will count
every minute

619
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,959
that the kids
are away from here,

620
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,894
away from you, as a victory.

621
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:21,163
But you're right.

622
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,100
It's a bad plan.

623
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:28,670
I don't have any
of your magic, Walt.

624
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:30,373
I don't know what to do.

625
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,608
I'm a coward.

626
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:34,843
I-- I can't go
to the police.

627
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:36,845
I can't stop
laundering your money.

628
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,779
I can't keep you
out of this house.

629
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:41,416
I can't even keep you
out of my bed.

630
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:45,753
All I can do is wait.

631
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:48,123
That's it.
That's the only good option.

632
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:49,657
Hold on,

633
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:51,626
bide my time,

634
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,327
and wait.

635
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:58,598
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

636
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:03,303
For the cancer to come back.

637
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:52,879
Yeah?

638
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:56,650
Okay. Okay.

639
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:59,518
Just relax.
I'm coming.

640
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:14,867
Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

641
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:16,936
If the DEA's tracking
her barrels,

642
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,804
there goes
our precursor connection.

643
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,306
That's done.
And I'm telling you these days,

644
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:24,242
chances of getting a new
methylamine hook-up is rare, man.

645
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:26,311
It's like Bigfoot.
Like unicorn-rare.

646
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:30,816
Kid, it's just--
You're giving me heartburn here.

647
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:33,417
GPS on the bottom
of the barrel.

648
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:36,020
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

649
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,889
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

650
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:40,191
They made these things
to put under cars.

651
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:41,793
They can get wet.

652
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,127
Huh.

653
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:46,297
Even by cop standards
this is sloppy.

654
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:47,798
And the other barrels--

655
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:50,266
They have trackers
on the outside too?

656
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:53,403
I don't know.
Probably.

657
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:56,439
- You didn't check any
of the other barrels? - No.

658
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,909
But that's the only one we
could've taken, according to her.

659
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:00,911
Once we spotted it,
she freaked out,

660
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:03,980
I put the barrel back,
and we FO'd.

661
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:05,948
Let me ask you something.

662
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:08,083
The person
who spotted this--

663
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:10,119
Was it you or was it her?

664
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:12,688
Lydia.
She saw it first.

665
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,591
Okay.

666
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,426
She's dead.

667
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,028
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

668
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,130
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

669
00:41:22,164 --> 00:41:23,965
She's thinking
if she makes it look

670
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,967
like her inventory's
being watched

671
00:41:26,002 --> 00:41:28,970
that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

672
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:30,438
And she's right,

673
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:33,555
we will be taking
our business elsewhere,

674
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:35,711
right after I leave her
alone in a ditch.

675
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:38,111
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff,

676
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,213
that's a good thing, right?

677
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,982
I mean, all we gotta do
is tell her to,

678
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:44,051
you know, cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

679
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,153
You don't know
this woman like I do.

680
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:49,456
I had a chance to deal with this
before, and I gave her a pass.

681
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,491
That's what I get
for being sexist.

682
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,159
Now, if you'll excuse me...

683
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:55,028
Mike, you can't just...

684
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,597
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

685
00:41:57,631 --> 00:42:01,267
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

686
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:04,704
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

687
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:07,506
Look, she didn't seem crazy
to me, you know?

688
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,308
She just seemed, like, uptight.

689
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:11,643
And now you're being sexist.

690
00:42:11,678 --> 00:42:14,246
Trust me, this woman
deserves to die

691
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,715
as much as any man
I've ever met.

692
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:18,784
No. Wait!

693
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:20,619
Just wait.

694
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,888
What if this really was
the cops, you know?

695
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:25,890
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

696
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:28,226
But what if you are?

697
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,097
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

698
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:34,899
Now move away from me.

699
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:37,034
No. This is
a voting thing.

700
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:40,904
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

701
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,872
Mr. White,
weigh in here, would you?

702
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:45,275
What do you think?

703
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,044
Mr. White?

704
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:59,688
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

705
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:02,858
We are not ramping down.

706
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:06,129
We're just getting started.

707
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:09,465
Nothing stops this train.

708
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,634
Nothing.

709
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:16,171
Hey, yo, Mr. White.
Hold up.

710
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,176
I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

711
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,513
You know, it's pretty, uh...

712
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:27,081
I think it's the way to go.

713
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,052
Oh, hey, um,

714
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:35,589
you said it was your--
your birthday, so...

715
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,127
I left the receipt in the box

716
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:42,596
in case you wanna exchange it.

717
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,500
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

718
00:44:02,983 --> 00:44:04,750
Hi.

719
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:14,960
I, uh, stopped by
Hank and Marie's.

720
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:19,197
Junior is still asking,
"what is going on?"

721
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:21,966
Nonstop, very insistently.

722
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:24,302
But everything's okay.

723
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:27,672
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

724
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,774
It's very sweet.

725
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,577
How are you?

726
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:43,854
There's gonna be some more
money coming in soon.

727
00:44:43,888 --> 00:44:45,989
Is that okay?

728
00:44:47,592 --> 00:44:49,192
Fine.

729
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:50,860
Good.

730
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,099
So...

731
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:58,801
Are you coming to bed?

732
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:25,525
I wanna show you something.

733
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:30,196
See that watch?

734
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:33,366
It's a birthday present.

735
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,402
The person who gave me
this present

736
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:39,072
wanted me dead too.

737
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,474
Not that long ago,

738
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,541
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes,

739
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:45,277
right here,

740
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:48,080
and he threatened to kill me.

741
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:53,051
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler,

742
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:56,388
and so will you.

743
00:46:39,454 --> 00:46:43,582
