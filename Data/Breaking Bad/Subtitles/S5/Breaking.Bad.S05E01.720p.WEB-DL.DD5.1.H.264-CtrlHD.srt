1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:04,283
Here you go.

2
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:35,446
What happened there?

3
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,716
It's my birthday.

4
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,751
Yeah? Well,
Happy Birthday.

5
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,388
Birthday meals are
free at Denny's.

6
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:46,956
All you gotta show
is a valid ID.

7
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,892
I'm good. Thanks.

8
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:52,729
Really? Free meal.
Free is good.

9
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:55,597
Even if I was, like, rich,
free is always good.

10
00:00:58,568 --> 00:00:59,735
Okay.

11
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:10,144
New Hampshire. You're
a long way from home.

12
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,378
How long a drive is that?

13
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:14,958
About 30 hours
before you stop for gas.

14
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,051
Wow. You headed
to California?

15
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:20,287
No. Here.

16
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:25,159
So what's here?

17
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:32,933
Business.

18
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,501
You know, I was in Boston once,

19
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,903
Boston and a little town
called Swampscott,

20
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,939
which is right
outside of Boston.

21
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,707
That's kind of near
New Hampshire, right?

22
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:43,676
Uh...

23
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,011
Yeah. More or less.

24
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:49,448
Yeah, I was maybe 6,
so I don't really remember it.

25
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,284
I want to say I liked it.
They got this really big aquarium.

26
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,887
Yeah.
Great science museum there.

27
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,624
Excuse me.

28
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,762
Hi. My name's Lucy.
I'll be your server.

29
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:27,050
I get to worry this one would
end up crossing the border?

30
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,353
It's never leaving town.

31
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:36,325
Is there a-- a manual?
Instruction manual?

32
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,193
I pulled something
off the internet.

33
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:39,896
It's in there.

34
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,001
Good luck, I guess.

35
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,470
Happy Birthday,
Mr. Lambert.

38
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,416
Jesus, Walt, the news here--

39
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,084
Gus Fring is dead.

40
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:48,325
He was blown up along with some
person from some Mexican cartel,

41
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:51,477
and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

42
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:54,061
Do you know about this?

43
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,230
Walt?

44
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,303
- Walt, I need you to--
- It's over.

45
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,739
<i>We're safe.</i>

46
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,755
Was this you?

47
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,927
<i>What happened?</i>

48
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,264
I won.

49
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:48,434
Oh, God.

50
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,096
Dad.

51
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,466
- Dad.
- Hey.

52
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,901
Hey.

53
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:27,938
You don't have the TV on?
Seriously?

54
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,941
Uh, no, sorry, I--
No...

55
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:33,377
You didn't tell him
about Mr. Fring?

56
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,478
Um, he knows.

57
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:36,479
I--

58
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:37,480
Welcome home.

59
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,482
Jesus, dad, it--

60
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,985
It's all they're talking about.

61
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,687
They-- they haven't
said it on TV yet,

62
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,124
but Uncle Hank says he was this,
major, major drug dealer.

63
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,293
I mean, like, holy shit.

64
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,963
Your uncle is safe, right?
How do they know that?

65
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,632
Uncle Hank was
after this guy all along.

66
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,868
He didn't tell us, but he was.

67
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:02,471
He even took me
to his restaurant one time,

68
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:05,840
just, like, totally toying
with the guy,

69
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,743
just like "I got my eye
on you," like that.

70
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,713
They figure
Mr. Fring is the one

71
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:13,715
who put the hit out
on Uncle Hank.

72
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:16,017
Just somebody got to him first.

73
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,018
Wow.

74
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,853
Yeah, wow.

75
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:23,590
Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.
She didn't want us to leave.

76
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,527
But mom figured it was time.

77
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:28,128
Huh.

78
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,363
There's still some agents
over there,

79
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:33,700
but they figure it's over.

80
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:36,469
Like, when this hits the news,

81
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:38,739
Uncle Hank
is going to be a hero.

82
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:39,806
Yeah.

83
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,874
I mean, even more so
than before.

84
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,177
Seriously.

85
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,379
See-- See if it's on TV.

86
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:47,880
Yeah, yeah, I want to.

87
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:52,471
Just-- just give me
a couple minutes, huh?

88
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:05,097
Hi.

89
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,465
Hi.

90
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:13,104
Hi, sweet pea.

91
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:15,506
Oh, daddy missed you so much.

92
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,677
Yes, he did.

93
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:23,448
I know.
I missed you, too.

94
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:32,222
Well, don't you think
I rate a "hello," at least?

95
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,827
Hello.

96
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,263
Hello.

97
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:44,367
Hello to you, too.

98
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,140
So are you gonna talk
to me here?

99
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:53,542
Are you gonna--

100
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:56,412
You gonna show some kind of--

101
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:00,449
I don't know--
Some kind of mild relief

102
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,050
that I'm alive?

103
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,721
I am relieved, Walt.

104
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,157
And scared.

105
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
Scared?

106
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:14,930
Scared of what?

107
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,900
You.

108
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:28,943
Hey.

109
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,280
Hi.

110
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,707
Oh, shit.

111
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,185
Jesus, just say it already.

112
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,986
Tell me "I told you so."

113
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,221
Get it out of your system

114
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,990
before you need, like,
dialysis or something.

115
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:33,526
It's exactly like
Boetticher's drawings.

116
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:40,800
- Where were the two bodies?
- Over the fright elevator, over there.

117
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:45,837
No idea who they were?

118
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,539
Nah, not much left.

119
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:50,809
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn
thing when they get too hot,

120
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:52,578
so they tell me.

121
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,147
Whoever torched it,
did it up right.

122
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:03,354
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

123
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:17,268
Huh. What do you
figure that was?

124
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:20,837
I don't know. Some kind
of lab equipment?

125
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,313
Maybe a camera?

126
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:48,663
Come on. Be nice.
Just be nice.

127
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,701
You be nice. Just be nice.

128
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,069
Let Wendell in there.

129
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:58,307
If Wendell doesn't eat,
nobody eats.

130
00:13:58,341 --> 00:13:59,774
Yeah.

131
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,976
Are you sure?
Are you completely sure?

132
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,048
And what about...?
Yes, I will tell him. Yes, I will tell him.

133
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,354
It's Gustavo.

134
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,590
He's dead.

135
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,092
Son of a bitch.

136
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,661
Son of a bitch.

137
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,229
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hold up! Hold up!

138
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,664
Get out of my way, kid.

139
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,099
Mike, wait a minute,
all right? Let him talk.

140
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,534
"Let him talk." I am done

141
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,569
listening to this asshole talk.

142
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,271
Now get out of my way.

143
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,573
He's got something
you need to hear, all right?

144
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:11,208
What did you do, Jesse?

145
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,542
Do you even know?

146
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:16,078
- Do you even know what you've done?
- Yeah, he saved his own life...

147
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,346
One more word--

148
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,148
Mike. Mike.

149
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:21,117
If you kill him, you're
going to have to kill me.

150
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,786
Come on.

151
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,489
Oh, Jesse.

152
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,224
Jesus.

153
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:32,861
What is it with you guys?

154
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,797
Honest to God.

155
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,066
May I?

156
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:44,238
Look. Whatever differences
you and I have, they'll keep.

157
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:46,741
Right now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

158
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,477
Bigger fish.

159
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,078
The video cameras.

160
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,981
Gus kept cameras on us
at the lab,

161
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,451
at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

162
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:57,885
And, of course,
when I say "us,"

163
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,219
including you.

164
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,554
Mike.

165
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:04,157
Mike, if he taped
all that shit--

166
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:06,927
Us cooking, you picking up...

167
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:10,564
If Gus had a record of that and the
police get to it before we do...

168
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:13,467
- You son of a bitch.
- Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,

169
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:16,134
or a hard drive.

170
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,636
Where?

171
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,071
Where did he keep it?

172
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:27,546
He had a laptop in his office.
He kept it at the back of the restaurant.

173
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:31,016
It all fed straight to there.

174
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,692
What?

175
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:42,627
Keys, scumbag.

176
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,763
It's the universal symbol
for keys.

177
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:17,880
<i>Meter fraud.</i>

178
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,350
Yes, yes, it's a big deal.

179
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:23,353
Guy rigs his meter
so he's paying two cents less

180
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,221
for first-class postage.

181
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:26,955
I'm here to tell you

182
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,891
that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

183
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,962
It's money out of your pocket.
It's money out of my pocket.

184
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:37,566
I was hoping--
Now, look, sarge.

185
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,668
Do you think we could work
together on this thing?

186
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:41,303
You folks have it over there?

187
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,170
Could you tell me that,
at least?

188
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,708
Yeah.

189
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,977
Yeah.

190
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,614
Well, thanks for your help.

191
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,116
Uh, Inspector Clark,
Inspector Dave Clark,

192
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,918
like the Dave Clark Five?

193
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,154
Oh, before your time.

194
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,557
Well, you feel free to call me
day or night at this number.

195
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:09,562
Yes, sir.
No, you as well.

196
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,466
Oh, yeah.

197
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,468
We're boned.

198
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,239
Well...

199
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:24,910
You know how they say

200
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,712
"it's been a pleasure"?

201
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,315
It hasn't.

202
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,750
Are you going to tell us
about the laptop?

203
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:36,688
- Where you going?
- I'm gettin' the hell out of dodge, kid,

204
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:37,988
and so should you.

205
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:39,757
It's just a matter of time.

206
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,359
Mike,

207
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,260
where is the laptop?

208
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,595
What the hell difference
does it make?

209
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,363
They got it. End of story.

210
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:57,140
APD, Northwest area command,
on 2nd.

211
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:59,175
They tagged it, they filed it,

212
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,744
it's in the system,

213
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:03,078
and they locked it
in their evidence room.

214
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:06,114
All right.

215
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:10,319
All right. So...
Describe the building.

216
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:12,722
Describe the--

217
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,757
How about I describe Fort Knox?

218
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,392
And what are you going to do?

219
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:20,428
Are you going to put on your black leotard
and go dangling on a close line?

220
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,130
It's a building full of cops.
What else do you need to know?

221
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:26,234
And why in the hell
am I talking to you?

222
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,903
Mike, we gotta do something.

223
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,374
I am doing something.

224
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,775
He's good with this stuff.
Just give him a chance.

225
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,943
Now, you look.

226
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:40,146
That laptop might as well
be on the Moon.

227
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,815
They build these evidence rooms

228
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,551
like bank vaults
because guess what.

229
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:47,621
Lunatics like you
want to break into them.

230
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:53,466
But unlike a bank vault this is a place
that is guarded 24 hours a day

231
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:55,327
by the police.

232
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,764
There's no way you're
getting it out of there.

233
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,804
Who said that we have to
get it out of there?

234
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,439
We just need to destroy
what's on it.

235
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,241
Oh, so now you want
to blow up a police station.

236
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,176
I don't believe
I said that, no.

237
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,113
Nursing home full of old folks
just whet your appetite.

238
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,481
Now you want to kill
a bunch of cops.

239
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,983
I've never said anything
about killing anybody.

240
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,120
I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

241
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,422
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

242
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,625
Say this device
gets filed into evidence.

243
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,226
Now, it is inside that room.

244
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,628
What about a magnet?

245
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,896
You want to commit
a whole other crime

246
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,831
just to get this bomb
of yours into evidence.

247
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,933
Who said bomb?
I said a device.

248
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,201
- Yo, what about, like, a magnet?
- An incendiary device.

249
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,036
One quick fire
is all it would take.

250
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,704
You don't think they have
fire suppression?

251
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:42,906
I'm not talking
about sprinklers.

252
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,241
I'm talking about halon, because
halon doesn't destroy evidence.

253
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,910
- A magnet, though, maybe like--
- All right, so a bomb, then.

254
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:50,278
Maybe we plant a bomb outside.

255
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,614
Oh, actually I knew
a crew out of Fort Worth

256
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,083
that tried to blow up an
evidence room from outside.

257
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,553
About all they did was
take out a couple of hedges.

258
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,955
You are probably talking
about 2 feet

259
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,656
of reinforced concrete.

260
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,290
Or what about a magnet?

261
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,660
What magnet?
What about it?

262
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:08,496
You know, just a...

263
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:26,480
So what do you think?

264
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,647
Expensive.

265
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:29,983
Leaving aside engineering,

266
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:32,953
rigging some kind of
alternate power source,

267
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:36,989
my primary sticking point
is I actually need the thing,

268
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,557
as you gentlemen can see,

269
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:40,025
it's paying the bills.

270
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,596
But I mean it's
feasible, doable?

271
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,030
Hey, we're living in a time

272
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:47,867
of, uh, string theories
and God particles.

273
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,002
Feasible, doable?
Yeah, sure, why not?

274
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,370
Expensive.

275
00:21:54,106 --> 00:22:00,812
What would you put it in?

276
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:03,715
What about that?
Does it run?

277
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:05,949
We can get it running.

278
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,418
What's the box made of?

279
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,420
Plywood and aluminum--
just what you need.

280
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,025
All right,
so you want to talk money?

281
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,529
Step into my office.

282
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,967
Hey, listen. Um...

283
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,704
I don't actually have
any money right now.

284
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:34,076
My wife-- There's
an IRS issue anyway.

285
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,345
I'd appreciate it if you
could spot me my share.

286
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:40,081
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, whatever.

287
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,416
Right.

288
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,453
You coming?

289
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,856
If you have any brains,

290
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,424
you'll take that money you save

291
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,660
and you'll skip town--

292
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:53,528
Today. Right now.

293
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,597
You don't think this can work?

294
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:59,166
Is that a serious question?

295
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,301
Mike,
this is a three-man job.

296
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:03,136
The only way I know
it won't work for sure

297
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,738
is if we don't have you.

298
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,005
Come in.

299
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:43,774
Oh. Get in.

300
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,743
Close the door.

301
00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:48,546
What did we
say about you coming here?

302
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:51,616
Yeah, speaking of things
that tend to rile you up,

303
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,419
uh, the police--They may call.

304
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:56,087
Let me--
let me back up a little.

305
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,522
Can I s-- can I sit down?
I'm going to sit down.

306
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:01,558
Okay, w-w-why are
the police going to call?

307
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:04,495
May call you. Distant,
outside possibility.

308
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:07,697
But on the off chance I want you
thinking one thought--

309
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:09,433
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

310
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,602
Sergeant Schultz.
Do you remember Sergeant Schultz?

311
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:13,703
"I know nothing.
I see nothing."

312
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:16,405
Do you remember how he--
I want you like that.

313
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,009
- Okay, Saul, why are the police--
- There was a incident, with Beneke...

314
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,710
Oh, God.

315
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:24,514
- And it's--
- Oh, Jesus. What incident?

316
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,048
An act of God.

317
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:27,650
There's no right.
There's no wrong.

318
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:30,685
I mean, it just--
that's the best phrase.

319
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,689
It fits, but we got a problem.

320
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:40,562
Ted's dead.

321
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:43,331
Sorry?

322
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,600
Ted is dead?

323
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:48,302
No. No, no.

324
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,704
He just woke up.

325
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:59,801
Right-o, that should do 'er.

326
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:01,869
All right, watches off

327
00:25:01,904 --> 00:25:05,774
necklaces, earrings,
rings, bracelets...

328
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,375
Gold.
These are non-ferrous.

329
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,710
Better hope.

330
00:25:08,744 --> 00:25:10,344
What about that stuff
you young guys wear

331
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:11,545
on the end or your pricks?

332
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,648
Speak now
or forever sing soprano.

333
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,383
What's up with that,
by the way?

334
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,185
Why would anybody
wanna put a metal ring

335
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,553
through the end of the prick?

336
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,089
What are you looking at me for?

337
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:27,393
All right, uh, guns, knives,

338
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:30,463
tools, keys, plates
in your head,

339
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,465
artificial hips.

340
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,844
Check your pockets one
more time, please.

341
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,204
Oh, uh, credit cards.

342
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:42,006
You want that plastic working,
come Miller Time.

343
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:46,345
You know, I can foresee a lot of
possible outcomes to this thing,

344
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,514
and not a single one of them
involves Miller Time.

345
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,550
P.M.A.

346
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,685
Positive mental attitude.

347
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,054
Uh, okay, I think
we're good to go.

348
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,590
All right, where do you
want me with this?

349
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,891
Start 40 feet out.

350
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,560
That's more than
the length of the room.

351
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,328
- Who's doing the honors?
- Me.

352
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,330
Flip that switch, turns it on.

353
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,566
Twist this here.
That's your power control.

354
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,200
- All right.
- Everybody ready?

355
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,035
- Yeah.
- Okay.

356
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,003
Fire in the hole!

357
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,141
All right, you ready?

358
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:35,290
Fingers crossed it don't
yank the drive shaft

359
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:36,458
through the floor.

360
00:26:51,606 --> 00:26:52,773
Anything?

361
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,211
No. Still working.

362
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,848
All right, start walking.

363
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:14,126
Whoa. Whoa-whoa.

364
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,728
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

365
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:17,262
Yeah. That did it.

366
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,401
Yes.

367
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:23,868
Whoa.

368
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:30,542
Yeah, bitch!

369
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,944
Magnets! Oh!

370
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:37,582
How many batteries is this?

371
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,216
That there's 21,
wired in series,

372
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:44,254
so 21 times 12, 252 volts.

373
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,924
Can you add 21 more,
wired in parallel?

374
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,092
Up the amperage?

375
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,900
Everything goes flying
in that evidence room,

376
00:27:57,935 --> 00:28:00,169
it's gonna make
one hell of a noise,

377
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,071
and there goes your
element of surprise.

378
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:04,807
Won't matter.

379
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:06,876
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.

380
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,635
Hi. Who are you looking for?

381
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:37,270
Um, Ted Beneke.
I'm a friend of his.

382
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:39,373
But if it's not a good time,
I could--

383
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,208
No, no, no, this is fine.
I'm just finishing up.

384
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:42,442
Come on in.

385
00:28:55,756 --> 00:28:57,089
Hey, Ted.

386
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,693
I tell you,
he's been a real champ.

387
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:04,262
His color's better,
and his blood pressure's up.

388
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,497
We are going to have you

389
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:07,399
eating solid food
in a day or two.

390
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,001
I bet you money.

391
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:11,436
That's wonderful.

392
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,140
All right,
I'm just down the hall.

393
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:27,518
Ted.

394
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:30,614
Can you hear me?

395
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:36,192
Yes.

396
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:41,497
Ted, I just--

397
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:49,004
Skyler...

398
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,640
I haven't said anything...

399
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,377
to anyone.

400
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:01,249
I told them it was an accident.

401
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,854
I tripped and fell.

402
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,322
That is all they know.

403
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,727
I just--

404
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,299
I've-- I've got children.

405
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,602
Family.

406
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:24,938
I swear to you.

407
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:28,775
Please.

408
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,145
I just--

409
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:38,417
I...

410
00:30:39,886 --> 00:30:43,188
will never breathe...

411
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:48,227
one word of this.

412
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:58,970
Good.

413
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:23,149
It should be about a quarter
of the way down on the left.

414
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:24,951
We'll do a loop and come
around the other side.

415
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,152
Turn here.

416
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,498
Right up there.

417
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,667
That's the wall.

418
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,068
Oh, what the hell is this?

419
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:46,237
There's some big-ass hump
in the way.

420
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:48,940
So just drive over it.

421
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:50,942
- All right.
- You can do it.

422
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:53,377
Take it easy. Take it easy.

423
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,780
You got it.

424
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:05,255
Cut it.

425
00:33:06,257 --> 00:33:07,557
It's, like, 8 feet away.

426
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,525
Is this cool?
Is this close enough?

427
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,194
It'll work.

428
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,605
Mr. White, let's go.

429
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,708
Hang on.

430
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,508
- Let's just go!
- Hang on.

431
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:40,245
Mr. White,
let's get out of here.

432
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,579
Just...

433
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:44,382
one minute.

434
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,090
Whoops.
Turn it off!

435
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,325
Turn it off.

436
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,565
Jacocks, you okay?

437
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,101
Outside! Outside!

438
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,987
Oh!

439
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:26,989
Yes! Bitch!

440
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:29,091
- Shut up.
- Oh. Yeah.

441
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,026
What exactly
are you celebrating?

442
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,261
You left the truck behind.

443
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:33,495
So what?

444
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,963
So what?

445
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,598
So what if they find prints?

446
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:39,902
And what if they trace it
back to the wrecking yard?

447
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:41,802
They won't.

448
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:43,771
There's no prints.
I made sure of that.

449
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:45,839
There's no paperwork
on the truck,

450
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,608
the magnet, or the batteries.

451
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:50,511
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

452
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:52,613
I made sure of that, too.

453
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:54,215
Well, you got all the answers,

454
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,917
so you tell me, answer man,

455
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,951
did all that
even work just now?

456
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:00,888
Yes. It worked.

457
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,624
I'm supposed to
take that on faith?

458
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,426
Yeah?

459
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,727
Why?

460
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:09,897
How do we know?

461
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,398
Because I say so.

462
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,192
07-66-26432.

463
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:45,960
Gutierrez, Alvin B.

464
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,327
Roofing hammer.

465
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:50,630
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

466
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:59,940
11-58-73321.

467
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,541
Fring, Gustavo.

468
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:03,509
Samsung laptop computer.

469
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:06,879
Damaged. Glass screen
is broken and in pieces.

470
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,447
Bag still sealed.

471
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:20,559
11-58-73317.

472
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:22,027
Fring, Gustavo.

473
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:23,596
Framed photograph of two men.

474
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,863
Damaged.

475
00:37:24,897 --> 00:37:27,132
The glass is broken,

476
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,335
and photo has slipped
out of its frame.

477
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:32,871
Bag appears to be slightly
punctured by broken glass.

478
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,574
Hm. Check it out.

479
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,144
That's not on the manifest.

480
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,381
All right, so first off,

481
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,082
I'm not a marriage counselor.

482
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:46,684
Nor do I takes sides
in this thing.

483
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,222
And, not taking sides, mind you, but
you did put her in charge of your money,

484
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:54,258
which I advised against,
if you'll recall,

485
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:57,294
all of which is not to be
construed as an "I told you so".

486
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,964
I'm just walking you
through my mental process,

487
00:37:59,998 --> 00:38:01,899
so to speak.

488
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:07,537
So she comes to me
with a problem.

489
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:09,205
She's been cooking
Beneke's books,

490
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,774
he's in Dutch with the IRS,

491
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,108
and once they audit,

492
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:14,144
it's "Rio de caca"
for the both of them,

493
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:18,648
to which I say "hey, let's involve
Walt in this discussion,"

494
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:21,751
to which she says, "no,
let's cut Beneke a check

495
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:23,753
so's he can pay off the IRS."

496
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:25,687
Again, not taking sides,

497
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,956
but she really was
trying to protect you.

498
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:33,528
A little feedback here
might be nice.

499
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:38,767
"Let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

500
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:40,467
Yeah, that's what I told her.

501
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:41,903
She said no.

502
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:44,238
And you didn't argue the point.

503
00:38:44,273 --> 00:38:46,307
You didn't think to contact me.

504
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,144
You were a tad preoccupied

505
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:52,579
at the time, if you'll recall.

506
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:57,317
Okay. So you took it
upon yourself

507
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:02,222
to give away $622,000
of my money

508
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,758
to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

509
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:09,930
She's my client, same as you.

510
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:12,898
Does this arrangement get
a little tricky at times?

511
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:17,402
Absolutely. But I try my best,
you know, ethically, my duty...

512
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:22,507
Ethically? I'm sorry, I must be
hearing things.

513
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:27,479
Did you actually just use the
word "ethically" in a sentence?

514
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:29,981
You're not Clarence Darrow,
Saul.

515
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:32,583
You're a two-bit
bus-bench lawyer,

516
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,252
and you work for me.

517
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:36,654
Yeah, well, Clarence didn't ever
have a client like you

518
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,656
ask him for something...

519
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:41,425
like this.

520
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,828
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

521
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:46,496
Huell, too. Huh?

522
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,131
He's got fingers like hotdogs.

523
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,900
He could've easily busted
this in two

524
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:53,237
and killed everyone in the
office, but do I complain?

525
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,073
No. Beg, borrow, or steal,
I'm your huckleberry.

526
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:58,976
I go the extra mile.

527
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,346
Only you never told me that the kid
would wind up in the hospital.

528
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,447
You know--

529
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:07,950
Take that thing and get
the hell out of here.

530
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,418
You and me, we're done.

531
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:28,836
Come on. Hey.

532
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,171
Hey.

533
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:33,740
H--

534
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,177
We're done

535
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:39,513
when I say we're done.

536
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,629
I heard what happened to Ted.

537
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,234
