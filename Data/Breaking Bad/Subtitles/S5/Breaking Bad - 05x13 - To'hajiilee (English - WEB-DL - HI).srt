1
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,113
So, how big's the batch?

2
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,098
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

3
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,034
Uncle Jack, that mask...

4
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,319
I think you should...

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,623
Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

6
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,458
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

7
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:22,943
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,168
76%.
[Chuckles]

9
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:06,170
- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

10
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,655
Where is the blue?

11
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:09,156
Where's the what?

12
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:10,658
The blue color.

13
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,294
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

14
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:15,329
Where is it?

15
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,101
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

16
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:23,104
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

17
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,356
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,142
That dude who looked like Wolverine...
he couldn't crack 70.

19
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:29,527
Fine. Yes,

20
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:32,647
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

21
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,315
And congratulations, Todd.

22
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,017
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

23
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:39,570
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

24
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,240
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

25
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,242
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

26
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:46,661
but not if it's not blue.

27
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,831
I don't know.
To my eye,

28
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,500
it's kind of blue.

29
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:54,001
Yeah, a little.

30
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:55,803
It's blue-ish.

31
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,175
[Jack] Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

32
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,566
Yeah, kinda...

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,601
If it catches the light
just right,

34
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,571
I could see how you'd think

35
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,556
there's a touch of blue,

36
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,825
blue-green in there.

37
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,226
[Snaps fingers]
Aquamarine.

38
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:20,728
Hell, we'll put
food coloring in it.

39
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:22,363
Make it any damn shade
you want.

40
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,732
- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,031
Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

42
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,001
Like, flamingo pink.

43
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,027
It sure as hell don't come
out the ocean lookin' like that.

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,380
All right.
Let's make some money.

45
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:55,229
- Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
- Lydia.

46
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,097
Thank you.

47
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,739
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

48
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:06,807
Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,809
You sure?
If it's too weak or something,

50
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,945
I can go put another bag in it.

51
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,913
I'm sure.

52
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,535
Look, about the product...

53
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:20,171
I'm really sorry
about the color.

54
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,156
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

55
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:25,092
in the mixing kettle, I think.

56
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:28,179
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

57
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:31,465
You burned it, like a cake.

58
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:35,603
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

59
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,605
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

60
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,108
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

61
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,176
I mean, I'm doing everything

62
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:46,397
just like Mr. White
taught me, so...

63
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,984
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

64
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,620
I appreciate you making
every possible effort,

65
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:54,121
because, as you know,

66
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,690
my buyers expect
a certain threshold,

67
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,125
a continuity.

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,377
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

69
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,535
Uh, about your buyers...

70
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:13,974
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them,

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,562
if... you want.

72
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,184
I'll pass. Thanks.

73
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,988
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

74
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,891
I believe in you.

75
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,727
Please do make the cook better.

76
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:36,497
It's very important to me.

77
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,837
I've got a flight to catch.

78
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,597
[Phone ringing]

79
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,434
[Beeps]

80
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:15,486
Hello.

81
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,488
<i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>

82
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,156
Hey, Mr. White.
How you doing?

83
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,708
<i>I'm okay.</i>

84
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,459
<i>I, uh...</i>

85
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,462
<i>Todd, I think I might have</i>

86
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:27,498
<i>another job for your uncle.</i>

87
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:30,551
Oh, okay. Uh, you want me
to set up a meeting?

88
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:33,887
<i>I... Yes. Please.
Let's do that.</i>

89
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:37,308
Any heads-up
I should give him, like, um,

90
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:40,961
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

91
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,848
<i>- Mr. White?
- Just one target.</i>

92
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,518
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>

93
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,653
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

94
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,323
You got it.

95
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,024

97
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,258
I'm surprised
you didn't strangle him.

98
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,219
So, now what? Book him?

99
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:55,388
I'm sure the AUSA have plenty to say
on how to play him against Walt.

100
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,525
Knowing what we know about how
Walt deals with rats behind bars? No...

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,727
Yeah. Punk has to be safer
with the Marshals watching his back

102
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,139
than out here
where it's open season.

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,635
Mmmh...

104
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,233
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

105
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,835
Kid's got an idea.

106
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,255
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

107
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,924
The one that screwed up our sting?
Oh, I'm all ears.

108
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,243
Just, uh, hear him out,
will ya?

109
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,436
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

110
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:29,439
You guys need evidence
to put him away,

111
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:32,276
only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

112
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,777
So you say.

113
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,779
Well, I know some evidence

114
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:38,365
that greedy asshole
would never destroy.

115
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,401
His money.

116
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,770
- You know where he keeps his money?
- No.

117
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:46,573
But I know someone who might.

118
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,414
Oh, hey.
How'd it go?

119
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,551
Trailed him out to the dog house,
picked him up there.

120
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,753
Seemed to be looking
for someone.

121
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,255
Had a lot of questions.

122
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,257
No calls, though, right?
You got his phone?

123
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,508
Yeah.

124
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,312

00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,232
I got Van Oster
babysitting him.

127
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:15,468
Yeah, and what about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

128
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,938
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.

129
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,273
Good job.

130
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,408
I gotta tell you this
up front, Hank.

131
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,660
If this guy decides
that he wants to lawyer up,

132
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,329
I don't care
if you are my boss,

133
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,364
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

134
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:29,416
He won't lawyer up.

135
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:32,786

00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,133

00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,019

138
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,039

140
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,134
Hey, there. You mind taking it
outside for a minute?

141
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,503
- No, sir. You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

142
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,706
Huell Babineaux.

143
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,143
Know who I am?

144
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,480
I'll take that as a yes.

145
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,732
Uh, thanks for your patience.

146
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,735
Uh, as, uh, Agent Gomez said,

147
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,104
you're... you're not
under arrest.

148
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:42,773
Why am I here?

149
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:45,909
Well, you're here, uh,
for your own protection, sir.

150
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:47,411
How you figure that?

151
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:51,164
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

152
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,504
Nice poker face.

153
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,423
Look, uh, relax.

154
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:02,075
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

155
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,077
Multiple murders,

156
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,413
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

157
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,099
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

158
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,802
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

159
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,970
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

160
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,022
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

161
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:18,258
We intercepted a call
between him

162
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,944
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

163
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:23,613
You know, your employer.

164
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:26,700
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

165
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,369
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

166
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,288
and that you were next
on the hit list.

167
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,622
That's why you're here.

168
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,908
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

169
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,444
We got the recording.
I can... I can let you hear it.

170
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,080
Your associate, Goodman's fixer...
What's his name?

171
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:42,382
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

172
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,051
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

173
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,619
Came out here for the sunshine.

174
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,890
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

175
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,092
In fact,
Kuby's already missing.

176
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:54,094
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

177
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:55,962
for your...
your redheaded buddy.

178
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,466
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

179
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,985
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

180
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,970
He sold you
down the river big-time.

181
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:06,907
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

182
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,809
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

183
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,145
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

184
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,164
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

185
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,166
about 15 seconds
[Chuckles]

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,151
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

187
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,154
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

188
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,822
and as soon as you call him,

189
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,824
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

190
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,344
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

191
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,798
[Scoffs]
Oh, man. Oh, man.

192
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,384
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

193
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,470
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

194
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:38,004
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

195
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,523
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

196
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,057
for conspiracy to commit murder

197
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,642
instead of here,
under our protection.

198
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:44,644
So just tell us everything
you know about White

199
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,146
so we can get him
before he gets you.

200
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,148
Why would he wanna kill me?

201
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:50,484
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

202
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,619
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

203
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,287
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

204
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,990
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

205
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:01,211
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

206
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,163
I don't know
where his money is.

207
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,664
That ain't what we heard.

208
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

209
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,135
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

210
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,005
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

211
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,707
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

212
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,060
And who knows
where he took it from there?

213
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:19,879
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

214
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:22,065
Seven barrels' worth.

215
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,650
Seven barrels?

216
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,404
When you...
you say "barrels,"

217
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,406
<i>you mean barrels barrels?</i>

218
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,274
Barrels, man.
You know,

219
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:34,661
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

220
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:36,162
I got 'em at Home Depot.

221
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,832
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

222
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,085
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

223
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,537
Lariat.

224
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,072
The one on Candelaria
and Monroe.

225
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,910
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

226
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,912
Kuby rented the van.

227
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,631
Mr. White dropped it off.

228
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,100
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

229
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,685
Wash the rental?
Why?

230
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,521
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

231
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:04,774
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

232
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,527
handed over the key,
and that was it.

233
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,945
That's all I know.

234
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,651
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

235
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,621
Agent Gomez and I

236
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,290
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

237
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,242
to find the son of a bitch.

238
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,044
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

239
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,630
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

240
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,299
[Gomez] Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

241
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,084
Oh, almost forgot.

242
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,420
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

243
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,722
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

244
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,642
So don't put that back in.

245
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,927
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

246
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,313
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

247
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,632
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

248
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,301
because the less
you distract him,

249
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,987
the better he can protect you.

250
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:53,156
How long you gonna be?

251
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,443
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

252
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:11,091
[Jack]
So just one guy this time.

253
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,376
Not even in lockup.

254
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:19,299
Some former partner, Todd says?

255
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:22,852
Yeah.

256
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:25,138
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

257
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:28,942
"Rat p..."

258
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,561
No, no.

259
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,898
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

260
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:38,184
He's just...

261
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,238
He... he just...

262
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,457
won't listen to reason.

263
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,710
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

264
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,495
He's not a rat.

265
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,530
All right.

266
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,000
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

267
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,752
How angry we talkin',
by the way?

268
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:57,704
Like, Hulk angry?

269
00:14:57,722 --> 00:15:02,676
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

270
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,732
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

271
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,852
Jesse is like family to me.

272
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:17,223
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

273
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,891
and painless.

274
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,994
No suffering, no fear.

275
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:24,164
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

276
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,082
I respect that.

277
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,784
There's too many savages
out there.

278
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,736
Let's just talk
about the money.

279
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,921
[Chuckling] No,
we don't want your money.

280
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,175
We want you to cook for us.

281
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,127
[Scoffs]

282
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,971
You know I'm
out of the business.

283
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:50,724
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

284
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:53,926
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

285
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:56,596
Get the color right too.

286
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:59,449
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it...

287
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:01,901
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

288
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:03,403
So I'm told.

289
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,189
No. Absolutely not.

290
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:10,110
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

291
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:13,614
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

292
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,316
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

293
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,035
You want us to do this job?

294
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:21,038
Do it right?
That's the price.

295
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,135
One cook...

296
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,888
after the job is done.

297
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:59,025
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

298
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,378
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

299
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:03,413
Just tell me where he is.

300
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,383
I don't know where he is,

301
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,370
but I know how
to flush him out.

302
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,563
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

303
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,065
with your PBJ?

304
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,983
Both.

305
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,986
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

306
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:26,206
[Knock on door]

307
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,543
Hold on, honey.

308
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,247
Hi, Andrea.

309
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,965
I don't know
if you remember me.

310
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:37,217
I'm Walter White,
Jesse's friend.

311
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,303
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course. Hi.

312
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:40,804
Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

313
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,841
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

314
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:47,644
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

315
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,930
It's about Jesse.

316
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:52,733
Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

317
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,768
You wanna talk inside while
I get my boy ready for school?

318
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,436
Uh, well, yeah.
If it's...

319
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,305
if it's okay, yeah, sure.

320
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,307
Thank you.

321
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,242
You met Brock before, right?

322
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:05,195
Yes. Yes, I have.
At Jesse's.

323
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,997
How you doing, Brock?

324
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:11,885
Brock, he asked you a question.

325
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,621
- I'm good.
- Good.

326
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,540
Froot Loops.

327
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:18,926
That's good stuff.

328
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,728
[Quietly]
So... Jesse.

329
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,230
Yeah. I...

330
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,965
I don't wanna alarm you,

331
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,634
but I've... I've been trying
to reach him for days.

332
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,136
I've stopped at his house.

333
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,738
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

334
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,240
and he won't return my calls.

335
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:35,058
I can't find him anywhere.

336
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,010
Have you heard from him?

337
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,512
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

338
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,031
That was...
I don't know...

339
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:43,116
two weeks ago, maybe.

340
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:46,453
Andrea...

341
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,022
Jesse's using again,

342
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,958
and I... I...

343
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:53,410
I have a bad feeling
about this.

344
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,247
Have you tried
calling the police?

345
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,835
Or, um...
a better idea.

346
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:05,205
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

347
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:07,007
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

348
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,725
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

349
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,095
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I... I did that.

350
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,598
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

351
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,819
But otherwise,
very little help.

352
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,356
See, the thing is

353
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,609
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

354
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,079
And I... I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

355
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:31,665
he's... he's...

356
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:35,702
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh...

357
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:38,705
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

358
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,507
instead of...

359
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,260
him being...

360
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:45,312
Well...

361
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,250
Well, I'll try him right now.

362
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:53,136
I mean, if that's it...
he's mad at you,

363
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:54,805
maybe I'll have better luck.
[Phone beeps]

364
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:57,107
That would be such a help. Yes.
[Dialing phone number]

365
00:19:57,141 --> 00:20:00,260
What, um... what... what number
are you, uh, calling him on?

366
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:02,446
- Um, his cell.
- Ah. Yeah. You know,

367
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,448
he recently gotten a new one.

368
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,400
And there. That...

369
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:09,536
that's his new number there...
the highlighted one.

370
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,643
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

371
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:18,145
Your friend Walter
just dropped by.

372
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,180
He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.

373
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,716
We, uh...
we're thinking of you.

374
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,951
Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?

375
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,720
I really need to hear from you.

376
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,805
It's important.

377
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:32,125
Thank you, Andrea.

378
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,845
I appreciate that.

379
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:37,180
Well, I better...
I better be going.

380
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:40,233
Oh, you're welcome to stay a
few minutes to see if he calls back.

381
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:42,769
No. No, no. You're trying to
get your son off to school.

382
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,188
Listen, if he does happen to
call back, would you call me?

383
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,473
Better yet...

384
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:49,526
I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

385
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:52,162
And... thank you.

386
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,781
See ya, Brock.

We on?

392
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,782
Yes. It should be
any time now.

393
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,701
<i>Copy that.</i>

394
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:34,237
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

395
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:37,257
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

396
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,126

How'd it go
at the rental place?

409
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,871
Van have GPS?

410
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:26,706
No GPS. Nope.

411
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,843
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago,

412
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:32,429
when the ACLU
or somebody sued them,

413
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:34,765
and they had to get rid of it.

Yo, man, you can't
just give up on this.

417
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,894
- Who said we're giving up?
[Gomez] - What do you got?

418
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,263
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said

419
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:51,764
about the van being dirty

420
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:54,151
and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

421
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:56,603
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

422
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,822
No kidding.
So what?

423
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,824
There's a whole lot
of desert out there.

424
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,492
How are we gonna find
the right spot?

425
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:04,944
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

426
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:08,498
Yeah. But Walt
doesn't know that.

427
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,459
All right.

428
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,795
Here's your change.

429
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,797
- Oh, um, count it out, please.
- Here.

430
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,915
Uh, three.
That makes 15.

431
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,718
Plus five.
That is 20.

432
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,887
Give this to
your car wash professional.

433
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,222

Oh, you too.

- Good.
- Why... why do I...

438
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,898
why do I gotta say that?

439
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:39,317
Because it reinforces
our brand.

440
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,403
So, getting the hang of it?

441
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:44,456
It's, uh... it's...
it's pretty basic.

442
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,442
Mom, it's Saturday.

443
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,444
Can... can I go?

444
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,145
- Go where?
- Home.

445
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,616
Um, pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

446
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,835
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

447
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,671
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer, all right?

448
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,623
- I need you.
- Hi.

to your face?

Uh, this is a... I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,034
Okay, so thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

Good to meet you.

- Yeah.
- Don't drink and drive.

Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay.

485
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,212
He hasn't shown up yet.

486
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,848
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

487
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,767
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

488
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:38,436
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

489
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,272
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

490
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:50,331
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

491
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:53,067
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

492
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,004
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

493
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,006
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

494
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,174
Next thing I know,
radio silence.

495
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,577
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

496
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,630
Jesse is not on
some killing spree.

497
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,682
It's me he wants.

498
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:09,417
It's just me.

499
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,252
Then where the hell's Huell?

500
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,227
Any news?

501
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,429
Not yet, but soon.
I promise.

502
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,282
- Have an A-1 day.
- Okay.

503
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,122
Next...

504
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,825

506

...uh, ten pine-scented
air fresheners.

507
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,959
You mark "ten"
under this column,

508
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,512
and then you subtract ten from
the actual stock column here.

509
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,464
Okay?
Why don't you try that?

00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,731
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Hey.

695
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:50,225
I'll call the Tribal Police on the way out,
let 'em know we're here.

696
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,878
Gonna make a phone call.

697
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:00,719
[Beeps, automatic dialing]

698
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:06,558
[Phone ringing]

699
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,610
[Beeps]

700
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:12,965
Hank, why is there what looks
like brains in our garbage can?

701
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,250
Hey, baby. I got him.

702
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:16,952
Dead to rights.

703
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:20,005
You got Walt?

704
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,340
<i>Yeah.</i>

705
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:24,176
<i>I got him in handcuffs
as we speak.</i>

706
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,963
<i>Want me to wave to him
for you? Huh?</i>

707
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,352
[Chuckles]
Well, he's not, uh...

708
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,387
he's not feeling too friendly.

709
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:38,423
Oh, my God.

710
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:41,060
You did it.

711
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:42,728
Thank God.

712
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:44,446
<i>Things are gonna be</i>

713
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:48,000
a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.

714
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:54,456
Baby, you okay?

715
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:56,959
[Sniffles]

716
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:59,161
I'm much better now.

717
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,916
I gotta go.

718
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,951
It may be awhile
before I get home.

719
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:11,807
I love you.

720
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:15,010
I love you too.

721
00:42:17,296 --> 00:42:18,597
[Beeps]

722
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:19,848
[Exhales forcefully]

723
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:46,175
Who the hell is this?

724
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,210
Tribal Police?

725
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:53,966
Hank! Hank! Hank!

726
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:12,734
No...

727
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:23,528
Police!
Drop your weapons!

728
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:26,882
Jack, don't do it!
[Panting]

729
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,500
Jack!

730
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:34,256
Drop... your... weapons!

731
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,558
You heard the man!
Put 'em down!

732
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:39,544
[Jack]
How do we know you're cops?

733
00:43:39,562 --> 00:43:41,680
Show us some ID!

734
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:45,601
Damn straight!
Let's see some badges!

735
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:47,269
Jack!

736
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,388
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!

737
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:55,194
No, Jack! It's off!
Jack!

738
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:58,280
[Jack] We'll give ourselves up
if you show us some badges!

739
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:03,085
Simple as that!

740
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,421
How 'bout it?

741
00:44:06,456 --> 00:44:08,290
[Walt]
No!

742
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:10,909

Jack!

744
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:17,916
Jack, it's off!

745
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:19,384
Forget it!

746
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:21,086
Jack!
