00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,159
Oh, my God, Skyler.

6
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,360
Okay, I'll take the pink one.

7
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:08,978
- It's a princess cupcake.
- Ooh.

8
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,413
- Skyler?
- I know, right?

9
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,999
Well, actually,
they were my idea,

10
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,500
so you are all welcome.

11
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,002
You are the devil.

12
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,007
Hey, buddy.
Ready for a cold one?

13
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,293
Nah. I'm not feeling
hundred percent.

14
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,095
- Oh, no.
- I hope it's not something you ate.

15
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,964
No, no, I just...

16
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,099
We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.

17
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:31,667
Yeah.

18
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:32,685
Uh, no, I'm good.

19
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,804
I-I-I--
We need to shove off.

20
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:36,606
Okay, yeah.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

21
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,975
I'm sorry, Skyler.
I hate to leave you with--

22
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,194
No, no, don't worry about it.
I have plenty of help.

23
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:44,030
- And by that, she means me.
- That is correct.

24
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:46,616
- Holly can help.
- Let's go say good-bye.

25
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,517
Let's go send them
on their way.

26
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,519
- Let's say good-bye.
- Yes.

27
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:52,521
- Too long.
- Mwah. Say, "Bye, Auntie."

28
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,323
Bye, sweetie. Bye-bye.

29
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:57,577
Hey, and you know it's been about a
hundred years since we've been bowling.

30
00:06:57,628 --> 00:07:00,029
- Well, then, how about Thursday night?
- Oh, that sounds great.

31
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,364
Oh, thank you for having us.

32
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:05,367
Hey. You okay to drive?

33
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,720
Yeah.

34
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,973
All right.
Well, feel better.

35
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:16,095
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank."
Bye-bye.

36
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,016
Bye-bye.

37
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,485
Bye, Aunt Marie.
Can you wave bye?

38
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,854
All right, let's get started
on those dishes. Come on.

39
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:28,191
- You. - No, you.
- You. Washing, okay?

40
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,660
- I'll dry. You wash.
- Hello, Carol.

41
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:33,913
Oh, hi, Walt.

42
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,449
Europe.
I can't believe it.

43
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,919
- Were you there when she said that?
- Yeah.

44
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:42,088
You okay?
Your stomach okay?

45
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:43,405
Yeah, oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

46
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:48,344
Okay.
God. Jesus, Europe.

47
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:51,047
I just-- And, you know,
where they were

48
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,915
three or four months ago.

49
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,583
Oh, she was talking about it.

50
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,602
Like it was a second honeymoon--

51
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,137
We need to go to Europe.

52
00:07:58,188 --> 00:07:59,639
- We could go.
- Yeah.

53
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,358
It'd have to be, like,
a business trip, you know.

54
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,393
It could, um--
We could go to Italy.

55
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:06,779
To, um, Lake Como.

56
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,197
It's "Como," right?

57
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:09,932
...Like Mario Cuomo?

58
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:21,244
Hank. Hank?

59
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:22,278
Hank?

60
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,580
Baby, you okay?

61
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,249
Hank!

62
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:32,788
Oh, my God.
Hank!

63
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:36,843
Hank! Hank! Oh, my God!

64
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:40,296
Hank, are you--

65
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,515
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- I'm good.

66
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:46,185
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

67
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:49,188
Okay. You okay?
Just take a breath.

68
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,023
Oh, God, sweetheart.

69
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:52,491
It was an accident.
It happens.

70
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,027
I'll make the appointment.
All you have to do is show up.

71
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:58,314
For what? Three hours
in the Emergency Room?

72
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,498
All for nothing?

73
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,667
All they did was rule out
a heart attack.

74
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:04,086
- What if it happens again?
- It's not gonna happen again.

75
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:07,373
How can you know that? You can't even
say what it was in the first place.

76
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:08,841
Marie, baby, I'm okay.

77
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:12,461
I'm fine. Trust me.
Discussion over.

78
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:15,131
- And do not tell Skyler.
- What? Why?

79
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:17,300
Just don't.

80
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:19,719
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

81
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,769
_

82
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:42,976
_

83
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,557
_

84
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:24,667
<i>Hola,</i> Mariano.

85
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:25,701
Morning.

86
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,736
Luis. Enrique.

87
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,672
Oh, <i>feliz cumpleaños,</i> Enrique.

88
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,674
Hi.

89
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,260
Hi.

90
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:38,464
Here you go.

91
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,582
There's complimentary
coffee inside.

92
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,269
Have an A-1 day.

93
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,471
Air fresheners
are high margin, right?

94
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,556
At 30 cents wholesale, yeah.

95
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,609
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display,

96
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,945
separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

97
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,533
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

98
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,236
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

99
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,122
So maybe we move that
over to the cash register

100
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,607
by the five-hour
energy drink.

101
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,126
Sure. Fine.

102
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,247
Yeah, yeah.
Come here.

103
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:14,116
Speaking of the business,

104
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,419
the story comes first.

105
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,838
The story is is that
we are car wash owners,

106
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,172
pure and simple.

107
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,843
But if our story is that
the car wash is successful,

108
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:27,129
what do successful
car wash owners do?

109
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:30,299
They buy more car washes.

110
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:34,770
Listen. Skyler.

111
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:37,490
We'll be laundering
that money for years.

112
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:39,492
Decades.

113
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:42,495
Wouldn't two
be better than one?

114
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,532
Well, there's gentle hands
over by Kirtland.

115
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,617
I do love that location.

116
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,039
I'll think about it.

117
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,757
Yeah. Right. Right.

118
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,043
To be continued.

119
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,260
Okay.

120
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,432
Good morning.
Welcome to A-1.

121
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,551
Just the regular, please.

122
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,337
Well, we're having a special
on hand wax-- 21.99--

123
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:11,440
if you're interested in getting
rid of those water spots.

124
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,142
Just the regular is fine.

125
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:17,012
Okay. Well, there's complimentary
coffee inside while you're waiting.

126
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,365
Have an A-1 day.

127
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:26,072
Please give this to
your car wash professional,

128
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,374
and have an A-1 day.

129
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,864
68%. And falling.

130
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,917
Good morning. May I have
your ticket, please?

131
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:41,804
I knew there would be
a drop in quality, but 68%?

132
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:45,707
This is not what I agreed to.

133
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,394
I left a viable operation.

134
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:50,396
The rest was up to you.

135
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,398
May I have your ticket, please?

136
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,483
I'm only asking for a few days.

137
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:57,069
A week at most.
Call it a tutorial.

138
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:59,221
That's the standard wash.

139
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:02,575
Fix this.
Get the ship back on course.

140
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,578
We'll make it worth your while.

141
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:09,081
That'll be 14.95, please.

142
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,369
Listen, this is
a complicated situation.

143
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,621
There are a lot
of moving parts.

144
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:19,175
None of which are my concern.

145
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,129
You're putting me
in a box here.

146
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,347
You know what could happen.

147
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:30,136
Again, none of my concern.

148
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:31,770
There's your change.

149
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,056
And if you'll hand this
to your car wash professional.

150
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,091
And have an A-1 day.

151
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:44,200
- Listen--
- It'll only be a few more minutes.

152
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,768
There's some complimentary
coffee, if you like.

153
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,134
What's up?

154
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:04,970
Just wondering
who washes a rental car.

155
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:10,976
Walt, who was that?

156
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:17,349
She's a former
business associate

157
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,518
who wants me to go back.

158
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,904
And I won't.

159
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,622
Enrique, this one's finished.

160
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,208
<i>Terminado. Gracias.</i>

161
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,544
Get out of here.
Now.

162
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:49,682
- Excuse me?
- Never come back here.

163
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:52,301
Do you understand me?

164
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:54,887
- I--
- Go.

165
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:19,579
- Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:23,116
Oh, thanks.

167
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,068
Are you going in today?

168
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,871
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.
- Good.

169
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,257
Just, you no, stay out of there
till you're sure you're better.

170
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,758
- Yeah.
- Stay home and rest.

171
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,760
- Don't even think about work.
- Okay.

172
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,379
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

173
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:52,979
- Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
- Hey, guys.

174
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,315
- What's going on?
- Just dropping these off, ma'am.

175
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,867
- Where would you like them?
- Bring them around to the garage, guys.

176
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:01,204
I got it.
Have a good day.

177
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:04,607
You too.

178
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,077
Boss, Janice said to tell you

179
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,346
a few of them
might not have indexes.

180
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:13,800
- We could give you a hand sorting
through them. - No, I got it. Thanks.

181
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,104
All right.

182
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,151
- See you, boss.
- Okay.

183
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,249
Okay, um...

Dude, you are tripping.

209
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:26,968
I'm not dead. I'm on
the starship <i>Enterprise,</i>

210
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:30,722
macking on Yeoman Rand, while the
Andorian with the Disrupter's

211
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:33,024
back on Talos Four or whatever.

212
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,527
What do you think
all those sparkles and shit are?

213
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,528
The transporters are breaking
you apart, man.

214
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,781
Down to your molecules
and bones.

215
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,399
They're making a copy.

216
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,902
That dude who comes out on the
other side, he's not you.

217
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:45,787
He's a Color Xerox.

218
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,373
So you're telling me every time
Kirk went into the transport,

219
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,242
he was killing himself?

220
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:54,195
So over the whole series,
there was, like, 147 Kirks?

221
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,964
At least.

222
00:18:55,998 --> 00:19:00,034
Dude, yo, why do you think McCoy
never likes to beam nowhere?

223
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:02,036
'Cause he's a doctor, bitch.

224
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,706
Look it up.
It's science.

225
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,810
I ever tell you about
my <i>Star Trek</i> script?

226
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,712
<i>Star Trek</i> script?

227
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,148
Yeah. I gotta
write it down is all.

228
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:18,553
The <i>Enterprise</i>
is five parsecs out of Rigel 12.

229
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,740
Nothing's going on,
Neutral Zone is quiet,

230
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:23,358
the crew is bored,

231
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:25,827
so they put on
a pie-eating contest.

232
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:29,414
- The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies-- - Tulaberry?

233
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,666
Tulaberries.
From Gamma Quadrant, yo.

234
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,401
That's <i>Voyager,</i> dude.

235
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,588
Okay, blueberries then.
They're eating blueberry pies

236
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:40,091
as fast as the replicator
can churn them out.

237
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,679
Finally,
it's down to just three--

238
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:47,182
Kirk, Spock, and Chekov.

239
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,434
Okay, Spock always wins
these things.

240
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,020
How is Spock
gonna beat Kirk, yo?

241
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,689
Spock's like a toothbrush.
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

242
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:58,426
Spock has total vulcan control
over his digestion.

243
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,595
- You wanna hear this or not?
- Yeah, yeah, go.

244
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,032
Okay, finally, Kirk--
he can't take it anymore.

245
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:08,102
He yorks. Now it's just
down to Chekov and Spock.

246
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,788
But Chekov, you see,

247
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:14,042
he's got a whole fat stack
of Quatloos riding on this,

248
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:17,045
and he has figured out
a way to win.

249
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,331
He's got Scotty back
in the transporter room,

250
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:21,333
locked in on Chekov's stomach.

251
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:24,452
Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

252
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,054
Where is he sending them?
The toilet?

253
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,672
Space.

254
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,975
There's blueberries
just floating out there,

255
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,177
frozen, because it's in space,

256
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:35,564
and Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth,

257
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:38,733
and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

258
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:42,637
Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter
room fiddling with levers,

259
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,806
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in,

260
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,325
and she's got, you know,
her big pointies.

261
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,328
- And Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
- No.

262
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:54,482
Chekov screams. He sprays
blood out of his mouth.

263
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,535
Scotty beamed his guts
into space!

264
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:00,822
No way!

265
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,025
Hey, man, where you going?
You're missing the best part.

266
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,011
Just fill this out.
Bring it back to me.

267
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:26,564
Yo.

268
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,202
Yo!

269
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:38,192
Ohhh.

270
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,324
You know you can't
smoke that up in here.

271
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:19,668
Yeah. Jesse Pinkman's
out here smoking pot.

272
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,903
Give me a break, man.

273
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:29,410
Pinkman, he'll see you now.

274
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:32,747
Woody Harrelson,
live and in person.

275
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,749
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

276
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,268
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.

277
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:39,587
Uh, sorry to keep you
on ice out there, kid.

278
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:42,090
If I'd known it was you,
well...

279
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:44,309
Francesca.
I've warned her before.

280
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,645
One more time,
and it's back to the DMV.

281
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:52,266
So, uh,
are we on our own today?

282
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,935
Barn door open.

283
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:56,437
"Barn door"?

284
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:57,789
Oh.

285
00:22:57,823 --> 00:23:00,291
So, uh, how is the maestro?

286
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:02,293
Things have been quiet
on this end.

287
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:03,995
I haven't seen him.

288
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,948
Just as well, probably.

289
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,450
That whole thing
in the jails--

290
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,252
I mean, when they start
to whack the lawyers,

291
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:12,721
that's when I draw the line.

292
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:17,142
This goes to
Kaylee Ehrmantraut,

293
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:23,098
and that goes
to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

294
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:27,268
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

295
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:29,487
It's 2 1/2 million each.

296
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,990
A total of five.

297
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,527
Mr. and Mrs., uh, who?

298
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,079
Drew Sharp's parents.

299
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:41,583
Drew Sharp-- that's the kid on TV.
The missing, uh--

300
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:44,953
So but why would you, uh--
Scratch that.

301
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,838
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

302
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:50,542
Uh, thing is,
what those folks want

303
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,210
is to know what happened
to their boy.

304
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,045
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep--

305
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:56,548
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

306
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,518
Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
That's Mike's granddaughter?

307
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:04,005
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

308
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:06,007
It's your money.
Okay.

309
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,802
And you're giving it
to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

310
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,760
It's what Mike wanted.

311
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,450
So you and Mike, uh...

312
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:17,518
You've been in touch?

313
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,543
So we're just
talking about charity?

314
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,712
Yeah.

315
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,081
Okay, look.
You know, um,

316
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:33,751
shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy-- I kinda get it.

317
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:35,970
I mean, kinda. But this--

318
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,472
This is a bridge too far.

319
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:39,174
I'm sorry to say, kid,

320
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,044
but you're still gonna be
two miracles short of sainthood.

321
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:49,150
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

322
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:53,021
And my advice is...
Come on, already.

323
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:55,273
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue,

324
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,525
and you better believe
his family's on the radar.

325
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,110
A couple million bucks
shows up,

326
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:01,112
they're gonna snatch it
<i>tout de suite.</i>

327
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:03,198
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

328
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,399
What are you
you going for a hat trick?

329
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,702
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
- No, no, no!

330
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:09,287
I was just--
I was thinking out loud.

331
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,789
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

332
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:15,210
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I-- I live to serve.

333
00:25:18,347 --> 00:25:20,682
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

334
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:22,634
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

335
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:25,086
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

336
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:36,030
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

337
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,433
Yeah, there's a problem.

338
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,270
There's five million of them
here in my office.

339
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:46,324
No. No. Don't.
Just hold onto it.

340
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:51,112
Yes. Ye--

341
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,914
Yes.

342
00:25:52,948 --> 00:25:54,949
Calm down.

343
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:58,586
I'll handle it.

344
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:01,020
Déjà vu, huh?

345
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,724
Jesus.

346
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,776
All right, look.

347
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:10,313
You wanna talk me through this?

348
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,698
What you were thinking?

349
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,287
What you asked Saul to do?
I mean, come on.

350
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:20,656
It's just nonsensical.

351
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,251
I mean, do you...

352
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:35,388
You have any explanation
at all?

353
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,960
What?

354
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:44,680
It's like you said.
It's...

355
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,849
It's blood money.

356
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,568
I s--

357
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,523
Jeez. Okay. Yes. All right.

358
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:57,026
I said that. I did.

359
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:01,247
But it was in--
in the heat of the moment.

360
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,250
I was trying to win
an argument, all right?

361
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:08,171
And I was wrong.

362
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,373
This is your money.

363
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:12,758
Come on.
You've earned it.

364
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,681
Drew Sharp.

365
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,369
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

366
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,491
But, son...

367
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:49,195
you need to stop focusing

368
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:51,964
on the darkness behind you.

369
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,333
The past is the past.

370
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:02,008
Nothing can change
what we've done.

371
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,978
But now that's over.

372
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,899
You're out,

373
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,101
and so am I.

374
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:17,573
That's right.
I'm done.

375
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,411
I've been out
for about a month.

376
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,950
And there is nothing left
for us to do

377
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:32,788
except to try to live...

378
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,876
ordinary, decent lives.

379
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,860
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

380
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:00,783
She needs someone
looking after her.

381
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,937
Mike is perfectly capable

382
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:07,657
of looking after
his own granddaughter.

383
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:12,778
I don't think so.

384
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:15,748
I don't think he is capable.

385
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:19,001
I don't think he's coming back.

386
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:21,387
What--
what are you saying?

387
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,309
You doing what you did--

388
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:29,011
offing Mike's guys?

389
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:32,014
If he was out there,

390
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:35,067
you would have to look over your
shoulder for the rest of your life,

391
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,069
and that's not
how you do things.

392
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:39,071
So I think he's dead,

393
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:42,692
and I think you know that.

394
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:47,530
I don't know that.

395
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:52,168
I don't.

396
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,372
Listen to me.

397
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:59,625
I did not kill Mike.

398
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:03,162
The last time that I saw him,

399
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,931
he had his bag--
the one that I brought him--

400
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,267
and he got into his car,
and he drove away.

401
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:10,970
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

402
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,893
And if-- and if
he does come back,

403
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:21,564
and he doesn't understand
why I had to do what I did...

404
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:25,618
well, then, that's on me.

405
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,741
Jesse...

406
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:36,746
I need you to believe this.

407
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,636
It's not true.
It's just not.

408
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:50,509
So he's out there.
He's okay.

409
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:52,378
Yes.

410
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:54,480
Mike is fine.

411
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:56,982
Wherever he is.

412
00:31:57,017 --> 00:32:00,736
We both know that
he can take care of himself.

413
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:03,906
And he's certainly capable

414
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,942
to provide for
his own family, okay?

415
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,248
Jesse?

416
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,502
I need you to believe me.

417
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:24,543
Yeah. Like you said.

418
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,546
He's alive.

419
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,750
Yeah.

420
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,688
Mike's alive.

421
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,263
Absolutely.

422
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,739
Well, you've gotta
have a college counselor.

423
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:55,207
Are they bringing in
someone new?

424
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,775
I don't know.

425
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:58,494
Um, maybe she'll be back.

426
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,713
And what if she's not?
What are you supposed to do?

427
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:02,915
I mean, what's Louis gonna do?

428
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:05,584
- He's-- he's not worried.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

429
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:08,471
What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

430
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,139
Right.

431
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:12,558
College.
Nothing more important.

432
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:15,127
Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's
still not feeling well,

433
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,763
so bowling's off
tomorrow night.

434
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:19,098
Really?

435
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:22,601
Really. So you're spared
a night out with the family.

436
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:24,854
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

437
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,856
I'll be right back.

438
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,741
Um...

439
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,361
so if bowling's off,

440
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:36,365
can I--
can I get a late curfew?

441
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,260
Ah. Ugh.

442
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,778
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

443
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,163
Have you seen <i>Leaves Of Grass?</i>

444
00:34:58,198 --> 00:35:00,082
Hmm?

445
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,501
My book.
Walt Whitman.

446
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,420
Dark green hardcover?

447
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,872
I didn't even know we had that.

448
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:09,894
Hmm.

449
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:17,769
You don't think Junior...

450
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,821
You're kidding, right?

451
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:24,108
Well, it'll show up.

452
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,511
What's wrong with Hank?

453
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:47,682
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

454
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,885
He hasn't been to work
all week.

455
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,774
Well, good night.

456
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:00,524
Good night.

457
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:11,553
Mister, can you help me out?

458
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:13,889
Spare some change?

459
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:27,853
Hey. Come back.

460
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,372
Yeah. You. Come here.

461
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,408
I got something for you.

462
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,248
Here.

463
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:41,083
Take it.

464
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:42,801
Go ahead.

465
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:46,922
Just take it.

466
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:50,976
Take it.

467
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:56,815
Yeah.

468
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:37,422
Anything you
want us to tell Steve Gomez?

469
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,108
He says he's worried about you.

470
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,810
Yeah. Tell him
I already got two grandmas.

471
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:47,483
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

472
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,604
- We better hit it.
- Yeah.

473
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,907
See ya.

474
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:16,178
- Hey, guys.
- Walt.

475
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,347
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

476
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:21,133
Very good. Yeah. Well, you know.
I can't complain.

477
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,736
Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way?
I was thinking about that.

478
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,654
It's back to 100%.
We're going to District.

479
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:27,689
It's gonna be exciting.
When? This Saturday?

480
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:30,859
This Saturday morning. I think
first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh...

481
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,194
- 10:00.
- Yeah.

482
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:33,862
Be there.
Should be a big crowd.

483
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:36,281
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go!

484
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:37,449
See you, Walt.

485
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:38,784
- See you, Artie.
- See you, Walt.

486
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,318
All right, Scott.
Be well.

487
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,825
They're good guys, huh?

488
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:48,427
Yeah.

489
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:51,213
- Well, it's good to see you
up and about. - Yeah.

490
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:53,465
- How you feeling?
- Well, you know,

491
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:57,035
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

492
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,771
You--
Did you get to see a doctor?

493
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:01,440
I mean,
when one of these things

494
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,908
lasts more than three days

495
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,659
you really should
get that checked.

496
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:06,661
Yeah, no, I--
I did and I'm fine.

497
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:09,564
I'm, uh-- I'm what they say
on the upswing, you know?

498
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:12,284
Mm. Good.
Good to hear.

499
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,286
Yeah.

500
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:17,289
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I--

501
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,960
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

502
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:24,579
Perks of being the boss, huh?

503
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:26,631
Yeah, you know...

504
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,587
How's, uh--
how's things at the car wash?

505
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,639
- Good.
- Yeah?

506
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,608
Yeah, really good.

507
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:41,480
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

508
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,317
- I don't know. Ma-- maybe.
- Yeah, I mean,

509
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:49,071
no one else got sick, so you
probably shouldn't worry about it.

510
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:56,495
Well, Skyler will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

511
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:57,963
Which reminds me.

512
00:41:57,997 --> 00:42:00,048
I better get back to it.

513
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,621
If there's anything I can do...

514
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,629
Feel better.

515
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:28,410
You know...

516
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,413
You're gonna laugh,

517
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:34,699
but I have to ask you
about this.

518
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:39,171
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

519
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:41,373
I mean, it looks just like
the GPS tracker

520
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:43,625
that we used on Gus Fring,
doesn't it?

521
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,546
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

522
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,601
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

523
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:11,536
You okay?

524
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:15,240
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

525
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,748
Ugh!

526
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:31,039
- Hank--
- It was you.

527
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:33,892
All along, it was you!

528
00:43:33,926 --> 00:43:36,178
You son of a bitch.

529
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:38,847
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

530
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:40,982
Calm down.

531
00:43:41,017 --> 00:43:44,102
That call I got telling me
Marie was in the hospital...

532
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:46,721
that wasn't Pinkman.

533
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,723
You had my cell number.

534
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,444
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

535
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:56,064
- Listen to me--
- You bombed a nursing home.

536
00:43:56,082 --> 00:43:59,534
Heisenberg. Heisenberg!

537
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:02,370
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

538
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:04,372
Hank, look,

539
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:06,908
I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just--

540
00:44:06,926 --> 00:44:10,929
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail.

541
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:13,181
Just take a breath, okay?
Just listen to yourself.

542
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:16,017
These wild accusations--
they could destroy our family.

543
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,853
- And for what?
- Damn, like you give a shit about family!

544
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,946
Hank, my cancer is back.

545
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,283
Good.

546
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:33,618
Rot, you son of a bitch.

547
00:44:34,654 --> 00:44:36,655
I'm sorry you feel that way.

548
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,408
I wanna beat this thing.
I do.

549
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:44,045
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

550
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:48,300
But the truth is in six months,

551
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:52,003
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

552
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,757
But even--

553
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:58,560
even if somehow

554
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:02,264
you were able
to convince anyone

555
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:05,016
I was capable
of doing these things,

556
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:07,902
you and I both know

557
00:45:07,937 --> 00:45:10,939
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

558
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:20,248
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.

559
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:24,536
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

560
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:32,127
What's the point?

561
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:39,718
Have Skyler
bring the kids here,

562
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:42,270
and then we'll talk.

563
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:49,344
That is not going to happen.

564
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,985
I don't know who you are.

565
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:01,990
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

566
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:08,913
If that's true,

567
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:12,533
if you don't know who I am...

568
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,890
then maybe your best course...

569
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:23,928
would be to tread lightly.

570
