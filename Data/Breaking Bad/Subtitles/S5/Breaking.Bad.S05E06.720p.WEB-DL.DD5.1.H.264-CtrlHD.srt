00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,201
You guys didn't tell me this
stuff smells like cat piss.

2
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,521
Man.
Shit happens, huh?

- Buyout -

5
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:11,071
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

6
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:16,633
Obviously, I guess
you see it different.

7
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,668
Some of you. But I didn't see
any other choice.

8
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,170
I've been thinking
about this all day,

9
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:22,038
going over and over
it in my head,

10
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:23,723
and it was the only way.

11
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,144
Well, it's not like
I wanted to.

12
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,546
The kid was on a dirt bike.
I mean, he could've just--

13
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,015
He could've just gunned it
and been gone

14
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,883
before we even
had a chance to blink.

15
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,101
We never would've been able
to catch him.

16
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,237
I was thinking on my feet.
I saw a threat,

17
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,322
and I took care of it
the only way that I could.

18
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:40,907
A threat?

19
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:43,410
The kid was waving at us.

20
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:45,745
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

21
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,113
Yeah, but you don't know that.

22
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,581
Yeah, I do.

23
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:49,916
He didn't know what he'd seen.

24
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,167
Well, I didn't want
to take that chance.

25
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,703
I-- The whole point
of this thing was that no one

26
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:55,789
was supposed know that we
were even there, right?

27
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,625
People weren't ever supposed to
know that anything got robbed.

28
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,794
How could we have let
the kid go?

29
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,545
He made us. If I hadn't
done what I did,

30
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,080
the whole mission
would've failed.

31
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,082
I'm-- I'm real sorry.

32
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:11,354
I really am, but I--
But did I make a mistake?

33
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,556
Mr. White? 'Cause to me,

34
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,141
you know, respectfully,

35
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,142
I was looking out for the team.

36
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,694
I didn't want to kill him.

37
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,196
You gotta believe that.

38
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:24,234
At the end of the day, it was
him or us, and I chose us.

39
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:26,653
And I would do it again.

40
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,290
Okay, look. Uh...

41
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:34,961
Todd, why don't you step
outside for a few minutes

42
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:36,713
so we can talk this through?

43
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,715
Of course.
Yeah, you guys talk.

44
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,166
But I just want to make sure

45
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,419
that you know that my priority
is this business.

46
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:44,787
Okay. That's-- that's fine,
Todd. Thank you.

47
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,140
I want to be
a real part of this.

48
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,225
All right? If you could
just see that. I'm motivated.

49
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,810
And I've got connections.

50
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:53,396
Yeah. My uncle's got
his hookups in prison

51
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,765
who I think could be
a real help to us if--

52
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:08,644
Okay. That dude?
Whack-job.

53
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,280
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

54
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,282
Facts? Oh, okay. Uh...

55
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,701
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

56
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,703
A kid that he
didn't need to shoot.

57
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,588
The boy had seen us.

58
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:23,259
And, no, it didn't look like
he knew what he was seeing.

59
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:26,713
But what if he told somebody?

60
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:29,799
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

61
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,851
We can't know what someone--

62
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:35,671
Exactly. We can't know, because
Ricky Hitler there shot him.

63
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,509
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

64
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:40,894
We would've figured it out.

65
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:44,364
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

66
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:46,015
Is that how we do business now?

67
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,350
Look, I understand
you're upset.

68
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,202
And what was that crap
about his uncle

69
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:50,987
with the-- with the prison
connections?

70
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,023
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move.

71
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,858
- Come on.
- It's true, though.

72
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,411
He does have some connections.

73
00:06:58,462 --> 00:06:59,496
Is this a problem?

74
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:02,165
No. It's nothing
to be concerned about.

75
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,700
It came up in the background
I did on him.

76
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,537
Didn't worry me then.
He's just flexing.

77
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:13,059
All right.

78
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,211
It seems to me that we have
three options here,

79
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,430
and none of which are ideal.

80
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:20,567
One, we fire Todd.

81
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,103
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option,

82
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:27,390
seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

83
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,494
And we'd most likely have
to pay him to keep quiet.

84
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,948
And God only knows we've got
enough of that going on.

85
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,419
Two...

86
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,037
We dispose of him.

87
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,080
Which leaves us option three.

88
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,082
We keep him on payroll.

89
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,803
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

90
00:07:56,854 --> 00:08:00,440
We keep him close.
Under our control.

91
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:05,562
Now, option three
would be my choice.

92
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:07,564
Shall we vote?

93
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,102
I vote three, kid.

94
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:29,335
You're still in.

95
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:34,224
Right on.
Thank you so much.

96
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,308
You guys totally made
the right--

97
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:39,312
The next time you bring
a gun to a job

98
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:41,797
without telling me,

99
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:45,301
I will stick it
up your ass sideways.

100
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:49,105
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

101
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:46,879
Hey, boss. What's up?

102
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:49,332
I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

103
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,534
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

104
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:54,137
Well, isn't that sweet?

105
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,888
Here, let me see.

106
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,930
It's a dead drop.

107
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:39,432
- What?
- A dead drop.

108
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:42,101
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

109
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,637
Write the time down.
Roll on it.

110
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,393
Looks like he's leaving now.

111
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,865
- Anybody coming for it?
- Nope, not that I can see.

112
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,619
Nobody in sight.
Could be hours.

113
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,954
Could be.

114
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:04,157
What do you want to do?

115
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:47,825
<i>It's not my fault that
Murtha's got his panties in a twist.</i>

116
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,826
<i>It's an HR issue, Janice--</i>

117
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,530
<i>I read the report.</i>
<i>I'm calling again</i>

118
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:56,633
<i>because that's the wrong</i>
<i>case file number.</i>

119
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,503
<i>All right? I don't know</i>
<i>what kind of-- of shoddy stan--</i>

120
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:03,306
<i>First off, Miracle Whip</i>
<i>is not mayonnaise, okay?</i>

121
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,542
<i>"Looks like it" doesn't equal</i>
<i>"tastes like it."</i>

122
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,545
<i>Secondly, every time it's like
they got to slather an entire j--</i>

123
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,549
<i>- -bastard's just screwing</i>
<i>with us now.</i>

124
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,017
<i>How'd he make you guys?</i>
<i>What'd you do?</i>

125
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,069
<i>We honked our horns
and yelled "yoo-hoo."</i>

126
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,387
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>what did we do?</i>

127
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,688
<i>This guy is slippery as hell.</i>

128
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,941
<i>He's been throwing</i>
<i>every tail we put on him.</i>

129
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:26,246
<i>The guy's a pro.
Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.</i>

130
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,916
<i>One of these days, our pal</i>
<i>Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.</i>

131
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,419
<i>Just gotta be there</i>
<i>when he does.</i>

132
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:41,428
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.

133
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,581
How's it going?

134
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,601
Oh, you know...
This little munchkin,

135
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,220
I could just keep her forever.

136
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:54,274
She is just the sweetest
little baby ever born.

137
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,092
- Yes, she is.
- Oh.

138
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,896
I don't see much of Flynn.

139
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,232
That car of his keeps
him pretty busy.

140
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,818
Yeah.

141
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:08,155
More importantly,
how are you doing?

142
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,406
I'm okay.

143
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,441
How's the therapy?

144
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,212
I know Dave helped me so much

145
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,947
when I was going
through my little...

146
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,883
How's your guy? Um...

147
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:20,950
- Peter.
- Peter.

148
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,336
He's, um, yeah, he's good.

149
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,840
I feel like I'm
making progress.

150
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,141
That's great.

151
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:32,179
You know, you just keep
working through it.

152
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,802
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, honey.

153
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,939
Babe, what is it?

154
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:45,192
It's okay. It's all right.

155
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,644
Just-- Why don't you let me take Holly,
and then we'll talk about this?

156
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:48,995
No. No, no, no.

157
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,497
Okay.
All right, that's fine.

158
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,699
Then how about you
just talk to me?

159
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,252
Just tell me what's going on.

160
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:57,704
I just...

161
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:00,590
I need to make
the right decision.

162
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,093
I need them to be safe.

163
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,711
The kids?

164
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,931
They're safe.
Of course they are.

165
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:10,967
I just miss them so much.

166
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,769
I just want to be with them.

167
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,555
Hey, you know we can bring them
back home anytime you want.

168
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,357
No.

169
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,608
They need to stay.

170
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:22,696
But I just...

171
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,731
I don't know what
to do here. I--

172
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:28,851
Like, whatever I choose
is wrong.

173
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:33,856
Skyler, you have to tell me
what's going on.

174
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,496
I-- I know sometimes you...

175
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,632
I know you think I have
a big mouth sometimes. I...

176
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,220
But if you felt like you
couldn't talk to me,

177
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:49,256
I don't know what I'd do.

178
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:51,641
Okay. So...

179
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:55,095
So what's this about the kids
not being safe?

180
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:59,182
Safe from what?

181
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,735
From us.

182
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,521
From Walt and me.

183
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:08,525
Like what?
Like you're bad parents?

184
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,729
Because you're not.
Not even close.

185
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,731
Marie,

186
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:18,251
there are things you
just don't know.

187
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:21,237
That if you knew,

188
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,240
you'd never speak to me again.

189
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,462
Try me.

190
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:39,306
Okay. If you're
not gonna say it, I will.

191
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:42,809
Skyler, you have to forgive
yourself for Ted.

192
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,943
What?

193
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,646
You can't keep
beating yourself up

194
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:50,950
over some stupid little affair.

195
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,535
Uh...

196
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,571
- Walt told you.
- Please don't blame him.

197
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:58,158
I practically forced him to, and
I wasn't gonna say anything.

198
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,711
But I cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

199
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:03,946
You have to forgive
yourself, Skyler.

200
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,449
You were having
all these problems with Walt.

201
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,386
And Ted is
a really good-looking man.

202
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,641
You're only human.
Hell, I've even thought of, you know...

203
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:19,962
I mean, not seriously, but I
totally get your temptation.

204
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,349
Yeah.

205
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,272
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

206
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,076
Oh, yeah.

207
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,861
I feel better.

208
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,580
Yeah.

209
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,622
<i>For those who love</i>
<i>the taste but not the price,</i>

210
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,841
<i>there's simulated caviar</i>
<i>made of kelp,</i>

211
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,459
<i>a type of seaweed.</i>

212
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:51,177
<i>A fraction of the cost,</i>

213
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:54,097
<i>it looks, smells, and tastes
similar to the real thing.</i>

214
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,801
Ready to get back at it?

215
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:01,354
<i>Unlike fish caviar--</i>

216
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,005
We have breaking news
into our newsroom.

217
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,175
We've just learned that police
are now expanding their search

218
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,696
for a missing Mckinley County boy
after four days with no leads.

219
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,350
Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.

220
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,319
Authorities are extending
their search today

221
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:19,656
east from Crownpoint to Hospah
and White Horse.

222
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,708
Sharp was last seen
riding his dirt bike

223
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:23,793
into the desert
behind his house.

224
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,695
Investigators are asking any--

225
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:37,223
Jesse, nothing can change this.

226
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,727
Yeah. It's just
that kid's parents--

227
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:44,397
I know. Believe me.

228
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,483
I haven't been able to sleep
the past few nights

229
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,568
just thinking about it.

230
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:49,903
But, Jesse,

231
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:53,239
now, finally, we're
self-sufficient.

232
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,575
Finally we have everything
that we need,

233
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,861
and no one to answer to
except ourselves.

234
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,065
And in a year, year and a half,

235
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,251
once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money,

236
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:08,738
there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching.

237
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,374
Until then...

238
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,209
We keep going.

239
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:16,679
And we-- we run our business
our way

240
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:19,716
and make sure that this
never happens again.

241
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,305
Okay?

242
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,690
Look.

243
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,759
Listen, I'll-- I'll
finish this up.

244
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,529
Why don't-- why don't you
go on home? Hmm?

245
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:35,398
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

246
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:38,401
Yeah.
I'll take care of this.

247
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:41,788
You go on.

248
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,834
Hey.

249
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,118
Yeah, I was just leaving.

250
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,624
All right.

251
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,782
Hello?

252
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,350
Walter?

253
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,686
What are you doing here?

254
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,822
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

255
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:11,044
Might as well get this
over with. Come in. Join us.

256
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,669
- Hey.
- Hi.

257
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,257
Where's your cars?

258
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,843
We parked around the block.

259
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:29,095
You might consider
doing that as well.

260
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,400
Okay.

261
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:46,062
So what's going on?

262
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,416
Just since this morning,
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

263
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,401
- What?
- The feds have been all over me.

264
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:55,588
This has been going on
for a while now.

265
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,173
Did they follow you here?

266
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,908
No.
I said I threw them.

267
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,679
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation

268
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,597
dragging a bunch of cops,
Walter.

269
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:07,433
It would be unwise.
How can you be so sure?

270
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:08,801
Well, I've been doing this
a long time.

271
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,386
It's pretty basic stuff.

272
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,090
How long has this
been going on?

273
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:17,093
Since about the time we
started this little venture.

274
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:20,647
The DEA, in particular
your peach of a brother-in-law,

275
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:23,316
has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

276
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,818
And you're just
telling me this now?

277
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,437
What, you didn't think this
information would be of interest?

278
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,989
Wouldn't be germane?

279
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,624
I've been handling it, Walter.

280
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:34,043
We're sitting
on a thousand gallons

281
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:37,413
of stolen methylamine. Jesus!
How can you be so irresponsible?

282
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:38,998
Calm down, would you please?

283
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,584
I can't believe that you
kept this from me. From us.

284
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,618
Did you know about this?

285
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,836
Mike just told me.

286
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,305
And I said calm down.
I've got it under control.

287
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,257
Oh, well, forgive me

288
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,843
for not having
complete confidence.

289
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,845
You know this can't
go on, right?

290
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,296
Yeah, I know.

291
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,899
And I've already decided.

292
00:21:56,934 --> 00:22:00,302
I'm out.

293
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:12,815
Okay. Well...

294
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,984
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

295
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,503
But I really don't see
any other way.

296
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,155
Neither do I.

297
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,673
Obviously, Jesse,

298
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,427
you'll have to take over
the distribution end of things.

299
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,547
Mike, I trust that you'll
bring Jesse up to speed

300
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,599
on your side of the business?

301
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:32,685
Yeah.
Um, about that.

302
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:35,671
Actually, Mr. White, um...

303
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,143
I'm out too.

304
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:44,346
You're what?

305
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,851
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

306
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,070
So, um...

307
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,823
I'm retiring, I guess.

308
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:57,877
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal,

309
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:03,549
that methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

310
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:06,969
And you're telling me that you're
willing to walk away from that?

311
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:09,038
We're walking away
from the meth.

312
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,590
Not the methylamine.

313
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,593
Jesse and I will be taking our
two-thirds and we're selling it.

314
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,480
I've got a connection, a guy I
knew from my time with Fring.

315
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:21,267
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

316
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,437
Mike's thinking we'll clear,
like, five million. Each.

317
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,940
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

318
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,392
And those legacy costs
that you're so fond of,

319
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,411
you won't have
to worry about anymore.

320
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:35,231
And then I will be
going on my way.

321
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,582
Jesse too.

322
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,336
It's a solid plan.

323
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,739
You can come in on this
with us.

324
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,408
That'd be cool.

325
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:50,379
'Course, you know, you are
free to hold onto your third

326
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:54,016
and keep cooking.

327
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,939
You'll be selling
to my competitors.

328
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,809
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

329
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,278
It's a big country, Walter.

330
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:08,030
Whole lot of meth-heads.

331
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:10,616
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

332
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,269
And that's what you're gonna
sell out for?

333
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,289
Pennies? Why?

334
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:19,325
Five million isn't pennies.

335
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,244
It's more money
than I've ever seen.

336
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,247
And when it comes down to it,

337
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,833
are we in the meth business?

338
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,085
Or the money business?

339
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,835
Relax, kid.
There's no one there.

340
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:47,004
You sure?

341
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,006
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

342
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,338
Glad to see
you could make it out.

343
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,574
I was surprised
to get your call.

344
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:26,677
Good surprise, I hope.

345
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:29,079
There's one gallon,
as discussed.

346
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:31,715
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

347
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:35,452
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

348
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,004
All right.
That's fair enough.

349
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:39,590
Shall we talk money?

350
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,258
That one's free.

351
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:44,261
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per...

352
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:49,149
665 gallons, that's 9,975,000.

353
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:52,436
Although I would prefer
you round it up to ten.

354
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,073
Makes it easier
for my partner and I to split.

355
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,107
Steep.

356
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:00,977
Mm. We good?

357
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,980
Yeah. I'll talk to my guys,
but I should be able

358
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,315
to put together
that cash, yeah.

359
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,533
Good.

360
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,252
I gotta tell you,
this is worth it

361
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:10,587
just to get that blue stuff
of yours off the market.

362
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,962
The blue stuff will be
off the market, right?

363
00:26:22,383 --> 00:26:27,304
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666,

364
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:30,340
that seems like an odd number.

365
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:32,142
Two-thirds
of an even thousand, though.

366
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:36,730
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

367
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:39,366
That's not all
the methylamine, is it?

368
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:44,738
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

369
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:48,909
This other party wouldn't be
a problem for you.

370
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,827
His territory
won't impact yours.

371
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,212
You see, that doesn't
work for me.

372
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:53,830
I'm not just buying this
for the supply.

373
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,132
I'm buying this for the demand.

374
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,034
I'm looking to increase
my market share here, Mike.

375
00:26:58,052 --> 00:27:00,220
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

376
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:02,589
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue

377
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,374
will be off the streets.

378
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:13,266
All right. Here's
a new deal for you then.

379
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:18,438
I'll pay you 15k a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

380
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:22,392
Not a drop less.

381
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,195
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

382
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,365
Well then, no deal, Mike.

383
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:54,424
Yes?

384
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:57,527
Yes. I guess.

385
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,815
I don't know.

386
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,651
Why don't you come over here?

387
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:08,488
To my house.

388
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,774
Yes, seriously.

389
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:19,249
Hey.

390
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,791
Yo, you sure this is okay?

391
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,509
She's not here.
Nobody's here.

392
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,849
All right.
So, uh...

393
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,184
Something's come up.

394
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,469
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell,

395
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:42,773
but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

396
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,077
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares

397
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:49,996
of the methylamine unless he
gets your share, too.

398
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:53,483
He wants the entire
thousand gallons.

399
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,985
Absolutely not.

400
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,705
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

401
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:00,874
But I've been thinking
about it,

402
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:04,461
and it really makes sense.

403
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:06,996
- Kinda.
- It does, does it?

404
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,834
Look, when you, uh,
when you started this thing,

405
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:13,336
did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

406
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,505
I know for a fact
that you didn't.

407
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:19,810
I know for a fact all you
needed was was 737,000,

408
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:23,029
'cause you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

409
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:27,651
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed,

410
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:30,520
then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

411
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,405
And we could have it tomorrow.

412
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,074
We would be out.

413
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,542
You could spend time
with your family.

414
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:37,160
No more worrying
about them getting hurt

415
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,045
or finding out
about everything.

416
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,697
Isn't this what you've
been working for?

417
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:43,250
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out.

418
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:47,053
It's not selling out.
Yes, it is, Jesse.

419
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:51,675
I ha-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

420
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:55,345
And I will not
throw it away for nothing.

421
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,232
I don't know how else
to say it, Mr. White.

422
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:02,853
$5 million isn't nothing.

423
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:09,326
Jesse, have you heard of a
company called "Gray Matter"?

424
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,496
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it

425
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,948
in grad school with a couple
of friends of mine.

426
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,734
Actually, I was
the one who named it.

427
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,453
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

428
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:22,873
We had a couple
patents pending.

429
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:25,408
But nothing earth-shattering.

430
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:29,179
'Course, we all knew
the potential.

431
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:31,965
Yeah. We were gonna take
the world by storm.

432
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,137
And then...

433
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:40,774
This, uh-- Well, something
happened between the three of us.

434
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,894
And I'm not gonna go
into detail.

435
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:46,730
But for personal reasons,

436
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:48,481
I decided to leave the company.

437
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:51,785
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

438
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,821
I took a buyout for $5,000.

439
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:59,125
Now, at the time, that was
a lot of money for me.

440
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:03,496
Care to guess what that
company is worth now?

441
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:06,800
Millions?

442
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:10,470
Billions, with a "B."

443
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:14,057
2.16 billion
as of last Friday.

444
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:16,643
I look it up every week.

445
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:19,346
And I sold my share,

446
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,815
my potential,

447
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:25,769
for $5,000.

448
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:29,940
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

449
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:32,609
This isn't the same thing.

450
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:38,081
Jesse, you asked me

451
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:42,168
if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

452
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:44,921
Neither.

453
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:47,323
I'm in the empire business.

454
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:54,631
I don't know.

455
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:59,970
Mr. White, is a meth empire really
something to be that proud of?

456
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,319
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

457
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,538
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

458
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:20,373
Hey, Mrs. White.

459
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,042
Good to see you.

460
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:24,160
You have a lovely home.

461
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,413
- I was just heading out.
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

462
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:30,383
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
- Stay.

463
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:33,586
Come on. It'll be fun.

464
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:35,722
It's okay with us,
isn't it, Skyler?

465
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,874
We don't have anything
special planned tonight.

466
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,380
Yeah.

467
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:46,266
Sure.

468
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,237
Why not?

469
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,859
See?

470
00:33:14,545 --> 00:33:17,263
Mm.

471
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:20,583
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

472
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,771
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

473
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:27,891
My mom always
made them like that.

474
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:30,093
You put lemon in there, too?

475
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:35,264
They are from the Deli
at Albertson's.

476
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:38,284
Oh.

477
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,404
Oh. Well, uh,

478
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,908
Good-- good work
on your shopping then.

479
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:49,129
Because these are choice.

480
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:06,980
I, uh, I eat a lot
of frozen stuff.

481
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:09,966
It's usually pretty bad.

482
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:12,519
I mean, the pictures are
always so awesome, you know?

483
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,138
It's like, "hell yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

484
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:18,975
And then you nuke it, and the
cheese gets all scabby on top,

485
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:21,611
and it's like-- it's like
you're eating a scab.

486
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,813
I mean, seriously,
what's that about?

487
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:28,151
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

488
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,987
You know?

489
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:43,716
Yeah, it's bad.

490
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:50,223
So, hey, uh, how's business?

491
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:51,858
The car wash.

492
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:55,195
Mr. White said it's
going really well.

493
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:57,781
He was, like, you're a--
you're a great manager.

494
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:01,785
He did, huh?

495
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:04,988
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a--

496
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,624
Like a machine.
Like, well-oiled.

497
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:10,293
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

498
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,531
What else did he
tell you about me?

499
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,220
Oh, you know, just...
Just good stuff.

500
00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:22,755
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

501
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,557
Um, we don't really
talk that much

502
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:30,146
about, um, personal--
personal things.

503
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:32,682
Hmm.

504
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,552
Did you also tell him
about my affair?

505
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:57,740
May I please be excused?

506
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:15,358
You know my kids are gone?
Thank God.

507
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:20,480
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

508
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:24,617
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

509
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,203
She made me kick my own kids
out of the house.

510
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,579
She told me

511
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,082
that she was counting the days

512
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:40,950
until my cancer came back.

513
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:47,974
My wife is waiting
for me to die.

514
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:53,646
This business is all
I have left now.

515
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:01,470
It's all I have.

516
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,577
And you want to take
it away from me.

517
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,583
I thought you might
try something stupid.

518
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,169
- Look, Mike--
- Don't bother, Walter.

519
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,505
Come join me in the office.

520
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,425
I don't think so.

521
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,011
That's not a request.

522
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:53,802
Might as well get comfortable.

523
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,988
This deal's going down
tomorrow. It's happening,

524
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:57,606
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

525
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,325
- Got it?
- Oh, so it's okay for you to steal my--

526
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,978
And to ensure that,
you and I are gonna spend

527
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:05,998
the rest of the night
together in this office.

528
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:08,500
- Like it's my birthday.
- Mike--

529
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:11,486
When the deal is done, you'll get your money.
I guarantee that.

530
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:15,824
Let me cook it. I'll double
your five and you still walk.

531
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:19,828
You know, I have never seen anybody
work so hard not to get $5 million.

532
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,162
Mike, you need to listen to me.

533
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:24,132
No, Walter. The last thing
I need to do

534
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,835
is listen to you.
Now, sit down.

535
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,053
All right.

536
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:03,872
Walter, I've got
a bit of a quandary here.

537
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,724
I've got something
I need to attend to

538
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:07,709
before this deal happens.

539
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,847
But for some reason, I don't trust
you alone with the methylamine.

540
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:14,516
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

541
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,903
You gotta be kidding.

542
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:20,439
Stand up for me, please.

543
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,825
Stand up.

544
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,278
Turn around for me.

545
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,896
Arms out to the side.

546
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:29,731
Up.

547
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:45,914
- Oh, man.
- Sit down.

548
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:50,435
Sit down.

549
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:55,057
Give me your wrist.

550
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:03,899
Sorry.

551
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,371
All righty. To what
do we owe the pleasure?

552
00:42:56,405 --> 00:43:00,709
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

553
00:43:02,444 --> 00:43:03,545
This should be good.

554
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:05,280
Mr. Ehrmantraut
has become the subject

555
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:07,282
of a vicious, relentless,

556
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,920
and unwarranted
DEA persecution.

557
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:14,455
Gomie, does that, uh,
that sound right to you?

558
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:16,591
I have no idea what
he's talking about.

559
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,126
Play it as cool
as you like, Fonzie.

560
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:21,813
But we all know you've been
following my client day and night.

561
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:24,399
The poor man can't even spend a few
minutes with his granddaughter

562
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:26,935
without you guys quivering
in the bushes

563
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:29,070
and peeping through
your little binoculars.

564
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:32,807
It's-- Well, it's disturbing.

565
00:43:32,825 --> 00:43:38,246
And it's taken a toll on his
mental and physical well-being.

566
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:40,615
Your client looks fine to me.

567
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:45,170
Well, some hurts only show
on the inside.

568
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:48,323
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

569
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:51,993
Theoretically, these tails
you refer to would be

570
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:53,461
completely within the bounds
of the law.

571
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:55,046
We don't need a warrant
to follow somebody

572
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:56,515
through a public place.
Theoretically.

573
00:43:56,549 --> 00:44:00,302
Yeah, that is, uh,
theoretically correct.

574
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:04,556
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance

575
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:07,842
like this amounts to stalking.

576
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,111
Which is illegal.

577
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:12,647
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting

578
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:15,367
about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

579
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:19,788
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

580
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:23,408
So, I have filed for a
temporary restraining order

581
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:27,662
against the DEA on behalf
of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

582
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:33,368
Where'd you get
your law degree, Goodman?

583
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:35,887
The same clown college
you got that suit?

584
00:44:35,922 --> 00:44:37,305
You know who likes this suit?

585
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,892
Judge Papadoumian. She thinks
I'm a snappy dresser.

586
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:42,928
You know what
Judge Papadoumian hates?

587
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:47,399
Police harassment
of a senior citizen.

588
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:49,317
Sorry.

589
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:51,186
Expect a visit
from the sheriff, agents.

590
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,772
You should have
your <i>ex parte</i> within the hour.

591
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:57,192
Let's go.

592
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:07,085
<i>What the hell kind of
judge would issue this thing?</i>

593
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,703
<i>Papadoumian, man.</i>

594
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:11,206
<i>She's like Ho Chi Minh.</i>

595
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,707
<i>So what we do?</i>

596
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:16,011
<i>Well, not a lot of choice,</i>
<i>you know? We back off.</i>

597
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:19,881
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand
up, and Goodman knows it.</i>

598
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:21,549
<i>I don't see what they're</i>
<i>playing at here,</i>

599
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,085
<i>but if Ehrmantraut</i>
<i>wants a fight,</i>

600
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,554
<i>he's gonna get one.</i>

601
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:28,056
That was a hell of a gamble.

602
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,107
Worked.

603
00:45:29,141 --> 00:45:32,227
Yeah, well, not for long.

604
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:35,697
He's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed toute suite.

605
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:39,200
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

606
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:40,902
So have fun with that.

607
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,788
How much time I got?

608
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:46,541
Maybe 24 hours.

609
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,043
It's enough.

610
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:50,161
It better be.
Whatever you got planned,

611
00:45:50,212 --> 00:45:52,881
you best pull the ripcord
while you still have a chance.

612
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:08,313
- Where is it?
- Mike--

613
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:09,898
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

614
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:11,683
You, sit down.

615
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:13,468
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, okay?

616
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,654
- I am gonna count to three.
- Mr. White's got an idea.

617
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:16,821
- Mike, I'm serious.
- One.

618
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:17,822
- Two.
- It's a great idea.

619
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:19,524
Look, you get
your five million,

620
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:21,809
we both do, and he gets
his methylamine, all right?

621
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:24,696
Just hear him out.

622
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:30,785
Is that true, Walter?

623
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:38,009
Everybody wins.
