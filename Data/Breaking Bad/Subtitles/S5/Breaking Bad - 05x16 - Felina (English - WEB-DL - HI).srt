184
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,641
They won't take my money.

185
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,343
Even if they did,

186
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,728
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

187
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,899
But two rich benefactors,

188
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,569
who are known for their
charitable endeavors,

189
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,387
who would think nothing
of, for instance,

190
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,689
writing a $28 million check

191
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,610
to help victims of
methamphetamine abuse?

192
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:43,029
I have to think that your money

193
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,247
would be very welcome.

194
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,565
It wouldn't make
any sense coming from us.

195
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,234
It certainly would.

196
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:50,403
My children are
blameless victims

197
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:53,089
of their monstrous father.

198
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,625
A man who you
once knew quite well.

199
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,082
Call it a beau geste,

200
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,434
call it liberal guilt,

201
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:05,802
call it whatever you want,

202
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,754
but do it.

203
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,890
And you are not to spend

204
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:14,527
a single dime
of your own money.

205
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,129
If there are taxes

206
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,798
or lawyers' fees owed,

207
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,566
you will take it
right from here.

208
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,486
They use my money, never yours.

209
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,104
Okay, Walt, sure.

210
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:27,373
That...
that sounds reasonable.

211
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:32,495
So what happens next?

212
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,831
I guess we shake on it,

213
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,883
and I leave.

214
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,998
I can trust you to do this.

215
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,500
Yes.

216
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:13,536
Absolutely you can.

217
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,218
Oh!

218
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,887
Don't move.
Don't...

219
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,355
Don't dare move a muscle.

220
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:33,523
You don't want them to think

221
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:35,308
that you're trying to get away.

222
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,726
Just breathe.

223
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,513
Just this afternoon,

224
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,648
I had an extra $200,000

225
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,033
that I would have loved dearly

226
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:47,403
to leave on top of this table.

227
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,205
Instead,

228
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,074
I gave it to the two best

229
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,494
hitmen west of the Mississippi.

230
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,862
Now,

231
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,085
whatever happens
to me tomorrow,

232
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:04,220
they'll still be out there.

233
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:09,041
Keeping tabs.

234
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,426
And if,

235
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,595
for any reason,

236
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:16,715
that my children
do not get this money,

237
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,935
a kind of...

238
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,220
countdown will begin.

239
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,556
Maybe a day or so later,

240
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,024
maybe a week, a year,

241
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,076
when you're going for
a walk in Santa Fe

242
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,062
or Manhattan
or Prague, wherever,

243
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,081
and you're...

244
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:35,118
talking about
your stock prices...

245
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:41,674
without a worry in the world.

246
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,293
And then suddenly,

247
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,179
you'll hear the scrape

248
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,630
of a footstep behind you,

249
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,715
but before you can
even turn around,

250
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,750
- pop!
- Aah!

251
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,608
Darkness.

252
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,283
Cheer up, beautiful people.

253
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,321
This is where
you get to make it right.

254
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,588
[Gretchen sobs]

255
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,488
Oh, yeah, right.

256
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,764
You know, I don't exactly

257
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,933
know how to feel
about all this.

258
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,434
For real, yo.

259
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,104
Whole thing felt kinda shady,
you know, like,

260
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,305
morality-wise?

261
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,340
Totally.

262
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,679
How do you feel now?

263
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:27,846
Better.

264
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:30,683
Yeah, definitely improving.

265
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,235
[Walt] What's this I hear about

266
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:35,872
blue meth still
being out there?

267
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:36,873
What do you mean?

268
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,708
Have you heard anything?

269
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,743
Is it still being sold?

270
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,248
Yeah.

271
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:51,637
By whom?

272
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,807
It's you, right?

273
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,759
I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

274
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,480
Damn, man.

275
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,182
We were sure it was you,

276
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,850
because that shit
is choice, yo.

277
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,235
Better than ever.

278
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,604
I mean, um, you know.

279
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,108
Jesse.

280
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,225
Seriously?

281
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,944
You said he moved to Alaska.

282
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,062
That's what I heard.

283
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,197
Right on, Jesse.

284
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,232
Passing the torch.

285
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,480
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

286
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,952
[Blows]

287
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,008
Wow, what happened there?

288
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,626
It's my birthday.

289
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,095
Yeah? Well,
happy birthday.

290
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,628
<i>[Hank] It's easy money.</i>

291
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,146
<i>Until we catch you.</i>

292
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,264
Walt, just say the word

293
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,966
and I'll take you
on a ride-along.

294
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:09,151
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

295
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,071
Get a little excitement
in your life.

296
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,440
Someday.

297
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:42,501
Welcome to The Grove.

298
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,603
Would you like to see a menu?

299
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:44,687
No, thank you.

300
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,522
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

301
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,340
All right, you got it.

302
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,958
Hey, how you doing?

303
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,877
Good.

304
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,162
How's things?

305
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,197
Hey, I like your...

306
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,868
shirt.

307
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:16,886
My blouse?

308
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,871
Nice, yeah, the color.

309
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,058
That's a nice color on you.

310
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,426
It's kind of a...

311
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,011
I don't know exactly
what you'd call it.

312
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,731
It's kind of a cornflower.

313
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,066
Before you say or do anything,

314
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,935
just hear me out.

315
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,053
Todd...

316
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:35,387
Nobody knows that I'm here.

317
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:37,356
Just listen for two minutes

318
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,908
and then I'll leave.

319
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,276
Please.

320
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:41,661
Please.

321
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,062
Just two minutes of your time.

322
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,082
That's all I ask.

323
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,367
Please.

324
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:57,176
You're running out
of methylamine, aren't you?

325
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,712
I can do the math.

326
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,047
You've been at it long enough.

327
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:04,016
You must be running low.

328
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,219
I have a new method

329
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,138
that requires no methylamine.

330
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,389
And it's easy, and it will

331
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,590
keep you in business.

332
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,093
And Todd, I could
teach it to you.

333
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:17,279
How did you know
to find us here?

334
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,282
10:00 AM
every Tuesday morning,

335
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,234
you and I met here.

336
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,103
You're rather...

337
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,871
schedule-oriented,
I guess.

338
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,108
[Coughs]

339
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,454
Sorry.

340
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,263
I need the money.

341
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,183
I've spent almost all of mine.

342
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,736
Already, just trying to stay

343
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,155
one step ahead of the police.

344
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:02,158
Mr. White, I don't
think there's...

345
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:06,829
How much would it cost us?

346
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,614
Nothing short of a million,

347
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,166
and believe me, for this,

348
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,036
that is...
is giving it away.

349
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,487
I think Jack should hear this.

350
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,373
Yeah, I don't know.

351
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:19,825
Now listen, I can...

352
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:21,794
I can come up there tonight

353
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,796
and talk to him.

354
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,664
He'd get it.

355
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:29,218
This is a win-win
situation.

356
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,970
Hi, what can I get for you two?

357
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:32,471
He's just leaving.

358
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,024
Good seeing you again.
Take care.

359
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,512
For you?

360
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm good.

361
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,200
And I need more stevia.

362
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,244
Okay, no disrespect to the man,

363
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:56,879
but doing business with him?

364
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,247
Right now,
that's not...

365
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:01,083
Of course, we're not
doing business with him.

366
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,369
Todd, please.

367
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:06,538
Don't make me
walk you through this.

368
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:13,479
Jesus.

Hey.

<i>Walt's in town.</i>

00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,440
Yeah?

389
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:29,225
That car they thought he stole

390
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,393
in New Hampshire,

391
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:31,977
they found it in
a Denny's parking lot

392
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:33,595
right on Central.

<i>the one on the right,
what's her name, Becky?</i>

395
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,452
Becky's on the left.
Carol's on the right.

<i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

397
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,605
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

398
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:45,875
Just this morning,
plain as day.

399
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,943
He's there, walking
out of your house,

400
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:50,629
and he calls her by name.

401
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:53,132
He didn't hurt her, did he?
He didn't...

402
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,451
No, he's just like,
"Hey, Becky!"

403
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:58,137
Or Carol, whatever.

404
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,923
<i>She said he looked
exactly like the Unabomber,</i>

405

<i>but she's positive it was him.</i>

406
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,677
Skyler, we're getting
calls from all over town.

407
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:06,262
He's here, he's there,

408
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:07,813
he's going
to blow up city hall.

409
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,482
Apparently he has
some sort of manifesto.

410
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:10,983
He wants to be on
the six o'clock news.

411
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:13,352
<i>- It's just...
- Who's making these calls, him?</i>

412
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:14,904
<i>There are two or three
different voices.</i>

413
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:16,472
<i>They're not sure
if they're crank calls</i>

414
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,324
<i>or people he's put up to it</i>

415
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,776
<i>or if they're actual
anonymous tips.</i>

416
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,944
<i>And it's stretching them thin,</i>

417
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:23,479
<i>which is maybe the point.</i>

418
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:25,281
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
and I've told them this,</i>

419
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:26,949
there are three places
that he would go.

420
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:29,318
To you, to me, or Flynn.

421
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,320
<i>Right.</i>

422
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:32,988
They're watching
the high school.

423
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:36,509
They're probably
watching your place, too.

424
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,844
I mean,

425
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,547
I know that's what
Hank would do.

426
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,549
There's no way
Walt's getting to you.

427
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,385
They are absolutely
going to catch him.

428

No doubt about it.

429
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,138
That arrogant asshole thinks

430
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,672
he's some criminal mastermind,

It's over.

452
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,854
And I needed a proper goodbye.

had the house,

in the middle of the night,

462
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:14,216
wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

463
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,135
They told me not to talk about

464
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:17,470
that woman I saw
at the car wash,

465
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,338

made that clear.

00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:06,802
Call the DEA once I leave.

bacon and eggs

on my birthday,

482
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:24,286
and that I gave you
that ticket.

483
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:28,374
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

484
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:30,409
For what?

485
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:36,332
A burial site.

486
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,368
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

487
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:46,542
That's where
I buried our money.

488
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,311
The men who stole it from us,

489
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:52,264
the men who still have it,

490
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:54,733
they murdered Hank and Steve

491
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,269
and put them in that hole.

492
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:01,490
Now you trade that

493
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:04,059
for a deal with the prosecutor.

494

to understand...

553
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,743
Can we talk business?

554
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,612
I don't think so, no.

555
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:37,581
Did Todd tell you
what I'm offering?

556
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:39,149
Yeah, he told me.

557
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,951
Thing is, we're...

558
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,703
not really in the market.

559
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:46,373
You're running low
on methylamine,

560
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:47,507
what happens then?

561
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:50,627
No, we'll get more.

562
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,179
That Quayle woman's
got her own set-up.

563
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:53,997
The heat's off her.

564
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:55,832
She can break loose a barrel
every now and again.

565
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,601
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

566
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,387
Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

567
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:03,056
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

568
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:07,811
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

569
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:11,565
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:15,535
Wait. Jack.

571
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,686
Where do you want it?

572
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,188
Well, gee, I don't know,

573
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:19,289
anywhere but my living room?

574
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:20,356
Take him out back.

575
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,958
- Jack, you owe me.
- Hey, come on.

576
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:23,577
- You owe me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

577
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:25,361
I owe you, what for?

578
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,913
Jesse Pinkman,
you promised that

579
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:28,882
you would kill him,
and you didn't.

580
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:31,168
Instead, you
partnered with him.

581
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:32,368
You're his
partner now...

582
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:34,554
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

583
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,680
Partners,
what are you talking about?

584
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:45,381
He's alive, isn't he?

585
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,717
He's cooking for you.

586
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:50,487
What, are you gonna lie?

587
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:51,688
Him being alive is not

588
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,407
him and me being partners.

589
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:55,409
Not by a damn sight.

590
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,694
What, you think
I'd partner with a rat?

591
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:59,696
Where's that little
piece of shit?

592
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,364
He's finishing up a batch.

593
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,083
Well, go get him.
Bring him here.

594
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,870
- Uncle Jack...
- No. No, no, no.

595
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,872
This one here
calling me a liar?

596
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:11,925
He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

597
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,261
Jesus. Hustle it up.
Come on.

598

599

just how wrong you are,

600
