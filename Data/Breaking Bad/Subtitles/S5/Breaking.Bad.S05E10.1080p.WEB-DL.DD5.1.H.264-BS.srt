3
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,595
Mariano, it's me.

4
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,844
I need you to get Skyler
on the line.

5
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,185
No, no, I need you to get
her on the phone right now.

6
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,436
Tell her it's urgent.

7
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,442
No-- What do you mean
she won't get off the phone?

8
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,861
I am giving you permission,
Mariano.

9
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,646
You make her get off the phone.

10
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:48,938
Mariano,

11
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,407
who is Skyler
on the phone with?

12
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,171
Yeah.

13
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,064
Okay.

14
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,110
Where is she?
Where's Skyler?

15
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,478
She just kinda left.

16
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,914
She didn't say
where she was going.

17
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,486
Skyler, my--
my head is spinning.

18
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,174
And yours...

19
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,594
I-- I can't even imagine.

20
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,383
So much makes sense to me now.

21
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,818
You jumping in the pool,

22
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:47,606
you sending us your kids,
I get it.

23
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,694
I just wished
I'd seen it sooner.

24
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:55,890
He's a monster.

25
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:59,178
He's a...

26
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:03,072
Look, I don't know
what he did to you

27
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,074
to force you
to keep his secrets.

28
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,425
If he threatened you,

29
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,545
or whatever mind games
he played.

30
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,548
I don't know
if there was abuse.

31
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:16,802
But I want you to know that
you can be open with me.

32
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,722
Don't hold anything back, okay?

33
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,307
I mean, I don't even--

34
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,359
understand if you know
the full extent of this,

35
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:24,810
what he's done.

36
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,118
Not just the meth cooking,
but the lives he's destroyed.

37
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:34,103
But, look,
that's all behind you.

38
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,704
Starting now.

39
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,830
You're done being his victim.

40
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:42,461
Because here's what
we're gonna do.

41
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,866
Sky.
Here's what we're gonna do.

42
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,085
You and the kids are gonna
move back to our house

43
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,003
where you'll be safe,

44
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,462
where he can't get to you.

45
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:57,927
Hank, does Marie...

46
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:01,430
No. No.
We'll get to that soon enough.

47
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:04,767
It's just you and me
right now, okay?

48
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:08,971
Okay.

49
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,642
Before we, um, before
we get you back to the house,

50
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,411
I...

51
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:19,982
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everything you can.

52
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,151
Um, take as long as you like.

53
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,986
Just, uh,
start from the beginning

54
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,756
when you first became aware
of Walt's activities,

55
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:33,045
and just-- just try to be
as detailed as you can.

56
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:37,666
Uh, what--
Right-- right here?

57
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,351
Right now?

58
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,886
Sure. Why not?

59
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,855
While it's still fresh,
you know?

60
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,858
And just, uh,
just, uh, remember to, uh,

61
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,510
just state your name
and the date before you start.

62
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,448
Hank, do...

63
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:55,646
Do we have to--
have to do this right now?

64
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,705
No, we-- we don't have
to do this right now.

65
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,381
No.

66
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,358
But just here's the thing.

67
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,412
You see, I need something solid
that I can bring to my people.

68
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,414
A statement, on the record.

69
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,333
So you testifying to Walt's
criminal activity,

70
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,719
whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

71
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,721
Okay? I mean, you see,

72
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,923
building a case this big,
gathering all this evidence,

73
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,508
enough to get a conviction,

74
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,877
we're talking a long-haul
proposition here,

75
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,379
and I don't want that bastard
running out the clock.

76
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,547
But with your testimony--

77
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,383
Wait, what do you mean
running out the clock?

78
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,071
His cancer.
His cancer's back.

79
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,237
So he said.

80
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:37,719
He didn't tell you?

81
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,913
Who's to say it's even true?

82
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,732
Lying piece of shit.

83
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,236
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll just assume.

84
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,671
Fine. Okay?

85
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,005
You know what?
That son of a bitch

86
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,674
looks me in the eye and he says

87
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,222
if what I know is true, <i>if...</i>

88
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,307
he'll be dead
before I can prove it.

89
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,544
The balls
on that son of a--

90
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,934
I got all these little pieces.

91
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,969
They're all part
of the story, right?

92
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,587
But they don't mean
much on their own.

93
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,356
But when you start
telling me what you know,

94
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,774
when you start
filling in the gaps,

95
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,192
I'll have him in lockup
before the sun goes down.

96
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:15,741
Hank, I-- I...

97
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,284
I think maybe...

98
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,952
Maybe I need a lawyer.

99
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,779
What?

100
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,939
No, no, no, no, you don't.

101
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,659
I-- I think maybe I do.

102
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,078
Skyler, understand,
I am here to help you.

103
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:31,547
But to do that,
I need your help.

104
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,666
We start bringing in lawyers

105
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,884
and they start
putting up roadblocks

106
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,219
where they don't need to be,

107
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:40,055
and my ability to control
this situation diminishes.

108
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,559
Just for my own protection,

109
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:47,346
it just, you know,
it seems to make sense

110
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,181
that I should have
someone to talk to.

111
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,635
Skyler, I'm your--
your biggest advocate here,

112
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,821
and I'm telling you,
for your own good,

113
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,030
you need to get out
ahead of this thing.

114
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,112
I mean, you start,
you know, getting defensive,

115
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,197
I-- I'm not saying
it's right,

116
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,915
but I'll tell you it's a fact,

117
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,484
the DA will look
at you differently.

118
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,453
But you don't know that.

119
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,955
Skyler, yes, I-- I do.

120
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,923
I've been around
long enough to know.

121
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,709
It's in your best interest

122
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,210
to get out there
and show the world

123
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,180
you have nothing to hide.

124
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,505
Look...

125
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:29,063
no one in the world
is more important to me

126
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,443
than your sister.

127
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:35,311
So believe me when I tell you

128
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:40,899
that your best interest
and mine are the same.

129
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,853
But, Hank, you telling me
not to talk to a lawyer

130
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,406
doesn't sound like that at all.

131
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,039
It sounds like what you want...

132
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:56,301
What you want is to get Walt.

133
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,490
At all costs.

134
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,648
Okay.

135
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,039
Okay, let's just--

136
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,813
Slow down. Slow down.

137
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,044
You can...

138
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,959
You can talk to a lawyer later.

139
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,319
But right now,
what we need to do,

140
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:18,937
we need to go get the kids,

141
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,191
we need to bring them
to my house where they're safe,

142
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,559
and then we need
to help each other

143
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,282
put this animal away, okay?

144
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,331
Come on.

145
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,367
- Hank.
- No, come on.

146
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,701
Let's go to the house and we'll
deal with it there. Come on.

147
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:35,914
Am I under arrest?

148
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,173
What?

149
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,460
Am I under arrest?

150
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,768
Skyler, I-- I--
You're not thinking straight about this.

151
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,271
You have to listen to me.
I-- Skyler.

152
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,422
Skyler-- Skyler-- Skyler--

153
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,606
- Am I under arrest?
- No, no, no.

154
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,974
- Am I under arrest?
- No. Sky-- shh.

155
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,026
- Hank, are you arresting me?
- Sky--

156
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:00,740
Am I under arrest?!

157
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,864
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

158
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:52,156
I gotta do it, man.

159
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,602
Dude.

160
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:00,912
Mm.

161
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:03,098
What are you doing?
Huell.

162
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:04,399
Hey, quit screwing around.

163
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:05,467
Mm.

164
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,002
We are here to do a job,

165
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,937
not channel Scrooge McDuck.

166
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,505
You hearin' me?

167
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,340
I hear ya.

168
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,965
Dude.

169
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:17,672
Mm, mm, mm.

170
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,580
Ah, screw it.

171
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,091
Mexico.

172
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,671
All's I'm saying.

173
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,199
Guy hit ten guys in jail

174
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,950
within a two-minute window.

175
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,474
All's I'm saying.

176
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,172
Yeah, it's me. Again.

177
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,791
Listen, kid, you've got
to hide those bags.

178
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:48,794
The monkey is in
the banana patch, <i>capisce?</i>

179
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,379
So... call me.

180
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,181
This was the third message.

181
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:55,066
Where the hell is that kid?

182
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:58,186
That's her.

183
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,221
Don't.

184
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:00,222
I have to talk to her.

185
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,256
You don't have to do--

186
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:02,441
You answer that phone

187
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,142
and Schrader's on
the other end of the line

188
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:06,111
with a legal wire tap
recording everything you say,

189
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,112
you're not doing anybody
any favors.

190
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:08,396
Except for him.

191
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,365
In fact, why do you still
have a battery in that thing?

192
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,703
Take it out.

193
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,653
They might be trying
to triangulate your movements.

194
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:17,276
I'm not being paranoid.
Do it.

195
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:20,792
Can't believe she went to him.

196
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,110
She just panicked.

197
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:24,045
She went right to him
without even talking to me.

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,380
Without a moment's hesitation.

199
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:27,415
I'm not saying
it's not bad. It's bad.

200
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:28,834
But it could be worse.

201
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:31,452
Really.
How much worse could it be,

202
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:32,971
exactly, in your estimation?

203
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,556
What does she actually know?

204
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,057
What has she seen, hmm?

205
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:37,676
Nothing. It's hearsay.

206
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,060
It's all he said, she said.

207
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,595
I mean, the only real evidence

208
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,564
that she can lead them
to is your money,

209
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:43,765
and once we take care of that,

210
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,601
well, then they got nothing.

211
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:50,822
Nothing? Hank knows.
That's not nothing.

212
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:55,684
Yeah. I can't exactly see him
turning the other cheek.

213
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:00,606
Of course there's always, um...

214
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,622
Always what?

215
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,672
Well, have you
given any thought

216
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:12,844
to, um, sending him
on a trip to Belize?

217
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:15,847
Belize?

218
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:17,516
Yeah. Belize.

219
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,002
You know, where, uh,
where Mike went to.

220
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,499
Off on a trip to, uh, Belize.

221
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:28,894
Saul, you better not be saying
what I think you're saying.

222
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,362
It's just conjecture
on my part.

223
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,030
Hank is family!

224
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:33,281
Okay, it's an option that--

225
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:34,733
You understand that?

226
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,701
It's an option that has
worked very well for you

227
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:37,986
in the recent past.

228
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,187
Jesus.
What is wrong with you?

229
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:42,857
My mistake. Family.
Off limits. Of course.

230
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,826
I'm just throwing
thoughts out there.

231
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,244
This is a safe room, right?

232
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,196
Jesus.
Send him to Belize.

233
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,175
I'll send you to Belize.

234
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,835
Finally.

235
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:01,726
It's about time.

236
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,928
Have you two been followed?

237
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,712
Are you sure?

238
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,415
If they had, we'd all
be in handcuffs right now.

239
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:18,539
I, uh, took the tops off.

240
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:21,062
Figured you'd want to check to
make sure it's still all there.

241
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,978
You figured right.

242
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,087
Close enough.

243
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,575
Hey, if you need any help
on the other end.

244
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,461
Yeah, these things are a
bitch to move on your own.

245
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:38,079
I'll manage.

246
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:39,381
And we don't mind overtime.

247
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:40,765
Ain't no thing.

248
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:55,146
Pay Huell and Kuby
and take your cut.

249
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:58,400
The rest is mine.
Insurance in case I need you.

250
00:17:58,434 --> 00:17:59,434
In case you need me?

251
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,486
I'm thinking
the probability is high.

252
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:03,271
Just find Jesse.

253
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,114
Keys.

254
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,739
Saul Goodman, please.

255
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,240
Skyler White.

256
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,710
No, no, please-- please
don't tell me he isn't there.

257
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:34,049
I know he's been
avoiding my calls.

258
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:38,469
All right, well, um,
has my husband been there?

259
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,335
What do you mean
you don't know?

260
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,469
Either he has or he hasn't.

261
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:42,504
I don't--

262
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,121
Sweetie...

263
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Shit.

264
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:54,633
Sky.

265
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:00,555
Sky, I know you're home.

266
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:03,500
Let me in.
Let me talk to you.

267
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:08,446
Skyler, I'm just gonna wait
here until you open the door,

268
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,949
so let me in now
or three hours from now,

269
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,464
but I'm not leaving
until I see you.

270
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,738
Skyler. Please.

271
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,655
Just you.

272
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:30,756
Not Hank.

273
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:37,654
Tell me Hank is crazy.

274
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:42,947
Tell me he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

275
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,455
You gotta give me
something, Skyler.

276
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:53,261
Anything to help me understand.

277
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,354
It can't be true.

278
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,674
Oh, my God.

279
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,514
How long have you known?

280
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:28,743
Hank said that when
you walked into the pool,

281
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:30,478
that's when you knew.

282
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,109
When you had your...

283
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:40,705
But not then.
Before that.

284
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,261
Since Gus Fring?

285
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:51,766
The money.

286
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,099
All that money that Walt made,

287
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:57,522
when you bought your car wash.

288
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,771
And your whole gambling story.

289
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:08,159
- That was a lie.
- I...

290
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,280
Did you know then?

291
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:20,657
You had to.

292
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,321
Skyler...

293
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,677
did you know
since before Hank was shot?

294
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:41,995
Skyler?

295
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:49,115
Marie.

296
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:53,394
I am so sorry.

297
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,914
You're sorry...

298
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:57,898
You're...

299
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,404
I'm--

300
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:05,740
You won't talk...
You won't talk to Hank

301
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,876
because you think that Walt
is going to get away with this.

302
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:14,718
Oh, God.

303
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:23,218
Come on. Let's go.

304
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,733
Come on, baby. Come on.

305
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,708
- Let's go.
- Marie. Marie. Hey.

306
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:36,237
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey, hey.

307
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,271
What are you doing?

308
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,289
She's coming with us.

309
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:39,991
No, she is not.
Give her back to me.

310
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,382
Marie.

311
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:46,113
Hank. Hank, help.
Come and help.

312
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:49,116
You are not leaving this
house with my daughter.

313
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:50,501
Give her back to me.

314
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,553
Marie.
Give her back to me.

315
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:53,638
Stop it.

316
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:54,639
You're scaring her.

317
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:55,640
Marie.
Give her back to me.

318
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:56,791
I'm trying to protect her.

319
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,643
Protect her? How dare you?
I'm her mother.

320
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,291
She's not gonna live
in this madhouse!

321
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:02,296
You do not know
what you're talking about!

322
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:03,297
Give her back to me!

323
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:04,298
- Marie...
- Hank, you have to help me.

324
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:05,350
Listen, I will call the police.

325
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,352
You call them.
You call them, Skyler.

326
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:09,103
I will.
Give me my baby.

327
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:10,137
Marie, put her down.

328
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:11,656
I am not leaving
here without her.

329
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,824
Marie.

330
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:13,825
Give me my baby.

331
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,660
Skyler, we are not
leaving without her.

332
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:17,478
Give me my baby right now!

333
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:19,330
Marie!

334
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:21,017
Do it now.

335
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:24,702
Give her back.

336
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:31,158
That's right.
It's okay. It's okay.

337
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:35,013
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

338
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:37,048
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

339
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:45,973
Okay, mama has you now.

340
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:47,392
Mama has you now.

341
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,727
Mama has you. Shh.

342
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:57,201
It's okay.

343
00:24:57,236 --> 00:24:59,237
It's okay, it's okay.

344
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:01,021
It's okay. It's okay.

345
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,607
You have to get him.

346
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:07,586
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

347
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:11,974
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

348
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:19,882
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

349
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:26,105
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

350
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:33,746
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

351
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:03,652
Walt.

352
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,746
Where have you been?

353
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:24,140
Oh, my God.

354
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:28,518
What happened?

355
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:40,763
You moved the money,
didn't you?

356
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:43,012
You buried it somewhere.

357
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:47,235
Did you get my messages?

358
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:51,908
I told Hank nothing.

359
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:58,464
Walt. I swear I didn't.

360
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:02,451
Say something.

361
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:07,056
Please.

362
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:13,179
Oh, my God.

363
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,932
Walt. Walt.

364
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:46,429
How-- how long was I out?

365
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:48,998
Oh, about four or five hours.

366
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:50,466
Oh.

367
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,301
How are you feeling?

368
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:03,123
It's true.

369
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,067
The cancer's back.

370
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:21,196
Is this it?

371
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:34,927
Does that make you happy?

372
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:40,883
I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

373
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,499
Just tell me.

374
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,049
I know you talked with Hank.

375
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,980
I know you made a deal.

376
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:05,774
Skyler, I'll make this easy.

377
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:08,744
I'll give myself up.

378
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:11,539
If you promise me one thing.

379
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:15,784
You keep the money.

380
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,997
Never speak of it.

381
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:21,974
Never give it up.

382
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:25,861
You pass it on to our children.

383
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:29,315
Give them everything.

384
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:33,806
Will you do that?

385
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,532
Please?

386
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:44,797
Please don't let me
have done all this for nothing.

387
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:59,635
How did Hank find out?

388
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,648
Did-- did somebody talk?

389
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:04,900
No, no one talked.

390
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:09,855
It was me.

391
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,630
I screwed up.

392
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:22,526
The way Hank talks...

393
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:27,110
he's got his suspicions.

394
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:32,327
Not much else.

395
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,351
You can't give yourself up

396
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,637
without giving up the money.

397
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:45,504
It's the way this works, Walt.

398
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,727
So maybe our best move here

399
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:54,020
is to stay quiet.

400
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:34,156
Okay, you can take it off now.

401
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,451
All right, what's so important

402
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:03,886
you had to come
all the way out here?

403
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,471
For the amount of money
I'm bringing in,

404
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:10,021
I think I deserve to see exactly
why it's all going so wrong.

405
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:12,278
Are you an expert
on meth labs now?

406
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:16,243
Are you gonna tell us
how to fix our operation?

407
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:17,933
And what if I can help?

408
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,818
What will it hurt to show me?

409
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,771
I-- I don't like
my time being wasted.

410
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:24,707
Well, I'm here,

411
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:27,877
and ten minutes
is a small sacrifice

412
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:31,337
when we're talking about
a $50 million shortfall.

413
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:33,605
So?

414
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:08,167
Safe to come down?

415
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,619
Yeah. You're good.

416
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:20,662
Ladies first.

417
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:47,323
Okay, now you've seen it.

418
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:50,515
Yep. Now I've seen it.

419
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:53,329
What?

420
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:56,865
Well, how about
we start with it's filthy?

421
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:57,866
What are you, my mother?

422
00:35:57,884 --> 00:35:59,885
What, filthy?
It's just dimly lit.

423
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:03,889
Do you seriously think this is up to
the standards of your predecessor?

424
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:06,208
Because it's not.
Not even close.

425
00:36:06,226 --> 00:36:07,709
Yeah, well,
the product we're making,

426
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:09,595
it's selling just fine.

427
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,546
Heisenberg's standards
don't matter anymore.

428
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:14,984
To whom? A bunch
of scabby Arizona tweakers?

429
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:17,552
They matter to my buyer
in the Czech Republic,

430
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,604
I can tell you that.

431
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:19,855
Therefore, they matter to me.

432
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:22,574
Look, I cannot move
what this person is making

433
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:24,059
if it's substandard.

434
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:25,727
And it is.
It just is.

435
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,246
No offense.

436
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,864
You can do better, do better.

437
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:30,749
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

438
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:32,534
I mean, you tried
to get the man back, right?

439
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:35,204
He said no, so I mean,
what do you want me to do?

440
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:38,173
Todd. Use Todd again.

441
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:42,127
Look, he learned from him,
all right?

442
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:45,414
At least Todd's
first two cooks were at 74%.

443
00:36:45,432 --> 00:36:47,516
On his third cook,
he started a fire.

444
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,935
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.

445
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:50,969
It didn't work out.

446
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:52,471
I wanna cook in my territory,

447
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:54,056
I wanna use guys that I trust,

448
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,258
not Todd, who I don't.

449
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:57,810
And that's the end
of the conversation

450
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:58,894
as far as I'm concerned.

451
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:07,754
I really wish you'd
have given him a chance.

452
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:10,340
Hey.
We have a problem.

453
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:14,069
You stay here.

454
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:12,267
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?

455
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,341
Hello?

456
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:35,023
Safe to come up
whenever you want.

457
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:51,056
I...
I don't want to see.

458
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,509
Okay.

459
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,563
Cool, so I guess maybe, um...

460
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:59,565
Maybe just close your eyes?

461
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:12,861
Okay.

462
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,947
This way.

463
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,057
To your right.

464
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:32,385
Are you kidding me with this?

465
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,218
Uncle Jack.

466
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:49,198
Fire in the hole.

467
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:53,952
It's okay.
Sorry about that.

468
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,333
It's cool, lady.

469
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:07,849
Okay, boys.
Let's take it all.

470
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:09,651
Let's get everything.

471
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,862
Hey.

472
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:41,005
You, uh...

473
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:43,539
going into work today?

474
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:48,145
You're kidding, right?

475
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,352
What about you?

476
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:01,405
Are you going to the office?

477
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,731
You have to tell them, Hank.

478
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,466
Today.

479
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:12,604
Marie, I just--
just don't have it yet.

480
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,605
The piece I need
to prove it all,

481
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,641
it's just--
it's just not here.

482
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,676
Then let them help you.

483
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:21,145
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

484
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:24,248
You've got enough to get them
to believe your story at least.

485
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,517
Put the whole DEA on it.

486
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,153
That's how this
is supposed to work, right?

487
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,105
No.

488
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,525
No? What no?

489
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,910
What are you,
Lone Wolf McQuade?

490
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,194
Look, baby--

491
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,080
You've gotta go in
with this, Hank.

492
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,288
Look,
the day I go in with this,

493
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,470
that's the last day
of my career, all right?

494
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,623
I'm going to have
to walk in there,

495
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:51,645
look those people in the eye,

496
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,346
and admit that the person
I've been chasing the past year

497
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,248
is my own brother-in-law?

498
00:42:03,055 --> 00:42:05,022
It's over for me.

499
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,895
Ten seconds
after I tell this story,

500
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,262
I'm a civilian.

501
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:14,615
And then
how can we help Skyler?

502
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,784
If she comes to her senses.

503
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,988
When I go in there...

504
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:25,793
I'm bringing proof,
not suspicions.

505
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,801
I can be the man
who caught him. At least.

506
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,970
What if you wait...

507
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,172
and they catch Walt
without you?

508
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:42,259
If they find out that you
knew and you said nothing?

509
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,795
Hank, wouldn't you
go to jail too?

510
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:55,573
Hey, Hank.
Welcome back.

511
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,641
Morning.

512
00:42:57,693 --> 00:42:59,572
Hey.

513
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,865
Hey.

514
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,332
Hey. Look who's back.

515
00:43:22,384 --> 00:43:24,668
I had to see it
with my own eyes.

516
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,836
How you doing?

517
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:27,972
Good. Yeah, yeah.
You miss me?

518
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,608
Miss you? Like my balls
miss jock itch, maybe.

519
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:31,859
I didn't know you had balls.

520
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,111
All right, don't make me
sorry I stopped by here.

521
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:37,698
Anyway, uh, you got
a budget meeting in an hour,

522
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,033
and then
you got a meet and greet

523
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,452
with the new Prescription
Taskforce guys, all right?

524
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,870
All right.

525
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:46,657
Hey, uh, you know, listen.

526
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:51,429
Let's see if we can get
that budget meeting pushed,

527
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,764
and instead see
if you could set up

528
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:56,167
a conference call with Ramey.

529
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:57,735
What for?

530
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:00,504
Just a "getting back
up to speed" thing.

531
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,556
You know, for me.

532
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:05,009
All right. You got it.

533
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,090
Oh, hey. Did you hear
about that money thing?

534
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,848
No, what-- what money thing?

535
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,266
Oh, you're gonna love this.

536
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,307
It involves your old pal
Jesse Pinkman.

537
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,772
Pinkman?

538
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,607
I'll give you this.

539
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,776
Jesse, you're never boring.

540
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,778
Not boring at all.

541
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:27,698
So come on, buddy.
Share with us.

542
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:30,167
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars

543
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,952
all over Albuquerque?

544
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,255
I promise you we can hold out

545
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,090
just as long as you can.

546
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,341
That's a fact.

547
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,376
I got a bladder the size
of a hot water bottle.

548
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:41,545
Yeah. All that cash?

549
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,048
- I wouldn't be able to stop
talking about it. - I know, right?

550
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,133
But I don't think I'd be
tossing it out my car window.

551
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:48,102
My take-home
definitely doesn't allow

552
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,054
for that whole
Robin Hood thing.

553
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,440
But apparently Jesse here
is just raking it in.

554
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,192
- Yes, indeed.
- And I'm sure he's got

555
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,228
a perfectly reasonable
explanation for where he got it.

556
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:59,263
He found it.

557
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:00,698
Or won it in
a card game, maybe.

558
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,616
That's it.
Won it in a card game.

559
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,702
Lucky night at the casino.

560
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:08,142
Jesse, did you have
a lucky night?

561
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:15,463
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let
you gather your thoughts

562
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,832
so we can continue
this stimulating conversation.

563
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,134
Can we get you anything?

564
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,837
Coffee? A soda?
Right.

565
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,999
Yeah. Thought not.

566
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,237
I have a history
with Jesse Pinkman,

567
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:43,991
and I think he can be helpful to me
on another active investigation.

568
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,925
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

569
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,281
You said he wasn't talking?

570
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,083
Let me tell you,
that kid hates my guts.

571
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,485
Despises me, okay?

572
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:58,255
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

573
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:01,876
Then you guys go in there, get what
you need from the little shit-stain,

574
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,407
finish him off.

575
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:07,298
Gives me anything useful
while he's with me, I'll share it,

576
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,627
100%.

577
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,937
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

578
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:16,373
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an
eye on our suspect for us,

579
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,192
- just for a few minutes.
- Absolutely.

580
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,894
I can do that.

581
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,011
Okay.

582
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:22,705
Thank you, guys.

583
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:44,902
