total pump malfunction.

00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:27,675
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naivete,

97
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,426
I took to understand that gas

98
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,345
is no longer
coming out of the nozzle,

99
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,230

to put it back

in the living room rug

00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,968
called your guy back.

181
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,587
No. Somebody misses their
first chance with my guy,

182
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,606
there's no second.

183
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,975
Well, keep looking.

184
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,427
What then?

185
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,862
What do you mean?

186
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,898
I mean,
Pinkman's like a bad penny.

187
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,366
Sooner or later,
he's gonna turn up.

188
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,269
I'm wondering what
you wanna do when he does.

189
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,155
Jesse is upset about the boy.

190
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,407
I just need to explain to him

191
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,042
why that had to happen.

192
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,880
Okay, but say, you know,

193
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:28,832
just for the sake of argument,

194
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,116
the kid's not in the mood

195
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,169
for a nuanced discussion

196
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,120
of the virtues
of child poisoning.

197
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:37,341
You know, his plans are running
more towards stabbing you to death

198
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,425
with a pointed stick.

199
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,428
In that scenario, then what?

200
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,982
You have a suggestion?

201
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,350
We were wondering

202
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:51,438
if maybe this isn't
an "Old Yeller" type situation.

203
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:53,907
"Old Yeller"?

204
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,659
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,

205
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,661
most loyal dog there ever was.

206
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,580
I mean,
everybody loved that mutt,

207
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,416
but one day he showed up rabid,

208
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,319
and Little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake,

209
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,322
had to, uh...

210
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,793
Oh, you...
you saw the movie.

211
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:16,129
You're full of colorful
metaphors, aren't you, Saul?

212
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:18,882
Belize, Old Yeller.

213
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,001
Just brimming with advice.

214
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,060
Do not float that idea again.

215
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:35,032
Find him.

216
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:53,133
Sorry. Ah. Sorry. Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room,

217
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,637
so I had to go down
to the front desk.

218
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,639
But here we are.

219
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,591
Checked in on Junior.

220
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:05,145
Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

221
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,815
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

222
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,069
How's Saul doing?

223
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:15,322
Saul? Goodman?

224
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:19,392
I have no idea.

225
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,945
No?

226
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,581
You were just out talking
to him in the parking lot.

227
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:31,505
I'm sorry.
Were you spying on me?

228
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,040
Yes.

229
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:36,093
And I feel
just awful about it too.

230
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,211
You know, I played along

231
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,263
with your
pump malfunction bullshit

232
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,248
because Junior
was standing right there,

233
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:45,636
but now I would like
to know what's going on.

234
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,104
[Opens soda can]

235
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,728
First of all, it's no big deal.

236
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:58,031
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

237
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:06,323
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

238
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:11,778
He came over to the house
that time for dinner, remember?

239
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,965
Well, he... he got upset

240
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,801
over this...

241
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,221
something he thinks I did.

242
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,622
I did do it.

243
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,290
But I did it
for very good reasons.

244
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,793
It's... just...
it's complicated.

245
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:30,847
Wait. Are you...
are you telling me

246
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,816
that he tried to...

247
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,736
burn our house down?

248
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,606
That was,

249
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,826
probably for a brief moment,
his intention,

250
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,696
but obviously
he changed his mind.

251
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:49,166
And how does that work?

252
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,168
Him... him changing his mind?

253
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:55,422
[Sighs]
Ah, God.

254
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,323
Look...

255
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,161
With... You've got
to understand.

256
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,662
With... with Jesse,

257
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,883
there are emotional issues,
personal issues,

258
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:08,635
some drug abuse.

259
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:14,608
But he has always been more of a
danger to himself than anyone else.

260
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:17,978
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle.

261
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,029
That's all.

262
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:22,115
So he has never hurt anybody?

263
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,746
No.

264
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,292
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

265
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:38,698
Oh...

266
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:41,968
So...

267
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,421
what's your course
of action here?

268
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,726
Saul's guy, Kuby,
tracks him down,

269
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,845
which shouldn't take long,

270
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:55,599
and when he does, I'm gonna...

271
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,769
I'm gonna talk to him.

272
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,937
Make him see reason.

273
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:03,573
"Talk to him.

274
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,276
Make him see reason."

275
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,949
So I'm clear,

276
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,619
these are just euphemisms...

277
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,571
you're using here, right?

278
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:22,592
No. What?

279
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,462
Wh-what does that mean?

280
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:26,913
My God.

281
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:29,800
I knew
this was going to happen.

282
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:30,801
I knew it.

283
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:32,585
I told you that someday,

284
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:35,639
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

285
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,140
And now here we are.

286
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,424
No.

287
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:41,061
Jesse didn't go there
to hurt anyone.

288
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:44,397
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

289
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,817
He tried to set
our house on fire.

290
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:49,269
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

291
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,487
What if he changes it back?

292
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:52,455
[Holly fusses]

293
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,077
Walt, you need

294
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:59,079
to deal with this.

295
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,664
How much have you had to drink?

296
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,132
[Laughs]

297
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,633
Not nearly enough.

298
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,635
I... I don't know
how we got off

299
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,056
on whatever it is
we're talking about here.

300
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,093
But clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough,

301
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:15,461
because this
is a big overreaction.

302
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:19,316
We all need to just take
a deep breath and calm down,

303
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,319
because Jesse
isn't just some...

304
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:25,272
some... some rabid dog.

305
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,406
This is a person.

306
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,193

that is a threat to us.

307

where we are now
with Hank and Marie

309
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,285
and that awful tape we made.

310
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,820
After everything we've done,

311
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:43,823
you can't just talk
to this person.

312
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:48,044
You're s-saying

313
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:51,598
that I just...

are you saying?

363
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:28,045
It's gonna go great for me.

364
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:42,125
So... you're angry.

365
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,979
I can't sleep.
I'm not eating.

366
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:52,302
Last night I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

367
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,304
This close family friend

368
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,657
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

369
00:24:56,691 --> 00:25:00,861
and somehow this person's
secret became known,

370
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,080
and now you're sad and hurt

371
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,332
and angry.

372
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:09,870
I'm...
I'm in the ballpark?

373
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:14,791
To be this wrong about someone.

374
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:16,877
This off.

375
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:20,163
We all live double-lives
to some extent, don't we?

376
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:21,998
- We all have our secrets.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:24,017
Not like this.

378
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:27,304
Not like him.

379
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:31,358
Marie, I think it's time
you filled me in

380
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,343
on some more details here.

381
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,529
Who and what
are we talking about?

382
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,481
I said I can't do that.

383
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:40,067
It'd be bad for Hank.

384
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,537
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

385
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:48,909
Those kids...

386
00:25:50,194 --> 00:25:52,162
under his roof.

387
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,530
That baby.

388
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:58,001
I'm sick
just thinking about it.

389
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,670
How could I have not seen this?

390
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,376
If I weren't being such a...

391
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,746
idiotic, stupid idiot,
I could've...

392
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,782
We could have...

393
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,921
Blackjack winnings.

394
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,024
Nothing suspicious
about that at all.

395
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,560
Tell me about this movie.

396
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:26,947
Dave, can't we simply

397
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,065
just focus on my feelings here?

398
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,668
The details don't
really matter, do they?

399
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:34,004
There is nothing
to be done, okay?

400
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:35,956
He screwed us, and he won.

401
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,959
Can we just...

402
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,628
[Sighs] Can we talk about
something else, please?

403
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,597
Yes?

404
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,250
How's work?

405
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:51,605
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

406
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:58,779
Marie?

407
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:02,949
Saxitotoxin.

408
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:04,951
"Derived from shellfish.

409
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:09,606
Produces a flaccid paralysis
that leaves the victim conscious

410

of symptoms.

411

Death occurs
from respiratory failure."

412
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:17,947
That is definitely a contender.

413
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:20,617
Marie,

414
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:23,720
you're not ready
to fill me in here,

415
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:26,089
that's fine.

416
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:29,125
But I want you to listen.

417
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:32,562
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult

418
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:35,965
or painful
or seemingly unsolvable,

419
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:37,767
that violence won't make worse.

420
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,655
I know. I...

421
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,824
Don't worry.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

422
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,493

00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:54,167
It just feels good
to think about it.

[Door opens]

426
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,927
- Hey, babe.
- What's the story here?

427
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:06,179
Oh, uh, well, uh,
something's come up.

428
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:08,515
I thought you might wanna
get outta the house for a day or two.

429
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,601
You thought I might wanna
pack up and move out of my own house.

430
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,186
Why?
What's going on?

431
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,605
Look, I don't wanna
get into it now.

432
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,024
But you know that thing with Walt?
There's, uh...

433
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,026
there's been a development.

434
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,862
What happened?
Are you in danger?

435
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:23,530
No. No, no, no,
not at all.

436
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,649
Just...
it's a fluid situation,

437
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,235
and I think it might go a little
smoother if you're not here.

438
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,687
So, I, uh...
it'll be great, you know?

439
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:33,022
I-I-I booked you
a spa package at La Posada.

440

You can do
that river stones thing.

is going on?

[Relaxed breathing]

446
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,395
He was a little keyed-up.
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

447
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:05,722
Okay. So listen.

448
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,108
I bring that kid in and...
and put him in the system,

449
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,726
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later.

450
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:13,229
You know, my last ten witnesses
died in jail, remember?

451
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,249
A-a-and I can't use a DEA safe
house without writing him up.

452
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:18,034
I can't risk a... a motel.

453

I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place for him.

454
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:23,206
For now.
Just for a day or two, tops.

455
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,742
Okay, just answer me
this one question...

456
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,744
Is this bad for Walt?

457
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,296
Yeah. Very.

00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:46,724
Just, uh, tell us
everything you remember.

540
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:50,211
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings,

541
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:53,598
any criminal activity you
were a witness or a party to.

542
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:55,516
Anything and everything.

543
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:58,052
Just tell us your story, okay?
[Beeps]

544
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,171
Start from the beginning.

545
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,674
When did you
first meet Walter White?

546
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:08,229
Right. Okay, uh...

547
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:14,402
I first met Mr. White...

548
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,704
Walter White...

549
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:19,907
in junior year chemistry.

550
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,862
He was my teacher.

551
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:41,729
You believe him?

552
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,515
Yeah.
I do, unfortunately.

553
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,517
And I hate to admit it,

554
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:49,103
but I think the kid is right.

555
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:51,555
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

556
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:53,724
Yeah, well, no weapons,

557
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:56,327
no bodies, no working lab.

558
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:59,196
Just the word of one nut-job
meth-head

559
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,866
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-A-Lung-Tumor.

560
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,085
So, do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

561
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,421
Vamonos Pest? Follow up
with the Drew Sharp killing?

562
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,923
Where do we start?

563
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:11,909
I say we start with this.
[Beeps]

564
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,244
<i>[Walt]
Jesse,</i>

565
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:18,716
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza
tomorrow at noon.</i>

566
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,718
<i>I hope you'll
give me the chance</i>

567
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:23,087
<i>to explain myself</i>

568
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:26,440
<i>and talk through everything
once and for all.</i>

569
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:31,929
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

570
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:34,649
<i>So if you wanna come
and shoot me in the head,</i>

571
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,034
<i>that's up to you.</i>

572
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:41,288
<i>Either way,</i>

573
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:43,824
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

574
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:56,954
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

575
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,956
Go and talk to that asshole?

576
00:37:58,974 --> 00:38:00,958
You... you can't
be serious.

577
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,459
Go and listen.

578
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,178
He wants to explain himself.

579
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:06,797
We put a wire on you
and let him explain.

580
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:09,967
So your plan is to do his plan?

581
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:11,986
You... you seriously think
that this...

582
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,106
this whole "Once and for all
in the Plaza" thing

583
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,607
is so he can talk to me?

584
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,160
Why not?

585
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:22,312
I... I...
I can't believe you two.

586
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,916
The dude wanted me out of town before
I came to burn his house down,

587
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:28,119
and now I'm even more
of a threat to him, okay?

588
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:31,038
And he's got a zero-tolerance
policy on threats, you know?

589
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:34,375
If I go to this Plaza,
I'm a dead man is why not.

590
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:36,544
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

591
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:39,764
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

592
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:43,551
I agree.
Except when it comes to you.

593
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:46,554
He cares about you.
[Scoffs]

594
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,389
Can't you see?

595
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,691
Oh, yeah.
You mean when he's not,

596
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:53,527
uh, ripping me off
or calling me an idiot

597
00:38:53,562 --> 00:38:56,614
or poisoning people
that I care about?

598
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:59,567
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

599
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:02,820
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

600
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,872
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

601
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:07,124
uh, ran over those two
drug dealers with his car.

602
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,909
Sounds like he saved your life.

603
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,328
Uh, made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

604
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,598
Yeah, no, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him, so...

605
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,267
I don't know.
The way you tell it,

606
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,636
sounds to me like he's
manipulating you to stick around.

607
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,137
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.

608
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:22,056
All those numbers
he... he runs on you,

609
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,725
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

610
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,727
Come on.
Look how far he'll go to show you...

611
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:29,597
to convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

612
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:32,216
- That's what this is.
- What if it's about, um,

613
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:34,218
killing me, you know?

614
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:36,570
You know, getting me
out in the open,

615
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:40,157
hire some, uh...
some clock tower guy,

616
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:43,727
or... or have me sit on a poison needle,
or something, you know?

617
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:45,229
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

618
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:47,231
I mean, the Plaza's
one of the most wide-open

619
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,066
public places
in all of Albuquerque.

620
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,567
It's middle of the day.

621
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:52,753
And Agent Gomez and I
will be right there with you.

622
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:54,905
Look...
look, you two guys

623
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:58,959
are just... guys, okay?

624
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,746
Mr. White...
he's the devil.

625
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:05,466
You know, he is...
he is smarter than you,

626
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:07,518
he is luckier than you.

627
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,770
Whatever... whatever you think
is supposed to happen...

628
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,923
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite

629
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:14,925
of that is gonna happen, okay?

630
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:18,863
Jesse... Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

631
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:21,148
This is not asking.

632
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,317
Unless you know
another way to get the man,

633
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:24,985
or unless
you wanna take your chances

634
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,037
with the banger boys
over in MDC,

635
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:28,706
then this is it.

636
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,275
This is what's happening.

637
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,277
I gotta piss.
Can I piss?

638
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:35,946
Yeah.
Down to the left.

639
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:40,117
You got another SD card?

640
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:44,255
[Exhales forcefully]
What?

641
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:47,141
What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?

642
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:49,510
"The kid"?

643
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:52,062
Oh, you mean
the junkie murderer

644
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,298
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

645
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:58,185
Well, then, he's right.

646
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,637
Pinkman gets killed,

647
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,157
and we get it all on tape.

648
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:12,854
[Hank] Remember, you're
hurt, you're angry,

649
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,856
but you're here
for answers, okay?

650
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,526
But don't, uh...
don't push the questions, okay?

651
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,028
Let's not get him suspicious,
all right?

652
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:23,115
You let him do the talking,
right?

653
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,250
Just relax. That's what...
that's what matters most.

654
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,285
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

655
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:31,706
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

656
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,792
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
You getting that?</i>

657
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,544
<i>Loud and clear, idiota.</i>

658
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,078
<i>How's it looking, Gomie?</i>

659
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,765
[Gomez]
No change.

660
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:41,716
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

661
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,685
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

662
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,720
Ready to kick some ass, partner?
[Pats]

663
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,144
All right.
Time to go.

[Gomez] Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

671
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,177
He's just standing there.

672
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:19,013
<i>What the hell's he doing?</i>

673
00:43:40,586 --> 00:43:43,221
He's on the move now.

674
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:44,839
He's taking off.
I think he's running.

675
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,041
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid.
Come on.

676
00:43:55,735 --> 00:43:58,853
[Gomez] You got him?
He's at the pay phone.

677
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,022
Who the hell is he calling?

678
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:05,527
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, kid.

679

Nice try, asshole.

No. I'm not doing what you want anymore.
Okay, asshole?

<i>This is just a heads-up to let
you know I'm coming for you.</i>

<i>See, I decided</i>

690
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,595
<i>that burning down your house
is nothing.</i>

691
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:44,199
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

was that all about, huh?

What were you thinking?

704
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:40,538
- Thinking there's another way.
- What?

705
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,342
To get him.
There's another way.

706
00:45:46,512 --> 00:45:48,463
