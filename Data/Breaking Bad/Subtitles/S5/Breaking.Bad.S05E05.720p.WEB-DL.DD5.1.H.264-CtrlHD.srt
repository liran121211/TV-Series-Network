00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:48,512
Hey, man,

3
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:50,714
look at the sad sack I found
moping around the lobby.

4
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:53,248
- Hey.
- Ho. Hey, there, Walt.

5
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:54,783
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

6
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,185
Listen, I'm sorry to drop
in on you out of the blue.

7
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,232
- No, no, no.
- If it's a bad time, I could...

8
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:02,302
No, no. I'm just kind of settling into the
new digs here. What do you think, huh?

9
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,567
Wow.
It is very nice.

10
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,069
- Yeah. Congratulations again.
- Yeah.

11
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,223
- We're all very proud of you.
- Oh, well, thanks.

12
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,925
You know, my days of chasing
dirt-balls is over.

13
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,360
But I'll tell you what,
being a boss--

14
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,196
own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

15
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,615
Uh, Steve,
would you mind if--

16
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,656
I've gotta run something by
Hank, if it's all right.

17
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,728
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

18
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,547
- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Hey.

19
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,088
- Thanks again, Steve.
- Take care, all right?

20
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,590
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

21
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,376
Hey. Whoa.
Look at that.

22
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,094
- Jesus, Walt.
- Oh.

23
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,120
- That's nice. Let me see that.
- Yeah.

24
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,089
Wow. That's beautiful.

25
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,024
Was it a birthday present?

26
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,450
Uh, yeah.

27
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,452
Well, I mean,
not-- not really.

28
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,464
I bought it for myself.

29
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:47,999
Oh.

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,168
Hey, have a seat.

31
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:55,040
New car, new watch.

32
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,942
Ah, good for you.

33
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:59,711
With all the curve balls that
were thrown at you this year,

34
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,706
you deserve to treat yourself.

35
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,308
I mean, as long as you got

36
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,410
the money to spend, that is.

37
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,520
So, how's Sky?

38
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:11,392
Actually, she went
to work this morning.

39
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,161
She wanted to.

40
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,496
She said she needed
to, you know,

41
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:18,176
keep her mind occupied, and...

42
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:20,579
- That's good. Great, actually.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:22,560
I mean, as long as
you're all right with her

44
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,195
being on her own and stuff.

45
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,696
Yeah, well, you know,

46
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,232
I'm right there with her
most of the time.

47
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,802
And Mariano kind of
keeps an eye on her

48
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,136
when I'm not, so...

49
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,538
- Good.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,744
And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

51
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,414
I mean, you know,
Marie goes off about Dave

52
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:41,024
like he's a rock star shrink,
you know?

53
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:42,659
They come in like zombies,

54
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,227
out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

55
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,228
That's great.

56
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:48,224
Actually,
she already found someone.

57
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:50,528
Yeah. Peter...

58
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,597
Uh... hmm.

59
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:54,932
I don't know why I'm drawing
a blank on his last name.

60
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,696
Peter... anyway,
he's out in Rio Rancho.

61
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,716
He's supposed to be top notch.
Good. I'm glad you're on it.

62
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,040
That's not something
you wanna let fester.

63
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:05,056
No. No, you don't.

64
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,091
You don't.

65
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:10,928
Um, Hank,
I-- I just, uh...

66
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,640
I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

67
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,742
No, it's-- it really is--

68
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,677
- No--
- No, it's nice of you, and...

69
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,984
I'd like to come by tonight and
see them if that's all right.

70
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:24,620
Oh, of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

71
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,584
It's great having them.
They're great kids.

72
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,280
I appreciate that.

73
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:30,781
I do.

74
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,296
Something else
on your mind there, Walt?

75
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,536
Walt, feel free to, you know...

76
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:52,512
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

77
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:57,376
And I don't know
what to do, Hank.

78
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,839
I don't.

79
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,408
She...

80
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:08,672
She says that I'm
a bad influence on the kids,

81
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,824
and, uh,

82
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:14,528
that I'm not not good for them.

83
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:16,380
Aw, jeez, Walt.

84
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,331
No.

85
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,319
She thinks I'm a bad father.

86
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,845
Hey, I mean,

88
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:28,832
Sky and you got your issues,

89
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,650
but, uh, that there--

90
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:32,832
That's-- that's...

91
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,300
I mean, I'm no...

92
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,936
I'm not an expert
on parenting or anything,

93
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,621
but from where I'm sitting,

94
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:41,216
I just-- I just don't
see it, you know?

95
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,185
I mean, I...

96
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,024
I think you're great
with the kids.

97
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,492
I think you're great
with the kids.

98
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,828
You're a provider, uh,

99
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:52,320
a role model, you know?

100
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:55,223
Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer--

101
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:59,104
That alone, that's--
that's an inspiration to me, you know?

102
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,740
No, I've made mistakes,
you know?

103
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,168
Yeah, I know.

104
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,487
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want a coffee?

105
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,589
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

106
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:11,104
I'm gonna give you a moment to--
to just get it together there.

107
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,572
Um...

108
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,720
You want cream and sugar?

109
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:16,522
Yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

110
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,424
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

111
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,711
That...

112
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,728
Cup of coffee, right?
All right.

113
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:24,832
Just take a moment.
Take a moment.

114
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,839
You know, you two
are really great together.

115
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,520
Take it from me, buddy,

116
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:26,944
it's always darkest
just before the dawn.

117
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,797
Yeah.

118
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:33,918
What is this place?

119
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:36,755
What is this place?
What are we doing here?

120
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,590
- Get me the table.
- I-I-I can't be here.

121
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:41,888
My-- my daughter-- my little girl,
she's-- she's gonna be home soon.

122
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,422
What?
What are you doing?

123
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,991
Mike-- Mike-- Mike--

124
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,200
Shut up!

125
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,632
Give me her phone.

126
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,155
All right, Lydia.

127
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,724
My friends here
don't know you like I do,

128
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:09,824
so they're very kindly
giving you one last chance.

129
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,898
There's your script.
Study it.

130
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,833
In about 30 seconds,

131
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,011
I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader
on your line here,

132
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:25,081
and you're gonna pass along this information,
and then we'll see what we see.

133
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,936
But here are the rules...
If you yell for help,

134
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,424
try to give the man some kind of coded
message or otherwise tip him off,

135
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,793
I am gonna pull out my pistol

136
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,095
and shoot you in the head.

137
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,032
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

138
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,056
Remember how
you like to do that?

139
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,424
If it happens this time,

140
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,561
I am going
to pull my pistol out,

141
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:48,864
and I am going to
shoot you in the head.

142
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:51,800
Look at me, not at them.

143
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,328
Lydia, look at me.

144
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,931
If you make Schrader suspicious

145
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,232
in any way,

146
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,504
any way at all,

147
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,573
tell me what's
gonna happen next.

148
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,542
You'll pull out your gun
and shoot me.

149
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,936
- And where will I shoot you?
- In the head.

150
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,605
In the head.
That's right.

151
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,774
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

152
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,110
I'm expecting precision here.

153
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:16,206
We up and running?

154
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,842
Yeah.
Um, computer's set.

155
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,110
Okay, Lydia.

156
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:24,512
If you ever needed to give
the performance of a lifetime,

157
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:27,328
it's now.

158
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,397
You're up.

159
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,668
<i>ASAC's office.</i>

160
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:36,671
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
calling for Agent Schrader.

161
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:39,104
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>What's this regarding?</i>

162
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,041
Madrigal Electromotive.
Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.

163
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,293
Hold, please.

164
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:49,472
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
on line one.

165
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,711
Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

166
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:58,047
Well, this is kind of
an odd, uh...

167
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,288
It's just that I
was in our warehouse,

168
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:02,223
supervising a shipment
of chemicals,

169
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:04,392
when I noticed a device

170
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,104
<i>on the bottom of one of our
barrels of methylamine.</i>

171
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,240
- A device?
<i>- Yeah. I-I guess</i>

172
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:10,541
you'd call it that.

173
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,176
I'm certainly no expert,

174
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:15,936
but it-- it looks to me
like some kind of a--

175
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,939
a tracking device
or-- or a GPS.

176
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:22,080
- Huh.
<i>- So I was just wondering</i>

177
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,815
if maybe your people
put it there.

178
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,349
Not that it's
any of my business,

179
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,424
but the last thing
I wanna do is interfere

180
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,424
with a law enforcement operation
or a sting...

181
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,793
or whatever you call it.

182
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,228
So, I don't know.

183
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,430
Maybe you could
give me some guidance?

184
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,866
Uh, well, I'll tell you what.

185
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,232
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would,

186
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,718
and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

187
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:49,024
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

188
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,443
Yeah. All right.
Sure thing.

189
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,856
<i>Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. quayle.</i>

190
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,975
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

191
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,967
Hey, Gomie, come here,
would ya?

192
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,235
- Yeah?
- Hey, man.

193
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,204
<i>You don't know anything</i>
<i>about GPS trackers</i>

194
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:10,208
<i>on a methylamine barrel,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

195
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:12,160
<i>Madrigal Houston</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

196
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:15,200
<i>No. Nobody from my
team planted anything. Why?</i>

197
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,236
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>I figured as much.</i>

198
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,072
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

199
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,192
I-I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

200
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,044
I'm telling you,
I didn't plant that thing.

201
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,095
Shut up.

202
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,631
And there you have it,
like I said.

203
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,064
All right.
So now what?

204
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:33,582
It's not the DEA's,

205
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:36,035
so Schrader's probably thinking
some crew planted it,

206
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,176
looking for a weak spot
to pull a heist.

207
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,762
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

208
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,614
He's gonna wire it
out the wazoo--

209
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,499
Bugs, cameras,
the whole nine yards.

210
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,304
So the warehouse is too hot.

211
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,773
Her supply
is useless to us now.

212
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,320
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

213
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,756
We're 900 miles closer,
after all.

214
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,026
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

215
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,768
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there,

216
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,670
use her security code
to gain access,

217
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,005
and we take every barrel
we can get our hands on.

218
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,944
U-haul can only take
six or seven

219
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,345
before the suspension
gives out.

220
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:09,746
It's a stopgap.

221
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,648
But right now,
it's the best we can do.

222
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:16,186
Well, what about her?

223
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,587
You two drive

224
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:22,190
the barrels back tonight.

225
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:24,158
I'll deal with her.

226
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:27,296
No! No, no, no.
You're making a mistake.

227
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,496
This-- this was not me!
I swear to God I didn't do it!

228
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,732
I don't know, man. It sounds like
she's telling the truth to me.

229
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:36,002
She has a gun to her head, kid.

230
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,604
Everyone sounds like Meryl
Streep with a gun to their head.

231
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,573
I'm sorry, Jesse.

232
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:44,384
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

233
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,352
It's two against one.

234
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,021
Okay.

235
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,592
No. No! You can't kill me!
Come on!

236
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,894
I swear I didn't do anything!

237
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:55,814
<i>Hey, Janice, give me Doughty
in the Houston office, will you?</i>

238
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:58,016
<i>You got it.</i>

239
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,525
<i>He's on the line.</i>

240
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,443
<i>Hey, Erol.
Please tell me you guys</i>

241
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:11,162
<i>didn't do something</i>
<i>as lamebrained</i>

242
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,414
<i>as put a GPS tracker</i>
<i>on the outside</i>

243
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,185
<i>of a barrel</i>
<i>of methylamine--</i>

244
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:18,272
<i>One earmarked for the Madrigal
warehouse in Houston?</i>

245
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,257
<i>Uh, who's asking?</i>

246
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,026
<i>Did someone find them?</i>

247
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,727
<i>Jesus.</i>
<i>Are you shitting me?</i>

248
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,397
<i>Since when do you put a GPS tracker
on the outside of a barrel?</i>

249
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:28,896
<i>We didn't have time to go in
there with hazard suits, Hank.</i>

250
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,347
<i>They were about to ship.</i>

251
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:32,833
<i>We epoxied them to the bottom.</i>
<i>They were well-hidden.</i>

252
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,008
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Well, not well-hidden enough.</i>

253
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,360
<i>How many barrels you tag?</i>

254
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,448
<i>All of them. All the ones that were
headed to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

255
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:42,951
<i>Christ. All right.</i>

256
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:45,119
<i>Well, sit tight.
Let me figure out how to play this.</i>

257
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,804
<i>Next time, a little communication
first, all right?</i>

258
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,222
<i>Yeah, I...</i>
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

259
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,592
Asshole.

260
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,642
Aside... aside from the fact

261
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,210
that we almost killed
this woman,

262
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:02,180
all of those barrels
are already marked.

263
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:04,256
We solve the problem we can.

264
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,192
This has not changed the
equation one iota for her.

265
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:09,728
Oh, come on!
You are not seriously

266
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,648
still considering killing me?

267
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:14,751
I saved you! If it weren't for me,
we'd all be in jail right now!

268
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:18,048
I hate to say it, but
she's-- she's right, Mike.

269
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,576
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

270
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,712
She was saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

271
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:27,584
I am telling you, she will
turn a gun or a badge on us

272
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,469
the first chance she gets.

273
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,488
The woman

274
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:34,724
put a hit out on me.

275
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,768
Seriously?

276
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,137
Wait. A hit?

277
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,839
What?
Like the mafia?

278
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,280
Yeah, like the mafia.

279
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:48,283
Hey! You still need methylamine,
don't you? Right?

280
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,051
You wanna talk methylamine?

281
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,192
Then tell your partner
to stop threatening me,

282
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,827
and let's talk.

283
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:56,229
Talk about what?
You heard.

284
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,465
You can't even get us
a single barrel.

285
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,800
Who said anything
about barrels?

286
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm talking about
an ocean of the stuff.

287
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:15,595
Just give him a minute,
would you?

288
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,440
Trust him.

289
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,875
"Trust him."

290
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,816
Okay.
So, let's hear it.

291
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:30,144
Not without a guarantee that once I
tell you how to get what you want,

292
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,912
I won't be killed anyway.

293
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:34,688
- Fine. You have my word.
- Not good enough.

294
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,190
Look, lady--

295
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,059
Do you have children?

296
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,256
That has nothing
to do with this.

297
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,792
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

298
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,495
Yes, I have children.
So what?

299
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:49,184
You think that somehow
because we're both parents

300
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,353
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

301
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:53,688
- Swear on their lives.
- Oh, what?

302
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:56,032
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

303
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,251
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

304
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,904
Look, you're
a smart businesswoman.

305
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,998
You understand
the concept of leverage.

306
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,632
Please don't patronize me.
I hate that.

307
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,984
You have none.

308
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:16,032
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydia.

309
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:19,335
Is it true that you put
a hit out on Mike?

310
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,339
Yes.

311
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,607
- Why?
- I was scared.

312
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,480
Of Mike?

313
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,465
Not at first.

314
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,218
There are men who used to work with
Gus Fring in custody right now.

315
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,887
Nine of them. They know
everything about me. Everything.

316
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,472
Some of them
even know about you,

317
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,074
assuming you're
the master chemist

318
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,809
they're always talking about.

319
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:46,208
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about,

320
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,310
why put the hit on Mike?

321
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,246
I had no choice.
I'm not going to prison

322
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,381
and have my daughter raised
in some horrible group home.

323
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,560
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

324
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,864
I gave him a list of names,

325
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:59,099
but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.

326
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,960
So I hired someone else.
At that point,

327
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:03,936
there was no option
but to add Mike to the list.

328
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:11,910
This ocean of methylamine

329
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:15,968
that you claim
you can get your hands on,

330
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:19,221
how much are we
talking about, literally?

331
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:22,258
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

332
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,808
Once a week, on a Wednesday,

333
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,777
a freight train
leaves the port of Long Beach

334
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,012
loaded with
industrial chemicals.

335
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,782
There's always at least one
tanker car full of methylamine,

336
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:37,117
which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

337
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:40,192
The train travels east
through Arizona,

338
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:42,561
stops at a rail yard
outside Flagstaff

339
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,530
where it gets broken down
and rebuilt.

340
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,400
But the methylamine
always moves on,

341
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,936
destined for our pesticide
concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.

342
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,968
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

343
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,971
There's a remote
three-mile stretch here,

344
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,056
in Mckinley County.

345
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,058
That's where you do it.

346
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,811
That's where
we do what, exactly?

347
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,280
Get your methylamine.

348
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:07,712
Like, rob it?
Like Jesse James?

349
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,548
You want the stuff? I'm offering you
enough to fill a swimming pool.

350
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,152
You are offering us a quick trip to prison.
That's what I'm hearing.

351
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,604
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

352
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,752
You have any idea
how many alarms

353
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:21,312
that's gonna set off
between here and D.C.?

354
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,381
None, if you do it right here.

355
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,350
If a freight train
is stopped in transit

356
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,452
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots--

357
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,760
Absolutely, a signal
will automatically alarm

358
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,096
the FRA and the TSA
Surface Division

359
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,898
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

360
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,633
But what you don't know,
and I do,

361
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,944
because my job requires me to keep
track of my buyers' shipments--

362
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,113
This is dark territory.

363
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,749
- What's that?
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

364
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,760
It's a dead zone.

365
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,512
No automated
supervision system,

366
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,098
no alarms,
no contact with control.

367
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:52,000
What about cell phones?

368
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,400
- Crew could just call the cops.
- No cellular either.

369
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,503
I'm telling you,
it's the perfect place.

370
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,839
You'd have time enough
to stop the train,

371
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:02,336
siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry,

372
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,804
and get away
before the police--

373
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,739
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

374
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,672
Assuming we can stop
a moving train,

375
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,674
how do we know
we have the right one?

376
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,676
And which tanker car is which?

377
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,878
I can't believe that they
would advertise their contents.

378
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,632
Once the train
gets rebuilt in Flagstaff,

379
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,301
a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

380
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:23,776
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

381
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,178
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

382
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,947
Keep in mind,

383
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:31,072
I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

384
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,141
I expect to be paid.

385
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,411
W-we can talk
percentages later.

386
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,968
You know what this means,
don't you?

387
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,836
We've gotta off the crew.

388
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,538
How do you figure?

389
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:45,573
Well, if we don't, the
engineer's gonna call the cops

390
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,680
as soon as he
gets out of the dead zone.

391
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,216
- It's only three miles long.
- But we're way out in the boonies.

392
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,118
I don't care
if it's in the Gobi desert.

393
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:55,520
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security

394
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,322
are gonna swoop down
with choppers on us

395
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,957
so fast it'll make
our heads spin.

396
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,760
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

397
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,662
- How many in the crew?
- Just two--

398
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,163
An engineer and a conductor.

399
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,965
Assuming there are
no security guards.

400
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,304
No guards. It's not like we're
carrying nuclear warheads.

401
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:12,272
Wait. Two guys.

402
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,496
Can't we just
tie them up or something?

403
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,099
And then what?
Even if we wear a mask,

404
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,634
we're leaving
two witnesses behind.

405
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,436
Bottom line,

406
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,520
I have done this
long enough to know

407
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:26,336
that there are
two kinds of heists:

408
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:29,239
Those where the guys
get away with it

409
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:31,725
and those that leave witnesses.

410
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,920
Give me a break.

411
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,822
You guys were gonna murder me.

412
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:38,525
I thought
you were professionals.

413
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:44,212
Can you say "ASAC"?

414
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,648
"Aaay-SAC."
Can you say that?

415
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,367
Say,
"ASAC Schrader."

416
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,328
If those turn out
to be her first words,

417
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,996
I will beat you with my shoe.

418
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,865
Don't listen to him, Holly.

419
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,367
Aw, I'm just telling it
like it is, babe.

420
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:59,905
Boss man.
I'm the boss man.

421
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,888
Say, "boss man."

422
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:04,473
Am I the boss man?
I'm the boss.

423
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:06,475
Hey, that better be
something from a boob

424
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,394
instead of some fake soy crap.

425
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,007
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little girl--

426
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,359
- Your little girl. Oh.
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

427
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,829
- Oh, no. See?
- Okay.

428
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:18,665
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

429
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:21,051
She wants me.

430
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:26,112
Yeah, my little girl,
'cause I'm not giving her back.

431
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,447
Yeah, I know.

432
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,549
What about emo McGee?

433
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,685
Has he come out
of his room today?

434
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,107
Barely.

435
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:34,875
When he does, he barely talks.

436
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,128
Yeah, well, what do
you expect, you know?

437
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,315
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

438
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:51,384
Flynn, do you want me to
heat up some of that lasagna

439
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:53,600
to hold you over till dinner?

440
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:54,801
No.

441
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,970
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat</i>
on BluRay.

442
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,592
Wanna watch it with me later?

443
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,194
No.

444
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:03,680
And you can keep
talking about me now.

445
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,654
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

446
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,672
We do it
the old-fashioned way.

447
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:14,674
We hit skid row,
the Crystal Palace,

448
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,275
all the halfway houses,

449
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,044
scrounge up about
a dozen skells,

450
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,224
and put them to work
smurfing cold pills.

451
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,159
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

452
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:24,128
You're the chemist.
Admittedly,

453
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,240
it's gonna
cut down on our output.

454
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:28,593
Like a factor of four or five.

455
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:32,013
It also means that
we will eat $80,000

456
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:34,382
we just invested
in our new lab equipment,

457
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,928
which is only good
for a P2P cook.

458
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,364
You know, I don't have
to do the math to know

459
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,916
that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

460
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:46,816
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

461
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:50,086
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

462
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:53,323
Why is making nothing
not an option?

463
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:55,072
- Walter--
- Let me tell you why.

464
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,541
It's because of your nine
guys in lockup, right?

465
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:59,510
You broke it, you pay for it.

466
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,144
And we've talked about
this plenty already.

467
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,392
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more,

468
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:05,627
because what it sounds like
you're telling me, Mike,

469
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:07,329
is that from now on,

470
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,368
we have no choice but to do
this piddling pseudo cook

471
00:24:10,403 --> 00:24:12,504
so that we can pay back
your guys.

472
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,690
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

473
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:19,264
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter,

474
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:21,766
is that you
wanna do this heist,

475
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,960
even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

476
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:27,296
That what you want?

477
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,964
You know, I don't know why

478
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:31,168
you insist on putting
words in my mouth here.

479
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,487
What if we can
rip off that train,

480
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:38,720
and no one ever knows
it got robbed?

481
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,984
Maybe...

482
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,353
Just maybe.

483
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:14,272
It'll come from that direction.

484
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,665
775...

485
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,024
800...

486
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,894
Oh.

487
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:56,114
814.

488
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,118
Wow.
Wait a minute.

489
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,470
It's perfect!
Yeah, we do it here.

490
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,104
We do it right here.

491
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:28,768
How are we looking, Mike?

492
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,043
All clear.

493
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,545
<i>Copy that.</i>

494
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,968
Go down, go down.

495
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:49,637
All right.

496
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,639
That's good, Fernando.

497
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:08,580
All right.

498
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:12,896
This one.

499
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,063
Whoo.

500
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,419
- You good?
- Yeah.

501
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:25,806
- What's your name again?
- Todd.

502
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,474
Todd, on the day,

503
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:29,568
are you gonna be able
to make this climb?

504
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:31,870
Yes, sir.
I'll be ready.

505
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:33,906
All right.

506
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,841
You mind if I ask you
a question?

507
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,209
No. Go ahead.

508
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:39,776
Well, I get why we want
the tank for the methylamine.

509
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,412
But why this other one
for the water?

510
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:44,608
Well...

511
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,977
Jesse, it's your idea.

512
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,946
You wanna fill him in?

513
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,648
It's all about the weight, yo.

514
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,616
The tanker
we're gonna hit--

515
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,136
it gets weighed once when it
gets loaded in Long Beach,

516
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,080
and then again when
it's unloaded in Texas.

517
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:00,249
If the weights don't match,

518
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:02,284
the train company's gonna know
it got robbed.

519
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,786
Okay.

520
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,752
Boosting methylamine from a
train is, like, a major rap.

521
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:10,105
The point is,
no one other than us

522
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:13,312
can ever know that
this robbery went down.

523
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:14,763
Nobody.

524
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,399
You got it?

525
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:20,569
Yeah. Absolutely.

526
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,788
Are you sure?

527
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,673
Yes, sir.

528
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,688
With all that said,

529
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,207
the whole thing relies on us

530
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,176
replacing the weight
of methylamine we steal

531
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,644
with the same weight in water.

532
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,912
Right on. So they'll never
know we hit them. Cool.

533
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,248
Aqueous methylamine
is water-based,

534
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,456
yet it weighs
slightly less than water.

535
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,708
So, we will be removing

536
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,594
a thousand gallons of methylamine
from the tanker car,

537
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:45,995
but replacing it

538
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,312
with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water,

539
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:53,312
which comes to
900.24 gallons.

540
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:55,214
Actually, Jesse,

541
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,015
let's make that an even 920

542
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,256
to account for spillage and
whatever will remain in the hose.

543
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,958
How we doing, by the way?

544
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,064
Uh, 850.

545
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,100
- We're almost there.
- All right.

546
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:08,002
But won't they figure out
they got robbed anyway

547
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:09,856
on account of getting
watered-down methylamine?

548
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,526
Well, out of 24,000 gallons,

549
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:17,063
it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

550
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,287
But, yes, you're right.
They will notice.

551
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:24,064
At which point,
they will blame China

552
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:27,700
for sending
a marginally weaker batch.

553
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:31,456
Damn, you guys thought
of everything.

554
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:41,952
Flynn...

555
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,755
Flynn, open the door.

556
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,808
Just come out and talk to me.

557
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:51,232
I'm staying.
That's all I have to say.

558
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,638
What's going on?

559
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,704
You got what you wanted,
that's what.

560
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,168
Congratulations.

561
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,343
It's me. Open up.

562
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:22,400
- Come on, Junior.
- I'm not gonna ask twice.

563
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:25,069
What?

564
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,104
You know what.

565
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,048
Are you seriously kicking
me out of my own house?

566
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,917
Are you seriously doing that?

567
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:34,336
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

568
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:35,838
We love you.

569
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:38,274
And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

570
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:41,312
But your mom and I need some
time alone, and you know that.

571
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,764
We explained that to you.

572
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:44,349
You haven't
explained jack shit.

573
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:47,456
You want me out?
Explain to me why.

574
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,357
Why do I have to go
to Uncle Hank's?

575
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,416
Give me the exact reason,
or I'm not going anywhere.

576
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,902
This is not gonna be a debate.

577
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,888
What's going on?

578
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,128
Why can't anybody
tell me anything?

579
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:02,698
I want one good reason.

580
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,776
Because we're your parents,
and you're our child.

581
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,496
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as I ask.

582
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,600
Now.

583
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,406
It'll pass.
He'll understand.

584
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,642
Don't start, Walt.

585
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:25,632
I won't change my mind
about you.

586
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,868
Ever.

587
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,070
Well, I don't accept that.
You're my wife.

588
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:33,952
I'm not your wife,
I'm your hostage.

589
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:39,056
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned,

590
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,834
I'll make you a deal.

591
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:44,544
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets,

592
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:47,520
but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's,

593
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:50,323
where they have a chance
of being safe.

594
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:55,462
Think you've seen
too many movies.

595
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,360
Our children are not in danger.

596
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:01,795
Just a couple of days ago,

597
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:04,896
you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

598
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:07,733
You said it like
it was a point of pride.

599
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:10,048
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me

600
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,951
there won't come a day that
somebody will knock on that door,

601
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:16,121
looking to harm you
or me or all of us.

602
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:20,256
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

603
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:24,677
You agree to that,

604
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,272
and I will be

605
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:29,776
whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

606
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:44,576
Okay.

607
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,018
By the way,

608
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:56,736
you're visiting a therapist
from Rio Rancho.

609
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,855
Peter.
Last name-- up to you.

610
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,296
Out burying bodies?

611
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:10,464
Robbing a train.

612
00:33:39,124 --> 00:33:40,591
<i>Yeah?</i>

613
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:44,352
It's me.
I've got it.

614
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:49,088
Okay, Mr. White,
everything's set.

615
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,651
Hey, Wallace!
Up ahead!

616
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:55,588
Stop the train now!

617
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,675
Stop the train!

618
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,705
Now. Go, go, go.

619
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:10,197
Jesus. Thank God you guys
weren't asleep at the switch.

620
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:12,704
It'd be like pancake city
out here.

621
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,806
Oh, man.

622
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,908
You believe this?

623
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,144
I mean, shit fire
and save the matches.

624
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,952
Talk about bum luck.

625
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:25,056
Hey, man, I'm sorry to put
you guys out like this.

626
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,524
What's the trouble with it?

627
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,626
No clue. I was just
driving down the road.

628
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,744
All of a sudden, the old cow
just bellied up and died on me.

629
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:33,696
Hey, either one of you guys
know about engines?

630
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:34,998
Oh, of course you do.

631
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:37,824
That's why they call you
an engineer. Right?

632
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,445
Think it's, uh...

633
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:44,397
Think it's in there
or something.

634
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:45,984
- You think?
- Yeah.

635
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:48,303
Probably a pretty good bet.

636
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:51,757
When was the last time
you changed the oil?

637
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,856
I don't know, man.
I just drive it.

638
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,759
Now. Go, go, go.

639
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:58,194
We're on.

640
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:19,078
- Good?
- Yeah.

641
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:20,413
Go!

642
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:44,897
It looks good up here.

643
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:46,532
How about this one?
Hold up.

644
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:49,602
There it is.
I think this is the one.

645
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:52,054
- We good?
- Yeah.

646
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:54,356
Hey, you wanna get in there,
give it a whirl?

647
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,609
All right.
Let me give it a try.

648
00:40:07,818 --> 00:40:09,736
- Ready?
- Ready.

649
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:14,090
- Nothing?
- Try again.

650
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,606
- Nothing.
- All right. Uh...

651
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,608
Maybe if we all pushed?

652
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:24,800
All right.
It's worth a try.

653
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:30,072
You got any other ideas,
you just shout them out.

654
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,041
Not at the moment, I don't.

655
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,949
You coming?

656
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:39,018
So far, so good.

657
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,987
Give me a status.

658
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,590
Uh, we're at

659
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:47,328
300 gallons and counting.

660
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:52,083
And water is going...

661
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,588
Now.

662
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:01,216
Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.

663
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,320
- Good?
- Yeah.

664
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:13,835
All right.

665
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,832
Ready? One,

666
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,734
two, three.

667
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:37,428
You did remember
to put it in neutral, right?

668
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,360
Yeah, man.
Give me a little credit.

669
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,376
Uh-oh.

670
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:10,461
You sure you're not out of gas?

671
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,730
I got a full tank here.

672
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:15,650
Doesn't make any sense.
Everything looks good.

673
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:18,986
Why don't we just
keep going over it?

674
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:21,656
There's gotta be
something loose somewhere.

675
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,141
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell
of a place to break down.

676
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,693
I know, right?
Crazy.

677
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,645
Hey, you know anything
about engines?

678
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:37,564
Not a whole lot.
I can push you off the tracks at least.

679
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:40,016
Oh, gee, man, I wouldn't want
you to mess up your ride.

680
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:42,369
I'll go slow.
Won't get a scratch.

681
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:43,871
You'll screw up
your nice shiny bumper.

682
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,022
Hey, we're running late
because of you, buddy.

683
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,242
- The man said it was no problem.
- Yeah. Come on already.

684
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:49,860
And thank you, by the way.

685
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:52,546
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

686
00:43:16,404 --> 00:43:19,990
Jesus. Walter, we've got
a good samaritan on the scene.

687
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:22,492
You pull your guys
off that train right now.

688
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:24,161
We're not done yet.

689
00:43:41,462 --> 00:43:44,381
The track is clear, Walter.
I said get outta there.

690
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,644
