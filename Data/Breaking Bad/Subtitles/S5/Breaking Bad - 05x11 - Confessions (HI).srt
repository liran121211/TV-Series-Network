Hey, Mr. White.
It's me.

3
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:29,765
Um, I know you're probably
real busy with retirement,

4
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:30,866
but I just...
I got some news

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,568
I think that you
should maybe know about.

6
00:00:32,602 --> 00:00:34,703
Me and Declan had some
differences of opinion,

7
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:36,805
and it got a little...

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,673
messy.

9
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:42,610
Um, any... It's all
straightened out now,

10
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,813
but just a heads-up there's been
a kind of change in management.

11
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,283
Anyway, um,
just thought you should know.

12
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:50,251
Feel free to give me a call
if you want the details,

13
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:51,886
but, you know, it's cool.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,253
So whatever.

15
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:56,423
Okay then. Thanks. Bye.

16
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,259
Right, so there I am,
I'm on top of the train,

17
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:00,361
pumping the water in,

18
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,795
and he's watching
to make sure we put in

19
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,331
exactly what he calculated.

20
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:05,466
And we gotta be real precise,

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,934
because water and methylene
weigh different,

22
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,435
and he, like,
figured it all out

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,536
to the, like, milliliter.

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,904
Anyway,
I'm up there with my hose,

25
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,606
and we're going
as fast as we can.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,673
'Cause we only got
a few minutes.

27
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,142

we got this guy

the engineer.

29
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,979
And it's all just going great,

30
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:23,849
until this other dude shows up
in this monster truck,

31
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,050
so we're pretty much screwed,

32
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,318
because he can just push

33
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,785
the entire dump truck
off the tracks,

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,155
which, you know,
is what he does.

35
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,656
Wait.
What's your guy doing?

36
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,790
You can't stop him?

37
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,592
Yeah. But what's
he gonna say?

38
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:39,131
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends
are still stealing cargo back there"?

39
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,598
Anyway,
so I'm looking all around,

40
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,765
'cause I know we're not done,

41
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,068
but the gallons are just
slowly ticking away.

42
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:46,037
And finally Mr. White
tells me to cut it.

43
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,272
And so I fling the hose,
I'm grabbing the cap,

44
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:49,306
I'm screwing in the bolts.

45
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,575
Just, like, busting ass,
you know?

46
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:56,447
And, um, and then I feel
the train start moving.

47
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:58,515
- You're...
- I'm on top.

48
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,150
Did you piss your pants?

49
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,617
Yeah, right?

50
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:03,053
So the thing
starts speeding up,

51
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:06,089
so I jump off the moving train.

52
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:07,557
Like, total stuntman stuff.

53
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:08,591

54
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,060

Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
Good movie.

56
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,862
But he jumped out of
a helicopter, not a train.

57
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,630
Well, whatever, man.
It's a good movie.

58
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,066
And this guy Jesse,
he's underneath the thing,

59
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,168
and the train
just drives right over him.

60
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:21,970
And luckily he's...
he's this skinny little guy.

61
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:25,207

they got robbed,

64
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,180
just like we planned.

65
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:36,117
Mr. White told me it was, like,
the biggest train heist ever,

67
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:40,455

Nope. Thanks, darlin'.

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,485
I'm, um, I'm gonna
head out, okay?

179
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Where you going?

180
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:49,122
Uh, Aunt Marie just called.

181
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:53,459
She, uh, she wants me to help
her with some computer thing

182
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,827
and asked me
to stay for dinner.

183
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,436
That cool?

184
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:01,567
Uh, I guess that, uh...

185
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:04,183
Cool. All right.
See you later.

186
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:07,739
Wait, uh...
Son?

187
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,107
Junior?
Hang on a second.

188
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,141
Yeah?

189
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,509
Oh, good.
Come on back inside.

190
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:12,843
What happened?

191
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:13,945
Oh, this? Nothing.

192
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:15,413
No, I'm fine.
It's fine.

193
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,482
Really. I do wanna
talk to you, though.

194
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:19,484
Okay. Are you okay?

195
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:21,619
Yeah. Here.
Sit down for a second.

196
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,326
I just don't wanna keep
things from you, okay?

197
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,665
I mean, you deserve to know
what's happening.

198
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:36,733
Yesterday I passed out.

199
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,136
Briefly.
Very... very briefly.

200
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,775
And I did this.

201
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:44,926
Why... why did you pass out?

202
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:49,545
Well, my latest scans

203
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,783
show a little shadow
on my lung.

204
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:59,454
But my doctor put me right on
a new round of chemo,

205
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,689
which is why I've been
so tired lately.

206
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,725
But I... I was pushing
myself too hard.

207
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,161
I know it. I just don't
want you to worry.

208
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,996
I learned my lesson.

209
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,633
Well, um, what's the...

210
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,535
What now?

211
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,438
What now is that we go on.

212
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:21,775
Like always.
Right?

213
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,279
Hey, don't worry
about this, okay?

214
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:26,313
I know that's hard.

215
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,449
But I beat this once.

216
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:31,319
There's no reason to think
I won't again.

217
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,920
And my doctor says
I'm doing great.

218
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,857
I'm responding really well
to the treatment.

219
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,725
And I'm...

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,531
I'm feeling very...
very good about this, all right?

221
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,199
And what would really
help me out

222
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,191
is if we all stayed positive.

223
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,199
Can we do that?

224
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,735
Yeah? Hmm?

225
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,747
Okay.

226
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,714
So why don't you go on
and help your Aunt Marie,

227
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,749
and... and we'll talk about this
later with your mom.

228
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,352
No. No... no way.

229
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:12,223
I'm staying.
I'm not leaving.

230
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,664
[Door opens]

231
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,000
- Flynn's not with you, is he?
- No.

232
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,169
No.
Why would he be?

233
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,640
How'd it go?

234
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,718
That bad, huh?

235
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,478
How bad are we talking, Hank?

236
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:41,617
I didn't tell them.

237
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,594
Why not?

238
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:46,388
It's just not time yet.

239
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,490
No, it's past time.

240
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,359
Way past time.
We talked about this.

241
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,860
You've got to tell them now.

242
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:54,229
It's just gonna be worse

243
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:57,098
if they find out that
you've kept this from them.

244
00:13:57,132 --> 00:14:00,535
Look, it's just I've got some things
I gotta chase down.

245
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,003
What? What things?

246
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:04,805
Leads, you know.

247
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,406
What leads? What?
Something new?

248
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,508
I'm not keeping anything
from anybody, Marie, okay?

249
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:11,044
Jesus. Don't tell me
how to do my job.

250
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,552
[Skyler]
Walt.

251
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:22,098
Are you sure about this?

252
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,991
It's the only way.

253
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:31,697
Okay.

254
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,067
[Clears throat]

255
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,902
[Exhales forcefully]

256
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:39,871
I'm ready.

257
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,244
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

258
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,846
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

259
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:52,617
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

260
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:55,452
This is my confession.

261
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,681
They're here.

262
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,539
Thank you for coming.

263
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:55,082
Okay. I'll start.

264
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:56,249
Skyler and I...

265
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:57,917
Welcome to Garduno's!

266
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,952
My name's Trent.
I'll be taking care of you today.

267
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:02,188
Can I start anybody off
with some beverages?

268
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:03,356
Margarita?

269
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,092
How about some of
our tableside guacamole?

270
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:08,328
I... I think we're fine.

271
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:10,029
We need some time
with the menu.

272
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,431
No worries.
Be right back with some water.

273
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:18,537
So you here to confess?

274
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,146
There's nothing to confess.

275
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,415
We're here to talk
about Walter, Jr.

276
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,050
Flynn and Holly
should be living with us.

277
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,252
End of story.

278
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:37,155
And while we respect
your opinion,

279
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:41,058
we think that your concern
is misplaced.

280
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:45,828
Skyler and I feel
due to Marie's attempt

281
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,497
to lure him to your house...

282
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:50,600
I wasn't trying to lure him.

283
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:54,204
Regardless of what
you might call it,

284
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:58,175
Skyler and I
would like to ask you

285
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,611
to please leave
our children out of this.

286
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:07,082
Junior has been through
a lot already this year.

287
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:08,784
You are just...

288
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:11,287
This investigation, Hank...

289
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,922
Do you realize
what this will do to him?

290
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:15,491
Hearing these things?

291
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,826
He's gonna hear it when
I kick in your front door and arrest you.

292
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,704
If... that day ever comes,
so be it.

293
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:33,307
You have no evidence
to support your claims.

294
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:36,677
Why tear this family apart?

295
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:41,726
So, how about that guacamole?

296
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,286
We make it right here
at the table.

297
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,959
I'll just give you guys
a few more minutes.

298
00:17:57,731 --> 00:18:00,780
How can you sit there
and listen to this?

299
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,902
All we want is for
those kids to be safe.

300
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,203
You are putting them in danger,

301
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,904
keeping them under
the same roof as this...

302
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,406
They are safe, Marie.

303
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:10,208
You yourself sent them
out of the house.

304
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,677
And I brought them back.

305
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:16,214
Look,
whatever you think he did,

306
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:19,351
this is not
an ongoing situation.

307
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,218
- Skyler.
- No.

308
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,320
They need to understand.

309
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,623
It's in the past.

310
00:18:25,657 --> 00:18:29,092
It's over.
There is nothing to go after here.

311
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,161
There's nothing to accomplish.

312
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,496
How can we believe
anything you say?

313
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,399
There's no telling
where the lies begin and end.

314
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,934
That affair of yours?
Did that even happen?

315
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:42,172
Please. Look, Junior just found out
that my cancer is back.

316
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:46,309
He's already facing the idea
of living without his father.

317
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:50,435
To put this on top of that?

318
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,115
It's just not right.

319
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,150
I swear to God,

320
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,851
you start throwing
the word "right" at me...

321
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,886
What I mean...

322
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,520
Was it right to run
a drug empire?

323
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,555
There is no drug empire.

324
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,291
Lying to your son,
to all of us... is that right?

325
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,926
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

326
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,753
Why don't you
kill yourself, Walt?

327
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,197
What?

328
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,899
Just kill yourself.

329
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,433
This whole thing
dies with you, right?

330
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:13,467
That's what you're saying here?

331
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:16,137
Is that Hank
should just let it go

332
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:19,307
and wait for you to die.

333
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:22,844
Well, maybe you should just
go ahead and die then.

334
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,745
That is not a solution.

335
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,448
No, it's not a solution.

336
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:30,717
He's not getting off that easy.

337
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,019
Jesus, Hank.

338
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:34,354
And the same goes for you
if you stick with him.

339
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,559
Both of you think you're just gonna
walk away from this thing?

340
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,627
Never gonna happen.

341
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:42,761
That is not
what we're saying...

342
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,263
Enough with the bullshit.

343
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:51,003
You're not gonna negotiate
your way out of this thing.

344
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:52,438
There's only one solution...

345
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:55,074
step up, be a man,
and admit what you've done.

346
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:57,775
That's it.
There is no other option.

347
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,094
Let's go.

348
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,045
[Walt] My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

349
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,048
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

350
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:43,387
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

351
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:45,654
This is my confession.

352
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:48,223
If you're watching this tape,

353
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:50,593
I'm probably dead...

354
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:55,498
murdered by my brother-in-law,
Hank Schrader.

355
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:58,434
Hank has been building
a meth empire

356
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,702
for over a year now,

357
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,404
and using me as his chemist.

358
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:05,306
Shortly after my 50th birthday,

359
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,776
he asked that I use
my chemistry knowledge

360
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,677
to cook methamphetamine,

361
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:12,146
which he would then sell

362
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,081
using connections that he made

363
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:17,818
through his career
with the DEA.

364
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:21,288
I was... astounded.

365
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,857
I...
I always thought

366
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,992
Hank was a very moral man,

367
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:29,195
and I was particularly
vulnerable at the time...

368
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,199
something he knew
and took advantage of.

369
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:37,002
I was reeling
from a cancer diagnosis

370
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:40,873
that was poised
to bankrupt my family.

371
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,374
Hank took me on a ride-along

372
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,374
and showed me
just how much money

373
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,279
even a small meth operation
could make.

374
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,298
And I was weak.

375
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:54,052
I didn't want my family
to go into financial ruin,

376
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:56,521
so I agreed.

377
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,357
Hank had a partner,
a businessman,

378
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,125
named Gustavo Fring.

379
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,329
Hank sold me into
servitude to this man,

380
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:07,998
and when I tried to quit,
Fring threatened my family.

381
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:11,042
I didn't know where to turn.

382
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:15,272
Eventually, Hank and Fring
had a falling out,

383
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:17,508
and things escalated.

384
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:20,678
Fring was able to arrange,

385
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:25,715
uh, I guess... I guess
you call it a hit on Hank,

386
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:26,749
and failed,

387
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:28,518
but he was seriously injured,

388
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:31,354
and I wound up
paying his medical bills,

389
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:35,492
which amounted
to a little over $177,000.

390
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:40,596
Upon recovery,
Hank was bent on revenge.

391
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,332
Working with a man
named Hector Salamanca,

392
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:47,068
he plotted to kill Fring.

393
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,137
The bomb that he used

394
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,892
was built by me.

395
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:55,309
And he gave me no option
in that.

396
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:58,884
I have often
contemplated suicide,

397
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:01,732
but I'm a coward.

398
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:06,410
I wanted to go to the police,

399
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,456
but I was frightened.

400
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:12,291
Hank had risen
to become the head

401
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,427
of the Albuquerque DEA

402
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,996
to keep me in line,

403
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,831
he took my children.

404
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,568
For three months he kept them.

405
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,071
My wife, who had no idea

406
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,305
of my criminal activities,

407
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,375
was horrified to learn
what I had done.

408
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,080
I was in hell.

409
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:39,868
I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my family.

410
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:45,156
Recently, I tried
once again to quit,

411
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,693
and in response,
he gave me this.

412
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:01,672
I can't take this anymore.

413
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:06,476
I live in fear every day
that Hank will kill me,

414
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,776
or worse, hurt my family.

415
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:15,751
I...
All I could think to do

416
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,954
was to make this video

417
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:23,892
and hope that the world
will finally see this man

418
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:26,728
for what he really is.

419
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:41,308
Who do you think
he's shown this to?

420
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,938
No one.
It's a threat.

421
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,650
It's what he will do
if I don't back off.

422
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:52,452
I think you should
show this to Ramey.

423
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:54,921
Just get ahead of it.

424
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:56,689
That video
is a bunch of lies, Hank.

425
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:58,725
Anybody who knows
you will know.

426
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,095
$177,000?

427
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,834
Hell's he talking about?

428
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:14,834
Marie?

429
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:20,748
They told me
it was gambling money.

430
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:24,788
What was gambling money?

431
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:31,589
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

432
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:32,723
Oh, God, no.

433
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,492
How was I supposed to know?

434
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,394
How was I supposed to know
where it really came from?

435
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:38,029
Why were they paying
for my medical bills?

436
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:39,497
What about my insurance?

437
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,898
Insurance wouldn't have covered
the treatment that you needed,

438
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:43,919
and I...

439
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:45,435
I just wanted the best for you.

440
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,470
Why didn't you tell me?

441
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,805
Because I knew that
you would refuse it,

442
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,209
and without it, you may never
have been able to walk again.

443
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:54,770
Oh, Christ, Marie.

444
00:25:57,814 --> 00:26:00,483
You killed me here.

445
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,517
I mean, it's the...

446
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:02,951
that's the last nail.

447
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:05,288
That's the last nail
in the coffin.

448
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:10,793
What do we do?

449
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:33,980
If I were you,
I'd be more nervous.

450
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,518
Ugh. Jesus.

451
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,486
It's always a desert.

452
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:44,425
[Sighs]

453
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,509
Uh, I already checked it.

454
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:42,612
It's clean. I wouldn't have
driven it here if it wasn't.

455
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:45,649
Um, get one of these,
by the way.

456
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:48,718
Reads radio signals.
Much easier.

457
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,092
What does he know?

458
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:02,030
[Sighs] I mean, he knows
you're Heisenberg.

459
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:04,199
But I figure not much else,

460
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:07,354
otherwise, you know,
you'd be locked up.

461
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:12,143
What did he say, exactly?

462
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,710
He wants me to inform on you
for him.

463
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,579
Tell him everything we did.

464
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,882
Anything else?

465
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:27,329
I don't think he's told
the rest of the DEA.

466
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,289
Why do you say that?

467
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,225
Just him being there
all by himself,

468
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:35,962
and plus he was
acting kinda shady.

469
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:38,631
Seemed like he didn't
want the other cops

470
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:41,332
hearing what he had to say.

471
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,869
Are we gonna talk about
the rain of caca

472
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,438
the kid brought down upon us?

473
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:46,572
Do you want to hazard a guess

474
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:48,474
what his little
charity drive cost you?

475
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:50,609
Why don't you go
take a walk, Saul?

476
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:03,860
Jesse, will you
let me help you?

477
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,970
I don't like to see you
hurting like this.

478
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:13,276
Maybe it's time for a change.

479
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,200
What kinda change?

480
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:21,294
I don't know.

481
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:26,905
I don't know.
Maybe...

482
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:30,552
Maybe it's time for you
to just...

483
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:34,232
leave all of this behind.

484
00:29:35,285 --> 00:29:37,052
Just get out of town.

485
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:39,455
Don't look back.

486
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:47,827
Saul knows a man.

487
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:53,557
He specializes in giving
people new identities.

488
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,372
He would move you
someplace far away

489
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:01,556
and set you up with
a whole new life.

490
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:07,314
Yeah, I know.
Sounds a little extreme.

491
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:13,716
But maybe it's exactly
what you need.

492
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:18,057
You know, I really think
that would be good for you.

493
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,159
A clean slate.

494
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:23,630
All right.
Just think about it.

495
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:28,785
You get a job. Something legitimate.
Something you like.

496
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:32,103
Meet a girl.
Start a family, even.

497
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:36,138
Hell, you're still so damn young.
[Chuckles]

498
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:39,461
And what's here
for you now anyway?

499
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:42,881
[Breathes deeply]

500
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,382
I tell ya.

501
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,329
If I could, I'd trade places.

502
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:49,353
A whole lifetime ahead of you

503
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:52,509
with a chance to hit
the reset button.

504
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:57,695
In a few years,
this might all feel

505
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:01,065
like nothing more
than a bad dream.

506
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,946
Would you just, for once,

507
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,915
stop working me?

508
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:21,416
What are you talking about?

509
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:23,919
Can you just, uh,
stop working me

510
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:25,855
for, like,
ten seconds straight?

511
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:28,918
Stop jerking me around?

512
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:31,727
Jesse, I am not working you.

513
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:34,829
Yes. Yes, you are.

514
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:38,265
All right? Just drop the whole
concerned dad thing

515
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,934
and tell me the truth.

516
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:42,937
I mean, you're...
you're acting like

517
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:45,940
me leaving town is...
is all about me

518
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,274
and turning over a new leaf,

519
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:51,740
but it's really...
it's really about you.

520
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:53,881
I mean, you need me gone,

521
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:55,949
'cause your dickhead
brother-in-law

522
00:31:55,984 --> 00:31:58,151
is never gonna let up.

523
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,186
Just say so.

524
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:03,276
Just ask me for a favor.

525
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:07,159
Just tell me you don't
give a shit about me,

526
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:09,395
and it's either this...

527
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,164
it's either this
or you'll kill me

528
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:15,443
the same way you killed Mike.

529
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:19,449
I mean, isn't that
what this is all about?

530
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,626
Huh? Us meeting
way the hell out here?

531
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,946
In case I say no?

532
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,899
Come on.

533
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,688
Just tell me you need this.

[Sobbing continues]

536
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:35,501
Your change.

537
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:37,870
And if you'll hand this
to your car wash professional,

538
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:39,972
and have an A-1 day.

539
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,314
Skyler?

540
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:56,688
Skyler, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

541
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:59,491
Can you take over
the register for me?

542
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:04,063
Skyler?

543
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:08,933
[Inhales, exhales slowly]

544
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:13,237
It worked...

545
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,607
and we're fine.

546
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,843
Okay?

547
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,728
We're fine.

548
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,425

_

550
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,749
So, Palmer and Castanares

551
00:35:00,783 --> 00:35:02,884
are sitting on that jerkoff
Saul Goodman's office,

552
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,552
keeping an eye
on Jesse Pinkman.

553
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:05,887
Yeah. I put them on it.

554
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:08,991
You wanna explain that to me?

555
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,059
Yeah. Right.

556
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,060
Why the hell
should I know anything?

557
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:15,096
They're just my guys,
after all.

558
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,464
You gotta tell me
what's going on.

559
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,734
Pinkman is APD's problem,
not ours.

560
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:21,669
You got a history
with this kid.

561
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,738
He catches wind
that you're trailing him,

562
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:25,773
and this explodes,
he could sue.

563
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,742
Look, if I can't
explain this to Ramey,

564
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:31,077
I gotta pull my guys.

565
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:33,546
Fine. Take them off.

566
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,652
I said take them off.
What else you want?

567
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:58,971
I'm going out for awhile.

568
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:01,272
Well, you have that 3:00.

569
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,207
Will you be back?

570
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,242
You know what?
It's gonna have to be another day.

571
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,211
Reschedule it.

572
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,315
Last chance.

573
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,350
You sure there's nobody
you wanna say bye to?

574
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:15,286
Nobody at all?

575
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,386
No.

576
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,721
This is it.

577
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:20,623
Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

[Number dials]

579
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,132
Uh, I need a new dust filter

580
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:32,702
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure-Pro, model 60.

581
00:36:32,703 --> 00:36:34,490
Can you help me with that?

582
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,572
Yeah. Pickup.

583
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:38,607

Uh, not hot hot,</i>

584
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,642
just a little hot.

586
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:45,280
Yeah, he knows the rules.

587
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:47,816
One hour. Okay.
He'll be there.

[Phone beeps]

589
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:52,320
And done.

590
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:56,958
Okay.

591
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:59,493
This guy's fee
is one twenty-five.

592
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:01,863
Your benefactor...

593
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:04,397
asked me to send you out
with something extra.

594
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,333
Get you started, you know?

595
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,335
Keep you sitting pretty until

596
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,238
you get into the groove
of your new life.

597
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,975
Provided, of course, you don't
toss it out the window on the way.

598
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,479
Seriously,
this is the last of it,

599
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:22,648
so you might wanna think
about making a budget.

600
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,150
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

601
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,753
You can't fire up a doob in here!
Put that out!

I mean it!
Put it out!

603
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:32,491
Look, Mr. Natural,
I'm not gonna let you sabotage this thing.

604
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:35,728
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high,

605
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:39,030
so stop screwing around,
or it's both our asses.

606
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,602
Right. Well,
that's a start.

for this cash.

about lighting up again.

710
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,327
- Hey.
- Hi.

711
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:12,364
- What's going on?
- Not much.

712
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:16,401
[Exhales forcefully]

713
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:18,936
- Yeah? Nothing?
- No. Things are fine.

714
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:20,938
- Good.
- Why?

715
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:23,741
Oh, no reason.

716
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,485
You know what I...
found the other day

717
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,891
is that the... the... the latch
on the soda machine wasn't...

718
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,193
latching.

719
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,129
It's... it's catching

720
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,464
every time that I stock
that darn thing.

721
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,399
[Chuckles softly]

722
00:44:50,433 --> 00:44:52,768
So I thought I'd check it out.

723
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:57,205
- Great.
- Okay.

Oh! Exact change.

727
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:36,009
I like that.
Thank you very much.

728
00:45:37,978 --> 00:45:40,279
Okay.

729
00:45:40,313 --> 00:45:42,481
And...

730
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:45,650
please give this
to your car care professional,

731
00:45:45,685 --> 00:45:47,418
and have an A-1 day.

732
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,721
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- You know what I just remembered

733
00:45:49,755 --> 00:45:52,156
is that they gave me
a prescription to go pick up.

734
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:53,825
So I forgot.

735
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:57,462
I'm gonna go head on over
to the drugstore, okay?

736
00:45:57,496 --> 00:45:59,563
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

737
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:12,428
