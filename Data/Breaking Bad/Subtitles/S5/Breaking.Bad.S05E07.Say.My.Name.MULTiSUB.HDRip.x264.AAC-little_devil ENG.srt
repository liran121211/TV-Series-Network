1
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,858
There.

2
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,859
That's them.

3
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:47,165
Your play, Walter. You're on your own.

4
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:02,976
Looks like you're about 1000 gallons
light here, Mike.

5
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:05,187
Where's the juice?

6
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,816
The methylamine isn't coming.

7
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:12,694
Why is that?

8
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:17,241
- And who the hell are you?
- I'm the man who's keeping it.

9
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:18,575
What the hell's this?

10
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:21,286
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

11
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,788
So where's the tank, Mike?

12
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,707
Mike doesn't know where it is.
Only I do.

13
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,709
And you're dealing with me now,
not him.

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,128
Why don't you just out
to what it is you want...

15
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,714
...or what you think
is gonna happen here, all right?

16
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:34,716
Because we're gonna get
what we came for.

17
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:37,928
That 1000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands...

18
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,973
...than it is in yours or anyone else's,
for that matter.

19
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:44,810
But I need distribution.

20
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,353
Distribution.

21
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,564
That's right.

22
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:52,109
So if you agree
to give up your cook...

23
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,112
...and sell my product instead...

24
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:57,114
...I'll give you 35 percent of the take.

25
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:59,032
Thirty-five percent?

26
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,159
Wow, are you kidding me?
Thirty-five--

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,246
Mike, please tell me this is a joke.

28
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:07,708
Know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

29
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,670
Why the hell would we want you? You
know we have our own operation, right?

30
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,964
I know all about your operation.

31
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,426
See, my partners here tell me
that you produce a meth...

32
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:21,054
...that's 70 percent pure,
if you're lucky.

33
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:25,309
What I produce is 99.1 percent pure.

34
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,479
So?

35
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,984
So it's grade school T-ball...

36
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,653
...versus the New York Yankees.

37
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:39,990
Yours is just some tepid...

38
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,660
...off-brand, generic cola.

39
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,664
What I'm making is Classic Coke.

40
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:50,000
All right. Okay.

41
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:54,838
So if we just waste you
right here right now...

42
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,548
...and leave you in the desert...

43
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,509
...then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

44
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,138
See how that works? There's only us.

45
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,139
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca-Cola?

46
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,488
My partner tells me that your crew...

47
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,699
...switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,328
You dye your meth with food colouring
to make it look like mine.

49
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,083
You already ape my product
at every turn.

50
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,668
But now...

51
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,420
...you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

52
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,005
I need you to listen to me.

53
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:39,091
We're not gonna give up this deal...

54
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:42,719
...to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,596
For what?

56
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:46,890
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

57
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:51,603
A better high
means customers pay more.

58
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:55,691
A higher purity means a greater yield.

59
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,236
That's 130 million dollars of profit...

60
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:03,448
...that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

61
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,243
Now you listen to me.

62
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:09,955
You've got the greatest meth cook in A--
No, the two...

63
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:14,956
...greatest meth cooks in America
right here, and with our skills...

64
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:18,130
...you'll earn more
from that 35 percent...

65
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,923
...than you ever would on your own.

66
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:22,259
Yeah. So you say.

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,886
Just wondering why we're so lucky.

68
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,680
Why cut us in?

69
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,266
Mike is retiring from our crew...

70
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:32,018
...so his share of the partnership
is available...

71
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:37,019
...if you can handle his end,
distribution...

72
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:41,987
...and if you give him 5 million dollars
of the 15 million that you brought today.

73
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:45,949
Just think of it as a finder's fee
for bringing us together.

74
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,950
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship, ready to go.

75
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:57,248
Are you ready?

76
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,980
Who the hell are you?

77
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,774
You know.

78
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:23,775
You all know exactly who I am.

79
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:27,032
Say my name.

80
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:30,535
Do what? I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

81
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:35,536
Yeah, you do. I'm the cook.

82
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,668
I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.

83
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,880
Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.

84
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:46,881
Are you sure?

85
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,227
That's right.

86
00:05:55,228 --> 00:06:00,228
Now, say my name.

87
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:08,156
You're Heisenberg.

88
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:13,157
You're goddamn right.

89
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:49,694
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

90
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,368
Hey-

91
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,204
I appreciate the kind words...

92
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:59,875
...but I'm out too, remember?

93
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:04,754
I know. We'll talk.

94
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:09,755
Maybe we should talk about how and
when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.

95
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:12,012
And we will do that.

96
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,180
Absolutely.

97
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,473
It's just, you know--

98
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:18,685
Look, Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

99
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:22,022
I'll need help getting things
up and running during this transition.

100
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:26,902
You can at least do that for me, right?

101
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:31,903
Come on. Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

102
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,898
Well, I guess that's it.

103
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,942
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two:

104
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:08,944
First, as I said...

105
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:11,279
...I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end...

106
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,617
...so you won't have to worry about
my guys anymore. Second, the bug.

107
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:19,079
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when, could be anytime.

108
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,080
But you need to get it out of there,
sooner rather than later.

109
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:28,129
All right.

110
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,965
That's it?

111
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:34,966
No "thanks for the 5 million dollars," no
"sorry for chaining you to a radiator"?

112
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:41,597
Just get the bug, Walter.

113
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:50,652
So, hey.

114
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,404
I guess...

115
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:54,531
I guess I'll see you around.

116
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,117
No. Don't think so.

117
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,412
When I'm out, I'm out.

118
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:05,413
Well, I'm out too, Mike.

119
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:10,918
Kid, just look out for yourself.

120
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,553
- Are we good?
- You tell me.

121
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:03,349
Okay, Jesse. Back it up.

122
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,520
You're good. Keep it coming.
Straight back.

123
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,522
Slow it down.

124
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:14,523
All right. That's good.

125
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:23,032
Hey, Mrs. White.

126
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,672
"Vamonos."

127
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,966
I Wish.

128
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:40,887
All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.

129
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:45,888
Walt.

130
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:49,854
What is this?

131
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:52,816
Do you really wanna know?

132
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:56,361
- Why are you hiding it here?
- Don't worry about it.

133
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:58,113
Who are you hiding it from?

134
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:00,949
I said don't worry about it.

135
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,576
From the police?

136
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,287
Or someone else?

137
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,331
Someone who would kill for it?

138
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:12,669
Why don't you go back in the office?

139
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,506
Why don't you go back in the office
and let us do this?

140
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:21,507
We'll get it out of your hair.

141
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,334
What'd you bring me this time?

142
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,128
They're bacon banana cookies.

143
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,339
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God!

144
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,258
Just bits. Just little bits of bacon.

145
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,428
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

146
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,181
Dan, this is too much.

147
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,432
I'm not sharing those.

148
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,517
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

149
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:12,187
- They're mine.
- They're yours to do with as you please.

150
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:15,106
Good, because my husband's
not getting any either.

151
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:17,400
- How is Mickey?
- Don't get me started.

152
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,068
He wants to buy a boat.

153
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,988
I can't even get him
to start the lawnmower...

154
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:24,157
...and he wants to buy a boat.

155
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,284
I don't know. A boat might be nice.

156
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,286
A little one, maybe.

157
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,331
Oh, please.
Where would you even take a boat?

158
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:34,125
All the way down to Elephant Butte?

159
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:37,295
Or Caballo. It's beautiful down there.

160
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,381
You can even leave it at the lake
if you don't want to haul it.

161
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:44,510
We're not buying a boat,
I'll tell you that right now.

162
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:49,307
- And the last one is 545.
-569.

163
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:52,644
- Dang it. I almost got them all that time.
- Very good.

164
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:56,981
But actually, I've got an extra one
for you this week. 603.

165
00:12:56,982 --> 00:13:01,982
-603. Where is that?
- Right down there.

166
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:07,033
All right. I'll let you get to it.

167
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:12,034
Thanks, Dot.

168
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,875
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box...

169
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:43,504
...if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

170
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,298
How's the rest of it?

171
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:47,467
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

172
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,345
The families are pretty reliable
with the pickups.

173
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,722
Nobody complaining
about wanting it all at once?

174
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:57,723
No, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

175
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:01,647
So I guess this is it for a while?

176
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,816
Don't worry about the families.

177
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:08,817
They'll keep getting their deliveries.

178
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:17,830
<i>I know times are tight,
but it's for the kids...</i>

179
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:20,708
<i>...and your sponsorship
would sure be appreciated.</i>

180
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,754
<i>Yeah, we have a silver level,
but the gold and platinum levels...</i>

181
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:29,755
<i>...really get your name out there
on the banners and T-shirts.</i>

182
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,010
<i>Sure. No, that's not a problem. You call
me directly if things change, you hear?</i>

183
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:40,728
<i>Gomey, take a brick to my head if I
ever have to make another Fun Run call.</i>

184
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:42,897
<i>I'm done.</i>

185
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,316
<i>What's up? Why you smiling?</i>

186
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,527
<i>Because the Ehrmantraut warrant
just came in.</i>

187
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:50,655
<i>Now we're talking. How quick
can you get your group together?</i>

188
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,281
<i>- Two, three hours.
-Make it two.</i>

189
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:57,282
<i>We're gonna nail that son of a bi--</i>

190
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:31,001
Police! Search warrant!

191
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:35,176
Police! Search warrant!

192
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:40,177
Coming. Hold your horses.

193
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:42,767
Search warrant.

194
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,519
Police! Search warrant!

195
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,772
- Police. Search warrant.
- Police. Search warrant.

196
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:51,108
How's that restraining order
working out for you?

197
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:56,109
If you want me to read that,
I'm gonna need my glasses.

198
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:03,246
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip out
from headquarters, sergeant.</i>

199
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:07,166
<i>From out of bed, you mean. When a cop
kills himself, they want a full report.</i>

200
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:10,962
<i>Just to say hello to who's in charge
of the Record Bureau.</i>

201
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,588
<i>A single contact wound.</i>

202
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,924
<i>Powder burn on his temple
and right hand.</i>

203
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,676
<i>Suicide, I'll bet you.</i>

204
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:18,886
<i>- Tell the wagon boys they can have him.
-Yes.</i>

205
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:23,887
<i>When I found him, he was...
He was dead.</i>

206
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,608
Hey! Perfect timing.

207
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:37,321
Just about to get started.

208
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,032
You know, if you can get going
on that settling tank...

209
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,493
...that would be a huge help.

210
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:46,122
We left that stuff in there too long
after the last cook.

211
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:48,541
- Mr. White--
- I mean way too long.

212
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,960
Now we have a tremendous amount
of residue.

213
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:54,005
You know what we need to invest in
is a power washer.

214
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:59,006
Mr. White, can we just take a second
and talk about all this?

215
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:05,975
Yeah, yeah, sure.

216
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:10,976
Yeah.

217
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:17,774
Look, you know what I think
we need to talk about?

218
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,780
Is doubling down.

219
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:21,699
Doubling down?

220
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,161
Cooking 100 pounds a week,
not 50.

221
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:29,290
As in starting a new lab,
a lab that you'll run.

222
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,084
A cook all of your own.

223
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:34,629
Why not? You deserve it.

224
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,715
You're every bit as good as me.

225
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:40,635
Well, what do you think?

226
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:45,636
Mr. White, I think that
nothing has changed for me.

227
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I just wanna get my money
and get out.

228
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:57,731
Jesse, this...

229
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:03,111
What we do...

230
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:07,036
...being the best at something...

231
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,663
...is a very rare thing.

232
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:12,583
You don't just toss
something like that away.

233
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:16,045
And what, you wanna squander
that potential?

234
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:19,090
Your potential? Why?

235
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:21,926
To do what?

236
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,720
- I don't know.
- Well, think.

237
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:29,721
To do what, Jesse?

238
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:33,104
I'll-- I'll figure it out, all right?

239
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,773
Look at you.

240
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:39,735
What have you got in your life, huh?
Nothing. Nobody.

241
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,696
Oh, wait. Yes.

242
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:44,198
- Video games and go-carts.
- Mr. W--

243
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:47,284
And when you get tired of that,
what then?

244
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:52,285
And how soon will you
start using again?

245
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,292
Look....

246
00:20:55,293 --> 00:21:00,293
Look, I know how upset you are
about what happened to this boy.

247
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,050
I am just as upset as you are.

248
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:08,051
Are you? Really?

249
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:11,600
How can you say that to me? Jesus!

250
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:14,145
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

251
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:17,648
What, do I have to curl up in a ball
in tears in front of you?

252
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:21,485
Do I have to lock myself away in a room
and get high to prove it to you?

253
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:24,447
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy...

254
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,782
...and it tears me up inside!

255
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:30,661
But because it happened, what,
am I supposed to just lie down...

256
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:34,457
...and die with him? It's done!

257
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,292
It makes me sick that it happened...

258
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:39,295
...just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

259
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:40,671
What Todd did...

260
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:44,550
...you and I have done things
that are just as bad.

261
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,093
Yeah.

262
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:51,094
All the people that we've killed,
Gale and the rest.

263
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:55,144
If you believe that there's a hell,
I don't know if you're into that...

264
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:59,231
...but we're already pretty much
going there, right?

265
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:02,902
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

266
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:07,072
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

267
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,492
How many more people
are gonna die because of us?

268
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,911
No one. None.

269
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,663
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

270
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:18,375
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

271
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:20,669
- No.
- Always! You know what?

272
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,173
I'm done, okay?

273
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:29,174
You just give me my money,
and you and I, we're done.

274
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,853
Okay.

275
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:40,439
Why?

276
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,443
Why do you want this money?

277
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:48,614
Because it's mine. It's my out.

278
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:51,116
But isn't it filthy blood money?

279
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:54,578
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

280
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,498
No, no, no. You shouldn't touch
that dirty money.

281
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,252
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

282
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:03,295
Come on.

283
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,505
You want it.

284
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:07,216
You want it just as much as I want it.

285
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:11,512
And it's not wrong to want it. Okay?

286
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:15,349
So stay and work with me...

287
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,350
...and you can make ten ti--
Twenty times as much.

288
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:25,943
Whatever, man.

289
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:29,488
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

290
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:34,489
- Yes, you do.
-It's on you, all right?

291
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,203
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

292
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:41,204
You're not done. You're not leaving.
Because if you leave, you get nothing!

293
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:45,504
Do you understand me? Nothing!

294
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:50,505
Jesse!

295
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:55,055
<i>Budget for the current fiscal year
for electronic surveillance...</i>

296
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:59,602
<i>...is 1.5 million, on par with
ATF and the Marshal Service...</i>

297
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,062
<i>...but still just a fraction of FBI totals.</i>

298
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:04,648
<i>We're lobbying Congress
for an additional 1.41</i>

299
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,484
<i>...but we're waiting on action reports
to demonstrate...</i>

300
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:11,780
<i>...we're actually getting worthwhile
results. Our undercover operations...</i>

301
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,450
<i>...reap the most successful
actionable intelligence...</i>

302
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,328
<i>...if you refer to the chart
in Appendix 4.</i>

303
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,415
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us about
the surveillance man-hours...</i>

304
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,334
<i>Hank?</i>

305
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:25,127
<i>Hank?</i>

306
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:27,713
<i>Hank!</i>

307
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:30,424
<i>I think we're going to wrap this up.</i>

308
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:35,220
<i>If ASAC Schrader can stay behind
while everyone else clears out.</i>

309
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:40,221
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

310
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,320
<i>You know no one wants...</i>

311
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,948
...to <i>see you succeed at this
more than me, right?</i>

312
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,158
<i>-'(es, s“.
-I know how good you are.</i>

313
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,203
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

314
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:01,747
<i>But you're not knocking down
doors anymore, bubba.</i>

315
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:06,251
<i>You're in charge of a district office,
and that comes with responsibilities.</i>

316
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:10,714
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports
aren't being filed in a timely manner.</i>

317
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,549
I'll work on it. It'll get better.

318
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,219
<i>Yeah, it will, because way too much
time and money...</i>

319
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,098
...is <i>being spent on the Fring case,</i>
a <i>case which is essentially over.</i>

320
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:22,267
<i>All this overtime to surveil
Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

321
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:24,937
<i>That's just money that could
be better spent elsewhere.</i>

322
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:28,190
I understand, but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

323
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,985
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street...

324
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:35,114
...Fring's gang is still operational, and
Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.

325
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,573
<i>I believe you. But so what?</i>

326
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:39,493
<i>It's one case out of dozens,
and you don't play favorites...</i>

327
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:42,579
<i>-...with it because it used to be yours.</i>
- I really <i>think--</i>

328
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,374
<i>Don't play favorites.
You got</i> a <i>bigger job than that.</i>

329
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,626
<i>I mean, forget the financial cost.</i>

330
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:51,046
<i>I hear you're personally sewing
search warrants out in the field?</i>

331
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,507
That was an error in judgment.
Won't happen again.

332
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:56,844
<i>You're damn right it won't.
I'm just gonna bottom-line this for you.</i>

333
00:25:56,845 --> 00:26:01,724
<i>The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut
is now zero. We clear?</i>

334
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:04,601
Sure. Thank you.

335
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,895
- Clear.
- Good.

336
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:11,896
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

337
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:22,036
Yeah?

338
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:27,037
-Hey.-
-Hey.-

339
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:32,379
So Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

340
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,007
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

341
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,633
Yeah, something like that.

342
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:39,344
No more following Ehrmantraut.

343
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:42,723
Not worth the financial investment.

344
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,975
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

345
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,561
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

346
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:52,441
He's just living a boring old-man life
like he has nothing left to hide.

347
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:56,153
- And none of Fring's crew is talking?
- Not giving an inch.

348
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:57,988
You sweeten the pot enough?

349
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:01,700
Zero jail time and an all-expense-paid
trip to Maui?

350
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:04,912
Not that, but close.
Nobody wants to bite.

351
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:06,455
Christ!

352
00:27:06,456 --> 00:27:10,417
They're either the most loyal crew in
history or someone's paying them off.

353
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:13,754
- You still checking bank records?
- No one living beyond their means.

354
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:17,424
Nine peeps, all being represented
by one lawyer.

355
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:19,426
Not unusual in a case like this.

356
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:24,427
Yeah, this guy, what's his name?
Daniel Wachsberger?

357
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:29,474
He represents every one of these
douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.

358
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:32,064
Can we find out more
about the lawyer?

359
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:34,441
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

360
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,236
Like the shit ain't deep enough
for you already.

361
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,446
Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

362
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:43,033
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

363
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:45,035
Do it.

364
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:50,036
You're the boss.

365
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,232
All right. Shall we get started?

366
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:19,528
Now, I know that most of this,
or all of this, is gonna be new to you.

367
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:23,574
But did you take chemistry
in high school?

368
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,450
Just basic?

369
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:26,827
No.

370
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:29,079
Okay. That's all right.

371
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,080
As we go, I'll be as detailed as possible
without being overwhelming.

372
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:39,298
Yes, sir.

373
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:44,299
Look, Todd, I don't need you
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

374
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:48,348
What I do need is your full effort
and attention.

375
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:50,767
Listen and apply yourself.

376
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:55,768
If you do that, then we just might have
a fighting chance here, okay?

377
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:01,778
-Okay.-
-Okay.-

378
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:06,779
Well, here we go.

379
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:22,503
Slowly. Steady.

380
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,104
The aluminum helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

381
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:49,113
Gently pour it in. Don't spill it.

382
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:32,703
<i>You're gonna like the little Schticky,
but you're gonna love the big Schticky.</i>

383
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,704
<i>For bigger messes like dust bunnies...</i>

384
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,998
Now...

385
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,126
...the CO2 freezes the liquid...

386
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:23,378
...crystallising it...

387
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:28,379
...which gives us our finished
methamphetamine.

388
00:31:28,468 --> 00:31:32,304
Now all that's left...

389
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:37,059
...is to break it up, weigh it,
and we're done.

390
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,937
Wow, this is...

391
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:45,938
This is complicated. It's gonna take me
a few more times to get a grasp on it.

392
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:51,861
Oh, yeah. It'll take a few more times.

393
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:58,205
I do all right?

394
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,040
You did fine, Todd.

395
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,543
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

396
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:07,422
Now all that's left,
I guess, is to talk money.

397
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:12,423
We can talk money
once I get this right.

398
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,315
Morning. Guess what I have.

399
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:30,316
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

400
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:33,573
Very nice. Thank you, Dan.

401
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:38,574
See? I put little faces on them.

402
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:01,518
Hey-

403
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,519
Hey-

404
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,370
All right.

405
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:52,611
I'm working with a new guy now.

406
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:54,946
And I think that it...

407
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:59,826
I think it could possibly work out...

408
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:04,827
."because“"

409
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:12,251
I'm trying, Hank. I really am.
I'm trying, but there's... There's...

410
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:16,635
I mean,
it's like I don't even exist to her.

411
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:19,930
Well, yeah. Yeah.

412
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:24,931
I mean, I know she's struggling.
I know, but I just don't know what to do.

413
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:27,103
I mean, what can I do?

414
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:31,233
Such a mess.

415
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,817
I mean, we-- Both of us...

416
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:37,818
...we just have screwed up so much.

417
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:40,033
I'm just...

418
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:43,912
I'm sorry. I don't--
Do you have any coffee?

419
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,248
- Maybe I can--
- Coffee? You bet. Yeah, you bet.

420
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:51,249
- What, you take cream, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

421
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,538
- All right. Here you go, buddy.
- Oh, thank you, Hank.

422
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:29,749
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm sorry to waste your time...

423
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,334
-...with all this.
- No.

424
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:36,335
-It's, you know-- But it's-- You know.
- Yeah.

425
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,262
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

426
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:43,680
Hey, could you excuse me?

427
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:46,141
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

428
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,268
- Tell me something good.
- You tell me.

429
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:51,438
Sweated the guy for 14 hours.
That should be some kind of record.

430
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,523
Quit your bragging. What'd you get?

431
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:56,860
He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.

432
00:35:56,861 --> 00:36:01,861
He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?

433
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,244
What are you wasting your time for?
Throw a net around that son of a bitch.

434
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:11,245
All right.

435
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:41,404
<i>- Yeah?
- Mike, hey, it's me.</i>

436
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:43,156
- Can you <i>talk?</i>
- I can.

437
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:46,493
<i>Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.</i>

438
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:49,829
<i>I don't wanna do this on the phone.
Are you available?</i>

439
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,873
I can come by in a few hours.

440
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:54,209
<i>That's not good for me.
Where are you now?</i>

441
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,461
I'm at the park
with my granddaughter.

442
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:58,797
<i>Where exactly?</i>

443
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:00,256
Palomita.

444
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:05,257
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm not far.
I'll come to you. You just hang tight.</i>

445
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,479
<i>- Yeah?
- Mike, they're coming for you.</i>

446
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,023
<i>- Right now. They're coming.
- Slow</i> down, <i>Walter. Who?</i>

447
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:20,110
<i>The DEA. The DEA--
Somebody flipped.</i>

448
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:23,238
<i>They have some kind of
bank surveillance.</i>

449
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,906
<i>And something about some lawyer.</i>

450
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:29,907
<i>Someone is talking, Mike,
and they're coming for you right now--</i>

451
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:21,755
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

452
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,256
Dan Wachsberger.

453
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:26,634
He would've had better luck with
the law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

454
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:29,554
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

455
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:33,349
All right, Saul, enough, please.
Instead of just sitting around here...

456
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,144
-...what can we do?
- Besides pray that he gets away...

457
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:37,937
...I'm open to ideas.

458
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:40,023
Because if the DEA
catches up with him...

459
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:43,318
...and he flips, it's good night,
John-boy.

460
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:48,319
No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay?
No way.

461
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:51,910
Yeah, yeah. Never say never.

462
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:56,289
This is the second time the DEA
has confiscated his bankroll.

463
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,083
You know? Jesus, fool me once, right?

464
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:02,462
Look, he won't flip.

465
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:07,463
But his nine guys will.

466
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:25,397
Hey. It's him.

467
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:29,447
Mike, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

468
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:33,493
- The what?
- The... Walt and Jesse are here.

469
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:36,621
<i>I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.
I want you. I need your help.</i>

470
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:39,707
- What do you need?
- I got a go-bag at the airport.

471
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,293
Passports, money,
but there are eyes everywhere.

472
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:43,962
I can't get close.

473
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:48,174
I need you to pick up that bag
and get it to me as soon as possible.

474
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,635
Do you know how thick
the crap storm is out there?

475
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:52,887
Told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

476
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:56,808
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
- Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?

477
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:00,478
<i>- Just</i> tell <i>me</i> what <i>to do.
- No, kid. Not you.</i>

478
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:02,814
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

479
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:05,900
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you...

480
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:09,863
...so they're probably sitting on my car
right now, hoping I do something stupid.

481
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,615
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

482
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:14,576
- No, Jesse.
- Jesus, I'll do it.

483
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:16,578
Besides, you're out, remember?

484
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:21,579
Mike, tell me where to get this bag.

485
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:36,824
Hello, Walter.

486
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:40,870
Before I hand this over,
I need something from you.

487
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:45,871
- And what's that?
- The names of your nine men.

488
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:49,796
Why? You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

489
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:53,007
The point is, Mike, it affects me.

490
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:56,844
It affects Jesse too.
And we deserve to know.

491
00:41:56,845 --> 00:42:00,974
The only thing left to do now
is leave town. You understand?

492
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,184
"Leave town."

493
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:07,271
Yeah, I just can't up and leave
like you, Mike.

494
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:10,692
I've got a family,
I've got people who depend on me.

495
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:15,693
Yeah.

496
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:32,835
Goodbye, Walter.

497
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:38,215
You're welcome!

498
00:42:38,804 --> 00:42:40,972
I'm sorry, what?

499
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:43,307
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

500
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:44,934
I don't owe you a damn thing.

501
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:49,935
All of this, falling apart like this,
is on you.

502
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,862
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

503
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:58,823
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA...

504
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:01,409
...and now suddenly,
this is all my fault?

505
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,328
- Why don't you walk me through this?
- We had a good thing...

506
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:08,583
...you stupid son of a bitch!
We had Fring. We had a lab.

507
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:11,461
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

508
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:13,755
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth...

509
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:16,340
...cooked, and made as much money
as you ever needed.

510
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:19,761
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

511
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:23,014
You and your pride and your ego!

512
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:25,016
You just had to be the man.

513
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:27,560
If you'd done your job,
known your place...

514
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:32,561
...we'd all be fine right now.

515
00:45:43,822 --> 00:45:46,407
I just...

516
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:51,408
I just realised that Lydia has the names.
I can get them from her.

517
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:59,295
I'm sorry, Mike.

518
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:02,798
This... This whole thing
could've been avoided.

519
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:07,799
Shut the fuck up...

520
00:46:07,804 --> 00:46:12,804
...and let me die in peace.
