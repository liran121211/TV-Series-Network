<i>Honest to God, it's starting</i>

4
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:41,643
<i>Well, don't.</i>

5
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,145
<i>It keeps me awake at night.</i>

6
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,680
<i>I lay there thinking, "Where is it?
Where did it go?"</i>

7
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:49,784
<i>- And I just-- You know, I can't even--
- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, look...</i>

8
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:52,553
<i>Doesn't it make sense</i>
<i>that it wound up in the lab?</i>

9
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:55,390
<i>I thought about that a lot.</i>
<i>But I just don't see how.</i>

10
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:57,525
<i>Well, look.</i>
<i>You had the pack</i>

11
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,093
<i>in your pocket</i>
<i>of your jacket, right?</i>

12
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,742
<i>- Yeah.
- And your jacket was in your locker,</i>

13
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,264
<i>so maybe the cigarette
just fell out of the pocket</i>

14
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,233
<i>and wound up in the locker,</i>
<i>and now it's all burned up.</i>

15
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,135
<i>- It's gone.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

16
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,172
<i>But I don't know that,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

17
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,408
<i>I can't ever know for sure.</i>

18
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,645
<i>Well, look, did you</i>
<i>check your house?</i>

19
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,580
<i>Did you-- Maybe it's</i>
<i>somewhere in your house.</i>

20
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,683
<i>No, man.</i>
<i>I've looked everywhere, okay?</i>

21
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,684
<i>Your car?</i>
<i>Did you check your car?</i>

22
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,285
<i>No, no--</i>

23
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,322
<i>- Thoroughly? - Yes, of course.</i>
<i>Look, it's not in my house.</i>

24
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,490
<i>It's not in my car.
And the more I think about it,</i>

25
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,491
<i>there's no way</i>
<i>it fell out in my locker.</i>

26
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,427
<i>And I keep thinking somebody's</i>
<i>gonna find this thing</i>

27
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,295
<i>- on the street or something.</i>
<i>- You don't know that.</i>

28
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,230
<i>- Somewhere where I dropped it.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

29
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:40,732
<i>Some innocent person,</i>
<i>some kid maybe, even.</i>

30
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,266
<i>No. No. Come on.</i>

31
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,669
<i>And they're gonna pick
it up, and it's gonna--</i>

32
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,670
<i>You're working yours--/i>
- Oh, my God!</i>

33
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,004
<i>Jesse, listen.</i>

34
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,506
<i>You've gotta get</i>
<i>ahold of yourself here.</i>

35
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,507
<i>All right? I'll tell you</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do.</i>

36
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,209
<i>I'm gonna</i>
<i>come over there, okay?</i>

37
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:54,311
<i>And together, we're gonna</i>
<i>look for this thing.</i>

38
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,814
<i>- All right?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

39
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,589
Ohh.

40
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,568
What the hell is that?

41
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:06,602
My Roomba.

42
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,341
I already checked it.

43
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,578
When?

44
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:17,746
Like, a week ago.

45
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:39,032
Oh, God.

46
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:43,069
Oh, Jesus.

47
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,840
Okay. Easy, easy.
Take it--

48
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,376
Careful.
Let me see.

49
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,512
Is it still intact?

50
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:53,814
Yeah. Good.

51
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,815
Good. No worries.

52
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,850
Let me get rid of this.

53
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,066
What luck.

54
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,460
Whoo.

55
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,931
Well, I don't know about you,

56
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:15,133
but I, for one,
could use a beer.

57
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,268
You have any?

58
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:21,973
Jesse?

59
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,978
I almost shot you.

60
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,513
Hey, hey, now...

61
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:32,716
I almost killed you
all because...

62
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:35,953
Listen.

63
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,722
It was just a--
A misunderstanding, that's all.

64
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,758
No. No, no, no, no.

65
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:46,729
I don't know what's wrong
with me, Mr. White.

66
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,264
- I...
- Hey.

67
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,035
I don't know how
I could be so stupid.

68
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,570
Stop that now.
Come on.

69
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,705
Come on. Come on.

70
00:10:56,707 --> 00:11:00,408
I'm so sorry.

71
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:02,444
It's okay.

72
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:04,312
It's okay.

73
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:08,149
Listen to me.

74
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,219
What happened,
happened for the best,

75
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,254
you hear me?

76
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,856
I wouldn't change a thing.

77
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,993
You and I working together,

78
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,862
having each other's back.

79
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,098
It's what saved our lives.

80
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,304
I...

81
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:33,840
I want you to think about
that as we go forward.

82
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:43,549
Go forward where?

83
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:48,286
Ohh.

84
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,288
<i>Stillwell, steady as she goes.</i>

85
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:51,456
Ohh.

86
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,125
<i>Willie, note the time.</i>

87
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
Whoo.

88
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,496
- Ohh.
<i>- Captain, I'm sorry,</i>

89
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,164
<i>- but you're a sick man.</i>
- Mmm.

90
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:01,166
<i>I'm relieving you</i>
<i>as captain of the ship</i>

91
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,935
<i>under article 184.</i>

92
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,103
- Oh, God. <i>- I don't know what</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

93
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,572
<i>- Helmsman, left 180.</i>
- Ohh.

94
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:10,609
<i>Mr. Keith, what do I do?</i>

95
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:14,012
<i>I told you to come left.</i>
<i>Now come left, and fast.</i>

96
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:15,514
<i>I'm sorry, sir,</i>

97
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,649
<i>but you're not issuing orders</i>
<i>on this bridge anymore.</i>

98
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,250
<i>I've relieved you.</i>

99
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:20,618
<i>I take full responsibil--</i>

100
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,113
<i>Thanks for seeing us.</i>

101
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,861
We're here to talk partnership.

102
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:33,030
Partnership.

103
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,032
Yes. Equal.
Three ways--

104
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:39,302
You, Jesse and me.

105
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:42,605
Well, we figure we're gonna
start cooking again.

106
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,674
You know, we figure, why not?

107
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,810
There's no denying the
popularity of our product.

108
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,879
There's a market to be filled,

109
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:53,882
- and currently no one to fill it.
- A lot of money to be made...

110
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,486
And obviously, Jesse and I
have manufacture covered.

111
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,889
But there's still distribution,

112
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:03,958
support, logistics,
that sort of thing.

113
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,428
For instance, we'll need a
steady supply of precursor.

114
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:10,331
With your experience
and connections,

115
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,266
you would be a great help.

116
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:13,301
Mmm.

117
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,003
Granted, there's
a lot of work ahead.

118
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,505
There's a lot of rebuilding.

119
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,342
And, no doubt,
our profits will be smaller.

120
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,843
At least at first.

121
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:26,580
But each of us
will receive a larger cut.

122
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:30,183
Owners, not employees.

123
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,988
Thanks, but no, thanks.

124
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:41,393
Mike,

125
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:44,029
I know you don't care for me.

126
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,734
We've had our issues,
you and I.

127
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:50,502
I would suggest

128
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:53,105
that you leave emotion
out of this decision.

129
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,640
I am.

130
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,608
You...

131
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,111
are trouble.

132
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:04,582
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't
see it, but I sure ash hell do.

133
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:07,918
You are a time bomb...

134
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:11,055
tick, tick, ticking,

135
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,292
and I have no intention
of being around for the boom.

136
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:26,837
Well, sleep on it.

137
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,872
Maybe you'll reconsider.

138
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,174
In the meantime,

139
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,376
we're pressing on.

140
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,058
Morning.

141
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,132
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?

142
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,734
- I came to see if you needed any help.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

143
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,037
Well, I can see that, man.
It's outstanding.

144
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:04,705
Yeah.
I'm working on it here.

145
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,707
Not exactly running
marathons here, you know.

146
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,709
Yeah, well, when did
your couch-shaped ass

147
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,644
ever run any marathons?

148
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,481
- I'm proud of you, brother.
- Yeah, yeah. So how many cars we've got?

149
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,982
Enough to invade Poland.

150
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:19,119
Came in their own G5,
just like Oprah has.

151
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,121
- G5, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:24,057
Is that one where the--
Where the wings go up like that?

153
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,526
- I think they all do that.
- They all have that?

154
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,929
Anyway, we got two
U.S. attorneys in the house.

155
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,531
Big doings.
Your name keeps coming up.

156
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,565
Yeah? Hey, give me
a hand here, would you?

157
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,767
Just-- just a little bit there.
Thanks.

158
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,338
I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.

159
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,974
Almost single-handedly,

160
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,976
he grew up a little
restaurant division

161
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,078
into an industry leader

162
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,514
and a source
of great personal pride.

163
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,251
I am shocked and saddened
by his death

164
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:59,590
and outraged by the damage his actions have
brought upon my grand-father's company.

165
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,127
Alleged actions.

166
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:07,264
An innocent man does not
kill himself.

167
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:10,200
My people and I
are here to help.

168
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,302
Through your investigation
I pledge Madrigal's

169
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:15,138
full cooperation
and transparency.

170
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:19,642
I confess I have
my selfish reasons.

171
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:23,079
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

172
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:25,414
But if that is not the case,

173
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,916
I want to know it,

174
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,951
just as you do.

175
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,389
So when you gonna announce it?

176
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,091
I don't know.

177
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,794
- As I'm walking out the door with my
big cardboard box.- You can't do that.

178
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,997
You know damn well we're
gonna throw you a big party.

179
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:44,866
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

180
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,307
Outstanding police work, Hank.

181
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,342
If only I'd listened.

182
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:59,113
But I guess
the damage was done.

183
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,750
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

184
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,111
Somebody's gonna go
under the bus.

185
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,558
Ramey's a good man.

186
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:14,160
He'll do right by you.

187
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:18,431
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

188
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:21,534
Bullshit it does.

189
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:23,101
Sir.

190
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:29,642
What's with that APD thing?
The electromagnets?

191
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,643
They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

192
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,778
Turns out a couple of days
before it happened,

193
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:36,681
desk sergeant gets this phone
call from a "postal inspector"--

194
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,182
Quote, unquote--

195
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,117
Wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

196
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,987
And he told them?
Jesus.

197
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,989
Anything left of the laptop?

198
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,125
Do we look that lucky?

199
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,362
You know, I sneaked a peek before
APD took it out of Fring's office.

200
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:53,364
The whole thing was encrypted.

201
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:55,833
They wouldn't have got
anything anyway, but...

202
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,572
So Hector Salamanca
killed Fring.

203
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,029
But who gave
Salamanca the bomb?

204
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,377
Whole lot of questions

205
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,145
and not much
in the way of answers.

206
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,646
Yet.

207
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:14,784
The APD did find
some of Fring's financials.

208
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,439
That just might
lead to something.

209
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:23,825
I had him out to my house.

210
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,128
Fourth of July.

211
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,330
We cooked out in the backyard.

212
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:30,065
My son shucked the corn.

213
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,834
My daughter cut up potatoes.

214
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,536
Fring brought sea bass.

215
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,304
Every time I grill it now,

216
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:39,840
I make a little foil pouch,
just like he showed me.

217
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,543
That whole night,
we were laughing,

218
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:47,181
telling stories, drinking wine.

219
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:50,218
And he's somebody else
completely.

220
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,953
Right in front of me.

221
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,258
Right under my nose.

222
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,870
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>What can I get you?</i>

223
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:36,206
- Just tea, please. Chamomile.
- Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea.

224
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,043
Then some sort of bergamot,
provided it's not Earl Grey.

225
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,977
I like soy milk
instead of dairy.

226
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,013
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

227
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,649
Wow. You're really running me
through my paces here.

228
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,151
Uh-huh.

229
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,486
Well, English breakfast,
I guess.

230
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,188
We have Lipton's.

231
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,724
That's pretty much all we have.

232
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,727
I would like a cup of
hot water, filtered,

233
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,428
if possible,
ad a single slice of lemon.

234
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,430
And I'm assuming
you don't have stevia?

235
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:06,068
Never mind.
I brought my own.

236
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,239
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

237
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:12,907
Face forward.

238
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:15,009
We'll talk like this.

239
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,679
I guess I'm coming to you.

240
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,315
Ohh.

241
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,018
Mmm.

242
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,791
Take a breath, will you?

243
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:34,828
This place is safe,
no one's gonna see you here.

244
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,231
My God!

245
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:41,067
Duane, this is so--
Thank you.

246
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:43,169
How did I not see you
sitting back there?

247
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:44,837
So weird.

248
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,705
You want anything else, Mike?

249
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,874
No.

250
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,977
I'm good, Fran.
Thanks.

251
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,651
How about
we lose the sunglasses?

252
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:02,820
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

253
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:08,359
There you go.

254
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,663
Breathe in, breathe out.

255
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:15,966
Drink your whatever.

256
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,343
Who killed Gus?

257
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,946
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

258
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,549
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

259
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,921
What's this?

260
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,756
A list of 11 names.

261
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,258
Okay.

262
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,626
You know them all.

263
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:47,929
I do.

264
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:50,598
Those 11 men-- and I think
you know this, Mike.

265
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,767
Those 11 could sink us,
you and me both.

266
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,702
Where are we going
with this, Lydia?

267
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:57,305
No specific.
I'm just pointing out facts.

268
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:59,407
These men-- your men--
yours and Gus's--

269
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,676
these men were on the payroll,
very publicly.

270
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,611
They trace back to Pollos
and the laundry.

271
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,946
They trace back to Madrigal, and they're
gonna get picked up by the police.

272
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,315
And when they do, when they get picked
up and threatened with prosecution,

273
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,517
and there's only one way out
for them, they're gonna--

274
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:13,120
And I'm not saying
all of them. Okay?

275
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,488
All it's gonna take is two
or three, or even one.

276
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,490
But there's always
a weak link somewhere.

277
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,859
But they're gonna talk.
At least one of them's gonna talk about you,

278
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,328
about me, and that's all
it's gonna take.

279
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:25,397
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

280
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:27,766
I never met your chemist,
for instance.

281
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:30,502
I'd love your input.

282
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,075
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

283
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:39,845
Wow. That's a leap,

284
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,913
what you just, uh...

285
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:44,282
No, I didn't say that.

286
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:49,187
But if you think
that'd be wise...

287
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:54,358
You're scared, aren't you?

288
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,759
Yeah.

289
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,761
You're very upset,

290
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,064
which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

291
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,769
These are my guys,
and they are solid.

292
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:08,071
- Understand?
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

293
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:10,273
Didn't one time you have
to shoot him through the hand?

294
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,342
You think that didn't
stick in his memory?

295
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,277
What about Dennis
at the laundry?

296
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,778
They're sure to pick him up.

297
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,348
They already have.
They picked him up last night.

298
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,817
My guys are solid.

299
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:24,887
I vetted them with great care,

300
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:27,055
and Fring made sure
they were well compensated

301
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,324
in the event
of a situation such as this.

302
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,558
They're paid
to stand up to the heat,

303
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:35,229
keep their mouths shut,
no matter what.

304
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:37,265
And they will.

305
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,468
Now, I don't know what kind
of movies you've been watching,

306
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,338
but here in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people

307
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,873
as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

308
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:49,876
Look at me

309
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,412
and say you understand.

310
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:55,315
I understand.

311
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:57,150
I get it.

312
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,319
So we're off
that very silly idea?

313
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:04,023
Good.

314
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,167
Drink your hot water.

315
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:29,680
- I gotta go.
- Have you had enough?

316
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,416
Yeah. I'm good.

317
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,583
Okay.

318
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:33,951
Bye-bye.

319
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:35,419
- Bye.
- Bye.

320
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:37,187
Bye, big brother.

321
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:39,022
Say bye to mom for me.

322
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:43,093
I will.
Have a good day.

323
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,995
You, too.

324
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:01,110
- Skyler.
- Mmm...

325
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,445
Hey.

326
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:05,614
The car wash opens
in 15 minutes.

327
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:08,516
Mariano can open for me today.

328
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,923
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

329
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:20,828
Come on.

330
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,998
A shower will feel good.

331
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,581
Hey, Chow.

332
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,652
How you holding up?

333
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,754
Okay.

334
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,224
You know,
they-- they--

335
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,192
They talked to me.

336
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:55,860
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

337
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:18,349
Thanks for coming down.

338
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:21,352
Have a seat,
Mr. Ehrmantraut.

339
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:24,221
Am I, is that right?

340
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:26,423
Close enough.

341
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,825
So, once more, you're waiving your
right to have an attorney present?

342
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,327
Correct.

343
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:33,430
Could you state that
to the camera, please?

344
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:36,499
I'm waiving my right
to have an attorney present.

345
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:40,002
Uh, okay, then.
We just have a few questions.

346
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:43,439
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

347
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:45,107
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I am.

348
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,242
- And what do you do there?
- Corporate security.

349
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:49,511
- Corporate security?
- Yeah.

350
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:53,248
What's that?
Like, uh, guarding the special sauce?

351
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:55,951
I conduct employee
background checks,

352
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:58,419
I oversee loss prevention.

353
00:26:58,454 --> 00:27:02,090
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

354
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:05,426
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

355
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:07,095
Yeah, well...

356
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,830
If I were you, I'd start
sending out those resumes.

357
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,733
It says here you're
a private investigator?

358
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,367
Where you licensed?

359
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,136
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

360
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,837
Every state where we operate.

361
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,439
Colorado?

362
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,108
You have some restaurants
there, right?

363
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:22,976
Colorado doesn't
require licensure.

364
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,844
You licensed
to carry a firearm?

365
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:26,779
Concealed carry?
Yes, I am.

366
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,315
Which states?

367
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,183
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

368
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:33,185
And if we pulled your CCP's,

369
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,686
everything would be in order?

370
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:37,156
I'm guessing you've already
done that, so you tell me.

371
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,428
You strike me as a former cop.

372
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:43,962
Am I right?

373
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:47,393
Where at?

374
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,536
Philadelphia.

375
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,605
Philly.

376
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,607
The city of brotherly love.

377
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:59,377
It turns out we, uh--
We know some folks there,

378
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,446
and they told us that your
tenure as a police officer

379
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,383
ended somewhat,
uh, dramatically?

380
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,318
You wanna talk about that?

381
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,886
Not particularly.

382
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,322
Yeah, me neither.

383
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,992
See, I'm more interested
in why Gus Fring

384
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,128
decided to put a guy like you

385
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,363
in charge of
his corporate security.

386
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:24,800
I mean,
given your... history

387
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:28,204
doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

388
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,205
Seems like over...

389
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:32,508
What else you do for Fring?

390
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,177
He must've needed help
running that drug empire

391
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,011
of his, no?

392
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,681
Drug empire?

393
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:44,386
First I'm hearing about that.
I don't know anything about that.

394
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,189
Hey, man, we have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab,

395
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:48,756
and he'll testify to it.

396
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,925
So from here on out,
this can go hard or easy,

397
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,495
so what's it gonna be?

398
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,739
Forget your handcuffs?

399
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,107
I'm confused.

400
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,543
Am I under arrest here,
or am I not?

401
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,619
You wanna state that
for the camera?

402
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:28,026
You are not under arrest,
currently.

403
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,562
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

404
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:33,632
Because you've got me
very stirred up

405
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,967
with all these false accusations.

406
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,437
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

407
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:42,173
Uh-uh.

408
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,980
And I suppose we could talk
about the two million dollars

409
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:51,750
in your granddaughter's name.

410
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,854
Yeah. It seems, uh,

411
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:59,389
Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts

412
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,058
that he would
deposit money into--

413
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,726
Like, uh, well,
an even dozen of them--

414
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,194
And they're all in the names

415
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,729
of certain people
on his payroll.

416
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:08,899
There was the, uh--
The manager of the laundry,

417
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:12,969
um, a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

418
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:16,839
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

419
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:20,609
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

420
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:26,382
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

421
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:29,985
Ten years old

422
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,587
and just cute as a button.

423
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,756
Yeah.
Two million and change

424
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,892
we found on deposit for her.

425
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:38,760
Way more than anybody else.

426
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,762
Now, my partner here,

427
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,097
he took one look at that
and said, "Shit, man.

428
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:46,433
This fifth-grade girl is the muscle
behind Fring's entire operation."

429
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,003
I said, "Whoa, whoa.
Hey, partner, slow down there.

430
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:51,038
Maybe it was actually

431
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:54,008
her dear old granddaddy."

432
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,343
Impressive, no?

433
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:58,078
But...

434
00:30:58,113 --> 00:30:59,779
Level of insight?

435
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:03,183
He's not impressed, Gomie.

436
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:06,920
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

437
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:08,922
Yeah, well, I mean,

438
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:13,026
the government's gonna take
every last dollar, unless...

439
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,995
Well, here's the thing, Mike--
or Michael?

440
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,264
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.
- Here's the thing, Mike.

441
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:21,099
Lucky for you,
you didn't touch that money.

442
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:24,269
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

443
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:26,504
One of your guys
is gonna roll on you,

444
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,007
and then we'll definitely
remember the handcuffs.

445
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,042
Now, before that day comes,

446
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:33,978
you can do yourself a solid.

447
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,948
You can tell us what you know,

448
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:40,617
you can tell us
who's still out there,

449
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:43,554
and if we like your story,

450
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,556
good things can happen.

451
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,891
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

452
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:50,293
Maybe.

453
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,495
So what do you say?

454
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:59,702
I don't know anything
about any money.

455
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:03,672
I don't know
what you're talking about.

456
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,334
First order of business

457
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,503
is to find a new place to cook.

458
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,871
Before anyone says it,
no more RV's.

459
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,874
I don't know. The crystal
ship did pretty good for us.

460
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,677
The "crystal ship"?

461
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:32,316
- Yeah. That's what I called it. - Well,
I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab,

462
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,718
but it was too dark, too small,

463
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,720
not to mention
it could've broken down

464
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,221
at any moment.

465
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:41,424
Saul, find us someplace
safe from prying eyes.

466
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,892
Security against detection
is paramount.

467
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,561
But I don't
wanna drive too far.

468
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,664
No more 50-mile treks
to some Indian reservation.

469
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,165
In town is trickier.

470
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,668
I mean, you got a lot more
of your prying eyes.

471
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:56,999
If Gus can manage it,
then so can we.

472
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:02,677
Precursor.
Where are we with that?

473
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:06,047
Uh, we're good on everything

474
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:09,683
except, uh, methylamine.

475
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:11,385
No surprise.

476
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:13,387
It's just dry as hell out there.

477
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:16,056
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

478
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,891
Absolutely out of the question.

479
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:21,061
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
I know it.

480
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:22,730
Yeah, but what if there's not?

481
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:26,399
Because there isn't.
I mean, really.

482
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,268
There is.

483
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:31,070
Have faith.

484
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:33,105
Can I--
Can I offer a thought?

485
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,440
Uh...

486
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,610
Say a guy wins the lottery.

487
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,545
Ten million bucks.

488
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,681
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

489
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:45,350
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

490
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:49,388
He counts his lucky stars, and
he sails off into the sunset,

491
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:52,524
which, seems to me,
and all due respect,

492
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:55,894
some advice you two might take.

493
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:59,263
What lottery did I win exactly?

494
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,931
Hey, you're alive.

495
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,901
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

496
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:06,170
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

497
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:08,172
Counting the money
that I owe Jesse,

498
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:09,973
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

499
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,809
Does that seem like
an acceptable

500
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,877
stopping point to you?

501
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,748
There is gold in the streets,

502
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:24,154
just waiting for someone to come and
scoop it up. But, me? I should quit now.

503
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,623
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

504
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,192
Wow.

505
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:31,360
I got you this time, kid.

506
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:34,030
And how come you get two,
and I only get one?

507
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:36,833
Hmm?

508
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,500
Oh, no, you don't.

509
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,870
That one's mine!

510
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,174
No. Aaahhh!

511
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,148
Oh.

512
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:57,085
I give up, baby.

513
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,889
You're too good.

514
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:06,360
- Yeah?
<i>It's me, you got a minute?</i>

515
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:08,996
<i>Yeah. A minute.</i>
<i>What's up, Chow?</i>

516
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,299
The DEA,
they call me to come back.

517
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:15,369
- Say they want to talk more.
<i>- I'm sure they do.</i>

518
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:17,304
Did you call your lawyer?

519
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,373
<i>Yeah, but, Mike,</i>
<i>the DEA take all my money.</i>

520
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:21,707
<i>I need it.</i>

521
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,709
I need my money.

522
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:25,711
You understand.

523
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:28,314
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to do about it?</i>

524
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,149
I don't know.

525
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,886
I don't know.
We gotta talk.

526
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,719
Not on the phone.

527
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,855
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>

528
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:42,194
All right.

529
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,196
<i>Give me two hours.</i>

530
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,079
Chris.

531
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,117
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand,

532
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:21,487
and then turn around
very slowly.

533
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,705
Come on over
and sit next to Chow.

534
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:04,293
How much was she gonna pay you?

535
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:08,664
Ten thousand a name.

536
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:13,702
How far did you get
down the list?

537
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,270
Just Chow.

538
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:17,305
I figured I'd start with you.

539
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:20,642
For you,
she was gonna pay 30,000.

540
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,343
I'm very sorry about this, Mike.

541
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,581
But I needed the money.

542
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:29,617
Those feds,
they took it all, man.

543
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,855
I know.

544
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:37,971
Are you ready?

545
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:39,893
Listen, Mike...

546
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:04,896
Kira, come and
have some cookies.

547
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,565
It's a cookie!

548
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,766
It's a cookie, yes!

549
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,935
Let's go. Uh-huh.

550
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,671
Vamos a contar.
Let's count.

551
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:18,142
<i>Uno. Dos. Tres.</i>

552
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:19,744
<i>- Cuatro.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:21,112
<i>Cinco.</i>

554
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:23,447
<i>- Seis.</i>
<i>- Seis. Muy bien.</i>

555
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:25,249
<i>- Siete.</i>
<i>- Siete.</i>

556
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:26,783
<i>Ocho.</i>

557
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:29,886
<i>Nueve. Diez.</i>

558
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:33,624
<i>Muy bien.
Ahora los colores, a ver.</i>

559
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:36,392
<i>- Amarillo.</i>
<i>- Amarillo.</i>

560
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:38,962
<i>- Rosado.</i>
<i>- Rosado.</i>

561
00:39:38,997 --> 00:39:41,164
<i>- Azul.</i>
<i>- Azul.</i>

562
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:43,265
<i>- Verde.</i>
<i>- Verde.</i>

563
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,601
- Marron. - Marron.

564
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:47,837
Anaranjado.

565
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:49,005
Anaranjado.

566
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,373
Well, look at this.
What are you doing?

567
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:53,843
- Hey, mommy!
- What are you doing still up?

568
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:55,811
Hey, yourself.
Give me a kiss.

569
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:57,479
She said she wanted
to wait for you.

570
00:39:57,514 --> 00:39:59,147
She does, huh?

571
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,783
Well, who's the adult
here, Delores?

572
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,785
Tell me she ate
her dinner, at least.

573
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,687
Oh, yes, she ate everything.

574
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:06,688
She ate her peas,
she ate her carrots.

575
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:07,689
Do whatever it takes

576
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:09,124
to keep them out of here,
or they die.

577
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,860
- Understand?
- She ate a whole lot of carrots this time.

578
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:14,594
- Yep.
- That's right, my girl.

579
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,132
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.

580
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,135
Put Kira to bed and then go on home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

581
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,303
Really? You don't want
me to wait for you?

582
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,839
- No, you go home.
- Thank you.

583
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,507
<i>Si,</i> Ms. Lydia.

584
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,409
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

585
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:33,345
Mommy, you gonna come
say good night to me?

586
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,882
Yeah, honey.
After mommy takes a bath.

587
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,516
Okay.

588
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:40,853
Love you.

589
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:44,390
Mommy's very
tired, so let's go to bed.

590
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:04,008
I won't have to
unless you scream.

591
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:06,376
You know why I'm here?

592
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:11,415
What are you waiting for?

593
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,550
The nanny to leave.

594
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:16,553
If you have anything
to say to me,

595
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:18,755
now's the time.

596
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,598
Two good men died
because of you.

597
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:33,402
Don't shoot me in the face.

598
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,737
Please.

599
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,839
I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

600
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:39,374
- Your daughter won't see you.
- Yes, she will. She'll find me.

601
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:41,376
She never once sleeps
through the night.

602
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,212
Nobody's gonna find you, Lydia.

603
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,215
Wait. What?

604
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:47,983
No.

605
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:49,784
No. No.

606
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:52,186
No! Sh-she
has to find me.

607
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,588
- Lower your voice.
- She has to find me.

608
00:41:54,623 --> 00:41:56,357
She has to find me.
I-- I--

609
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,592
You want your
five-year-old daughter

610
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:00,594
stumbling across
your dead body?

611
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:03,697
I can't just disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

612
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,932
- She has to know that!
- Keep your voice down.

613
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,868
I don't care what you do.

614
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:09,836
I'll scream and
I'll keep screaming.

615
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,504
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

616
00:42:11,538 --> 00:42:14,775
Shut up and calm down.

617
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,676
I don't care.
You have to promise.

618
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,745
You have to promise me...

619
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:30,589
Promise I don't disappear.

620
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:58,481
Can you still get
your hands on methylamine?

621
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,454
Methylamine, Lydia.

622
00:43:04,488 --> 00:43:06,857
Can you still get it?

623
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,026
Maybe.

624
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,395
Why?

625
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:29,510
Aww...

626
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:38,519
Yes?

627
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:41,989
<i>You still plan to move forward?</i>

628
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:43,690
Yes, we do.

629
00:43:44,726 --> 00:43:48,362
I've reconsidered.
I'm in.

630
00:43:50,498 --> 00:43:51,999
Good.

631
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:14,219
Well, you missed a good meal.

632
00:44:14,254 --> 00:44:16,889
The lasagna came out very well,

633
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:19,024
if I do say so myself.

634
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:25,130
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

635
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,415
You know, it gets easier.

636
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,849
I promise you that it does.

637
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,088
What you're feeling
right now...

638
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,826
About, uh, Ted...

639
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,196
Everything...

640
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,200
It'll pass.

641
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,551
When we do...

642
00:46:00,587 --> 00:46:03,421
what we do for good reasons...

643
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,429
then we've got
nothing to worry about.

644
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:19,303
And there's no better reason...

645
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,974
than family.
