1
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,885
Mr. White?

2
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:59,886
Hello?

3
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:22,408
Mr. White,
the car's been dealt with, sir.

4
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,917
No one tailed you?

5
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:31,918
No, I stayed off the main streets
and kept checking, so...

6
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:35,551
Joe ask any questions?

7
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:40,552
I told him RV job, just like you said,
and he totally knew.

8
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:52,105
It's pretty cool the way they do that.
They just turn a car into a cube.

9
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,749
So should we deal
with this other thing now?

10
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:23,432
Yeah.

11
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:28,433
Sure.

12
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,910
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Okay.

13
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,497
It had to be done.

14
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:50,459
Okay.

15
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,460
All right.

16
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,189
I need to talk to you.

17
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,190
In private.

18
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,075
So, what's the story?

19
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,994
You get to Mike?

20
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,538
He get out safe?

21
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:31,750
He's gone.

22
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,168
All right.

23
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,838
Well, what about
those nine guys in jail?

24
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,758
I mean, they got no reason
not to talk now.

25
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,551
So, what do we do?

26
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:46,056
"We"? Who's "We"?

27
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,433
There is no "we," Jesse.

28
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:51,019
I'm the only vote left...

29
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,020
...and I'll handle it.

30
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:03,300
My client will supply information
relating to the organization...

31
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:07,262
...distribution and production of Fring's
methamphetamine enterprise.

32
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:11,016
We expect all charges to be dropped,
and Dennis not only walks out of here...

33
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:16,017
...a free man,
but also receives blanket immunity.

34
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:21,606
For what he'll be furnishing,
this deal is plenty fair.

35
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:27,032
Best I'd be willing to do
is queen for a day and reduced charges.

36
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,241
All charges dropped.

37
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,703
Queen for a day and a five-k.
That's the best you're gonna get.

38
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,830
No way. Guys, come on.

39
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:36,041
You can be a fairy princess,
for all I care.

40
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,584
Where you going?

41
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:41,087
Shopping for someone who can tell me
something I don't already know.

42
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:43,465
Hey, hey-

43
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,551
I got plenty you don't know.

44
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:48,762
You seem a little confused.

45
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,472
This here is a buyer's market.

46
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:54,768
I got eight other assholes just like you,
four of them within 100 feet from here.

47
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:58,313
I also got Dan the lawyer, who'll give me
the money and Ehrmantraut.

48
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:01,858
So settle in, Dennis.
Enjoy your new home.

49
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:06,859
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.

50
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,031
- So?
- Maybe you should order something.

51
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:54,786
- Do you want a coffee or something?
- Not just now.

52
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:57,664
I think this would play better
if you ordered something.

53
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:01,084
I think this will play just fine,
and I'm not thirsty.

54
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:06,085
So let's take a look at the list.

55
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,967
Lydia, you've come all this way.
You do have the list?

56
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:11,261
- Yes, I have it.
- Good.

57
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:13,305
It's just not written down.

58
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:17,183
- And why is that?
-It's in my head. Safer there.

59
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,643
I see.

60
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:21,354
Then I suggest you pick up a pen.

61
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:24,941
Not just yet.

62
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:28,695
It was my understanding
that attending to these nine names...

63
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:30,697
...was precisely what you wanted.

64
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:33,283
Ten names now.
Ten, counting the lawyer.

65
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:36,161
Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer.

66
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:41,162
So, what, am I not tying up loose ends
for our mutual benefit?

67
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,836
You're tying up loose ends,
and I don't wanna be one of them.

68
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,213
I give you that list,
I've served my purpose.

69
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:51,426
Then maybe I'm just one more person
who knows too much.

70
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:55,388
So you put that list in my hands,
and in your mind...

71
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,185
...I immediately just murder you,
just right here in this restaurant?

72
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:03,939
- No. Not right here. Of course.
- Here in this public place, immediately?

73
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,565
- That is not--
- Listen, Lydia.

74
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:10,403
You made me promise on my children's
lives that I guaranteed your safety.

75
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,113
From Mike.

76
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:15,742
You guaranteed
I'd be safe from Mike.

77
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:20,288
There's no way he'd ever go for this,
you getting rid of his guys.

78
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,289
You wouldn't be doing this, the names,
if Mike were still a factor.

79
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:34,423
Yeah. That's what I thought.

80
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:38,181
What do you want, exactly?

81
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:41,351
Because if you don't want
to give me that list...

82
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:46,352
...then I've truly got no use for you.

83
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,901
I can grow your business
exponentially.

84
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,236
Just give me the list.

85
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:54,364
I can do that by helping you
expand into a larger...

86
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:58,118
...highly active, highly profitable
marketplace.

87
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:02,288
What do you know
about the Czech Republic?

88
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:03,748
The Czech Republic?

89
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:07,502
Did you know there's a higher demand
for meth there than anywhere in Europe?

90
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,754
Five percent of its 10 million people...

91
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,424
...which is roughly the population
of the Southwest...

92
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:16,219
...from western Texas to Phoenix,
are using meth.

93
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,556
You keep your market here,
but by adding overseas sales...

94
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,975
...you can more than double
your current profits.

95
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:26,021
And I checked. The average purity
is only about 60 percent.

96
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:30,358
They've never seen
anything like your product.

97
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:34,487
You'll blow their hair back.

98
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:38,283
Shipping internationally
seems like courting disaster.

99
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:39,492
Not if you're Madrigal.

100
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:42,579
Madrigal is under investigation
by the DEA.

101
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,581
The restaurant division, mostly.

102
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:49,085
We've got 46,000 employees
spread across 14 divisions.

103
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:53,882
And once Mike's people are no longer
a factor, things should tidy up nicely.

104
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,842
This is what I do, you understand?

105
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:58,386
Move things from point A to point B
all over the globe.

106
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,930
One-point-two million
metric tons a month...

107
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:05,931
...and all of it right at my fingertips,
a laptop click away.

108
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:10,023
The Czech Republic...

109
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:12,734
- Who's on the other end?
- People I ship to regularly.

110
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:15,987
People I've worked with for years.
Professional and very amenable.

111
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:20,988
I'm very careful who I work with.

112
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:30,126
And if this is such a slam dunk,
then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?

113
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:34,130
I did. He said yes. We were
in the final stages of working it out...

114
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:39,131
...when somebody killed him.

115
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:45,554
You don't think Gus Fring built
his distribution network all by himself.

116
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:51,356
There are considerable advantages
to diversification of distribution...

117
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:56,357
...like putting 6000 miles
between you and your product.

118
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:03,197
At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating
you'll gross about 2 million.

119
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:09,203
Give me 10 pounds to start,
and we'll see how it goes.

120
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,711
- All right.
- Now, with Fring...

121
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:17,590
...my end was gonna be 30 percent,
which I believe is more than fair.

122
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,926
- Okay.
- Trust me, if you do this--

123
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:24,430
Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.

124
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:29,431
Now, first things first.

125
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:06,385
Shake on it?

126
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:12,391
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

127
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,649
Todd, I think it's time
I meet your uncle.

128
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,363
No iron pile.

129
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:49,242
There's too many muscle-heads
flexing their shit. Too many eyes.

130
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:52,662
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.

131
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,956
Well, gonna keep it simple.

132
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:56,332
Pass-byes.

133
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,086
Yeah. Hallways,
shower room, cells.

134
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,088
The easy stuff.

135
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,008
I say we go with a riot.
Our boys get it done in a riot.

136
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,760
No, no, no. No chaos.

137
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:12,761
I don't want the goon squad rolling in
and stealing our shot, you know?

138
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:16,269
This has gotta be fast and quiet.

139
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,688
Just boom, boom, boom.

140
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,815
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:23,151
Surgical.

142
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:27,822
Surgical. That's what it's gotta be.

143
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:30,742
So how many guys we got at MDC?

144
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:35,413
Three, counting Shattuck.
And he makes the schedule now...

145
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:38,583
...so we can put who we need
where we need them.

146
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:41,669
All right. So MDC's covered.
What about the rest?

147
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,797
We need G block in Valencia, right?

148
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,466
Our guy's on the night shift.

149
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,967
- Have him pull a double.
- No.

150
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,470
His supervisor's got
some hard-on about OT.

151
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:52,805
Have him switch with somebody.
Just get it done.

152
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:56,142
Regardless, you know, we got
enough guys in Valencia right now?

153
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,102
Might have to hire out.

154
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,605
You high?
Mix blood with chuntaros?

155
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:05,276
- No way.
- No.

156
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:08,488
There's no need. We got enough.

157
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:13,326
Hitters ain't the problem. It's that
short walking window after lunch.

158
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,788
Yeah. It's gonna be tight.

159
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:21,789
Real tight.

160
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:29,171
I gotta be straight with you, man.
Taking out all these guys is doable.

161
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:32,345
But hitting them in three separate jails
all within two minutes?

162
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:37,346
I mean, whacking bin Laden
wasn't this complicated.

163
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:43,231
Where do you suppose
these come from?

164
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:45,400
I've seen this one before.

165
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,402
I wonder...

166
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:52,403
...are they all In some giant
warehouse someplace?

167
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:02,083
Hey-

168
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:07,084
It can be done,
just not the way you want it.

169
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:26,524
It can be done exactly how I want it.

170
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:31,525
The only question is,
are you the man to do it?

171
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:42,081
Figure it out.

172
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:47,082
That's what I'm paying you for.

173
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,882
Yo, what's going on, man?
What's that alarm?

174
00:18:56,883 --> 00:19:01,883
What's happening?

175
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,890
What are you doing, man?
No, man, please!

176
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:06,809
No, man! Help me!

177
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,645
Help me! Help!

178
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:14,646
Help me!

179
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:23,614
Ball came in my direction,
batter wouldn't even bother running.

180
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:29,661
Excuse me a second.
Couple more photos.

181
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,219
Yes?

182
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,220
<i>It's done.</i>

183
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,233
<i>New details have emerged
in the spate of jail deaths...</i>

184
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,861
<i>...that rocked central New Mexico
three days ago.</i>

185
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:02,114
<i>As of yet, no names of victims
have been released...</i>

186
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:05,743
<i>...but authorities continue to investigate
what appears to be...</i>

187
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:08,496
<i>...a carefully coordinated
sequence of attacks...</i>

188
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:13,125
<i>...that occurred within minutes in
three different correctional facilities...</i>

189
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,211
- Is it okay if I turn this off?
- Oh, sure.

190
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,296
I don't want the news on right now.

191
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:20,716
Hank just pulled up,
and he's not in the best mood.

192
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:24,720
- Oh, all right. I'll get out of your hair.
- Okay.

193
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:28,182
Hi, honey.

194
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:31,560
Dinner will be in about an hour.

195
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:35,106
And I thought we could have
that chicken you like.

196
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:38,984
- Or we could order Chinese.
- Sure.

197
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:42,488
Here we go.

198
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,825
That fun? Play with your toys?

199
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:49,161
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?
See you in a little bit.

200
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:51,622
Hey, Hank.
I was just getting ready to leave.

201
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:54,083
Something to drink?

202
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,627
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

203
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,546
Perfect.

204
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:01,090
Hi.

205
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:06,091
- Rocks, right?
- Rocks, yes.

206
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:14,872
Been thinking about this summer job
I used to have.

207
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:18,584
Oh, yeah?

208
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:23,172
Back in college, I'd spend my days...

209
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:26,175
...marking trees in the woods
with this...

210
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:29,970
This orange spray can.

211
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:32,431
Marking trees?

212
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:35,351
Yeah. Crews would come in later...

213
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:40,352
...and find the trees I tagged
and cut them down.

214
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:47,776
First, you go in and you mark locations
for skid trails and landings.

215
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,990
Then you choose specific trees
all within a selected grid.

216
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:58,833
Every day...

217
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,460
...I'd go back...

218
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,046
...hike in...

219
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:09,047
...pick up where I left off.

220
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,097
Oh, it sounds nice...

221
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:15,933
...being out in the woods all day.

222
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:17,852
No, it wasn't so great.

223
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:20,729
I got sunburned.
There were mosquitoes.

224
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,730
I just wanted to make a few bucks.
Buy beer.

225
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,073
Been thinking about that job
more and more lately.

226
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,410
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.

227
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:39,411
Tagging trees is a lot better
than chasing monsters.

228
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:57,721
I used to love to go camping.

229
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:48,330
- This way.
- Here, baby girl. Come see your brother.

230
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,415
There you go, sweetie. That's it.

231
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,626
Oh, my God! Look at her go!

232
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:56,421
- Good job! Good job!
- Over here. Peekaboo. This way.

233
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:58,674
Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

234
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:01,844
Where'd you go?
I can't see you. Where'd you go?

235
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:05,097
There you are!

236
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:08,225
You're really good with her.

237
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,685
Come here, my baby girl.

238
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:12,729
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.

239
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,730
Mama's gonna get her exercise.

240
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:23,323
Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?

241
00:28:23,324 --> 00:28:26,368
Hey, Louis.

242
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:28,871
One moment.

243
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:33,872
Nothing. What's up?

244
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:41,379
Oh, Well.

245
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,307
It's so nice to see you smile again.

246
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:52,352
I mean, you seem good.

247
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:56,148
Yeah. I'm hanging in there.

248
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:59,693
To see you laugh like that just now...

249
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:04,364
It's such an improvement,
don't you think?

250
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:09,365
I don't-- I don't really...

251
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:15,334
We've been thinking...

252
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:18,795
...Hank and I, that it may be time...

253
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:23,796
...to take the kids home.

254
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:28,013
It's been almost three months, right?

255
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:33,014
Almost three?

256
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:36,563
Does Hank not want--?

257
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:39,316
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No.

258
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:42,277
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

259
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:44,821
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

260
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:46,573
And we're always here for you...

261
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:50,869
...and wanna help you
any way that we can.

262
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,249
But...

263
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,751
We're starting to worry...

264
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:02,752
...that maybe...

265
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:08,216
Maybe we're enabling you.

266
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:12,432
Sweetie, you've had
a lot on your plate...

267
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:16,645
...and you and Walt have had a lot--

268
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:20,732
So much to contend with.

269
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:24,236
I'm so proud of you for going to therapy.
You know that, right?

270
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:26,655
It can be so helpful,
such a good tool.

271
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:30,826
And I'm very, very proud of you...

272
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,619
...but I--

273
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,124
We...

274
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,168
Maybe at this point...

275
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:44,006
...the best way to help
repair the family...

276
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:49,007
...would be to repair the family,
you know?

277
00:31:57,455 --> 00:32:02,455
Take a drive with me.

278
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:24,602
Here. I'll get it.

279
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:31,859
Walt.

280
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:53,343
This is it.

281
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:58,344
This is what you've been working for.

282
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:03,391
I rented this place and I started
bringing it here because...

283
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:07,023
...I didn't know what else to do.

284
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,651
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

285
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:13,363
It was just so much, so fast.

286
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:15,991
I tried weighing it.

287
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:20,620
I figured one bill of any denomination
weighs a gram.

288
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:25,621
There are 454 grams
to a pound, but...

289
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:32,170
There's a variety
of denominations, so...

290
00:33:35,052 --> 00:33:39,264
How much is this?

291
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:42,934
I have no earthly idea.

292
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:45,896
I truly don't.

293
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,856
I just stack it up...

294
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:52,857
...keep it dry, spray it for silverfish.

295
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:56,448
There is more money here...

296
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:59,618
...than we could spend
in 10 lifetimes.

297
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:04,619
I certainly can't launder it,
not with a hundred car washes.

298
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:12,214
Walt...

299
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:16,301
...I want my kids back.

300
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:21,302
I want my life back.

301
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:25,185
Please tell me.

302
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:27,604
How much is enough?

303
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:32,605
How big does this pile have to be?

304
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:54,604
Shit!

305
00:36:23,596 --> 00:36:25,388
Hi.

306
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:29,392
Hey-

307
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:32,479
I hope I'm not disturbing you
or anything.

308
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,064
I tried calling, but--

309
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:37,609
Yeah. No, I tossed all my burners.

310
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,611
And you didn't answer
your home line.

311
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,696
It's disconnected.

312
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:43,823
Well, unplugged.

313
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:48,328
I mean, did you leave
a message, or...?

314
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:52,874
No.

315
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,794
So, what's up?

316
00:36:55,795 --> 00:37:00,795
No, I was just in the neighbourhood,
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

317
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:11,184
You wanna come in, or...?

318
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:16,185
Sure. Thanks.

319
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,495
You know, I'd offer you
a beer or something...

320
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,375
-...but, you know, I'm out.
- No, no. No, I'm fine, thanks.

321
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:38,962
You didn't wind up moving, I see.

322
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:41,047
Didn't have to.

323
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:46,048
Saul told me what you did.

324
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:51,057
Anyways, I'm not in jail.

325
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:55,854
You aren't either, so there you go.

326
00:37:55,855 --> 00:38:00,855
There was no other option, Jesse.
It had to be done.

327
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,699
I'm not coming back.

328
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,785
I know.

329
00:38:10,786 --> 00:38:15,786
So why are you here, exactly?

330
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:25,049
It's funny, I...

331
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,886
I saw a Bounder the other day.

332
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,804
- Bounder?
- Yeah.

333
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:34,805
Our RV? A Bounder?

334
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,188
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?

335
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:41,441
Yeah. Well, I mean,
within a couple of years, I guess.

336
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:42,942
Early '80s.

337
00:38:42,943 --> 00:38:46,905
It was certainly in a lot better shape
than our old hunk of junk.

338
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:50,158
Much nicer paint job.

339
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,702
No bullet holes in the door.

340
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:56,080
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

341
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:59,626
Yeah. It was primitive.

342
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:04,422
You know, whenever
I hit a red light, I used to pray...

343
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,800
...it wouldn't crap out on me.

344
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:08,468
Yeah.

345
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:12,096
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that...

346
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:14,724
That screeching sound
just out of the blue...

347
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:16,351
...like we hit a pack of cats.

348
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:20,063
Power-steering belt.
That's what that was.

349
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,023
You know, I always had this...

350
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,108
This whole system.

351
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:26,611
Strategy to not let it idle too low.

352
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:30,073
Remember that time we ran out of gas
coming back from a cook?

353
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:32,116
The gauge. It always said half-full.

354
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:36,496
You walked three miles with a jerrican
while I waited on the side of the road...

355
00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:39,999
...praying the whole time
that no cop would show up...

356
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,751
...no Good Samaritan.

357
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,087
God.

358
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,797
We had money.

359
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:47,674
Why'd we keep it?

360
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:50,927
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

361
00:39:50,928 --> 00:39:53,012
Inertia?

362
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,848
Yeah.

363
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:56,516
Yeah.

364
00:39:56,517 --> 00:40:01,517
Inertia.

365
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:15,827
So, hey, you know, I gotta get going.

366
00:40:15,828 --> 00:40:17,370
- Me too.
- I'm meeting friends.

367
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:22,371
I gotta get going as well.

368
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,130
I left something for you.

369
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:07,935
Hey-

370
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:22,408
I'm out.

371
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:31,083
I'm out.

372
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:18,885
With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

373
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:21,471
- Perhaps some big hoops.
-l do indeed.

374
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:24,307
I feel like I want to mix it up
with my hair this summer.

375
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:26,809
- I don't know, like colours--
- I don't know. Coins.

376
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,978
Did you have a coin collection?
Did you?

377
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:31,731
I've heard it's very therapeutic.

378
00:43:31,732 --> 00:43:35,109
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

379
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,570
You can play around with it,
take them in and out.

380
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:39,530
Not enough hours in the day, right?

381
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:42,366
- There's not enough hours.
- My hairstylist told me...

382
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,702
...to take prenatal vitamins.

383
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:46,329
For your hair?

384
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,706
He said they work,
so I figured why not?

385
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:52,668
Oh, Flynn, could you put some more
sunscreen on Holly?

386
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,420
Yeah. Is it over there?

387
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,214
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Okay.

388
00:43:56,215 --> 00:44:00,009
- Especially for a home brew, though.
- Paba-free. That's good.

389
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,887
- I don't know why it would be bad.
- Yeah. Me neither.

390
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:06,140
Oh, do you--? I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

391
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:07,517
You remember that?

392
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:10,436
You wanted to be
a beach bum so badly.

393
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:12,105
I did.

394
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:14,273
You and your stiff hair.

395
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:19,237
- Stiff? Whose stiff y? What?
- Hey, hey.

396
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:21,030
I was interested
to see you get into that.

397
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:24,117
-It's like chemistry.
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.

398
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:26,285
- Better than flaxseed?
- I don't know.

399
00:44:26,286 --> 00:44:30,581
- That's cool. I like your style.
- There is no Christmas.

400
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:33,835
- Maybe I should brew up a batch.
- Schraderbrau?

401
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:35,169
- Yeah.
- I vote yes.

402
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,047
- I second that.
- Well, there you go. It's unanimous.

403
00:44:38,048 --> 00:44:43,048
Well, who am I to fly in the face
of public demand, right?

404
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,975
All right.

405
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:51,561
Anybody want anything?
You want anything?

406
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:55,148
- No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you.
- Yeah? All right.

407
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:57,692
Does it look glossier?

408
00:44:57,693 --> 00:44:59,318
Do I have a halo?

409
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:01,529
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

410
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,530
Yeah? Try not to put any
of the sunscreen on her fingers.

411
00:46:08,805 --> 00:46:13,805
<i>"To W.W. My star, my perfect silence."</i>

412
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,771
<i>W.W.</i>

413
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:19,065
I mean, who do you figure that is?

414
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:21,525
Woodrow Wilson?

415
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:25,988
Willy Wonka?

416
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:30,989
Walter White?

417
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:36,495
You got me.
