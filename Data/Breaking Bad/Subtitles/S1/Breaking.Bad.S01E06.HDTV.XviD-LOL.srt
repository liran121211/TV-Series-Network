1
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,310
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,520
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

3
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,800
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,570
Out there on the
street, you deal with that.

5
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,110
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

6
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,130
I don't need to see them.

7
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,490
I don't want to hear from them.

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,560
I want no interaction with
them whatsoever.

9
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,310
This operation is you and
me, and I'm the silent partner.

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,100
You got any issues with that?

11
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,740
Whatever, man.

12
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,300
No matter what
happens, no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,620
No violence.

17
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,620
Walt?

18
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,970
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

19
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,400
You know, honey, you-- you
really don't have to

20
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,500
look, I like being here with you.

21
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,230
Yeah.

22
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,310
I'm only saying that, you know, I'd be okay
with it, really, if-- if you want to go.

23
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,930
You know, actually, it would make me feel a
little better knowing that you were there

24
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,980
when Walter jr gets home from school.

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,540
Okay.

26
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,010
All right.

27
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,630
- So you'll call me when you're finished?
- Oh, yeah.

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,290
Okay.

29
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,310
Uh, and have you been
in touch with Elliott?

30
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,230
Because, uh, I haven't
seen a check from him.

31
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,010
- Yes, I-- I got it.
- Really?

32
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,470
It came, yeah.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,150
Yeah, it-- it came last week, and I put it
right into my credit union account, so--

34
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,740
Taken care of it.

35
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,360
Good.

36
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,380
So we're good. We're good

37
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,760
could you not deposit this until monday?

38
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,960
Thank you.

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
Call if the discomfort's too much.

40
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,210
Otherwise, we'll see you next week.

41
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,370
Yeah.

42
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,840
Chemical reactions involve change
on two levels: Matter and energy.

43
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,840
When a reaction is gradual,the
change in energy is slight.

44
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,460
I mean, you-- you don't even
notice the reaction is happening:

45
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:51,490
For example, when rust collects on
the underside of a car. All right?

46
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,690
But if a reaction happens quickly,

47
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,460
otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

48
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,950
that generates enormous
bursts of energy.

49
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,290
who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

50
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,770
Hint, hint.

51
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,310
Right here.

52
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,690
Like an explosion?

53
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,850
Yes. Good.

54
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,350
Explosions.

55
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:40,030
Explosions are the result of chemical
reactions happening most instantaneously.

56
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,720
And the faster reactants--
I.E., Explosives

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,760
and fulminative mercury is
a prime example of that

58
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,580
the faster they undergo change, the
more violentthe explosion.

59
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,920
So... explosions.

60
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,820
Okay, listen. Why don't youstart reading on
your own from the top of chapter 7, all right?

61
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,880
Mr. White, you okay?

62
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,460
I got it, mr. White.

63
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,220
Don't worry.

64
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,580
You got kids to teach.

65
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,060
Thanks, Hugo.

66
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,800
He's starting to lose weight, which
is, uh, tough to see that

67
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,320
you know, to feel the difference
when I put my, uh, arms around him.

68
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,010
Can I talk?

69
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,940
Of course.

70
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,560
Walt...when, um, when you don't let me in,

71
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,020
when you don't tell me what's going on,

72
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,920
I think it's like I feel like you
don't even want me around sometimes.

73
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,610
No.

74
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,260
And-- and-- and
recently these afternoons,

75
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,860
when-- when you're
coming home so late

76
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,720
and we're just left
wondering where you are.

77
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,480
Y-yeah, dad.

78
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,710
What's up with that?

79
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:08,060
Walt, is there anything else you're
holding back from your family?

80
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,970
Now's the time to share.

81
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:22,930
Well... I, uh...I--
I like to be alone--

82
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,080
I mean at times, and
it's not about you, really.

83
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:41,940
It's just that sometimes it feels better not to
talk at all about anything, you know, to anyone.

84
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,970
Alone time can be helpful for some types.

85
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,220
Maybe knowing what you
do when you're alone

86
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:59,320
might make it easier for your family to be
more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.

87
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:11,940
Well... I-- I like to go on walks a couple
of times a week, maybe more, after work,

88
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,480
and, uh, I really enjoy the nature

89
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,100
you know, the cacti, the
vegetation, that kind of thing.

90
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,960
And that's really very therapeutic.

91
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,550
Yo! You okay?

92
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,830
- Did you breathe that ----
- No. I'm just dizzy. I--

93
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,280
come here. Sit down, sit down.

94
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,490
I'm burning up.

95
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,180
Take this off.

96
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,020
Sit down. Get some air.

97
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,700
Oh, god.
Oh, this--

98
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,030
here.

99
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,490
yeah?

100
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,260
Yeah, that's better.

101
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,410
When were you going to tell me?

102
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,220
Tell you what?

103
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,180
Cancer.

104
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,490
You got it, right?

105
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,020
How did you know?

106
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,570
My aunt had one of those...

107
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,330
dots on her to target the radiation.

108
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,550
What is it, in your lung?

109
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,630
I'm your partner, man.
You should have told me.

110
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,640
That's not cool, okay? Not at all.

111
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,530
What stage are you?

112
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,970
3a.

113
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,300
Gone to your lymph nodes.

114
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,140
Your aunt.

115
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,930
H-how bad was she when they caught it?

116
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,110
Bad enough. She didn't last long.

117
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,660
How long?

118
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,170
Seven months.

119
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,910
I get it now.

120
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,490
That's why you're doing all this.

121
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,960
You want to make some cash for
your people before you check out.

122
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,290
You got a problem with that?

123
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,640
You tell me. You're the one that looks
like you just crawled out of a microwave.

124
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,770
You going to be able to finish the batch?

125
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,450
Yes.

126
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,080
All right.

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
No.

128
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,120
You do it.

129
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,870
Me?

130
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,730
Yeah.

131
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,930
What happened to your mad skills?

132
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,320
Go on. Here.

133
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
You do it.

134
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,820
You can do it.

135
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,530
If you have any questions, I'll
be right out here.

136
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,300
The next time, put an ice
pack on your head during chemo.

137
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,340
My aunt said it
helped with the hair loss.

138
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,390
What's this?

139
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,900
Christmas?

140
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,710
This the one we found way out
in the boonies, the cook site?

141
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,440
Holy----.

142
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,270
What?

143
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,520
Lab says they pulled up an imprint of some
old writing that used to be on the inside.

144
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,210
Old magic marker or something.

145
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,760
Yeah? What's it say?

146
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,610
"Property of J.P. Wynne chemistry lab."

147
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,680
That's walt's school.

148
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,790
we were supposed to start at 3.

149
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm out there making fat stacks, man.

150
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,470
Chill.

151
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,740
Hey. Prepaid cell phone.

152
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,630
Use it.

153
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,770
How much is this?

154
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,320
26 big ones.

155
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,640
Is that all?

156
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,220
$26,000?

157
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,290
Uh, no, that's 26 hundred,

158
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,290
and your share is 13, minus
25 bucks for that phone.

159
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,040
How much meth did you sell?

160
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,200
Nearly an ounce.

161
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,230
Last time I checked, there
were 16 ouncesto a pound.

162
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,570
What did you do with the rest, smoke it?

163
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,350
Yo, I've been out there all
night slinging crystal.

164
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,450
You think it's cake moving a
pound of meth one teenth at a time?

165
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,470
Why are you selling it in
such small quantities?

166
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,070
Why don't you just sell the
whole pound at once?

167
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,270
To who? What do I look like, scarface?

168
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,820
This is unacceptable.

169
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,850
I am breaking the law here.

170
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,290
This return is too little for the risk.

171
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,730
I thought you'd be ready for
another pound today.

172
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,470
You may know a lot about chemistry, man,

173
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,830
but you don't know
jack about slinging dope.

174
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,220
Uh, well, I'll tell you, I know a
lack of motivation when I see it.

175
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,960
Oh,my--

176
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,300
come on. You've got to be
more imaginative, you know?

177
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,870
Just-- just think outside
the box here.

178
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,010
We have to move our
product in bulk, wholesale, now.

179
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,580
How do we do that?

180
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,930
What do you mean, to, like, a distributor?

181
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,910
Yes. Yes. That's what we need.

182
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,570
We need a distributor now.

183
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,490
Do you know anyone like that?

184
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,880
Yeah, I mean I used
to until you killed him.

185
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,860
So who took krazy-8's place?

186
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,340
Some guy named Tuco.

187
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,740
A bad ---, from
what I hear.

188
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,760
Tuco, okay. So then just go talk to Tuco.

189
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,590
Right. Like "hello, sir.

190
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,530
"Hey, I know you don't know me,"

191
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,100
but would you be interested in a
felony quantity of methamphetamine?

192
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,280
" Well, yes, but maybe with a
little more salesmanship, perhaps?

193
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,560
You just don'tget
it, man. This guy's O.G.

194
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,360
What--what
does that mean?

195
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,430
Ah,-----, look, he's
upper level, man.

196
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,760
He's not going to do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

197
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,030
Okay, you just don't understand
the way it works.

198
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,110
You can't just bum rushsome high-level
ice man and start cutting deals, okay?

199
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,860
It's risky.

200
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,970
You need an intro.

201
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,200
You need someone to vouch.

202
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,190
Well, who introduced you to krazy-8?

203
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,610
Emilio. That's only because I
knew himfrom, like, third grade.

204
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,470
We can't talk to Emilio, either, because

205
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,870
all right, all right, all right.

206
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,560
Look, I'm telling you, Mr.
White, it's too risky. Okay?

207
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,800
I mean, we're making money.

208
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,810
Why can't you just be
satisfied with the way it is?

209
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,320
Oh, come on! Just growsome!

210
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,060
Wait till monday again?

211
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,060
Yes, please. Thank you.

212
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,130
Mr. White.

213
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,880
Thank you, Hugo.

214
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,620
Knock-knock.

215
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,060
Oh, hey.

216
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,360
How are you feeling, Walt?

217
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,760
Good.

218
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,580
Yeah.

219
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,980
Are you up for having a visitor?

220
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,080
Hey, buddy.

221
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,820
Hank.

222
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,780
Well, let me know if
you need anything, huh?

223
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,180
I will. Thank you, Carmen.

224
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,530
No problem.

225
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,450
That chick's got an
--- like an onion.

226
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,610
Makes me want to cry.

227
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,680
So what-- what are
you doing here?

228
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,270
Well, I had some questions I wanted
to run by you-- work-related.

229
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,920
You feeling okay? I
could come back later.

230
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,860
No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

231
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,930
Everything's fine.

232
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,350
What do you mean work-related, though?

233
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,660
Do you recognize that?

234
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,180
No.

235
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,730
That was used to cook meth.

236
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,120
Found that on some indian
land about 40 miles from here.

237
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,150
Old label on the inside used to say...

238
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,400
J.P. Wynne chemistry lab.

239
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,640
Really?

240
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,720
I don't understand how
that came from here.

241
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,180
Well, I was hoping you
could help me with that.

242
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,670
We found it near an abandoned car
belonging to one of our snitches.

243
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,420
A snitch?

244
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,080
Yeah, one of our confidential informants.

245
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,470
Went missing a while back.

246
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,960
No body yet, but we're pretty
sure he's, you know, chk-chk.

247
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,060
Probably chopped up in little
pieces and fed to the buzzards.

248
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,670
Anyway, you, uh-- any respirators
like that go missing lately?

249
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,810
No. No. No, I mean, not that I know of.

250
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,020
I'll need to take a
look at that inventory.

251
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,560
Sure. Sure.

252
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,850
I got a list hanging on the wall.

253
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,280
You mind if I take a
look at your store room?

254
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,290
Not at all, no.

255
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,180
Be my guest.

256
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,650
So who's got keys?

257
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,080
Well, the science faculty, the staff, Carmen,

258
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,240
the vice principal has the master, and me.

259
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,560
How about students?

260
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,870
Uh, no, no.

261
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,410
No students have keys.

262
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,910
I should hope not.

263
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,050
My question is do any little ----
know where you keep them?

264
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,390
Uh, I don't-- I don't think so. No.

265
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,360
I mean, besides, I keep them right
here in my pocket anyway, so

266
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,170
walt, look, I know they're your students,

267
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
but, uh, do not underestimate them.

268
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,770
Big mistake.

269
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,240
Are there any other respirators?

270
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,130
Uh, no.

271
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,350
Because I'm counting six.

272
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,740
Uh, inventory says eight.

273
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Uh, glassware looking a little sparse.

274
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,150
- Is it?
- Yeah.

275
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,680
You're missing a couple of
erlenmeyer flasks at least.

276
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,630
Uh...oh, yeah.

277
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,290
A 5,000 milliliter round bottom.

278
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,230
Meth heads love to brew in this, baby.

279
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,840
Going to answer that?

280
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,980
Uh, no, it's just-- no, I don't-- I won't--

281
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,800
maybe it's Skyler.
She's in trouble or something.

282
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,860
I mean,----.
Don't ignore it on my account.

283
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
Answer it. Come on. I got stuff to do.

284
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,500
- Ah, jeez.
- Okay.

285
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,490
Hello.

286
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,000
What's up, Mr. W?

287
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,050
Uh, speaking.

288
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,580
Oh, bad time to talk?

289
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,770
Absolutely.

290
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,290
All right, so just listen.

291
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,640
You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco?

292
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,480
Turns out my boy skinny Pete was in the
same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas.

293
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,880
So we got our in.

294
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,600
We're hauling a pound to the dude right now.

295
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,430
Okay, then.

296
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,380
Well, thank you-- thank you very much for calling.

297
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,050
My doctor is very solicitous.

298
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,370
Hey, look, buddy, the last thing I want
to do is get you in hot water,

299
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,900
but some meth monkey had a
feeding frenzy in here, okay?

300
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,660
You got to keep a better watch over your turf.

301
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,080
I-- I will. All right.

302
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,880
We don't want people to start
wondering about you, right?

303
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,170
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

304
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,370
So you're sure you're tight with this guy?

305
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,220
Two nuts in a ----, yo.

306
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,230
Yo,man, I'm skinny Pete!

307
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,760
Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo.

308
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,760
Come on.

309
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,580
Atta man. That's what's happening.

310
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,630
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

311
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,210
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.

312
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,210
Tuco. What's happening, my brother?

313
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,050
Sick crib, yo.

314
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,180
You been keeping it real since you been sprung.

315
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,780
What's it been, like a year?

316
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,280
This your boy?

317
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,490
Yeah-- Jesse, the dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

318
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,860
Hey, man. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

319
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,500
Break out the ice.

320
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,290
Take a bump.

321
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,260
No worries, man. I'm no cop.

322
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,290
I said hit it.

323
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,960
All right.

324
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,980
This kicks like a mule with his
-----wrapped in duct tape.

325
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,960
Where'd you get it?

326
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,220
I cooked it.

327
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,010
Who you working for?

328
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,190
No one, man.

329
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,300
I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but

330
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,930
That's it.

331
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,360
All right.

332
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,930
We got a deal.

333
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,130
See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.

334
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,180
Cool.

335
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,190
I haven't said how much.

336
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,550
All right

337
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,210
How much?

338
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,570
35 large for the pound.

339
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,830
Well, you're a little light, ese.

340
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,350
It's all right. Don't sweat it.

341
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,620
It's all good.

342
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,950
It's good. Walk. Get out of here.

343
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,540
What about the money?

344
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,840
You'll get it.

345
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,280
This is a consignment operation.

346
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,430
You want me to float 35 g's?

347
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,160
You don't trust me?

348
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,480
No, no. Hey, it's not-- it's not that, man.

349
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,720
It's just, you know, I don't--
I don't do business that way.

350
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,290
Tough ----! The deal is done!

351
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,570
You said this was cool.

352
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,860
Get money for meth. Cash up front.

353
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,260
Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it.

354
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,190
I don't need your punk ---to vouch for me!

355
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,020
Come on!

356
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,230
Oh, come on!

357
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,240
All right, you brought
me some really clean crystal.

358
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,530
Do you really want your money up front?

359
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,020
Up front.

360
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,460
Nobody moves crystal in the
south valley but me,-----!

361
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,250
good morning, Hugo.

362
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,890
Don't mind if I call you Hugo...

363
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,410
Hugo.

364
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,860
We've never had a crowd on the street like that.

365
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,600
Is that uncle Hank?

366
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,480
Holy ----.

367
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,850
Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archuleta.

368
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,100
Hugo, is that--
this doesn't make any sense to me at all.

369
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,010
I got two words for you: Background check.

370
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,290
How about that?

371
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,970
555-0 to the 1 to the 7 to the 8,
representing the abq.

372
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,780
What up? Leave it at the tone.

373
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,210
Where the hell are you?

374
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,810
Call me back.

375
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,950
- Hey, Walt.
- Yeah.

376
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,240
Uh, Hank's about to deal.

377
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,490
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll be right there.

378
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,190
All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.

379
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,700
You're looking good, Walt.

380
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,010
You-- your color's better.

381
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,060
Yeah?

382
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,310
Thanks.

383
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,670
He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.

384
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,280
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some timeoff from work, but

385
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,980
well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning,

386
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,990
and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks.

387
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,680
Really?

388
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,790
I just didn't have a chance to tell you.

389
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,610
Sorry.

390
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,300
Your bet, tough guy.

391
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,440
Check.

392
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,310
Uh, yeah. Check.

393
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,970
Check's in the mail.

394
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,480
10 million.

395
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,110
Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.

396
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,080
Well, then 25 million because that's how I roll.

397
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:29,290
Hey, uncle Hank, why were you arresting
Mr.Archuleta the other day?

398
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,750
He's a pretty cool guy.

399
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,120
Well, uh, turns out that he has a record.

400
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,190
Yeah. Couple of possession beefs.

401
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,410
We figure he was the guy that was stealing
your school's chemistry gear.

402
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,370
I mean, you know, he had a key.

403
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,290
Fit the profile.

404
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,950
When we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt,

405
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,580
which goes to prove old huge
Hugo ain't so cool after all.

406
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,990
It's-- it's to you, Walt.

407
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,010
Yeah, I-- I'll call.

408
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,900
You know, I can't believe the school system
didn't know about this guy's record.

409
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,920
I mean, that's pretty scary.

410
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,380
How could something like that just
slip through the cracks?

411
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,790
I don't know.

412
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,850
I mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just
doesn't strike me as the thief.

413
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,120
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,

414
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,510
but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was
close enough to check you for a hernia.

415
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:23,830
Now, that said, we got a search warrant,
and we toreold Hugo's house apart.

416
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,390
Turns out he's a major league pothead.

417
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,810
But, uh, but he didn't raid your chemistry set.

418
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,000
You hiding something?

419
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm in.

420
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,980
And the river card.

421
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,560
Yeah, I got nothing. I'm out.

422
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,340
I'm out.

423
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,700
When old "holes in her purse" bails,
you know you're in deep.

424
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,680
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

425
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,750
What's going to happen to him? Hugo.

426
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,490
Oh, he-- well, I mean, he's going to
lose his job, like he should.

427
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,100
Probably spend a couple months in county,
as it's not his first rap.

428
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,170
I'm waiting.

429
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,270
You going to man up,
or you're going to ---- out?

430
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,870
Hank.

431
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,450
What? Sorry.

432
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm all in.

433
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,550
No.

434
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:38,040
You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.

435
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,470
What are you smoking there, huh?

436
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:42,650
You got a heart?

437
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,080
You got the flush, don't you?

438
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,020
Nope.

439
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,270
Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.

440
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,060
Talk about anti-climactic.

441
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,570
Your cards couldn't have been that bad.

442
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,610
Come on.

443
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,250
Oh, my god.

444
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,420
- You threw away an ace
- what are you doing?

445
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,190
- And a cowboy, for
- don't do it. What?

446
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,400
Oh... a handful of nothing.

447
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,610
Who is this?

448
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,880
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

449
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,820
Well, where is he, then?

450
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,950
You the guy?

451
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,630
Yeah, I'm the guy.

452
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,770
How is he?

453
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,140
Got some busted ribs and like that.

454
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,570
Got messed up pretty good.

455
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,150
I was all like"----, Tuco, chill, ese."

456
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,270
I don't know what got into him. Seriously.

457
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,750
Oh, he's out, man, way out.

458
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,630
They got him doped up big-time.

459
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,330
So you're the cook, huh?

460
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,900
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

461
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,740
Tell me about this Tuco.

462
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,450
Tell meev erything about him.

463
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,000
Good morning.

464
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,000
Would you pass the butter, please?

465
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,370
Bad ---, dad.

466
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,090
You tuco?

467
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,160
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

468
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,790
What's your name?

469
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,590
Heisenberg.

470
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,470
Heisenberg.

471
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,030
Okay.

472
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,080
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

473
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,310
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

474
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,840
No?

475
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,680
All right.

476
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,480
Be that way.

477
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,370
It's your meeting.

478
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,110
Why don't you start talking and
tell me what you want?

479
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,660
$50,000.

480
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,900
Oh, man!

481
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,600
50 g's?

482
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,840
How you figure that?

483
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:46,150
35 for the pound of meth you stole and another
15 for my partner's pain and suffering.

484
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,640
Partner.

485
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,800
Oh, yeah.

486
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,280
I remember that little -----.

487
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,090
So you must be daddy.

488
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,770
Let me get this straight.

489
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,120
I steal your dope, hmm?

490
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,840
I beat the ---- out of your mule boy!

491
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,590
And then you walk in here,
and you bring me more meth?

492
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,150
Whoo, that's a brilliant plan, ese.

493
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,420
Brilliant.

494
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,280
You got one part of that wrong.

495
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,220
This is not meth.

496
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,680
Are you ------- nuts?

497
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,140
You want to find out?

498
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,140
No-doze, gonzo, calma!

499
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,230
Calma. Calma.

500
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,240
Ah, yeah, you got -----.

501
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,500
I'll give you that.

502
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,100
All right. All right.

503
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,840
I'll give you your money.

504
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:48,020
That crystal that your partner brought
me I sold faster than $10 --- in tj.

505
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,450
What say you bring meanother pound next week?

506
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,910
Money up front.

507
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,060
All right.

508
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,420
Money up front.

509
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,670
Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches.

510
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,490
Just as long as we got an understanding.

511
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,400
1 pound is not going to cut it.

512
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,290
You have to take 2.

513
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,770
Orale.

514
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,910
Hey.

515
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,160
What is that ----?

516
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,860
Fulminated mercury.

517
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,710
A little tweak of chemistry.
