1
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:05,947
In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously.

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:08,520
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,227
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:12,958
remains one of our
highest priorities.

5
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:14,955
And the theft of lab equipment
from your school

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,534
is also receiving
our highest attention.

7
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:21,102
Rest assured, no stone will go
unturned in our search

8
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,744
for the person or persons
responsible for this.

9
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:25,783
If you have any questions,
now would be the time.

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,217
Sir?

11
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:29,683
You're talking like you haven't caught
anybody yet.

12
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,973
What about the janitor
that was dealing drugs at the school?

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,298
There is no indication that this individual
was selling drugs.

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,937
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana in his car,

15
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:41,696
not in the school.

16
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,882
And he's
since been fired.

17
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,563
I heard he had a record.

18
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:47,860
I'd like to know how he got a job here
in the first place.

19
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:48,609
Exactly.

20
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:49,931
Why wasn't there
a background check?

21
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,306
There was one.

22
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,457
We're currently reviewing
our hiring policies.

23
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,922
You better be doing
more than that.

24
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,295
This guy was arrested
right in front of my daughter.

25
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,168
This guy was stealing
the lab equipment, right?

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,133
That's not our thinking
at this time.

27
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,085
We are looking at others
who also had access,

28
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:06,266
but not limited
to the maintenance staff.

29
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:07,798
Are you saying
there was a break-in?

30
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,525
Do we know exactly
when this happened?

31
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:12,135
I mean, could it have been during
school hours?

32
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,677
We haven't been able
to establish a date

33
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:16,629
or time, but there is no sign
of breaking or entering.

34
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,414
So, whoever
took it had a key?

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,946
We're talking inside job?

36
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,209
Someone who's still
at the school?

37
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:24,708
Sir, at this time
I'm not able to discuss

38
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,892
the details with you,
but what I can tell you

39
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,874
is that we have
some very good people

40
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:30,324
working very hard
on this case.

41
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:31,727
I'm sorry, Officer.

42
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:33,146
But that just sounds
like double-talk.

43
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:34,754
We're trying
to protect our children.

44
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,239
You have to level
with us.

45
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,559
Really, we are giving you
all the information

46
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:39,495
we have.

47
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,167
You know what I'd like
to see in this school?

48
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:42,511
Drug-sniffing dogs.

49
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:44,882
Yeah. Yeah, dogs,
and metal detectors,

50
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,018
and locker searches,
and strip searches.

51
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:48,856
Our district
has strict policies-

52
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,561
I heard about
this school up in Canada.

53
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,005
They arrested one of their
groundskeepers with drugs.

54
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,690
And the next day
they found out

55
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,007
over half of the students
were high on LSD.

56
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,932
LSD? When were you gonna
tell us about the LSD?

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,210
No. Please.

58
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:03,508
No one said anything
about LSD.

59
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:05,146
The fact is...

60
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:09,897
What about the equipment
that was stolen?

61
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:13,192
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry department.

62
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,976
Walt?

63
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,440
Yeah.

64
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,264
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

65
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,823
But as he's chair
of the science department,

66
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:32,657
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

67
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:38,074
And I'd like to take
a moment to thank him for that.

68
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:46,734
Could you please
tell us more

69
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,875
about the equipment
that was taken?

70
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,090
- Please.
- Yes.

71
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,379
Um- And thank you.

72
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:03,179
The inventory list
for the missing labware

73
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,253
is as follows:
one 5,000 milliliter

74
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,622
round bottom boiling flask,
one Kjeldahl-style

75
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:14,285
recovery flask,
800 milliliters,

76
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:19,222
two full-face respirators,
some sep funnels,

77
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,385
a sill head with
a thermometer holder-

78
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:33,285
- Ooh. Ooh, my knee. Ow. Okay.
- Okay.

79
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:37,249
where...
did that come from?

80
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,196
And why was it
so - good?

81
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,392
Because it was illegal.

82
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:23,981
The basement.

83
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:25,529
Unfinished, of course.

84
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,248
But just look
at all this space.

85
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:30,647
You gotta think
rec room, media room.

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,882
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

87
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:37,505
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neigorhood.

88
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,913
Big lawns
and shade tress.

89
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,491
Walking distance
to the country club.

90
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:51,127
What happened there?

91
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:56,306
Bit of a fixer, but this house
has great bones.

92
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,466
You know what?
We're zeroing in.

93
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,673
I've got another listing,
brand-new, right around the corner.

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,930
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:06,826
Hi.

96
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,372
Hi.

97
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,864
It's by appointment only.

98
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:12,923
Oh, I'm- I'm here
to see the owner.

99
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,087
He's in the, um...

100
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,065
recreational vehicle.

101
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,733
Yo, it's appointment only!

102
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,907
How you feeling?

103
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,569
About as good
as you look.

104
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:50,452
Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

105
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,338
Listen, I-
I visited you in the hospital,

106
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,934
but you were asleep.

107
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,478
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

108
00:05:57,785 --> 00:06:00,785
Acting like you were
all out for blood.

109
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:04,805
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

110
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:07,118
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

111
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,502
So what, are you
selling your house?

112
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,356
I got two dudes
that turned into

113
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,930
raspberry slushie
and flushed down my toilet.

114
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,428
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

115
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:19,361
The whole - house
has got to be haunted by now.

116
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,665
You didn't actually
go see Tuco?

117
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,387
Here.

118
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,989
That is seventeen-five.

119
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,177
Your half of the 35,000.

120
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:35,124
Plus there's
an extra 15 in there.

121
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,632
It's all yours.

122
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,193
You've earned it.

123
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,908
You got this money
from Tuco.

124
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:41,031
Yeah.

125
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,497
So Tuco gave you this
is what you're saying.

126
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:44,858
We made a deal.

127
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,947
You made a deal?

128
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,364
That's right.

129
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:49,943
Wait. How-
Why would you make

130
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,671
a deal with that scumbag?

131
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,219
You see
what he did to me?

132
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:56,070
Because I think that
we can do business together.

133
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:58,052
We came to
an understanding.

134
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,613
No way, man! Okay?
No understanding.

135
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,548
Take a look at
the money in your hand.

136
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,381
Now just imagine
making that every week.

137
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:07,946
That's right.

138
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:11,178
Two pounds a week.
35,000 a pound.

139
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,809
Without even talking to me,
you- you told... this...

140
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:19,833
insane - clown
dead-eyed killer

141
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:21,374
that, uh...

142
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:24,151
that we would
- we would give him two pounds a week?

143
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,631
We'll just scale up
our operation.

144
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,553
We'll add
a few more hours-

145
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,988
No, don't talk
to me about hours.

146
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:29,445
What about pseudo, man?

147
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,420
How are we
gonna get that?

148
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:35,060
You think the meth fairy
is just gonna bring it to us?

149
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:38,142
It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

150
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,398
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces.

151
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,441
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs-

152
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:44,325
Smurfs?

153
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,676
Dudes who go
to the drugstores

154
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,015
and get a couple boxes
at a time and then sell them to me.

155
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:51,341
And that's maybe
only good for,

156
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:53,010
like, maybe
a half-pound worth.

157
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,065
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

158
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,158
All right.

159
00:07:58,253 --> 00:07:59,374
Of course you would
have known that

160
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,846
if you would have
just asked me.

161
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,241
Well, here we are again.

162
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,162
Here we are.

163
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:09,764
Skyler, you look great.
Thank you.

164
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,574
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

165
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,480
How goes it?

166
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,948
It's great...

167
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:18,860
other than waddling to the bathroom
every five minutes.

168
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,838
The baby shower's
next week.

169
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,506
It'll be good to-
You know, it'll be good

170
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:27,752
to have a day that's...
just about Skyler.

171
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:31,260
Very nice.
Thank you.

172
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,454
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

173
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,528
Mmm, yeah.

174
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:37,333
How do you feel?

175
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:38,620
Oh, okay.

176
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,971
Uh, you know,
pretty decent actually.

177
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,476
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

178
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:48,193
And he's even more, um...

179
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,402
physical.

180
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:51,874
More physical?

181
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,880
Uh, well... sexual.

182
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:59,434
frisky, actually.

183
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,689
I mean, that's got
to be a good sign, right?

184
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,272
Sure, I'll take that.

185
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:04,373
Right, Walt?

186
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:07,673
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

187
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,639
Realistically,
it may just mean

188
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,853
that we've got
the anti-emetics tuned right.

189
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,053
Truth is,
until Walt's finished

190
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:15,443
this round of chemo
and we look

191
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,438
at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

192
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,595
Isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

193
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,866
I've been wondering
about...

194
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:24,554
alternative medicine.

195
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,256
I mean, Eastern healing.

196
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,940
You know, holistic.

197
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,321
Well, I can't speak
to its efficacy.

198
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:35,366
But as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

199
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:38,561
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

200
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:41,825
a better comfort,
is fine by me.

201
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,516
So you're saying
it's all psychological.

202
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:49,407
It doesn't make
any real difference.

203
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,101
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

204
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:57,142
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

205
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,613
What?

206
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,258
A junkyard?

207
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:28,062
Let me guess, you-
you picked this place?

208
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,321
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

209
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,101
This is- This is like a...

210
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,979
a non-criminal's idea
of a drug meet.

211
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,249
This is like,
"Oh, I saw this in a movie.

212
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,247
Ooh, look at me. "
Yeah, so-

213
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:42,667
So where do you transact
your business?

214
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,228
Enlighten me.

215
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,799
I don't know.
How about Taco Cabeza?

216
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,813
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

217
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,901
Nice and public.

218
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,451
Open 24 hours.

219
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:57,470
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

220
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,653
Hell, why not
the mall?

221
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,074
You know,
wait at the Gap.

222
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,956
"Hey! It's time
for the meet. "

223
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,848
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

224
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,325
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

225
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,775
Skip the part
where psycho lunatic Tuco,

226
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,439
you know,
comes and steals my drugs

227
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,706
and leaves me
bleeding to death.

228
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,636
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

229
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:32,310
Okay?
I mean, seriously.

230
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:34,273
I'm okay.

231
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:37,455
Nah, I'm no -.

232
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,524
I'm good.

233
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,993
Mr. Clean and his boy.

234
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,174
I'm sorry that I had
to tune you up.

235
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:08,919
Respect,ese.
You gotta give it to get it.

236
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:14,659
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

237
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:17,655
What, they close
the mall or something?

238
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:21,429
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

239
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:27,170
That's it?
That's all you got?

240
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,385
We had some
production problems.

241
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,944
Point five-three.

242
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,203
I thought you was
a player.

243
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,536
You told me two pounds,
and now you waste my time

244
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:41,022
with these Chiclets?

245
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,691
171/2...

246
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,715
minus the half
for wasting my time.

247
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:57,689
Hey, come on.

248
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:01,383
What, you're gonna argue?
You got something to say?

249
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:07,407
You're doing business
like a couple little -.

250
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,246
I want all of it.

251
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,595
70 grand.

252
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:15,998
What did you say?

253
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,482
You like this product,
and you want more.

254
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,662
Consider it
a capital investment.

255
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:27,729
Loco bald -.

256
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,469
521/2.

257
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,176
25 points vig.

258
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,109
Vig?

259
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:40,866
Interest. Weekly.

260
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,733
Okay.

261
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:51,149
That's... $65,625
with interest.

262
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,397
1.875 pounds.

263
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:56,723
No, 2 pounds.
Next Friday.

264
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:59,417
And no production problems.

265
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:04,378
Can you handle 4 pounds?

266
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:10,275
Listen, old man.
Talk is talk.

267
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:13,021
But owing me money...

268
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:15,684
that's bad.

269
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:40,614
What did you just do?

270
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,407
4 pounds.

271
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:47,423
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds
wasn't bad enough.

272
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:52,103
We're talking 200-300
boxes of sinus pills.

273
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,475
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

274
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,690
We're not going to need
pseudo ephedrine.

275
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,418
We're going
to make phenylacetone

276
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,681
in a tube furnace,
then we're going to use

277
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:04,967
reductive amination to yield methamphetamine
- 4 pounds.

278
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,152
So no pseudo?
No pseudo.

279
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,964
So you do have a plan.

280
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,232
Yeah, Mr. White!

281
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:13,289
Yeah, science!

282
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,559
Okay.

283
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:19,821
What's this?

284
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:21,972
That is a shopping list.

285
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:26,567
Uh, getting some of those items
may be challenging.

286
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:31,570
"One autotransformer,
"6 liters an- hy-

287
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:34,222
hydrous methyl-
"methylamine,

288
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:37,198
two 35
M&M tube furnaces- "

289
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,756
That's MM: millimeter.

290
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,676
One 70-millimeter
would be fine,

291
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,291
but they're
hard to come by, so-

292
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,654
"40 grams thorium nitrate"?

293
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,369
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this -.

294
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:48,213
You know what?

295
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,550
Count me out, all right?
I'm leaving town.

296
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,548
I'm moving to, like,
Oregon or something-

297
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:54,483
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse,
listen to me.

298
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:59,161
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

299
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,554
What are you doing?

300
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,195
This is the first day
of the rest of your life,

301
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,278
but what kind of life
will it be, huh?

302
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,294
Will be be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no,

303
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:12,922
I can't do this," of never once
believing in yourself?

304
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:16,134
I don't know.
Listen.

305
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:17,314
These things?

306
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,089
We need them.

307
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,721
Hmm? And only you
can get them for us.

308
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:31,799
Okay, it's ready.
There you go.

309
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:36,623
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

310
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:38,586
Now, of course
you already know that

311
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,573
because when you watch this
20 years from now,

312
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:43,360
I will look exactly
the same as I do now.

313
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,215
I know it is amazing.

314
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:48,947
I have aged shockingly well,
haven't I?

315
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:52,924
Anyway, welcome
to your baby shower,

316
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,030
Esmeralda!

317
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,484
Esmeralda?

318
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:58,088
Esmeralda.

319
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,206
That's your name,
and you heard it here first.

320
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:04,900
Now, that is your wonderful,
handsome older brother.

321
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,051
Show her, older brother,
your face.

322
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,098
Okay. Not right up the nose.

323
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:13,450
Don't- Okay, not-
Back- Back to me.

324
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:16,276
There's your mommy!

325
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,555
Hello, Mommy!

326
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:19,493
And look!

327
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,624
There you are,
Esmeralda!

328
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,465
Wake up, baby!

329
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,511
Time to party!

330
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,317
Easy, easy.

331
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,922
Uh, believe it or not,
Esmeralda,

332
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:34,104
right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

333
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,548
And I believe, Hank,
that that was

334
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:38,646
around the time that we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

335
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,705
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,206
I dropped her off
at the curb.

337
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:44,025
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

338
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:50,642
There's Daddy!
Speak, Daddy!

339
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:52,531
Say hello
to your daughter.

340
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:03,921
Holly, I am very proud of you,
and I- I think about you

341
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:05,042
all the time.

342
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:14,123
Uh, wherever you go,
whatever you do in life,

343
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,940
uh, always know
that you have a family

344
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,872
who loves you very, very much.

345
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,370
Cheers.

346
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,604
Cheers!

347
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,758
Cheers.

348
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,672
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

349
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,375
Oh, Carmen, it's-
Oh, look.

350
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:33,810
Look at that.

351
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,058
It's adorable.

352
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,377
I love it, Carmen.
Thank you.

353
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:38,907
You're so welcome, honey.

354
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:39,875
Thank you.

355
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,592
Look at the little feet.

356
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,823
From me.

357
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:48,725
And Hank.

358
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:51,699
Oh. What nice
wrapping paper.

359
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,485
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

360
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,883
I do.

361
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,254
Okay.

362
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,395
Let's see what this is.

363
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,904
Exciting.

364
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:05,178
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

365
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:13,028
It's-
It's a-

366
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:14,338
a tiara.

367
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,429
Yes!

368
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:21,215
Mar- Marie, is this, um-
White gold

369
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:24,272
and several carats'
worth of zircons.

370
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,723
Oh, Marie, you spent
too much on this.

371
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,079
You shouldn't have.

372
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:30,355
You really, really
shouldn't.

373
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,773
But it's so-
it's really-

374
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,815
It's-
sparkly.

375
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,518
Sparkly! Like wow!

376
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,455
Thank you.

377
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:41,763
Hey, listen, Walt-
Oh!

378
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,996
...you got anything
stronger than beer?

379
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,314
It's just gor-
Oh, it's great.

380
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,530
I- I love it.
Thank you.

381
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:51,463
Thank you, sweetie,
thank you.

382
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:53,523
Sorry, man.

383
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,286
It's just, you know,
after 200 presents,

384
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,595
it just gets kind of old.

385
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,986
- That's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

386
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:09,376
I got, uh, just the thing
to go with that.

387
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,221
I'm sorry, man.
I wasn't thinking.

388
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,457
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

389
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,321
You mind
if I have one?

390
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,160
You think it's a good idea?

391
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,895
Hank, I've already got
lung cancer.

392
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,243
Okay. You got me there.

393
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,987
Thanks.

394
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,167
Cuban.

395
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,008
I did a little favor
for an FBI guy.

396
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,836
Now, I was
under the impression-

397
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:53,038
ahem-
that these were illegal, hmm?

398
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:57,217
Yeah, well,
sometimes forbidden fruit

399
00:20:57,252 --> 00:21:00,045
tastes the sweetest,
doesn't it?

400
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,324
It's funny, isn't it?

401
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:08,617
How we draw that line.

402
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,304
Yeah?

403
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,487
What line is that?

404
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,844
Mm,
well, what's legal,

405
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:19,788
what's illegal,
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

406
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:23,875
You know, if we were
drinking this in 1930,

407
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:26,504
we'd be breaking the law.

408
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:30,039
Another year, we'd be okay.

409
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:34,003
Mm. Who knows what
will be legal next year?

410
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,842
You mean like pot?

411
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,941
Yeah. Like pot.

412
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,875
Or...

413
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,764
whatever.

414
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,384
Cocaine? Heroin?

415
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:54,126
I'm just saying
it's arbitrary.

416
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:56,830
Well,
you ought to visit lockup.

417
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,494
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

418
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,451
"Hey, man, why'd you bust me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

419
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:05,121
"It's all
gonna be legal next year

420
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,414
when Willie Nelson's
president. "

421
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,861
- , buddy,
it doesn't only go one way, either.

422
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,466
Sometimes there's stuff
that's legal that shouldn't be.

423
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:20,025
I mean, friggin' meth
used to be legal.

424
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,421
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

425
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:27,839
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one, huh?

426
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,085
Yeah.

427
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,177
It was a nice party.

428
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,773
A tiara.

429
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:57,328
A white gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

430
00:22:58,164 --> 00:22:59,512
Yeah.

431
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,446
You know,
I think she got that

432
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:03,578
at Gertrude Zachary's
in Nob Hill.

433
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:05,108
I mean, that thing
must have cost,

434
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,912
like, what, $500 or $600.

435
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,950
You know what? I think
I'm going to return it.

436
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:16,548
You sure?

437
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,606
She's bound to find out.

438
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,572
Well, maybe I can
explain to her

439
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:24,159
that we need a Diaper Genie
more than a white gold

440
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:26,885
baby tiara.

441
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:31,409
Hey. You know,
I've been thinking

442
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,177
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
about alternative medicine.

443
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,291
No, no. Don't worry.

444
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:37,418
I'm not going
to mention that anymore.

445
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,263
No, no, no, no.

446
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,087
What I mean
is that maybe there is

447
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,566
something to it.

448
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,918
Uh, here. Look.

449
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:47,782
They do this
Navajo sweat lodge

450
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,992
up by Farmington.

451
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:52,095
Healing ceremony.

452
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:54,154
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

453
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,894
I'm not saying
that I believe in it,

454
00:23:55,983 --> 00:24:01,938
but, uh, you know,
it might be an experience.

455
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:03,607
Really?

456
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:05,861
You?

457
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,834
In a sweat lodge?

458
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:10,691
I was thinking about
driving up on Friday,

459
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,799
coming back Sunday-
I mean, if you're okay with it.

460
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,746
Well, of course
I'm okay with that.

461
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:17,656
Okay.

462
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,285
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

463
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:32,232
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

464
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:35,614
Okay.
Right.

465
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:40,806
Ah. 70-millimeter
tube furnace. Excellent.

466
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,747
This is excellent.
Very good work.

467
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:44,932
- straight.
- Okay. Hydrogen.

468
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:46,188
Electrolytically
produced, yes?

469
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:47,480
Yeah, like you asked.

470
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,955
I mean, this- this crap
wasn't easy to get.

471
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:51,423
It was expensive.

472
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,343
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

473
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,874
I don't see the methylamine.

474
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,255
Yeah, well, that's
where I ran into, uh,

475
00:24:58,336 --> 00:24:59,690
some trouble.

476
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:01,501
What kind of trouble?

477
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:04,057
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

478
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,742
but this methylamine...

479
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,695
not so easy.

480
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,672
I mean, they got it
locked down tight.

481
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:14,166
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

482
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,870
But they want 10 grand.

483
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,305
So what's the problem?
You have the money.

484
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:22,029
No, had. I already spent
almost the whole wad.

485
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,654
I mean, I got,
like, 2 grand left.

486
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,240
I told you,
all this crap was expensive.

487
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:29,142
So these thieves, did they-
did they say where they

488
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,642
would be stealing it from?

489
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:33,417
Yeah, a chemical supply
place south of town.

490
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,694
They got guards
and security cameras,

491
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,525
big - steel doors.

492
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:41,062
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

493
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,137
What?

494
00:25:56,442 --> 00:26:00,562
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

495
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:03,450
Yeah?

496
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,927
How are we
going to do that?

497
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:09,173
With this.

498
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:24,684
So, uh, what's this
stuff called again?

499
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:29,190
Thermite.

500
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:31,549
And that will
cut through a lock?

501
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:34,680
Because this is supposed to be
one big - lock.

502
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:38,161
In World War II,
the Germans

503
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:40,016
had an artillery piece-
it's the biggest

504
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,462
in the world-
called the Gustav Gun,

505
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:46,257
and it weighed
a thousand tons.

506
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:50,362
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

507
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:55,490
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

508
00:26:56,644 --> 00:27:00,641
I mean, you could drop bombs
on it every day for a month

509
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,291
without ever disabling it.

510
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:08,251
But you drop
a commando, one man,

511
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:11,311
with just a bag of this...

512
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,966
and he could melt
right through 4 inches

513
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:19,498
of solid steel
and destroy that gun forever.

514
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:23,976
Jeez!

515
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,030
So yes.

516
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,777
I think it will cut
through any lock

517
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,292
we're likely to find.

518
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,102
You'd like to return this?

519
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:39,347
It's very nice, but yes.

520
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,730
Well, it- it is
from the store, isn't it?

521
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:44,464
Oh, yes.
It's from this store.

522
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:46,116
Do you happen
to have a receipt?

523
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:49,986
Oh, no. I don't.
It was a gift.

524
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,592
Aha. A gift.

525
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:55,060
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

526
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,473
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you
to watch this lady

527
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:00,730
while I phone the police.

528
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,249
Whoa. Excuse me?

529
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,769
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

530
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:08,364
It-
Come with me, please.

531
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:14,209
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

532
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:17,600
Please do.

533
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:20,638
We'll be here.

534
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,911
Look, I-
I've never stolen

535
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:26,129
anything in my life,
all right?

536
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:27,659
I told you.

537
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,795
That tiara was a gift-
a- a baby shower gift.

538
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:34,241
So who gave it to you,
then?

539
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,194
I don't think
I have to tell you that.

540
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:38,921
Ma'am, you don't have
to tell me anything.

541
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,892
You can talk to the police,
and I can tell them

542
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:44,087
how my daughter-in-law
remembers showing

543
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,071
this particular item
to a tall blonde woman who,

544
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:50,500
when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

545
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:51,461
So there.

546
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:52,929
Oh, yeah?

547
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:56,080
Well, then I can talk
to the Channel 3 News.

548
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:59,262
Yeah. I can tell them
how you people,

549
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:01,485
without a shred,
without a modicum

550
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:03,693
of evidence,
illegally detained

551
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:08,092
an innocent pregnant woman
in a dank storeroom.

552
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:09,731
This is my office.

553
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:12,180
I feel I'm being
held hostage.

554
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,905
Furthermore- I'm not getting
enough air back here.

555
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:19,167
I don't
think I can breathe.

556
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:20,966
Ohh- Oh, my God.

557
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:22,008
Oh, no.

558
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,316
I'm going into labor.

559
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:26,734
Yes, I- - Oh!

560
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:38,362
Hi. You've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

561
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:40,096
Marie? It's Skyler.

562
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,773
I just left Zachary's.

563
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:44,736
I need to talk to you
immediately.

564
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:50,058
Where's the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

565
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,118
You think
he already passed?

566
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,710
I don't know.

567
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,771
There he is.

568
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,560
Okay, see him?

569
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:58,734
Wait till he passes.

570
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,367
Let's go, let's go.

571
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,497
What the hell is this?

572
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,915
It's all they had.

573
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,440
Then you go to another store.

574
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,096
If this is all they had,
you're in the wrong place.

575
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,497
Just put it on.

576
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:21,179
Of course you can-
Okay, come on.

577
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:28,969
Okay.

578
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,356
This is it.

579
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:34,593
Oh, God.

580
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:49,585
All right.

581
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:53,939
D- Where- Duck. Duck.
What?

582
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:56,750
He's not supposed
to come back.

583
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:58,689
What's he doing?

584
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:00,730
Oh, God.

585
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,815
He's going to the crapper.

586
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,854
Oh, God.
Carry your bag.

587
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:10,178
What? What are you doing?

588
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:44,877
Ok, there is it.

589
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,351
Is this
going to be loud?

590
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,800
We'll find out
in about ten seconds.

591
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:53,991
Stand back.

592
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:58,213
Jesus!

593
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,640
Hey, what's going on?

594
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:20,882
Where are the gallon jugs?

595
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,578
I don't know.

596
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:24,482
God!
What?

597
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:28,028
Let's just take this.
Come on. Come on.

598
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,834
What the hell are you doing
opening the door?

599
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,507
How are we going to
take this thing out?

600
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:22,045
How is it going
to be any different?

601
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:23,981
- Can I just try it?
- Fine, fine, go ahead.

602
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,623
- . Okay.

603
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,493
All right.

604
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:36,960
All right. Here we go.
Yeah, baby. See?

605
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,301
Eat it, okay? I'm the king.

606
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:39,665
I'm the king.

607
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:45,726
Oh, no. No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

608
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,495
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

609
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,429
We're not cooking
in my - driveway.

610
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:57,396
I tell you that.

611
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:07,119
What part of slow it down
did you not understand?

612
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,501
You talk too much.
It's heavy, man.

613
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:11,128
You got to wait for me.

614
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:13,421
Okay. All right.

615
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:15,973
That's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up.

616
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:17,121
Bring it up.

617
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:18,636
Easy, easy, easy.

618
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:20,378
Okay.

619
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,946
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

620
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,632
Aw, -.

621
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:27,942
Yo, I don't know.

622
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:30,124
I'll make - sure
she doesn't.

623
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:35,647
Yeah.
Good call, yo.

624
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:40,358
All right.

625
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,920
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

626
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:14,431
We'll need to run it
two more hours

627
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:16,903
to have enough
to make 41/2 pounds.

628
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:19,274
41/2? Not 4?

629
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:21,730
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

630
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,061
41/2 pounds puts us
$44,000 ahead each.

631
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:29,619
Right on, man.

632
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:31,868
Right on.

633
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,624
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

634
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,275
we could make
41/2 pounds a week for...

635
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,928
well, for the foreseeable
future.

636
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,937
How long is, uh,
that going to be?

637
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:48,383
I mean in your, uh,
situation.

638
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,318
How much
cash do you need?

639
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:54,751
More.

640
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,115
Someone's in my yard.

641
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,896
Was there, by any chance,
scheduled for this afternoon

642
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:33,708
an open house?

643
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:36,449
I left them a message, man.
It's not my fault.

644
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,921
I don't care how you do it.
Just keep them out of here.

645
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:39,884
Do you understand?

646
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:41,937
Go.

647
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,080
You know you can't
duck me forever.

648
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:14,464
What?

649
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:16,985
Come on. I left you,
like, 15 messages.

650
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:18,294
When I
went to your office,

651
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:19,488
you snuck out
the back way.

652
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:22,859
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

653
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,107
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

654
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:29,323
Look, Marie, Marie,
I have never been so humiliated in my life.

655
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,782
That-
ahem-

656
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:34,590
that tiara.

657
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,383
They accused me at Zachary's
of shoplifting it.

658
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:42,092
What were you doing
at Zachary's?

659
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:45,049
I was returning it.

660
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,838
You were returning it.

661
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,149
Why would you return it?

662
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:53,454
It just wasn't-
Marie,

663
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:55,493
what is wrong with you?

664
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:56,854
Can you
please tell me that?

665
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:59,909
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

666
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,998
What does that mean?

667
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:07,100
Does that mean
you don't know?

668
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:11,812
That means
that I have no idea

669
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,816
what the hell
you're even talking about.

670
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,885
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

671
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:20,661
The shop-
The shoplifting.

672
00:38:21,223 --> 00:38:22,783
No idea?

673
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:27,712
You're not going
to admit this, are you?

674
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:32,374
I can't
really admit to something

675
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:36,461
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

676
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:57,708
Don't forget to sign in.

677
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,025
Thank you.
Thank you.

678
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,364
Excuse me. I'd just like
to see the basement.

679
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,845
Yeah,
well, it's occupied.

680
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,157
It's not a bathroom.

681
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:31,122
Hey! I just want
to see the basement.

682
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,608
What's the big deal?

683
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:35,997
Yo, you ain't seeing
the basement, -. You got that?

684
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,206
Is that sinking in?

685
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:40,470
Now beat it. All of you all.
House is not for sale.

686
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:42,565
Get the hell out!

687
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:29,128
So how was it?

688
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,703
Was it a...

689
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:33,103
an experience?

690
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:34,995
Yeah.

691
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:37,158
It was definitely
an experience.

692
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:45,924
What's that smell?

693
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,140
Oh. Yeah.

694
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:49,904
It's...

695
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,872
sacred Navajo herbs
and...

696
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:09,979
Hey,
is everything okay?

697
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:14,005
No. Not really.

698
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,707
Actually, not at all.

699
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:24,226
You know that, uh, tiara
that Marie gave us?

700
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:25,364
Yeah.

701
00:41:25,454 --> 00:41:28,233
Well, she stole it.

702
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,873
Yeah.

703
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:33,806
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

704
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,660
Oh, my God.

705
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:39,496
She refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

706
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,428
I don't know
what to do.

707
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:48,607
Oh, well.

708
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:52,725
People sometimes do things
for their families.

709
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:57,890
People sometimes do things
for their families?

710
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:01,086
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

711
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,663
Yeah.

712
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,096
Wow. That must have
been some sweat lodge.

713
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:13,253
Have you been listening
to the words coming out of your mouth?

714
00:42:15,877 --> 00:42:18,765
What would you do
if it were me?

715
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:22,506
Wh- What do you mean
if it were you?

716
00:42:23,598 --> 00:42:25,578
Well, if it were me,
what would you do?

717
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:27,576
Would you divorce me?

718
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:30,850
Would you turn me in
to the police?

719
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,331
You don't want to find out.

720
00:42:54,286 --> 00:42:56,482
Do you want
something to eat?

721
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:02,097
Uh, no, thanks.

722
00:43:18,234 --> 00:43:21,676
What is this -?
This is blue.

723
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,081
We used a different
chemical process,

724
00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:26,262
but it is every bit
as pure.

725
00:43:26,948 --> 00:43:29,647
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

726
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:39,428
Tight! Tight, tight, yeah!

727
00:43:40,895 --> 00:43:42,222
Oh, blue, yellow, pink.

728
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,765
Whatever, man. Just keep
bringing me that.

729
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:57,013
4.6.

730
00:43:57,993 --> 00:43:59,825
Uh, come on.

731
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:03,865
And what did I say, man?
This guy can cook!

732
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,623
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

733
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:08,789
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

734
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:12,459
Just rember
who you're working for.

735
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:16,765
What did you say?

736
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,115
I'm just saying
they got to know

737
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,944
that they're
working for you.

738
00:44:21,043 --> 00:44:23,609
Like they don't
already know that?

739
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:26,401
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

740
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:30,534
No, I'm just-
I'm just saying.

741
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:33,269
Oh, yeah. So you're not
saying that they're stupid.

742
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:34,765
So I don't understand.

743
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:36,251
Are you saying
that I'm stupid?

744
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:37,717
No. Come on, Tuco.

745
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:39,259
I'm just-
I'm just saying.

746
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:41,037
No, you're just
speaking for me!

747
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:45,288
Like I ain't got the - sense
to speak for myself!

748
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:48,976
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

749
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:53,003
Tuco.

750
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:57,917
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

751
00:45:04,957 --> 00:45:08,074
Heisenberg says relax.

752
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:12,020
Orale,homes.

753
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,409
I'm relaxed.

754
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,977
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.

755
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:37,042
- , man!
Look at that! Look!

756
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:42,438
Yeah. That's messed up.

757
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:45,747
Okay, Heisenberg!

758
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:48,001
Next week.
