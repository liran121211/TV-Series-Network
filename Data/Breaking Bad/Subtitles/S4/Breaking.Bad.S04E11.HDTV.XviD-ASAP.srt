You can get the fuck out
of here and never come back.

00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:08,476
From whom did you think
that you got that 600,000?

4
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:09,922
- That was you?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,554
My brother in law will
in the near future

6
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:14,361
take a ride out to a
certain distribution center.

7
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:30,065
Get us out of here, kid.

Hey!

17
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,938
What about him?

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,941
What about him?

19
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:28,759
Hey, come on.

20
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:30,528

40.23 pounds.

26
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:17,878
Are they back yet?

27
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,048
Have you heard from anyone?

28
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:25,320
If Pinkman is gone, I'm done.

29
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:28,057
Do you understand?
I quit.

30
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:41,039
I just told you.
40.3 pounds.

31
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,680
40.21.

32
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,307
Look, uh,
my brother-in-law--

33
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:15,011
he keeps talking about driving
out to the factory farm,

34
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,145
and I have--

35
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,749
I have stalled him
as long as I possibly can,

36
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,751
but it's really
at the point now

37
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,688
where he's just gonna find someone
else to take him out there.

38
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,425
So I-I don't know if it's
been made presentable yet,

39
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,229
but I should be the one
to take him out there, right?

40
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,971
Can you just run it up
the chain of command, then?

41
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,119
Anything suspicious?

42
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,490
Still no, Walt.

43
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,863
Well, then, should we go?

44
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,100
You got someplace to be?
'Cause that's, like,

45
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,369
the third time
you've asked me that.

46
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:14,005
No. I'm just curious

47
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,706
what the next move is.

48
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:18,710
Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

49
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:20,245
This here's the job, buddy.

50
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,181
You know,

51
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,750
supermodels and speedboats,
you know?

52
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:33,193
Any, uh, cartel news
these days?

53
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,195
Seems like I'm always

54
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,299
reading something or other
in the paper.

55
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,302
Yeah, well, not a lot
happening Stateside.

56
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:45,107
I'm hearing rumblings about
some big play down south.

57
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:48,076
Lots of bodies, apparently,

58
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,313
even by cartel standards.

59
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:54,649
We'll know more when
the buzzards leave the bones.

60
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:03,224
So when are we gonna
talk about your face?

61
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,530
I don't wanna
get into it, okay?

62
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:10,031
No, it's not okay.

63
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:13,134
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho,

64
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,370
and he thinks we're not
gonna discuss it?

65
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:18,540
You know, buddy, if you're in
over your head on something,

66
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:21,510
don't you think I might be
the guy to come to?

67
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:26,648
You know, one of my
old buddies from Glynco--

68
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:28,650
he had a gambling problem,

69
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,653
but his thing was scratch cards

70
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:33,989
instead of blackjack.

71
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,125
Dumb Okie bastard.

72
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,595
Had his car repo'd
playing scratch-n-wins.

73
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:46,037
He's fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

74
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:50,575
But I know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

75
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,614
I'm just saying I'm here,
you know,

76
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,618
if you want to talk about it.

77
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:02,523
I don't want to talk about it

78
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:05,293
to you or to anyone else.

79
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:08,029
I'm done explaining myself.

80
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,590
Hey, uh-- Yo.

81
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,359
You think he needs
some more blood?

82
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,327
It's in the refrigerator.

83
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,831
What, you--
you want me to, uh...

84
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,180
A-negative, yes?

85
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,515
Your blood type?

86
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,552
Um, I don't know.
Maybe.

87
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,489
A-negative,

88
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,158
25 years old,

89
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,659
70 kilo,

90
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,560
180 centimeters.

91
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,829
You smoke, you drink,

92
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:20,265
you, uh, puff, puff, puff.

93
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,766
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

94
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,168
But no disease, no condition,

95
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,169
no complication

96
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,204
other than an allergy to...

97
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,739
Wait. Don't say.

98
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,409
Erythromycin.

99
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:36,713
But I have cefazolin in here,
so no problem.

100
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,749
How do you know all that?

101
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:46,991
Jesus.

102
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,160
He thought of everything.

103
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,136
O-negative.

104
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,838
That's what he needs.

105
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,947
It's time to go.

106
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,749
What about Mike?

107
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:12,720
With his injury?
No. No travel.

108
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,087
At least a week.

109
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,258
I'll send for him.

110
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:40,147
<i>- Gracias.</i>
<i>- De nada, amigo.</i>

111
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,649
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

112
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,752
Water and rest.

113
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,153
<i>Sí.</i>

114
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,406
<i>Vámonos.</i>

115
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,952
What happened to the plane?

116
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,657
There are many good ways south.

117
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:25,627
Unfortunately,
only one way north.

118
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,632
Six miles to Texas.

119
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,033
I've got a man there

120
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:34,602
who will drive us
the rest of the way.

121
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,974
I kind of liked the plane.

122
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,378
You gonna make it?

123
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:46,480
Six miles is pretty far.

124
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:48,782
I'll make it.

125
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,286
You did well down here.

126
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,421
And you also proved a point.

127
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,059
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

128
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,028
Don't you?

129
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,636
Let Mr. White go.

130
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:17,507
Pay him off or fire him.

131
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,542
Don't kill him.

132
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:24,481
You know that won't work.

133
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,917
Then you've got a problem.

134
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,433
Hi. We're home!

135
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:52,806
You doing your homework?

136
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,007
Yeah.

137
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,508
Uh-huh.

138
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:58,846
Well, dinner is in about 30.

139
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,653
<i>Hey.
Sorry to</i> <i>call you at home,</i>

140
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:07,756
<i>but I think maybe you're not</i>
<i>getting my messages.</i>

141
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,427
<i>That, or you just don't</i>
<i>feel like talking to me.</i>

142
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:13,029
<i>Anyway, why I've been calling</i>

143
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:15,164
<i>is because that thing</i>
<i>we discussed?</i>

144
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,701
<i>Well, I've been thinking,</i>
<i>and, uh,</i>

145
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,937
<i>I decided I can't do it.</i>

146
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:22,938
<i>I know that's probably</i>
<i>not what you wanted to hear,</i>

147
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:24,474
<i>but hopefully</i>
<i>you'll understand,</i>

148
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,543
<i>and if you wanted</i>
<i>to talk some more about it,</i>

149
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,044
<i>that's fine.</i>

150
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,513
<i>So call me. I'm around.</i>

151
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:46,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

152
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,230
Come on in.

153
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:58,307
First, I want to tell you
that I get it.

154
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,310
From what you've told me,

155
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,512
this situation
with Walt's gambling

156
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:06,683
sounds...intense.

157
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:11,288
Yeah, it definitely was

158
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,325
and continues to be.

159
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:19,062
So I would
greatly appreciate it

160
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:23,401
if you would just
help me out here.

161
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,937
Well, I have thought
long and hard about this,

162
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,140
and, uh...

163
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,075
here's what I want to do.

164
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,249
So is, uh, Walt gonna be okay?

165
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,917
Are you in contact with him?

166
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,918
Um, he's fine.

167
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:45,420
Good. That's good.

168
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,024
He doesn't know
about you offering, uh--

169
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,526
No, absolutely not,

170
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,096
and I mean
to keep it that way, so...

171
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:59,868
$617,000

172
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:02,203
written out to me.

173
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:06,874
Uh, what is this?

174
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:09,209
- I can't take your money.
- Oh?

175
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,711
And why is that?

176
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,713
Because at the end of the day,

177
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:17,151
paying my debt with
illicit gambling winnings...

178
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,454
I don't know.
It feels wrong.

179
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,456
It feels wrong?

180
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,391
- To me, it does.
- Uh-huh.

181
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:25,893
I'm not judging you or Walt.

182
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:29,396
I'm just saying I feel
uncomfortable with it.

183
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,198
Well, um, Ted,

184
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,200
the whole reason
we're in this mess

185
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:36,203
is because you had me
cooking your books.

186
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:38,973
So when did wrong

187
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,975
suddenly become
a problem for you?

188
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,645
Now, hold on.
That was a one-time measure.

189
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,648
I took an honest attempt
to protect my employees

190
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:48,650
and save my dad's company.

191
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:50,652
And it might've been a mistake,

192
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,920
but that's no reason
to go out and make another.

193
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:56,257
No, Ted. This is
the big mistake right here.

194
00:14:56,291 --> 00:15:01,295
You owe the federal government
$617,000.

195
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,631
If you do not pay them,
they will come after you,

196
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:06,067
and then they will
come after me.

197
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,102
And if they audit my business,

198
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:11,338
find out that Walt and I
paid for it

199
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,441
with close to a million dollars

200
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,376
in untaxed gambling winnings,

201
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,011
we will go to prison,

202
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,879
where you will already be.

203
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,381
Do you understand?

204
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,116
I understand you're upset,

205
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,452
but I think you're
overstating things, too.

206
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:25,786
No one's going to prison.

207
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:29,056
Oh, my God. How are you
not following me here?

208
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,058
Okay. Fine.

209
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:34,027
Let's say I take your advice.

210
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,864
I pay the IRS.
Then what?

211
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:39,399
Then you don't owe them.

212
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:42,602
Okay. But I still
owe the bank, Skyler.

213
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,604
I'm still gonna go bankrupt.

214
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:46,606
I'll lose my business
and my home.

215
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,175
I still have to pull
my girls out of school.

216
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,176
Just because I pay
some stupid fine

217
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:54,146
doesn't make my life
any less ruined.

218
00:15:56,283 --> 00:16:01,253
So, if I'm understanding
you correctly,

219
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:05,857
you're saying you can't
take the money I gave you,

220
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:08,659
but you can take
a larger amount.

221
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,327
No.

222
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,095
I'm just saying,

223
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,831
as much as I appreciate
the gesture,

224
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:18,101
the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

225
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,772
- Because it's not enough?
- No. No.

226
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,607
Don't twist my words.

227
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,609
This isn't about amounts.

228
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:28,011
This is about me
doing the right thing.

229
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,115
- Ted, are you blackmailing me?
- What?

230
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,585
No. Blackmailing?

231
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,219
God.

232
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,023
I feel like I'm not
explaining things right.

233
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:42,693
I think you're
explaining it fine.

234
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,499
I notice that, uh,

235
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,301
this is for...

236
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:54,338
less than what I gave you,
by the way.

237
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:57,341
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

238
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,744
Mmm. And now that you know, you
will, of course, be returning it?

239
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,746
Well, the leases
are pretty ironclad,

240
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:04,248
so I have to see
what's possible.

241
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,951
But, yeah,
I'm gonna do my best.

242
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,921
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

243
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,991
I don't want you
to pay me, Ted.

244
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,727
I want you to pay them.

245
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:16,995
But, Skyl--

246
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,535
Try it again.
Write a new check.

247
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,872
- Skyler--
- Same amount.

248
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:29,007
Only this time,
made payable--

249
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,243
- What happened to us?
- Make it payable

250
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:34,146
to the Internal
Revenue Service.

251
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,284
I can't.

252
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,953
You have to.

253
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,055
Actually, no, I don't.

254
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:44,791
Write it.

255
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:05,845
Saul Goodman, please.

256
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,448
Tell him it's important.

257
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,784
Yeah.

258
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,391
<i>What have I done?</i>

259
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:32,073
Hello, Hector.

260
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,481
All of them, Hector.

261
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,084
Don Eladio,

262
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:18,187
Don Paco, Cesar, Renaldo,

263
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:22,657
Fortuno, Cisco, and Luis,

264
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:25,026
Escalara--

265
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:28,296
all dead.

266
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:32,467
As is your grandson Joaquin.

267
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,542
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

268
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,916
Would you like to see?

269
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,859
This young man.

270
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,329
Do you remember him?

271
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,467
That young man shot Joaquin

272
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,303
to death...

273
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,339
while I made my escape.

274
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:13,413
I believe you have
met him before.

275
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:22,990
It was just you and Joaquin.

276
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:25,927
He was the only family
you had left.

277
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,799
Now the Salamanca name

278
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,369
dies with you.

279
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,910
Will you look at me now?

280
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,349
Look at me, Hector.

281
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,456
Look at me.

282
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,954
Hey, listen, Walt, I really appreciate
you doing this again, you know?

283
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:00,291
I know you guys must have your hands
full with the car wash and all.

284
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:02,126
No. No. No worries.

285
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:04,295
Happy to do it.

286
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,398
Besides, it gives me a chance

287
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,301
to see how you work a case.

288
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:12,636
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

289
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:15,606
Like watching weeds grow, huh?

290
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,077
Nah, this job's
as boring as hell.

291
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,346
Until it's not.

292
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:27,252
So, uh,

293
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:29,587
any more news
on that thing in Mexico?

294
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:32,824
Aah, same old, same old.
Bunch of animals

295
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:36,161
clawing each other's eyes out
over turf.

296
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,563
So you think all the victims

297
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:40,565
were cartel members?

298
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,966
Not in the loop enough to know.

299
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,269
Listen, take a right
at this street here, will you?

300
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:47,873
A right? But, uh, we're going
to the chicken farm.

301
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:49,074
That's straight ahead.

302
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,376
No. Gonna take
a little detour.

303
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:55,346
All right.

304
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:57,548
Yeah, there's this, uh,

305
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,218
industrial laundry
I want to check out.

306
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:01,720
It's not far.

307
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:03,255
Just turn right here.

308
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,127
What, uh--
What-- What laundry?

309
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,829
What about it?

310
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,531
Well, it's owned
by this company--

311
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,032
this Madrigal Electromotive.

312
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,668
It's this big
German conglomerate.

313
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:19,371
Into everything.
Well, it turns out

314
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:23,608
it's the same company that owns
Fring's chicken joints.

315
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,117
Sounds like a real
shot in the dark there.

316
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,318
I mean, you said it yourself.

317
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:36,620
If this--
Madrigal, is it?

318
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:38,890
If it's such
a big conglomerate, then--

319
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:43,294
I mean, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

320
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:45,763
Nah, it just...

321
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:49,433
It just sounds kind of...thin.

322
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,469
Well, look at you. You lose your
hair, you go on a couple stakeouts.

323
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,439
So now you're what, Kojak?

324
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:56,941
I'm just saying.

325
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,845
Now, the chicken farm,
however--

326
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,414
boy, that place seems ripe

327
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:06,817
for some kind of, uh,
clandestine activity.

328
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:09,620
I just-- I just don't want us
to miss anything, you know?

329
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:12,423
Yeah, well, you want to talk
about clandestine activity?

330
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,559
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary

331
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:18,061
that manufactures
this state-of-the-art

332
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:19,563
air filtration system.

333
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,565
And none other
than Gale Boetticher

334
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,567
took delivery
of one of these systems.

335
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,568
Yeah, a chemist
who was in possession

336
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:29,604
of hand-drawn plans
for a meth super-lab,

337
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:33,041
and was visited
by none other that Gus Fring

338
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:36,244
just days before he was
capped in the face, okay?

339
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,179
Shit, this is starting
to feel like a--

340
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:40,915
like <i>Three Days on the Condor,</i>
you know?

341
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,317
Anyway, an industrial laundry
would be one hell of a place

342
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:46,187
to hide a--
hide a meth lab.

343
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,688
There it is right up there.

344
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,924
Just turn in there.

345
00:24:52,694 --> 00:24:55,462
Well, slow down.
You gotta turn there, Walt.

346
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,699
Walt, what are you doing?
You just missed it.

347
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,002
I'm sorry.
It looked like a dirt road.

348
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,937
I thought you meant further up.

349
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,707
Just bang a U-ie
over here.

350
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,173
Mmm. Hits the spot.
Thanks, guys.

351
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,742
I said to Mom, "Ice cream,"

352
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:28,745
but she was like, "It tastes
the same, and it's healthier."

353
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,682
So, sorry. I tried.

354
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:33,685
Frozen yogurt
does taste the same.

355
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:35,086
Tastes exactly the same.

356
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:38,089
Wow. I feel, like, sorry
for your taste buds.

357
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,760
Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.

358
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:43,596
Hey, it's free food.
Free food always tastes good.

359
00:25:43,631 --> 00:25:45,432
Free drinks even better.

360
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:46,867
Hey, hon.

361
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:50,003
Can you handle another visitor?

362
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,838
Ho-ho! Mister Magoo.

363
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,506
Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

364
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,508
Don't run into any walls
or anything, all right?

365
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:58,211
Okay.

366
00:25:58,245 --> 00:25:59,612
Hey, Dad.

367
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,713
Hey, son.

368
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,715
So how you feeling, Hank?

369
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,717
Oh, well, you know.
Kind of feels like

370
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,219
one of those cones
they put on dogs

371
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:08,720
so they don't lick
their own balls.

372
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:11,622
Nice. Thank you.
Stay classy.

373
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,791
Anyway, hanging in there.

374
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:15,793
Glad you stopped by.

375
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:18,763
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry
about all this.

376
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:21,499
That guy--
he just came out of nowhere.

377
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:23,500
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

378
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:25,602
I saw him coming a mile away.

379
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:29,406
Hey, just mark it down
as a brain fart,

380
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:32,343
and be thankful
no one got killed.

381
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:34,345
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

382
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,248
Your Hardy Boys routine
is over.

383
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:39,017
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

384
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:41,453
It's too dangerous.
You hear me?

385
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:43,655
- I'll do it.
- Oh, no, you won't.

386
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:47,158
Marie's right. It was
a bit shortsighted of me.

387
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,160
That's why I caved.

388
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,361
Caved?

389
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,863
I broke down.

390
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,099
I ordered me
a gimp-mobile.

391
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,371
I wish you would
stop calling it that.

392
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,941
What do you mean,
like a handi-van with a lift?

393
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:03,610
Nah, nah.
It's a regular Tahoe.

394
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:05,112
It's got hand controls.

395
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,114
I ordered it.
It should be here in about a week.

396
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:09,116
I don't expect
to be in it long,

397
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,652
but I gotta
get around on my own

398
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,622
and stop being such
a damn burden to everyone.

399
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:20,161
Oh.

400
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,697
Oh. Sorry.

401
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:25,666
Car wash business.

402
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,301
<i>Hey, it's me.
</i> <i>Can you talk?</i>

403
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,803
I can listen.

404
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:32,038
<i>Fair enough.</i>
<i>He doesn't own a gun.</i>

405
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:34,307
At least not one
that he bought legally.

406
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:35,976
Nor does
his home security system

407
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,979
have any kind of panic button
arrangement.

408
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:40,415
So, way I see it,
we're good to go.

409
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:43,251
That is, if this is still
how you want to handle it.

410
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:47,922
Like I said,
I don't want anyone hurt.

411
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,926
All I want is for him
to write a check.

412
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,528
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.

413
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,363
I've got my A-team on it.

414
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,148
Can I help you?

415
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:15,517
Yeah. Thanks.

416
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,653
Whoa, whoa.
You just can't...

417
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:21,924
What's this about?

418
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,859
I'll tell you what
this is about, Mr. Beneke.

419
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:27,062
This is about you and me doing
our best to keep Huell happy.

420
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,064
Huell? Who's Huell?

421
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,432
This is Huell.

422
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,134
Huell, you happy?

423
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,969
Reasonably.

424
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,705
What would make you unhappy?

425
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,574
This little mofo
not doing what he's told.

426
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,709
And if you were
to become unhappy,

427
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:42,078
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care
for that?

428
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,580
I'm gonna say no.

429
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,148
Well, there you have it.

430
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,650
Let's go find your checkbook.

431
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,053
Ready? Here we go.
All right.

432
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,422
We're walking,
we're swinging our feet.

433
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,789
There you go.
Very nice.

434
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:56,458
Beautiful place you have here.
This way.

435
00:28:56,493 --> 00:29:01,630
So, the amount's gonna be
for $617,226--

436
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:04,299
Whoa, whoa. I don't have anywhere
near that kind of money.

437
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,134
Hold that thought.
Forgot to mention

438
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,635
we know exactly,
down to the penny,

439
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,036
how much money's
in your checking account.

440
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,371
Okay? Understand?

441
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:12,907
You still want to say
that stuff from before?

442
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,509
Maybe not. So,

443
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:18,180
$617,226

444
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,650
and 31 cents,

445
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:24,554
made payable to
the Internal Revenue Service.

446
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:27,324
W-What?

447
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,528
Wait.
This is, uh, Skyler's--

448
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,862
Skyler White sent you?

449
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,864
Doesn't matter who sent us.
For right now,

450
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:35,699
all you have to do
is worry about that.

451
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,635
Oh, my God. This is a giant
misunderstanding.

452
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:40,037
Skyler is a dear friend
of mine, all right?

453
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:43,106
Let me call her.
We'll, uh...

454
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,643
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke.

455
00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:48,846
Phone-call time is over.
This is check-writing time.

456
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,848
This is crazy.
Skyler would never do this to me.

457
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,550
Sit down and write!

458
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:58,090
There you go.

459
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:03,896
$617,226

460
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,732
and 31...

461
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,934
Yeah. Right.

462
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:12,573
You got it.

463
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:19,879
Huell, you happy?

464
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:22,515
Huell's happy.

465
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:25,017
All right.

466
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:27,886
Everything else
has been filled out for you.

467
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,855
All's we need

468
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:34,393
is a signature

469
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:36,262
right there.

470
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,036
Great.

471
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,738
Hard part's over.

472
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:46,574
Here's what happens next.

473
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,676
Huell's gonna
hang here with you.

474
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,678
I'm gonna make sure
I get this down to UPS

475
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,346
before 5:00.

476
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:54,715
On the way back, I'm gonna
grab some sandwiches.

477
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,483
The three of us can hang out,

478
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:58,352
play cards or watch TV
or whatever

479
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,554
for the next couple of days
until the check clears.

480
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,558
Painless, right?

481
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,894
Unless you don't have cable,

482
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:07,829
in which case is gonna suck.

483
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:08,964
So...

484
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,845
Does the laundry
have to be dirty?

485
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,651
Nope.

486
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:15,832
Hmm.

487
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,928
Someone cooked here.

488
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:51,466
You've been out of commission
four days.

489
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,036
Think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation

490
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,571
just for you?

491
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,508
Who cooked?
Who was here?

492
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,754
Now, how are you
doing all those backflips?

493
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,422
- Tell me.
<i>- Chico.</i>

494
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,591
Oh. Oh, I'm gonna get you.

495
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,527
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

496
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,131
Jump.

497
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,669
You're just pressing buttons,

498
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,337
and it makes you
do magical stuff.

499
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:27,939
- No.
- Yes.

500
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,407
- Cheater.
- Hey.

501
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,742
Who's winning?

502
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,109
- I--
- Well--

503
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:35,079
- Look at you. Look at--
- Ooh, yeah.

504
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,651
- 101 backflips I did.
- Oh, you.

505
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,486
- Hey, keep it going.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

506
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,421
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Relax, relax.

507
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,356
Oh, you're in trouble.

508
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,325
Mama's in the house.

509
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,128
Jesse.

510
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:55,931
What do you want?
I'm busy.

511
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:58,366
We need to talk.

512
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:00,569
I got nothing
to say to you, man.

513
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:07,643
Jesse, please.
I'm sorry.

514
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,678
Just one minute.
That's all I ask.

515
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,847
Get the hell outta my house.

516
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,584
Come on.
Hey.

517
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:15,919
Just give me one minute!

518
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,921
Let me just
explain myself here.

519
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,523
Okay. Let me--

520
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,757
Shh! Shut up.

521
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,993
All right. All right.
Okay. Okay.

522
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,795
All right. I'm sorry.

523
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,798
I know

524
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,134
that you have been cooking
without me.

525
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,670
That's right.
So what?

526
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,606
"So what"?

527
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,942
Isn't it obvious to you

528
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,944
what Gus is planning?

529
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:42,780
He's going to use you
to replace me.

530
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:45,817
He doesn't think
you need me anymore.

531
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,153
Jesse--

532
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:53,591
Jesse, if you agree
to replace me,

533
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,560
he will kill me.

534
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,363
You brought
your brother-in-law

535
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,897
to our lab.

536
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,832
What the hell's wrong with you?

537
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,834
- That's not my fault. Jesse, please--
- We're through talking.

538
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,168
Just--

539
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,304
You gotta help me.
Please.

540
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:10,306
The last time
I asked for your help,

541
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,941
you said

542
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:14,544
"I hope you end up buried

543
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:17,180
in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

544
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:57,690
You are done.

545
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,427
Fired.

546
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:04,063
Do not show your face
at the laundry again.

547
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,566
Stay away from Pinkman.

548
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,735
Do not go near him.

549
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,205
Ever.

550
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,441
Are you listening to me?

551
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:23,049
Or else you'll do what?

552
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,619
What did you say?

553
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:28,722
Stay away from Pinkman...

554
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:33,461
or else you'll do...

555
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:36,630
what?

556
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:38,665
Kill me?

557
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,104
If you could kill me,

558
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:48,809
I'd already be dead.

559
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:54,581
But you can't.

560
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:57,851
You can't kill me

561
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:01,422
because Jesse
wouldn't cook for you

562
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:04,358
if you did.

563
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,460
That's it, isn't it?

564
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:17,738
No matter how hard you tried
to turn him against me,

565
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:20,808
to screw with his head

566
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:23,911
so that he would hate my guts,

567
00:38:25,814 --> 00:38:27,815
and he still...

568
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:31,018
won't let you do it.

569
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:34,454
For now.

570
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:36,490
But he'll come around.

571
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,062
In the meantime, there's the
matter of your brother-in-law.

572
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:46,701
He is a problem
you promised to resolve.

573
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:48,703
You have failed.

574
00:38:48,738 --> 00:38:53,241
Now it's left to me
to deal with him.

575
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,710
You can't--

576
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:57,979
If you try to interfere,

577
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:02,717
this becomes
a much simpler matter.

578
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,454
I will kill your wife.

579
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:08,724
I will kill your son.

580
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:14,195
I will kill
your infant daughter.

581
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,311
Great.

582
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:06,880
Perfect, you know.
This is just...

583
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:11,317
I told her
you were my A-team.

584
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,820
It was an act of God.

585
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:16,990
Ain't no accounting
for no act of God.

586
00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:19,092
Check's in the mail, at least.

587
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,894
Oh, hello, Mrs. White.

588
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,896
The good news is
the IRS has been paid off.

589
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:25,032
The bad news is...

590
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,066
Jesus!

591
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:30,137
- Well, here goes nothing.
- Hey!

592
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:31,905
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

593
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:32,939
- What the--
- Saul.

594
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,775
How did you hear?

595
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,910
What? H-Hear what?

596
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:39,245
Uh, guys, go, go, go.

597
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,980
Scram. Wh--

598
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,482
- What the hell happened to you?
- Saul-- Saul,

599
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,550
this man that we
spoke of before--

600
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:47,618
this-- this person
that you said

601
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,187
could-- could disappear me,
give me a whole new life--

602
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:52,156
- Yeah.
- And make sure that I'm never found.

603
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:53,792
- Yeah.
- I need him.

604
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,863
Saul, Gus is gonna
murder my whole family.

605
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:00,032
Oh, Christ.

606
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:02,668
I need this man now.

607
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:04,737
Saul! Now, Saul!

608
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:07,474
Yeah, yeah. You understand there's
no coming back from this?

609
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,709
You're gonna get new Socials
and new identities.

610
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:12,645
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

611
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,814
All right.
Yes, yes, I understand.

612
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,883
How are you gonna sell this to that
wife of yours and your teenage son?

613
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:19,351
I have got no choice.

614
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,486
You're wanted by some
pretty scary individuals,

615
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,821
not to mention the law.

616
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,156
You're a high-risk client.

617
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,656
You're gonna need
the deluxe service.

618
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,658
- It's gonna cost you.
- How much?

619
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,994
The last quote I got
on the deluxe was 125 grand.

620
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:32,829
But you got four people
to vanish.

621
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:34,398
It's gonna be
at least half a million.

622
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:36,801
- And he accepts cash only.
- I've got the money. Now come on.

623
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:38,302
- Please!
- Here.

624
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:39,503
Okay.

625
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:43,841
This-- This is a vacuum
cleaner repair company.

626
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,877
What'd you expect,
Haji's Quick-Vanish?

627
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,545
I don't even know
the guy's name.

628
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,580
You just call that number
and you leave a message.

629
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:52,917
You tell them that you
need a new dust filter

630
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,253
for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure-Pro, Model 60.

631
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:58,755
I wrote it right on there.
He'll cal you back in five minutes.

632
00:41:58,789 --> 00:41:59,923
Okay. Okay, fine.

633
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:01,858
How long does it take
for him to arrange?

634
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,926
The guy works fast.
I mean, that's the game here.

635
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,494
You gotta have
your family packed

636
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:07,696
and ready to go
before you make the call.

637
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,197
He'll tell you
where to meet him.

638
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:11,533
He'll put you up in a safe
house until everything is set.

639
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,034
But you gotta bring the money.

640
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,237
He doesn't lift a finger
unless he's paid in full.

641
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:16,939
Okay.

642
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,509
- Saul-- - Can't say it's
been a pleasure, but--

643
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,945
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

644
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:23,680
You need to call the DEA,

645
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:26,650
and you need to tell them
that Gus has a hit out on Hank.

646
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,721
- No, you have to do it for me.
- Buddy, I gotta go on living here.

647
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,324
- I'm way too comfortable in my wingtips--
- Just call anonymous then.

648
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,026
- You call anonymously!
- I can't! I can't!

649
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,362
I'm practically
in the DEA family.

650
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:39,430
I go to their Christmas parties,
for Christ's sake.

651
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:41,632
They know me. They know my voice.
They'll know me.

652
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,567
Please, you gotta do it for me.
I'm begging you.

653
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,103
- Please. Please.
- No.

654
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:49,707
My brother-in-law doesn't
deserve to die because of this.

655
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:53,143
- There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.
- Okay.

656
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:56,413
The best I'll go--
I'll say it's the cartel.

657
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:58,581
They're coming back to finish
the job that they botched.

658
00:42:58,616 --> 00:43:00,283
You say whatever
you have to say.

659
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:02,985
You just give me an hour
to c--

660
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,455
I-- I need to collect
my wife and kids.

661
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,156
Okay?
Just give me an hour,

662
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,658
and then you make
the phone call.

663
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:10,560
Don't forget. Please.

664
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:12,462
Yeah.

665
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:15,732
Thank you, Saul.

666
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,168
No, no, no, no.

667
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:54,204
Where's the rest?

668
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:58,609
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

669
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:03,749
- Walt?
- Down here!

670
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:10,356
Walt, what did
that phone call mean?

671
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:12,392
Where is it?

672
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:16,362
Where's the rest?

673
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:18,998
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

674
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,868
Skyler, where is the money?

675
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,143
I gave it to Ted.

676
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:35,848
What? You-- You did what?

677
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,283
Walt, I'm--

678
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:38,651
I had to.

679
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:40,587
For us, for the family.

680
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:42,890
I swear, Walt.

681
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:44,926
You gave our money to Beneke?

682
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,897
Walt, please, please,
just hear me out.

683
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:49,998
Please!

684
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,975
Walt?

685
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:12,520
Walt?

686
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:20,696
<i>Hi. You've reached</i>
<i>the White family.</i>

687
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,298
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

688
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:29,439
<i>Skyler?</i>

689
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:32,542
It's happening again.

690
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,011
The DEA called.
They got some tip

691
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,380
from an informant that

692
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:39,583
the cartel--
they want to kill Hank!

693
00:45:40,952 --> 00:45:43,520
<i>Oh, God.</i>

694
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:46,256
<i>They're sending agents to--</i>

695
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,793
<i>to our house right now</i>
<i>to guard us.</i>

696
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,795
<i>God!</i>

697
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:54,164
<i>When is this going to end?</i>

698
00:45:57,402 --> 00:45:59,636
Marie, I'm here.

699
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,571
I'm here.

700
00:46:01,606 --> 00:46:04,174
Tell me exactly what happened.

701
