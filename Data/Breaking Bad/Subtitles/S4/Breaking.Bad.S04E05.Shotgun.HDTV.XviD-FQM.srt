Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:04,758
We found a notebook.

3
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:06,322
<i>I wonder if you might take a look.</i>

4
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:09,042
I'm supposed to straighten up
and fly right or toe the line

5
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,425
<i>or some other crap?</i>

6
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:11,973
<i>My drug-addicted partner
doesn't seem to care</i>

7
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:13,185
<i>whether he lives or dies.</i>

8
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,699
<i>How long before Gus decides
that he's too big of a risk?</i>

9
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,270
It's Pinkman.
He's become increasingly incautious.

10
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:19,795
<i>Something's got to be done.</i>

11
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:23,059
You think this Gale person
is your Heisenberg?

12
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:24,573
Jesse!

13
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:35,347
Say you understand.

14
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,083
Do you understand?

15
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,384
Tell me you understand, Saul!

16
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,620
Every dollar--

17
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:44,522
If you don't hear from me
in 24 hours--

18
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:46,592
No, no. Saul. Saul, shut up.

19
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:48,928
Shut up and listen to me.

20
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,931
I want you to give her
every last dollar.

21
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,403
I don't care if you have
to stuff it in trash bags.

22
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:55,772
Just make sure
she gets everything.

23
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,074
All right?
Just make it happen!

24
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,097
<i>Hi.
You've reached the White family.</i>

25
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:20,565
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

26
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,366
Uh...

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,968
Hey. It's me.

28
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,536
Um...

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,538
I-- I...

30
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:29,772
I just wanted to say

31
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:31,707
that I was thinking about you

32
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,908
and the kids, and, uh...

33
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,211
I love you.

00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,974
Hello. Would you like to try

36
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,343
our Breakfast Chicken
Chalupa Combo Meal?

37
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:19,477
Gus Fring.

38
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:21,212
Excuse me?

39
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:24,115
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now.

40
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,417
Please.

41
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,685
Mr. Fring
isn't here right now.

42
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,353
- Is there something I'm able--
- He's here.

43
00:03:28,387 --> 00:03:30,923
His car's parked out front.
He's here.

44
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,625
He was here.
Mr. Fring was--

45
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,892
You just go in the back

46
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,694
and you tell him
it's Walter White.

47
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:36,762
Understand?

48
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,666
He'll know what it's about.

49
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,572
I'll wait.

50
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,910
Hello.

51
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,779
<i>Walter, what
exactly are you doing?</i>

52
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:08,916
Where's Jesse?

53
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,219
<i>Jesse's with me.
He's fine.</i>

54
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:13,688
Do you expect me
to just believe that?

55
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,757
<i>I'm crossing my heart, Walter.</i>

56
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,426
Where is he?

57
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,361
<i>Hold on.</i>

58
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,864
<i>Yo.</i>

59
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:22,932
Jesse?

60
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,133
<i>Yeah. What's up?</i>

61
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,203
Jesse, w-where are you?

62
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:28,270
<i>With Mike.</i>

63
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,539
I know you're with Mike.

64
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:32,207
Are-- Are you all right?

65
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:33,609
Does he have a gun on you?

66
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,378
No.

67
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:39,014
<i>Well, what's going on, then?</i>

68
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:41,350
We're driving.

69
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,384
<i>Driving?</i>

70
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,786
Driving where?

71
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:46,955
I don't know.

72
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,057
Uh, north.

73
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,663
W-W-- Why is he driving you?

74
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:55,764
<i>Where is he going?</i>

75
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,500
Beats me.

76
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:59,402
I-- I don't-- I--

77
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:00,670
Put Mike back on.

78
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,742
Hello again.

79
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:09,146
Mike, tell me now
exactly what is going on.

80
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,649
Jesse's with me today,
so what you need to do

81
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:14,318
is to go back to your lab
and get on with the cook.

82
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,821
You're gonna have to muddle through
this one without him, okay?

83
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,457
<i>That's what's going on.</i>

84
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:19,891
But it doesn't--

85
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:20,993
<i>Goodbye, Walter.</i>

86
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:22,194
Mike--

87
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,888
Sir--

88
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,990
Excuse me. Sir.

89
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,458
You're not allowed back there.

90
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:53,526
Excuse me, sir.

91
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,730
As I said, sir,
Mr. Fring is not here.

92
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:59,498
This area's for employees only,

93
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,534
and I have to ask
that you leave immediately.

94
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,494
What you told Mr. White,
that's...

95
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:33,732
that's just bullshit, right?

96
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:55,488
You, uh, you figure on just
leaving me in some ditch?

97
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:00,627
What do you care?

98
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:02,895
I don't.

99
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:07,800
But I'll tell you now,
you better shoot straight,

100
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,602
old man,

101
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,203
or I'll slice off
your other ear

102
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,238
before this is over.

103
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:14,192
Ahem.

104
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:39,410
You coming?

105
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,980
We got to do this
six more times today,

106
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,115
with a lot of miles in between.

107
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,018
I'd like to finish before dark.

108
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:30,113
This freaking guy,
I tell you what.

109
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,215
It's like Scarface had sex

110
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:33,716
with Mister Rogers
or something.

111
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,485
Who does this, you know?

112
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,919
Your boy Heisenberg.

113
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,254
Thought we had him already.

114
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:41,289
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

115
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:42,324
Yeah, no.

116
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,691
Getz busted him
a few months back.

117
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:45,894
Yeah, well, no offense

118
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,596
to Detective
Doogie Howser there,

119
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,533
but all he caught
was a dipshit lifer

120
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:53,436
by the name
of Jimmy In-N-Out.

121
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,272
This one--
He's your Heisenberg?

122
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:58,575
Yeah, I believe he is.

123
00:13:58,609 --> 00:13:59,976
So what are you thinking?

124
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,012
Rival drug gang
taking out the mastermind?

125
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:05,281
Any names I should check out?

126
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:06,849
I wish I could help you there.

127
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,318
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

128
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:13,322
Uh, one is a beanie-wearing
jizz stain

129
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:15,058
by the name
of Brandon Mayhew--

130
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,693
Street name, uh, Badger.

131
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,462
Definitely another player.

132
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:24,333
The other one
is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.

133
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:27,370
He and I have a history.

134
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:30,006
Yeah.

135
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,209
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

136
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:34,978
That would surprise me.

137
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,313
Well, we got a composite

138
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:39,281
of a person of interest.

139
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:42,117
It's a guy the neighbors saw

140
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:45,187
at Boetticher's place
right after the shooting.

141
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:49,726
Eh...sorry.

142
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,428
No, hang on to it,
just in case.

143
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:53,931
Then we got a couple of
prints we're hoping to I.D.

144
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,399
If I get any kind of hit,

145
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,201
I'll keep you
in the loop on that.

146
00:14:57,235 --> 00:15:00,238
You know, uh, Tim,

147
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:03,108
look, I appreciate
what you're doing, really--

148
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,009
Uh, you know, keeping me
involved and all,

149
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,678
but, uh, you know,

150
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:13,016
finding this guy Heisenberg
dead like this...

151
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,986
I have to say, it, uh...

152
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,888
kind of feels like closure
to me, you know?

153
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:22,959
Hank, you really are
a big help here.

154
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:24,761
No, I know.
I get it, really.

155
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:27,030
But I'm done.

156
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,089
Oh, no.

157
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:33,397
You don't need to do that.

158
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,234
This is why I'm out here,
right?

159
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,302
To be, like, your backup?

160
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:42,105
Uh-huh.

161
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,809
So if I'm out here
in a guard-type capacity

162
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:46,944
to watch over the money,

163
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:50,414
that means I need, like,
a gun, right?

164
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:51,516
Nope.

165
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,802
I mean, isn't that,
like, completely idiotic

166
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:11,404
for me to be out here
without a gun?

167
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,206
I mean, you haven't said dick

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,574
about what I'm supposed
to be doing here,

169
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,176
and I'm supposed
to do it without a gun?

170
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,812
How does that even make sense?

171
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,048
What?

172
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,649
I can smoke, right?

173
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:26,085
Not a chance.

174
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:09,896
Uhh...

175
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,936
Buh-buh-buh-buh-
buh-buh-buh-buh.

176
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,088
♪ Fallacies ♪

177
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,724
♪ Fallacies ♪

178
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:37,393

179

Uhh.

180
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:54,910
It's finally hitting me
what the-- The plan is here.

181
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:57,546
It's to bore me to death, so...

182
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:02,117
mission accomplished
because it's totally working.

183
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:04,419
Great job.

184
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,425
You know, I really do
get what's going on

185
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,263
with all the dead drops
and bags of cash.

186
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,434
I mean, my boys
had the exact same system

187
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:20,503
when I was running things.

188
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:22,139
My crew.

189
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:25,508
Nowhere near the same cheese
you guys are slinging,

190
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,577
but same theory--

191
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:31,681
To maintain separation
between dealer and supplier,

192
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,683
reduce risk,

193
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,685
et cetera.

194
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:38,855
Look, don't you think
it would be good

195
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,759
if there was some back and
forth communication here?

196
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,227
You got me riding shotgun

197
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,995
to every dark anal recess
of this state.

198
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,464
Be nice if you
clued me in a little.

199
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:54,036
I mean, I'm here
to do a job, right?

200
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,639
And, I mean, yo,
like, if I'm the guy,

201
00:19:57,673 --> 00:20:00,975
then you should just tell me
what the hell's up.

202
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:06,747
What?

203
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,783
You are not the guy.

204
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,651
You're not capable
of being the guy.

205
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,387
I had a guy, but now I don't.

206
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,156
You are not the guy.

207
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:18,293
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

208
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,895
I don't know.
It's not my call.

209
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,163
I just do what I'm told,

210
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:24,099
and now you're gonna
do what you're told,

211
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,702
which is to sit here, shut up,

212
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:29,405
and stay in the car
till we finish our pickups.

213
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,773
You got it?

214
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:17,881
Oh.

215
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,322
We having second thoughts?

216
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:27,957
Every hour of every day.

217
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:29,992
Let me tell you,

218
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,694
that is perfectly normal.

219
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:34,062
But your expectations
are realistic.

220
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,164
You have a good,
solid business plan.

221
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:38,199
I'm feeling very confident.

222
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:40,835
You have an excellent shot
at making this work.

223
00:22:43,872 --> 00:22:44,905
Walt.

224
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:48,276
Hmm.

225
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,343
We good?

226
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,347
Yeah.

227
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:58,520
All right.

228
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:12,002
Well, my congratulations
to the both of you.

229
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:14,037
Thank you very much, Alan.

230
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,939
It is my pleasure.

231
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:18,642
Ah.

232
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:21,411
Mr. White.

233
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:23,379
Best of luck.

234
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,413
Thank you.

235
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm bringing my car over
first thing next week

236
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:29,418
for a wash and wax.

237
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:30,752
Oh, well, we'll
be looking for you.

238
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,521
I'll be there.

239
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:33,522
Thank you again.

240
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:34,523
You're welcome.

241
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:35,557
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

242
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:43,364
Wow. It's official.

243
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,068
How are you feeling?

244
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,908
I'm...

245
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:54,810
well, I'm--
How do you feel?

246
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:58,314
Uh...nervous.

247
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:01,251
Scared.

248
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,954
This is a big step, Walt.

249
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:07,024
If we don't
do this right--

250
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:08,725
We'll be fine.

251
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,727
We will?

252
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:16,833
Tell me again.

253
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:24,841
We will be fine.
Believe it.

254
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:29,378
If we're
going to do this--

255
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,347
I mean, we're really
going to do this--

256
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:34,449
Then we have to
promise each other

257
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:36,518
no more secrets.

258
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,922
There can't be any
mistakes like before.

259
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:44,926
There has to be
complete honesty.

260
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,495
I'm all for that.

261
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:49,831
Good.

262
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,534
Well, then, uh,

263
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:55,470
how about a drink to celebrate?

264
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:56,804
Well--

265
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:59,240
Well, we own a big-ass
car wash now.

266
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:02,043
We do. I guess
that merits a celebration.

267
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,445
Nothing too expensive.

268
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,247
Right. Right.

269
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,349
- Non-fancy liquor it is.
- Yes.

270
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,585
Just as long
as it gets the job done.

271
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:10,620
Oop.

272
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:18,228
<i>Uh, it's me.</i>

273
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:19,796
<i>I just wanted to say</i>

274
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,665
<i>that I was thinking
about you and the kids,</i>

275
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,534
<i>and, uh...</i>

276
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:27,336
<i>I love you.</i>

277
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:52,694
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

278
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:53,695
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

279
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:54,729
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

280
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:25,511
The sheets, they smell
different than I remember.

281
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:27,279
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

282
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:30,083
Oh.

283
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:31,785
New fabric softener.

284
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,420
Mmm.

285
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:35,122
Mm, I like it.

286
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:38,792
I, uh...

287
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:41,994
also got a new haircut.

288
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:43,696
Don't know if you--

289
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:46,199
Oh, yes, I-- I was
going to say something.

290
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,001
Were you, really?

291
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,472
I do like it.

292
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:56,176
Thanks.

293
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,384
So, um, dinner tomorrow night?

294
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:08,323
I told Marie that we'd
come over and eat with them.

295
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:12,027
Uh, think maybe you'll be free?

296
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:16,298
Yeah.

297
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,899
Yeah, we can do that.

298
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,735
That'll--
That'll be nice.

299
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:23,971
Good.

300
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:28,742
Marie says
it's about the only thing

301
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:31,078
that'll get Hank
out of his room.

302
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,347
Mom.

303
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,183
Ohh.

304
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,827
Hey, Mom, Dad.

305
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:46,861
Hi, son.

306
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:52,000
Where are you?

307
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:53,969
Uh, we're--
We're back here.

308
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:55,537
We'll be out in a minute.

309
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,440
Ohh...

310
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:03,811
He knows that you're here.

311
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,880
I'm parked in the driveway.

312
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:08,215
Oh. This is going to make

313
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:10,684
for some very interesting
dinner conversation.

314
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:14,420
He's definitely going to ask

315
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:16,723
about our living situation now.

316
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:17,991
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

317
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:22,629
Maybe, uh...

318
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:25,465
maybe you should move back in,

319
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:26,833
you know,

320
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:30,104
just so it's, uh, easier
to explain to everyone.

321
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,675
You think?

322
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:59,435
I have to get back to work.

323
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:02,338
You know, schedule.

324
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,039
Yeah.

325
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,244
Whoa. Ohh--

326
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Ahh--

327
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,384
Damn it.

328
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,785
Hey!

329
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,587
Hey! This is a two-man job!

330
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,854
I can't do it alone!

331
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,123
I'm done! That's it!
Finished!

332
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,659
Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

333
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,245
Jesse?

334
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:57,085
Where's Jesse?

335
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,887
I need him.

336
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:00,521
You people have me down here

337
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:03,691
trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself!

338
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:05,159
It's unacceptable.

339
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:08,228
It's dangerous
and counterproductive.

340
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:12,866
Jesse operates
the forklift, not me.

341
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,801
That's just one of the many,

342
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:16,036
many things
he does around the lab

343
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,604
that keeps us on schedule,

344
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:20,074
so I suggest that you
get him back down here

345
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,242
as soon as you p--

346
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:23,645
Are you listening to me?

347
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,913
Hello!

348
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,496
Where do you want it?

349
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:09,128
This is it, right?
Last stop?

350
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,496
Last stop?

351
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:12,866
Hey, I've been counting, yo.

352
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,367
No more pickups after--

353
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,984
Fallacies...

354
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,885
fallacies.

355
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:03,316
Fallacies, fallacies.

356
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:07,387
One for you, two for me.

357
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:11,257
Fallacies, fallacies...

358
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,380
Ohh!

359
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,756
Ohh.

360
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:24,567
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to be picked up.

361
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:25,902
Now.

362
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:29,873
Garcia's on Central.

363
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:32,642
Honk once. I'll meet you
in the parking lot.

364
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:39,817
Cancel that.

365
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:51,262
Hey, this dude--

366
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,531
This dude was coming
right at me

367
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:55,433
with a--
With a shotgun.

368
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,201
All right? They, like,
blocked the alley,

369
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:59,070
and they were going
to rip us off, man.

370
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:00,338
I didn't have a choice, okay?

371
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:03,108
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car,

372
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,111
and just--

373
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,479
I saw.

374
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,416
Ah, Jesus.

375
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:13,952
I just--

376
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,587
I don't know.

377
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,264
Go ahead, kid.

378
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,268
Smoke up.

379
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:51,999
Hmm.

380
00:35:57,506 --> 00:35:59,206
Mmm.

381
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,317
Good morning.

382
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,720
Hey. Good morning, son.

383
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,089
You want me
to pour you some juice?

384
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:18,358
I'll take coffee.

385
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:22,161
Didn't know you started
drinking coffee.

386
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:26,566
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces, too,

387
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,401
all by myself.

388
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:30,403
Go grab a mug.

389
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,849
Milk? Sugar?

390
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:43,351
Just black.

391
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:45,621
Black. I like it.

392
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,458
Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh...

393
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:53,695
I-- I just got to say, um...

394
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,296
I-- I just wanted to say

395
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:57,632
that it's really cool
to have you here.

396
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:01,369
Thank you, son.

397
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:03,471
It's cool to be back home.

398
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,074
It just feels--

399
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:10,546
Mom said you're moving
back in, uh, this Tuesday.

400
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,587
She-- She said that?

401
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:18,889
Yeah.

402
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:21,859
Tuesday, is it? Huh.

403
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:24,895
How about that?

404
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:53,990
Jesse.

405
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:55,826
Jesse!

406
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:58,262
Yo, what's up?

407
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,164
What are you doing?

408
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,666
Uh, breaking ice.

409
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,867
I mean, what are you--

410
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:04,502
What are you doing here?

411
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:05,637
Where's your car?

412
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:07,839
Mike dropped me off.

413
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,018
Jesse.

414
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,354
Jesse!

415
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,458
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

416
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:29,960
I was out with Mike
helping him make pickups.

417
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:31,261
Picking up what?

418
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,230
Cash. Dead drops.

419
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:37,134
Mike made the pickups,
and I guarded them.

420
00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:39,003
You?

421
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:40,371
Guarded Mike?

422
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:43,107
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

423
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:45,175
Hey, you know what?
Two dudes tried to rob us,

424
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,411
and I saved the stash.
I took care of business,

425
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:50,514
just like I'm taking care
of business right now.

426
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:51,982
You want to stand there
dicking around,

427
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:54,652
or you want to suit up
and get to work?

428
00:38:54,686 --> 00:38:57,289
Get in gear, yo,
if you want to do this

429
00:38:57,323 --> 00:38:59,224
because I'm meeting up
with Mike this afternoon.

430
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:01,326
What, again? Why?

431
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:03,929
Guess I have two jobs now.

432
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,481
<i>May I take your order?</i>

433
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:33,324
Any injuries?

434
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,494
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

435
00:39:37,496 --> 00:39:40,165
It all went like you
thought it would,

436
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,468
more or less.

437
00:39:42,502 --> 00:39:44,437
I will, of course,
reimburse you

438
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:46,205
to the damage to your vehicles.

439
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,273
Hmm.

440
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:50,542
Questions?

441
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:54,112
Uh-huh.
More than a few, yeah.

442
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:56,147
But I know better than to ask.

443
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,553
Anyway, it was like you wanted.

444
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:04,388
The kid's a hero.

445
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:23,544
Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo--

446
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:25,212
Just the idea
of owning a car wash

447
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:26,880
seems daunting,
but I had to warn myself--

448
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:28,382
Who is just the most beautiful
little girl in the world?

449
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,516
I think it's you.

450
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,451
So coming into
a business like this

451
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:33,553
that's up and running,
fully operational,

452
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:35,823
puts us way ahead of the game.

453
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:37,291
You know, we're
still going to have

454
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:38,558
some change over time--

455
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:40,027
I think it's you.
Yeah, I do.

456
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:41,595
But we do have
a staff in place,

457
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:44,564
so, you know, luckily,
we'll be able to hold on

458
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,266
to most of Bogdan's employees.

459
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:50,203
We might lose a few to the Ultra
Wash across town, though.

460
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:51,871
They're making a grab, I hear.

461
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:53,340
You going to put
the kid to work?

462
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:54,674
I got school.

463
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:55,809
I'm not talking about you.

464
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:57,077
I'm talking about
your baby sister.

465
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:58,545
I wouldn't let you near my car.

466
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:01,381
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
you guys.

467
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:04,050
You should put Holly
on the sign.

468
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:06,118
Like a mascot?

469
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:08,120
Like the Gerber baby.

470
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:10,055
I would get my car
washed there every day

471
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:11,323
if I saw her face out front.

472
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:12,457
What about me?

473
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:14,158
The goal is to bring
customers in,

474
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:15,626
not scare them away, so--

475
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,165
Walt, there's another
bottle in the kitchen.

476
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,232
Just help yourself.

477
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:23,534
Ah. Good.

478
00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:27,739
Uh, maybe we could
roll uncle Hank

479
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:28,907
through the car wash.

480
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:30,175
He could be the first customer.

481
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,845
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

482
00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:36,148
See this, son?

483
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:37,616
I got your wipe-down
right here, pal.

484
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:40,052
Hank, can you just
maybe get through one meal

485
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:42,321
without you saying
something disgusting?

486
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:44,791
So what are you going
to do with Holly all day?

487
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:46,192
You can't take her to work

488
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:49,895
with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

489
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:50,896
Marie--

490
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,465
What? That can't be safe.

491
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:54,866
Fortunately, there is,

492
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,534
just five minutes away
from the car wash,

493
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:59,737
there is the top child care
center in the city.

494
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:02,139
The National Child Care
Association

495
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:04,909
gives it really high ratings,
so that's quite a relief,

496
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:08,213
and, you know, it's just
a walk away if we need it.

497
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,481
I got to tell you,

498
00:42:09,515 --> 00:42:12,484
I'm just-- I'm really,
really impressed.

499
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:15,387
I mean,
you came together on this,

500
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:17,690
and I'm really happy
that it's working out for you.

501
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:18,691
Thanks.

502
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:19,759
It was a little scary,

503
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:21,761
but it, uh, needed to be done.

504
00:42:21,796 --> 00:42:24,731
And, uh, we get possession
of the keys tomorrow.

505
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:26,166
Oh, that's awesome.

506
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,233
Yeah.

507
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:28,701
I can't wait to see

508
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:30,569
what kind of car
I'll get for my birthday,

509
00:42:30,604 --> 00:42:32,605
now with all this money
rolling in.

510
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,473
I think you've been
spending too much time

511
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,741
around your uncle Hank.

512
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:37,542
The squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

513
00:42:37,576 --> 00:42:38,810
Right, uncle Hank?

514
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:40,478
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

515
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:44,315
Hey, uh, Nick the Greek,

516
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,984
you going to share
that bottle or what?

517
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,753
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

518
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:49,087
Who's Nick the Greek?

519
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:51,323
Nick the Greek. He was
a famous big-time card player.

520
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:52,825
Hank, that's not funny.

521
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,160
What? It's a compliment.

522
00:42:54,194 --> 00:42:55,628
Well, that's even worse, then.

523
00:42:55,662 --> 00:42:59,099
You're giving positive
reinforcement to behavior

524
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:02,636
that Walt is working
very, very hard to change.

525
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:04,238
Right, Skyler?

526
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:05,940
Yeah.

527
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,508
I don't see how it's bad, Dad,

528
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,744
just raking in
the beaucoup bucks now.

529
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:11,013
You know, I just, uh, think

530
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,015
maybe we could
change the subject?

531
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:16,119
Yeah. Sure. You know.

532
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,088
Absolutely.

533
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:21,225
Hey, uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at

534
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:23,861
with that crazy singing guy?

535
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:26,263
Ah, I'm off that.

536
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:28,832
I-- I gave my assessment
to the APD, and I'm done.

537
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:31,768
The case of the crazy
singing guy. Hmm.

538
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:33,971
Sounds like an Encyclopedia
Brown story, doesn't it?

539
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:37,274
Crazy is-- Is-- Is, uh,
is the wrong word.

540
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:39,109
This guy Gale Boetticher,

541
00:43:39,144 --> 00:43:41,145
he was, uh, he was eccentric.

542
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:43,647
I mean, a real character,
you know?

543
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:46,783
He's, uh, he's dead now,
you know.

544
00:43:46,817 --> 00:43:48,452
Huh. Who was he?

545
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:50,287
He was a meth cook.

546
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,556
Uh, he was a meth chef.

547
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,192
I mean,
we're talking five stars--

548
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:58,128
Candles and white tablecloths.

549
00:43:58,163 --> 00:44:00,030
Hey, I can't believe
these words

550
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:01,231
are gonna come out of my mouth,

551
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:06,236
but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

552
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:10,440
I mean, uh, boy, if you
applied that big brain of his

553
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:11,975
to something good,
I don't know,

554
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:13,877
who knows what could have
helped humanity

555
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:15,145
or something like that,
you know?

556
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:17,514
I mean, how many actual
geniuses are there

557
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:19,015
in the world, right?

558
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,685
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction,

559
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,420
who knows?

560
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:27,590
Hank, not to tell you
your business,

561
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:31,060
but I'm not sure I agree.

562
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,295
What do you mean?

563
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:33,329
Well, I mean,

564
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:34,630
you showed me that notebook

565
00:44:34,665 --> 00:44:36,599
and from what
I saw--

566
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,202
And this is just
my humble opinion--

567
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:42,871
From what I saw
on those papers...

568
00:44:42,906 --> 00:44:44,606
genius?

569
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,210
Not so much.

570
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:50,746
I mean, there was no reasoning,

571
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,548
no deductions in those pages.

572
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:55,817
To my eye, all this brilliance

573
00:44:55,852 --> 00:44:57,819
looks like nothing more

574
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:02,224
than just simple
rote copying--

575
00:45:02,258 --> 00:45:05,360
Probably of
someone else's work.

576
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:10,466
Believe me, I've been around
enough students to know.

577
00:45:13,604 --> 00:45:18,208
Ah, this genius of yours...

578
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,779
maybe he's still out there.

579
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:35,158
Hank.

580
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:36,393
Hey, babe.

581
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,630
Uh, Tim stopped by.

582
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:41,599
He brought over some file boxes

583
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,000
on that case.

584
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:45,036
Thought I'd take another peek.

585
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,437
That's great.

586
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,441
Sorry about the mess.

587
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,143
No, no, no. Don't be.

588
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:54,880
You want me
to make some coffee?

589
00:45:54,914 --> 00:45:56,448
Yeah.

590
00:45:56,482 --> 00:45:58,784
Yeah, that would be good.

591
00:46:27,747 --> 00:46:29,381
Hmm.

592
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:31,684
You find something?

593
00:46:33,587 --> 00:46:37,824
Oh, just this--
This guy I'm looking at.

594
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:41,361
You know, everything
he-- He-- He buys and eats

595
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:45,965
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

596
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:53,005
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?

597
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:59,500
