1
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:06,201
- Are we done?
- Listen, I--

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,491
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't know what it means.

3
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,450
Please.

4
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,873
I fear for my family.

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,584
I'm sure they'll be fine.

6
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:22,588
I'm told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

7
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:24,793
It's doubtful he'll live.

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,679
Now, thank me and shake my hand.

9
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:35,178
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

10
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,227
Guys, guys, hurry up.

11
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:41,392
- Can we go now?
- Upstairs, come on.

12
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:44,103
What's happening?

13
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:46,106
Eight forty-three.

14
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:49,487
Time of death, 20:43.

15
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,822
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

16
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:01,622
One of the gunmen died
at the scene.

17
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:05,036
The second succumbed to his wounds
earlier this evening.

18
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,878
Agents with the DEA and FBI...

19
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:11,003
...in conjunction with APD are working
with Mexican law enforcement...

20
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,084
...in an attempt to identify
the deceased suspects. Both--

21
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,150
I can give you the highlights.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,029
Your nephews grew impatient.

23
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:41,822
They continued to press me
for my permission to kill Walter White.

24
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:46,662
When I wouldn't give it, they settled
instead for DEA Agent Schrader.

25
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,741
But a phone call was placed...

26
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:52,627
...to Agent Schrader
moments before the attack.

27
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,374
Thus giving him the upper hand.

28
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:58,542
Marco was shot in the face
and died instantly.

29
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:01,795
Leonel lingered for several hours.

30
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,841
The warning call to the DEA agent...

31
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:09,718
...Juan Bolsa
may have some insight...

32
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,010
...into who placed it.

33
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,435
Yesterday,
federales raided his hacienda.

34
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,683
And in the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

35
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,522
An accident, perhaps.

36
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,271
A mistake made by his own men.

37
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,945
Though we may never know.

38
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:30,819
At any rate,
I thought you should hear it from me.

39
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:44,671
This is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

40
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:39,800
So is this the loud one?

41
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:43,462
What?

42
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,600
No. This is the PET/CT scan.

43
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:56,148
Positron emission tomography.

44
00:03:57,932 --> 00:04:04,907
They've paired that
with computed x-ray tomography.

45
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:09,233
Quiet. No magnets.

46
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,239
Right, okay.

47
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:12,701
Yeah, thanks.

48
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,576
I'm still pretty new at this.

49
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,250
One minute,
I'm starting a new business...

50
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,621
...my wife and I
are thinking about kids.

51
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,413
Walk into a doctor's office
and suddenly ...

52
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:27,919
- I mean, life as I know it--
- Excuse me.

53
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,548
Yes. I'm waiting
to hear a progress report...

54
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:35,430
...on the thing we discussed,
so call me.

55
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:42,473
Anyway, so for me,
that's been the biggest wake-up call.

56
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,608
Letting go, giving up control.

57
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:49,816
You know, it's like they say,
"Man plans and God laughs."

58
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,778
That is such bullshit.

59
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,530
Excuse me?

60
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:59,236
Never give up control.

61
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:03,207
Live life on your own terms.

62
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:06,457
Yeah, no,
I get what you're saying...

63
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,793
...but cancer is cancer, so...

64
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,998
To hell with your cancer.

65
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:14,253
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

66
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:18,336
From the start, it's a death sentence.
That's what they keep telling me.

67
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,215
Well, guess what?

68
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,717
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

69
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:28,264
So every few months,
I come in here for my regular scan...

70
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:32,311
...knowing full well
that one of these times--

71
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:34,898
Hell, maybe even today.

72
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,775
--I'm gonna hear some bad news.

73
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,940
But until then...

74
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,241
...who's in charge?

75
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,119
Me.

76
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,238
That's how I live my life.

77
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,849
This residue here is why we descale
with cool water...

78
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:13,550
...from the walk-in
and not water from the tap.

79
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:15,596
Do it again, please.

80
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,857
Pollos Hermanos, where something
delicious is always cooking.

81
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,235
Yes, detective.

82
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,874
Yeah.

83
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:54,759
- Gustavo, thanks for coming.
- Pleasure.

84
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,463
- How's Kathi?
- Much better, thank you.

85
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,351
- And you know Hank Schrader?
- Yes, indeed.

86
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:02,967
- And Steve Gomez?
- How was your meal?

87
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:06,389
Agent Schrader and I had a chance
to catch up at one of my restaurants.

88
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,940
I'd eat there every day
but I wouldn't fit through the door.

89
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,150
- Well, should we get started?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,232
- I'd like to record this conversation.
- Of course.

91
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,785
The DEA is working on an investigation
which may overlap with my own...

92
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,707
...so I've asked them to sit in.

93
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:32,536
Gus, we all appreciate your coming
in here to talk to us...

94
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:35,625
...but you have the right
to have an attorney present.

95
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:39,042
Oh, well, I can't see
how that would be necessary.

96
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:41,252
But then,
I have no idea why I'm here.

97
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,048
So you wish to continue?

98
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:47,972
Please. I'm very anxious
to find out what this is all about.

99
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:51,807
Sir, your fingerprints were found
at a crime scene.

100
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,272
Really? That's surprising.

101
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,103
A drug-related homicide.

102
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:06,449
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

103
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,280
So you knew the victim?

104
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:21,627
Fifteen years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

105
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,506
I named it
after Maximino Arciniega...

106
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:26,839
...a dear friend of mine
who died young.

107
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,584
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

108
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,931
He was perhaps one of three dozen.

109
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:35,848
I see.

110
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:40,562
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in ...

111
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,558
-1999.
- That sounds right.

112
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,691
And you kept in contact with him
over all this time?

113
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,444
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

114
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:54,656
- Ran into him where?
- At the restaurant.

115
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:58,612
Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate,
as I assumed...

116
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:02,778
...he came by to re-establish contact
with me. We caught up briefly.

117
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:06,699
He invited me to dinner
the following night and I accepted.

118
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,256
It was perhaps a week later
when I read about him in the paper.

119
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:15,252
- Drug related, you said?
-It's a good possibility.

120
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,709
The paper made no mention of that.

121
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,596
I assumed
that it was a random crime.

122
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,969
So after years with no contact,
he shows up in your restaurant...

123
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:28,518
...and invites you to dinner?
- He wanted money.

124
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:31,646
- Gale Boetticher asked for money?
- He didn't say that.

125
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:36,767
He spoke in terms
of a vague investment opportunity.

126
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:40,984
But it was my suspicion, yes,
as to why he invited me into his home.

127
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:46,488
He was a very, very talented chemist,
but for reasons I never understood...

128
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,739
...he was more interested
in taking shortcuts...

129
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:53,656
...than what would or could have been
a very promising career.

130
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,999
Personal shortcomings
notwithstanding...

131
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:58,369
...he was a warm, gentle person...

132
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,960
...and I thought a lot of him.

133
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:07,136
At any rate,
I declined his business offer...

134
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,679
...and after
what was a very pleasant meal, left.

135
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,056
Can you tell us where you were...

136
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:16,849
...on the night of Wednesday the 23rd
at around 8 p.m.?

137
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,724
- Not an accusation, just a question.
- No, I understand. Let's see.

138
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,526
Twenty-third.

139
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,567
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

140
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,450
I was there from 7 to about 10.

141
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,739
Anyone else?

142
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,544
Sorry, yeah. Just one other thing.

143
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:47,618
Is Gustavo Fring your real name?

144
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,626
Is it my real name?

145
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,507
I know you're a Chilean national...

146
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,887
...but there are no records of you
ever living there.

147
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,093
Really?

148
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:06,095
I mean, records show that you
immigrated to Mexico in 1986...

149
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:10,690
...and years later, you were granted
an entry visa to the United States.

150
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:16,938
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring
ever having existed in Chile...

151
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,156
...which I find, I don't know, strange.

152
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,734
Well, no, really, it isn't.

153
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,991
Pinochet's government
was guilty of many sins.

154
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,529
First and foremost
were human rights abuses.

155
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,617
But it was also notoriously unreliable
at keeping records.

156
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:36,838
I'm sure if you keep digging,
you'll find me.

157
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,296
Okay, I think that's it, Gus.
Thank you.

158
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,049
I hope that I was of some small help.

159
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,798
- You were, absolutely. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

160
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,641
Good to see you again. Oh, no.

161
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,307
- No, please, please. Don't get up.
- Thanks.

162
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:00,186
Gentlemen.

163
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,835
So are we buying?

164
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,336
This thing with his name?
What are you thinking?

165
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,634
Sure, the record-keeping
in South America's hit or miss.

166
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,300
I mean, we run into that all the time,
right?

167
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:37,213
But we usually find something.
Before '86 this guy's a ghost.

168
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:41,431
If State Department wasn't satisfied,
they wouldn't have naturalized him.

169
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:45,096
Well, maybe,
but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.

170
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:48,600
State just wasn't as tough
on background checks pre-9/11.

171
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:52,020
I don't know what this has to do
with the case at hand.

172
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:55,986
I was curious when his print showed up
at Boetticher's apartment.

173
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:58,239
For me, the scholarship explains it.

174
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:00,693
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

175
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,829
This man has been a longtime friend
of DEA.

176
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:08,950
But that being said,
I thought his story was credible.

177
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,915
Well, I agree.
I think it was a good story.

178
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:14,288
Still, why are we hearing it now?

179
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,503
What do you mean?

180
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:20,342
Well, like you said, he's a-- This man
is a big law enforcement booster.

181
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,337
He's reading the newspaper and sees
that someone he had dinner with...

182
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:27,130
...someone he thought a lot of
was murdered.

183
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,138
He reads this
and he doesn't make a phone call?

184
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:34,732
Didn't call you
or one of his other cop friends...

185
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,855
...to share his connection with the case
or ask about the investigation?

186
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:42,154
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation...

187
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,487
...on a person
not making phone calls.

188
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:47,950
What do you think, Tim?

189
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:51,991
Well, I wanna follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi...

190
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:54,163
...but my overall impression?

191
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:55,536
I believed him.

192
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:09,300
Nice touch. Birdbath.

193
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:13,265
- Hey, tiger, how's it hanging?
- Good.

194
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,262
Yeah, so very nice.

195
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,601
What's the damage?

196
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:23,816
Twelve hundred a month.
I did a lot of research.

197
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:27,643
- That's a pretty good deal.
- You kidding me? That's a great deal.

198
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,735
Speaking of which...

199
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:32,148
...that's for the week.

200
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:36,149
Plus there's a little extra in there
for any move-related incidentals.

201
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:37,400
Thank you.

202
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,996
- Hey, champ, how's the new school?
- Good.

203
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,116
I loved school when I was your age.

204
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:46,951
Seesaws, story time,
chasing girls with sticks.

205
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:01,429
It wasn't until the fifth grade
that I found out she liked me too...

206
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:05,550
...but by then her family had moved
to Scottsdale, so ...

207
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:10,185
- Carpe diem, okay?
- Okay.

208
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:11,892
All right. Good boy.

209
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:16,436
So you'll thank Jesse again
from both of us?

210
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,982
You got it.

211
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:22,858
- So is he-- How's he doing?
- Jesse?

212
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:33,164
He's good. He's busy.

213
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:42,962
How is it?

214
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:48,004
Space, lots of light. it's--
Little garden outback. it's nice.

215
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:52,467
And Brock? How's he doing?

216
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:56,054
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping checks off every week...

217
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,682
...like Ed McMahon...

218
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:00,270
...but if you wanna know
how they're doing...

219
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:03,235
...why don't you go see for yourself?

220
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:09,615
I'll catch you later.

221
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,607
- Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
- No.

222
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:00,320
Great.

223
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,285
Anyway,
I'm proud for not losing my cool.

224
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,334
Plus, it shows our crew
that I will support them...

225
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,370
...if a customer's being rude.

226
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:16,002
You're really taking to this whole
be-your-own-boss thing.

227
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,673
Yeah. I guess I am.

228
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,920
Actually...

229
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,136
...I'm thinking about making the move
up to management.

230
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,222
Jesus. Corporate America, look out.

231
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,102
Excuse me,
I would be a vast improvement.

232
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,225
No one in Kleinman's entire front office
knows about giving an x-ray...

233
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,064
...which is just...

234
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:40,188
Hey, Dad, whatever happened
with your scan?

235
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,477
Did you get the results back?

236
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:46,857
Yeah, I did...

237
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:49,233
...and I'm still in remission.

238
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,948
So you're all gonna have to be stuck
with me for a while longer.

239
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:55,196
Cheers, buddy.

240
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:00,294
What about you, Hank?
How you feeling these days?

241
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:02,496
You know, getting there.

242
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:07,209
The other day, he had a big powwow
with all the DEA muckety-mucks.

243
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,878
What was that about?

244
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,132
Nothing. Just a dead-end.

245
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:15,055
He won't tell me, either.

246
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:17,341
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.

247
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,555
Hey, Walt, do me a favour?

248
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:26,064
Marie's working tomorrow
and there's a gem and mineral show...

249
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:30,734
...opening at the fairgrounds.
I wondered if you could give me a lift?

250
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,778
Yeah. Sure.

251
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,612
I had a collection of my own
in high school.

252
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:40,407
I mean, nothing fancy.
Just entry-level beryls and garnets...

253
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,028
...one passable black tourmaline.

254
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,908
- Turn right here.
- Okay.

255
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:51,044
But I did have one piece of morganite
that was very special.

256
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:55,675
It'd been heat-treated,
so it had that classic cast to it.

257
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:59,584
That rose, almost salmon hue,
you know?

258
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,377
Hey, Walt,
there's no rock show, okay?

259
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:06,757
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.
Here. Take a right here.

260
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,931
Freak about what?

261
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,524
Hank, where are we going?

262
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,524
Are you hungry?

263
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,194
We're not here for the chicken.

264
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,952
Kill the engine.

265
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:35,289
All right.

266
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:38,456
You ready
for your mind to be blown?

267
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:40,672
Sure.

268
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:44,748
Gustavo Fring, remember him?

269
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:48,426
He came to the hospital
after the shooting. Put up the reward?

270
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:53,050
He sponsors the DEA Fun Run
every year. You've met him?

271
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:58,427
Yeah, the Fun Run guy. Yeah.
That guy, yeah. What about him?

272
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:03,106
Well, I suspect" I can't prove it,
mind you, but I suspect...

273
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,309
...the man's a drug dealer.

274
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,444
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

275
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,908
I mean, honest to God,
I really believe...

276
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:18,737
...that this guy may be one
of the biggest movers in the southwest.

277
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:20,284
Remember Gale Boetticher?

278
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,989
- That sad sack from the karaoke tape?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:27,123
And you said that he didn't strike you
as being the boss-man type?

280
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,330
That there was a bigger guy
out there.

281
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:34,007
- Hank, that was just speculation.
- Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.

282
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:36,092
And guess what I find?

283
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:40,847
Chicken Man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

284
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:44,973
- So we bring him in--
- You think that Gustavo Fring...

285
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,681
...killed Gale Boetticher?

286
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:48,094
Probably not.

287
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:51,434
These guys usually get a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

288
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:54,521
But his fingerprints being there
was enough to bring him in. So I--

289
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,735
So you brought him in to the police?

290
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,692
Right. He sits down to talk with us,
the problem is that--

291
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,901
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

292
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,443
Walt,
will you let me finish my story here?

293
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,576
Sorry, I'm just
interested, you know?

294
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,749
All right. Whatever. So we bring him in
and he proceeds to kick our asses.

295
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,915
Okay? He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints.

296
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,915
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
He's got reasons for everything.

297
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:25,468
This guy
is Terms of Endearment convincing.

298
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,553
So he's not guilty?

299
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,766
Yeah. As far as DEA
and APD are concerned, he's not.

300
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,977
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.

301
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,145
But I'm telling you...

302
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:39,981
...something deep down says
he's my guy.

303
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:42,316
Just gotta prove it.

304
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:48,529
Hank, why are you telling me this?

305
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,527
I need a favour.

306
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:54,907
What favour?

307
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,581
You see that Volvo station wagon
over there?

308
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:03,128
The guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo.
It's brilliant.

309
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,372
Anyway, listen...

310
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:08,917
...what I need for you to do...

311
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,211
...stick this on it.

312
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,133
GPS tracker.

313
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:21,726
Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around
on her but she wants to be sure?

314
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,186
Stick this on the car--
This part here, it's a magnet.

315
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,022
--And see where he goes.

316
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,347
Cool, huh?

317
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,272
Two eighty-nine from SkyMall.

318
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,613
It's not live-view,
so we gotta come back later...

319
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,527
...and take it off
and stick it in the computer.

320
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:40,695
Still, a pretty amazing time
we're living in.

321
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:42,240
Hank, isn't that illegal?

322
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:46,534
I mean, isn't there some sort
of unlawful search and something--

323
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:52,455
it's known as extralegal.
But trust me, it's our little secret.

324
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:57,288
Look, it's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

325
00:22:57,496 --> 00:23:00,842
You untie your shoelace
and you head toward the restaurant.

326
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,678
You're walking past the car...

327
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,759
...look down and, "Hey, darn,
my shoe's untied." Okay?

328
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:09,094
Now, when you bend down
to tie your shoe...

329
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:11,386
...you stick this into the wheel well.

330
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:16,182
- Then you go inside and I don't know--
- Hank, I don't feel good about this.

331
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:19,685
I know that this kind of thing
is outside your comfort zone--

332
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:22,311
No, I mean it. This is a mistake.

333
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:25,528
Walt,
I need you to help me out here, okay?

334
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:27,449
This is really important to me.

335
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:30,945
Are you gonna make me beg?
Come on. Just stick it in there.

336
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:39,449
Yeah.

337
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:42,163
Just act normal.

338
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,375
May I help you?

339
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,494
I-- I--

340
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,336
Sir, may I help you?

341
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,712
I didn't do it. See?

342
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,470
- I didn't do it.
- Do it.

343
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,681
Do it.

344
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:52,139
May I help you with your order?

345
00:25:10,903 --> 00:25:12,374
What the hell is he...?

346
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:24,295
Just made sure it was secure.

347
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,134
Hey, where's my soda?

348
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,257
Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go.

349
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,649
Yes, that one.

350
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:09,288
I swear to God, I thought I was driving
the man to a gem and mineral show.

351
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:12,592
All of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant...

352
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,340
...and telling me
that he's investigating you.

353
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,389
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences...

354
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:20,508
...but I would never--

355
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:29,227
Look, my brother-in-law,
evidence-wise, has nothing.

356
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,730
He's operating on pure conjecture.

357
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,648
And no one, not one person
that he works with...

358
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,654
...thinks that you are anyone other
than an owner of a fast-food chain.

359
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,115
But if something were to happen
to Hank?

360
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:46,953
That would only draw their attention
to you and therefore, to me, as well.

361
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,578
We have a mutual interest
in resolving this without violence.

362
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:57,497
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

363
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,136
Jesse!

364
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,886
What? Oh, hey.
Don't wait to be, like, invited.

365
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,895
Are we alone?

366
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,652
- So where do we stand?
- Where do we stand on what?

367
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,775
Where do we stand with the thing
that you were supposed to do?

368
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,531
I assume you haven't done it.

369
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,401
You didn't lose it, did you?
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

370
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:34,245
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:38,579
Asshole. You're creaming
to get it done, go do it yourself.

372
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,078
If he didn't see me coming
like he's some kind of ...

373
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,756
All right, look.
Our timetable has advanced.

374
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:49,667
You have got to make this meeting
happen this week.

375
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,795
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.

376
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,926
Oh, tonight. What are you, high?

377
00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:01,098
My brother-in-law,
my DEA agent brother-in-law?

378
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,643
He's onto Gus.

379
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,901
Did you hear what I just said?
My brother-in-law is onto Gus.

380
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:17,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it,
your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.

381
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,954
Look. So, what if this is
like math or algebra?

382
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:31,461
We add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag...

383
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,162
...and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

384
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:37,548
I've got some math for you.

385
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:41,341
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

386
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:47,053
Hank, he's relentless, all right?
He won't quit.

387
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:50,304
Yeah, well, he's got nothing,
is all I can say.

388
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,688
- How would you know that?
- Because he's still above ground.

389
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:58,643
Think a dude like Gus would let
your boy anywhere near him?

390
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:01,814
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

391
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:07,740
So you haven't even seen him
since that time at the diner?

392
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,956
Okay.

393
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:19,587
Think. All right.

394
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:26,624
They've got to be figuring
that we've talked.

395
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:31,887
So you need to tell Mike that you
are worried about Hank's investigation.

396
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:35,432
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

397
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:40,518
And besides, you actually did kill Gale,
so there's that.

398
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:44,728
This is all good fodder for you
to request a sit-down with Gus...

399
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:48,359
...so you can discuss
what you would say for questioning.

400
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,655
Okay? Now, you just say
that you want to be--

401
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:55,815
No, that you need to be able
to be properly coached.

402
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:58,111
Then, when you're near him...

403
00:29:58,484 --> 00:29:59,825
...you put this to use.

404
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:04,242
Mike's just gonna tell me
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

405
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:08,208
- He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
- Well, then insist on it, damn it!

406
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:10,165
Act panicked.

407
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:12,339
Gus' ass is on the line.

408
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:15,337
He'll meet with you
if he thinks you're a liability.

409
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,502
No. He will waste me
if he thinks I'm a liability.

410
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:21,260
You know what?

411
00:30:21,462 --> 00:30:23,134
Whatever, man.

412
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:24,513
I'm gonna take a piss.

413
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:16,811
I think you got a phone call.

414
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,570
Anything important?

415
00:31:55,543 --> 00:31:58,177
- Yes?
- I did some digging around.

416
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:00,929
- And?
- Neither the DEA...

417
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:04,180
...nor the APD considers you
a person of interest.

418
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:07,231
Schrader is looking into you
totally on his lonesome.

419
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,228
- A voice in the wilderness.
- Does he have resources?

420
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:13,728
Just him, his credit card
and his chauffeur Walter.

421
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:18,405
He'd be committing career suicide if he
were to mention you to Merkert again.

422
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:22,116
- No warrant for that tracking device?
- No.

423
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:26,195
The guy has gone totally maverick.
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

424
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,250
We watch our backs,
we don't throw him any bones.

425
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,835
He'll never make a case.

426
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,001
- What about Chile?
- If! can't find any trace before '89...

427
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:37,587
...I seriously doubt Schrader can.

428
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:40,717
Seems to me
the bigger problem is the cartel.

429
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:44,711
Now, we can handle them
if that's all we've got on our plate.

430
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:49,758
But dealing with both Schrader
and the Mexicans at the same time?

431
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:54,225
If he happens to be watching
when they make a move...

432
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:57,358
...it could be the perfect storm.

433
00:32:57,763 --> 00:32:59,104
Thank you.

434
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,228
I'll be in touch.

435
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,388
I don't know how many grandmas
and grandpas we got.

436
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:37,806
Is there a couple of them
in viewing land?

437
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:41,636
Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka."

438
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:52,773
Hello, Hector.

439
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:00,782
The cartel has given me
its ultimatum.

440
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:03,120
To which I've said no.

441
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:10,794
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.

442
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,967
He's looking into my past.

443
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:32,724
Is today the day, Hector?

444
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:42,191
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

445
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:49,617
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.

446
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,621
Everything is going to be okay.

447
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:14,261
Are you crazy?

448
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,844
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!

449
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,222
What, you gonna tell?

450
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:21,435
And you?

451
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:23,981
They ain't gonna say nothing.

452
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,441
They like what they see.

453
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:44,331
You're not going to offer
our guests anything?

454
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,911
Who says they're guests?

455
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:50,873
If the boss wants them to drink...

456
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,502
...they drink.

457
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:00,800
So...the Chicken Brothers.

458
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,470
I like your restaurant.

459
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:10,649
Dark meat and white meat?

460
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,391
Don't look like no brothers to me.

461
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,110
At last!

462
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:19,901
The master chefs!

463
00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:22,700
You two ...

464
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:26,742
That chicken you cook ...

465
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:31,665
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest
chicken in all of Mexico.

466
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:33,373
Thank you, Don Eladio.

467
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:35,118
It's a great honor.

468
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,542
Max is the chef.

469
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:38,416
The compliments are all his.

470
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:40,122
Gustavo is too modest.

471
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,258
There'd be no restaurant without him.

472
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:45,714
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

473
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:50,219
Your chicken, it's so...zesty.

474
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:52,560
Piquant.

475
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:55,723
But it does not taste
like a Mexican style.

476
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:58,021
It's a recipe I learned in Chile...

477
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,020
...which I've modified a bit
for the Mexican palate.

478
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:05,945
I bet we like a little more chili
than you Chileans.

479
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:10,949
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

480
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,416
So...if your partner is the chef...

481
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:23,921
...then who are you?

482
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,464
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

483
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,090
I handle the business operations.

484
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,051
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

485
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,056
Es el businessman.

486
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:39,882
Good, good.

487
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:43,222
But tell me something.

488
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,103
That chicken, so fabulous...

489
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:50,060
...so excellent...

490
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,893
Besides that, what else
do you have on your menu?

491
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:55,405
We have several side dishes.

492
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,692
Rice. Beans.

493
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:00,483
Sometimes we prepare
a carnitas entrée...

494
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:03,496
...if we come across fresh beef
in the market.

495
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:05,827
Anything else?

496
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:08,494
Come on, be honest.

497
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:13,463
There is nothing else you offer?
A little taste of something else?

498
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,424
Something on the side?

499
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:21,422
Because when I send my men
to your restaurant...

500
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,715
...they come back
with more than just chicken.

501
00:38:26,296 --> 00:38:28,515
They come back with drugs.

502
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,394
Regresan high.

503
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,811
You are selling them narcotics.

504
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,814
Methamphetamine.

505
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:44,106
With all due respect, Don Eladio.

506
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:45,818
I didn't sell it to them.

507
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,824
I gave them samples.

508
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:50,239
Samples.

509
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:54,655
Some businessman.

510
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:58,411
I gave them samples to give to you.

511
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:01,622
To introduce you to our product.

512
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,962
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense.

513
00:39:04,454 --> 00:39:07,218
But he...that is to say we...

514
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:10,463
...could think of no other way
to get your attention.

515
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:13,720
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.

516
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:18,474
I know all about methamphetamine.

517
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:24,230
That's poor man's cocaine.

518
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:31,108
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

519
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:35,152
There's no money in it.

520
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,029
May I, Don Eladio ...

521
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,446
I am a biochemist by training.

522
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:42,196
The methamphetamine we make
is much superior...

523
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:45,701
...to the so-called biker crank
you know of.

524
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,663
It is crystallized, like glass.

525
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:49,250
Purer.

526
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,586
And the chirality of the molecule...

527
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:54,123
...its very structure, is different.

528
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,252
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

529
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:59,589
This product is the drug of the future.

530
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:02,550
It'll triple your profits.

531
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:04,840
Perhaps quadruple.

532
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:08,727
They're not only good cooks...

533
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:10,896
...they're great at shoveling manure.

534
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:22,315
Right now, you deal almost exclusively
with cocaine.

535
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:24,609
But the coca plant can't grow
in Mexico.

536
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:27,860
You are no more than middlemen...

537
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:30,037
...for the Colombians.

538
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:34,787
They cut you a percentage for
smuggling across the border.

539
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:40,914
But the lion's share
of the profits goes to them...

540
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:45,917
...despite your assumption
of all the risk.

541
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,678
This new crystal methamphetamine ...

542
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:53,765
it's stronger,
more addictive than cocaine...

543
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,353
...which means
it will move in higher volume.

544
00:40:57,551 --> 00:41:00,516
But most importantly,
it's completely artificial.

545
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:03,016
We can show you
how to manufacture it...

546
00:41:03,223 --> 00:41:04,350
...right here in Mexico.

547
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,780
And you keep all the profits.

548
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:14,576
My men do like your product.

549
00:41:17,986 --> 00:41:21,200
Hector, what is wrong with you?

550
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:24,833
Why did you not get glasses
for our guests?

551
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,920
Go on.

552
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,136
You are quite the talent.

553
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:40,177
I bet you learned cooking
from your mama. isn't that true?

554
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:46,185
But...what about the chemistry?

555
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:49,477
I studied at the University of Santiago.

556
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:51,892
Gustavo paid for my education.

557
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:53,142
Oh, really?

558
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:59,028
I have degrees in both biochemistry
and chemical engineering.

559
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:01,697
With minimal capital investment...

560
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,324
...we can set up
a factory-grade laboratory for you.

561
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:07,740
Train your own people
to manufacture large quantities...

562
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:09,784
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

563
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,248
Fantastic!

564
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:17,620
Tell me one thing, though.

565
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,298
If you're the cook ...

566
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,633
Why do I need him?

567
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:26,594
Señor?

568
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,048
You.

569
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,809
Businessman.

570
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,894
Why should I negotiate with someone
who doesn't respect me?

571
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,477
Who insults me by dealing
under my nose without my permission?

572
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:45,530
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

573
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,115
...in front of my own men?

574
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:52,533
What do I need you for?

575
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:56,247
Don Eladio. Please.

576
00:42:56,445 --> 00:42:58,082
I didn't sell anything.

577
00:42:58,364 --> 00:43:00,451
I apologise if you are offended...

578
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:03,836
...by my method
of obtaining this meeting.

579
00:43:04,202 --> 00:43:07,416
I merely took the initiative.

580
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:12,417
I meant no insult.

581
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:14,798
Don Eladio,
Gustavo didn't mean to offend.

582
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:16,682
I know Gustavo like a brother.

583
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,172
He's an honorable man.

584
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:21,098
The most loyal man I have ever known.

585
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,555
He rescued me
from the Santiago slums.

586
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:25,350
He made me the man I am today!

587
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,307
Gustavo is a genius.
He will make you millions!

588
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:32,027
Just find it in your heart to forgive him
this one small mistake.

589
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:33,902
Please...

590
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:36,696
He's my partner.

591
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:39,656
I need him! I swear to God!

592
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:17,147
Look at him.

593
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:18,855
You did this to him.

594
00:44:19,725 --> 00:44:22,904
Now, look at him.

595
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,211
Listen to me.

596
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:43,499
The only reason you are alive
and he is not...

597
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:48,009
...is because I know who you are.

598
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:49,884
But understand ...

599
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,555
You are not in Chile any more.

600
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:06,147
My advice ...

601
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:09,444
Stick to chicken.

602
00:45:46,675 --> 00:45:48,597
Look at me, Hector.

603
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:59,404
Look at me.

604
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:23,460
Maybe next time.
