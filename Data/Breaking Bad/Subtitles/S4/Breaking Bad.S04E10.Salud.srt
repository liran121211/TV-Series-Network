1
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:43,163
You can do this.

2
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:28,017
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

3
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:31,515
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

4
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:36,605
Third try.
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.

5
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,234
I really wanted to do this together
but I can hear him getting up.

6
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,325
It's not like I can keep him
from seeing the thing.

7
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,374
So, I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and I...

8
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:51,258
I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead
without you.

9
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:55,133
So call me.

10
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:03,561
- Hey.
- Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.

11
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:05,689
Thanks, Mom.

12
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,442
Of course,
I thought you might sleep through it.

13
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:13,199
So since it's almost, oh, noon...

14
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:18,705
...I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

15
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,622
- Pancakes?
- Pancakes it is.

16
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,336
Oh, could you do me a favour?

17
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:27,223
I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab it for me?

18
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,259
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:45,026
Surprise.

20
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:49,705
It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty slick, huh?

21
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:56,086
Yeah. Thanks, Mom. It's... It's great.

22
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,255
I really did a lot of research...

23
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,640
...and, I don't know,
this car just really stood out to me.

24
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:06,432
It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

25
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,435
It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with all your friends.

26
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,859
And, of course,
it is safe because I'm still your mother.

27
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:15,571
And it has a CD player...

28
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,575
...so you can listen to tunes
while cruising around.

29
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:24,416
So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
You wanna take it for a spin?

30
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,794
Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.

31
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:33,602
Yeah, okay. Well, let's...
Let's get those pancakes going.

32
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:39,186
Saul, he's here.

33
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:43,860
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

34
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,617
Saul?

35
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,489
Send him in.

36
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:56,168
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

37
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,423
- Hey.
- Yeah, hi.

38
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:01,510
Have a seat, please.

39
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:04,015
I...

40
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,268
I don't understand why I'm here.

41
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,931
- Something to do with my creditors?
- Creditors? No.

42
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:15,030
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
I have some bad news.

43
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:17,857
Nothing but lately.

44
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,569
Your Great-aunt Birgit passed away.

45
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:22,738
I'm sorry, who?

46
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:27,630
Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

47
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,213
And this was- Wow, eight years ago.

48
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:33,844
I just assumed you two were close,
given that...

49
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,215
Well, maybe this is good news.

50
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,179
Birgit left behind a sizeable estate...

51
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:43,815
...of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

52
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:45,024
What?

53
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:48,904
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting...

54
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:52,868
...while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

55
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,748
Well, I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg.

56
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:02,002
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

57
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,293
Well...

58
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:12,388
Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

59
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:15,016
They traced the inheritance
to your father.

60
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:19,021
But having passed- My condolences.
- You are the next in line...

61
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:26,041
...to the tune of $621,552.33.

62
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,897
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

63
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,113
Let's see how the cook goes first.

64
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,275
Who's the chemist?

65
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,289
Is this a joke?

66
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:01,955
He's asking if you're the chemist.

67
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:03,331
I'm one of them.

68
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:06,500
Okay, we've all met.

69
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,962
Let's get to work.

70
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:36,881
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

71
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,958
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

72
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,338
We synthesize it ourselves.

73
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,639
All the ingredients are here.

74
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,769
They synthesize their own.

75
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,060
What?

76
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,359
I don't do that.

77
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:58,195
What's the problem?

78
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:02,574
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

79
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,911
That's how I know how to do it.

80
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,209
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression
that the phenylacetic acid...

81
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,928
...would already be synthesized
upon his arrival.

82
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,352
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

83
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,684
What kind of amateur
have you brought us?

84
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,101
- What's he saying?
- We're working it out.

85
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,316
This is ridiculous.

86
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:28,275
I'm not letting some infant...

87
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,322
...who can't even synthesize
phenylacetic acid...

88
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,075
...teach me my business.

89
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,281
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product...

90
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:41,798
...he's gotta do it my way.
The right way.

91
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:48,422
I speak English.

92
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:51,592
So you understand
what "asshole" means.

93
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:56,607
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
asshole.

94
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,026
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

95
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,907
I don't know. I have no idea.
Several hours, at least.

96
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:08,120
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

97
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:10,577
Don't you have standards?

98
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:13,962
I mean, this place is disgusting.

99
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:18,756
All right, we're gonna scour every vat,
every tank, every cook surface.

100
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:25,595
We clean up every possible source
of contamination. And then we cook.

101
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:33,490
Who do you think you are?

102
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:39,573
I'm the guy your boss brought here
to show you how it's done.

103
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:42,914
And if this is how you run your lab,
no wonder.

104
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:48,257
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
Now, if you don't want that to happen...

105
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:54,843
...I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch, and do what I say.

106
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,749
Clean up!

107
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,293
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

108
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,422
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

109
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:24,588
Dad, you there?
I'm outside. Are you okay?

110
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:28,143
I know you're home, your car is here.

111
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:32,304
You missed my party which feels like
something's gotta be really wrong.

112
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:38,530
I... I'm gonna have to call 911.
I don't know what else to do.

113
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,463
Dad?

114
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,130
Come in, if you're coming in.

115
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,973
What happened to you?

116
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:11,108
What happened?

117
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,540
I got into a fight.

118
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:22,882
What do you mean, a fight?
Like-? What fight?

119
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,834
Are you gonna talk to me here?

120
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,058
What are you doing?

121
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,594
- I'm calling Mom.
- Don't do that.

122
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,105
Look, I...

123
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:40,937
I appreciate that you're concerned,
but I'm fine.

124
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,753
Just do not call your mother.

125
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,634
Why not?

126
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,513
Because...

127
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:03,968
...I was gambling.

128
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:10,645
If you tell your mother, I just -

129
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,818
I will never, never hear the end of it.

130
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:16,656
So please.

131
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:26,164
Can we just keep this between us?
Would you do that for me?

132
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:30,797
Just... Just keep it to yourself.

133
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:35,015
I don't understand.
How'd you get into a fight?

134
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,850
And with who?

135
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:54,623
I made a mistake.

136
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:04,301
It's my own fault.

137
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:12,317
- I had it coming.
- Dad...

138
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,521
...it's okay.

139
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,242
It's all my fault.

140
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,040
I just...

141
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,788
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,839
I'm sorry.

143
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,514
Dad.

144
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,222
Come here.

145
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:41,894
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

146
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,896
No. Hey, hey, no.

147
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:49,063
- It's okay. Come on, please. It's okay.
- No.

148
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:50,660
Look at me. Look at me.

149
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,997
It's okay. It is. Come on.

150
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,121
Come on.

151
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,544
Come on.

152
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,089
It's-It's okay.

153
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,517
Hey.

154
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,060
How was your birthday?

155
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:20,658
Good. Get some rest.

156
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,779
Okay.

157
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,741
The new car...

158
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,953
...did you drive it here?

159
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,125
Yeah.

160
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:37,013
That's good.

161
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,223
You like it?

162
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:46,564
Sure. I do.

163
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:49,905
It drives great.

164
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:52,780
That's good, Jesse.

165
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,009
Yes.

166
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,843
- Yes.
- Well done.

167
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:19,390
The first of many.

168
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:24,227
Yeah? What's that mean?

169
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:27,895
You're staying.
You belong to the cartel now.

170
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:39,953
You can't come to my work like this.
You're too recognisable.

171
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:45,085
Your face is plastered on every
bus bench within a five-mile radius.

172
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:49,089
Celebrities have to get their cars
washed just like everybody else.

173
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,635
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

174
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,764
- Okay?
- What is it?

175
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:57,933
Well, I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke. Right?

176
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:01,654
Which, I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

177
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,617
Yes, but it is better than prison,
correct?

178
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:09,367
Marginally. Which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

179
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:10,665
All right, good.

180
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,252
Yeah. I can't believe
he actually bought it.

181
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:16,040
Great-aunt Birgit. What?

182
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:19,631
But you called it. People see zeroes
dance before their eyes...

183
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,851
- ...it's like highway hypnosis.
- So, what's the problem?

184
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:26,930
Let's just say, you and I don't
wear the same rose-coloured glasses...

185
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:29,144
...where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned.

186
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,028
So I kept an eye on his bank accounts,
and pulled his credit report.

187
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:36,327
If you would, note the time on that.

188
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:43,205
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.

189
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:48,251
- Three hours after leaving my office.
- He bought a Mercedes SL550.

190
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,962
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4500 down.

191
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,974
He's gonna pay 1830 a month.

192
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,187
Fully loaded.
He even got the heated steering wheel.

193
00:20:56,397 --> 00:21:00,348
But that's upwards of 6300
that won't be going to the IRS.

194
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,566
I just thought you might like to know,
loath as I am to say, I told you so.

195
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,251
Where is he now?

196
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,039
Hey.

197
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,295
How you doing?

198
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,420
Good.

199
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:32,772
How are you?

200
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:38,113
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

201
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,606
I called her last night.

202
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,745
Oh, God.

203
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:47,825
I told her
I was spending the night at Louis'.

204
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:51,711
It's cool. So...

205
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:54,961
How are you?

206
00:22:57,432 --> 00:23:00,469
I'm fine, son. I...

207
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,358
I...

208
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:08,694
Well, I...

209
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:13,035
I took these painkillers
that I had leftover from my surgery...

210
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,867
...and I made the brilliant decision...

211
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:19,416
...to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

212
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:25,170
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit.

213
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:27,460
But I'm fine.

214
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:31,801
I wish I could take back last night.
It was your birthday.

215
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,772
- This shouldn't be on your mind.
- It's okay.

216
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:35,978
No, it's not okay.

217
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:41,780
I'm your father,
and I don't want last night to be...

218
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:46,037
I mean, you really...

219
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:51,252
...can't think of me like...

220
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:53,751
Like what?

221
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,469
I don't understand.

222
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:14,196
My father died when I was 6.

223
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:17,114
- You knew that, right?
- Yeah.

224
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,745
He had Huntington's disease. It's...

225
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,042
It destroys portions of the brain...

226
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,129
...affects muscle control...

227
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:33,763
...leads to dementia,
it's just a nasty disease.

228
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:35,512
It's genetic.

229
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:39,313
Terrified my mother
that I might have it...

230
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:44,107
...so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid, but I came up clean.

231
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:48,735
My father fell very ill when I was...

232
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,081
...four or 5.

233
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,961
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

234
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,545
My...

235
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:03,930
My mother would tell me
so many stories about my father.

236
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,180
She would talk about him
all the time.

237
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:10,638
I knew about his personality...

238
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,566
...how he treated people...

239
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,984
...I even knew how
he liked his steaks cooked.

240
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,775
Medium rare.

241
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:18,616
Just like you.

242
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:23,913
I knew things about my father.

243
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,585
I had a lot of information.

244
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:29,295
It's because people
would tell me these things.

245
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:32,759
They would paint this picture...

246
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,213
...of my father for me.

247
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,097
And I always pretended
that was who I saw too.

248
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:44,767
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.

249
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:49,566
In truth, I only have one real...

250
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,905
...actual memory of my father.

251
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,169
It must have been
right before he died.

252
00:25:58,713 --> 00:26:01,169
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him.

253
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:05,085
And I remember the smell
in there, the chemicals.

254
00:26:05,305 --> 00:26:08,010
It was as if they used up...

255
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:13,138
...every single cleaning product
they could find in a 50-mile radius.

256
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:17,649
Like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

257
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:21,492
There was this stench
of Lysol and bleach.

258
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:24,371
I mean, you could just feel it
coating your lungs.

259
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,252
Anyway, there lying on the bed...

260
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:31,419
...is my father.

261
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,294
He's all...

262
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:38,046
He's all twisted up.

263
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,261
And my mom...

264
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,730
...she puts me on her lap.

265
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:50,522
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

266
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:54,903
But really, he just scares me.

267
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:01,077
And he's looking right at me...

268
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,801
...but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

269
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,267
And your grandmother is talking...

270
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:18,601
...trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does...

271
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:22,405
...but the only thing
I could remember...

272
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,534
...is him breathing.

273
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,875
This...

274
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:35,914
This rattling sound.

275
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:39,710
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray paint can.

276
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:48,981
Like there was nothing in him.

277
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,198
Anyway...

278
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:03,076
...that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

279
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:11,801
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

280
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:19,314
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

281
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:24,107
Remembering you that way...

282
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,612
...wouldn't be so bad.

283
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:34,490
The bad way to remember you
would be the way...

284
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:38,082
The way you've been
this whole last year.

285
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,547
At least last night you were...

286
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,591
You were real, you know?

287
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:56,441
- Bye.
- Bye.

288
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,484
Somewhere you should be?

289
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:33,613
Well, basically
it was a temporary hiatus.

290
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,330
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 100 percent.

291
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,794
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

292
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,377
- Hi.
- Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

293
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:47,299
Okay. You bet.
Say hi to the kids for me.

294
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:49,474
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:52,885
Nice surprise. What's up?

296
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,561
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

297
00:29:55,775 --> 00:30:00,154
Well, things are...
Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.

298
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:01,402
Oh, yeah?

299
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,404
The universe is telling me something.
I got some good news.

300
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,660
Some very good news...

301
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,950
...and I'm getting the business
going again.

302
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:14,499
I figure we haven't been down long...

303
00:30:14,717 --> 00:30:17,885
...so we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

304
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,255
Oh, thank you. That's -

305
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,469
Gosh, that's...

306
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:25,438
That's wow.

307
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:27,974
How is that even possible?

308
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:34,529
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

309
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:37,529
I guess someone's
looking out for me.

310
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:39,290
I guess so.

311
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:44,416
Is that yours, outside?

312
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:46,921
Yeah, well, you know...

313
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:49,092
...I can't be driving a piece of crap.

314
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,297
You got to present
that successful image.

315
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:56,309
Right. So the IRS stuff.
That's resolved?

316
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,065
Yeah, it's in progress.

317
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,437
So you paid them?

318
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,775
Well, not yet. But I will.

319
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:03,817
When?

320
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:06,816
Well, it's not that simple.

321
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,125
Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

322
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:13,491
So I was thinking...

323
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:17,544
...I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

324
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:20,796
There will never
be a better deal, Ted.

325
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,302
The deal is you pay
your back taxes...

326
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:26,434
...you pay your penalty
and you don't go to prison.

327
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:29,600
That's a good deal. So...

328
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:31,524
Let's keep our priorities straight.

329
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:36,607
Well, my priority
is getting my business back.

330
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:41,239
And putting my employees back on the
payroll so they can pay the mortgages.

331
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:44,707
Right. But I think
your employees would agree...

332
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,040
...that you need to get
your financial situation in control...

333
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:50,333
...before you can help them.

334
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,924
Boy, the IRS
got you on commission?

335
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,630
I'm just saying that,
though I really understand...

336
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,805
...the temptation
to restart the business...

337
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,848
...maybe the universe is telling you...

338
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:03,557
...that you need to pay what you owe.

339
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,907
Skyler...

340
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,944
...this is my money.

341
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:16,331
Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

342
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:19,914
A decision you made, by the way.

343
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:23,383
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

344
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:27,261
- Ted, this affects both of us.
- No it doesn't.

345
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,053
I'm telling you to drop this.

346
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,891
You need to use that money
to pay your bill.

347
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:33,524
By the end of this month.

348
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,605
Which you promised
the IRS in writing that you would do.

349
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,573
It is that simple.

350
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:42,160
Okay.

351
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,158
Okay, duly noted.

352
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:46,916
What does that mean?

353
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:50,620
Does that mean yes? Because
I really need a yes here, Ted.

354
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,960
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means. It means...

355
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:56,965
...in the most respectful way possible,
there's the door.

356
00:32:57,223 --> 00:32:59,631
And I'm inviting you to, you know...

357
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:03,061
And thank you for your concern,
but I'm done talking about this.

358
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:36,099
From whom exactly do you think
you got that 600,000, Ted?

359
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:40,817
Great-aunt Birgit?

360
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:43,825
That was you?

361
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,572
Yeah.

362
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:25,831
What is this shit?

363
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,747
I don't get a vote?

364
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:30,382
I'm supposed to just
stay down here forever?

365
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:34,138
I promise you this:

366
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:38,476
Either we're all going home
or none of us are.

367
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,399
Now settle down.

368
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,075
On your feet.

369
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:47,858
Gustavo.

370
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:50,113
I'm so happy...

371
00:35:50,326 --> 00:35:53,577
...you finally came to your senses.

372
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:03,422
May I present the cook.

373
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,267
This is your new employer.

374
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,635
You address him as Don Eladio.

375
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:14,061
It's a term of respect.

376
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,353
Hello, young man.

377
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:24,156
He doesn't speak
a word of Spanish, does he?

378
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:26,198
And he's no chemist...

379
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:27,868
...I'll tell you that.

380
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:33,328
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

381
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:37,341
He cooks better meth than you do...

382
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:41,554
...with all your fancy
college degrees.

383
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:46,273
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

384
00:36:52,992 --> 00:36:55,614
What's in there?

385
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,537
A gift?

386
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:07,927
Gustavo, you're so generous.

387
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:10,255
It's a token of respect.

388
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,846
In honour of our renewed friendship.

389
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,443
Let's see what's in here.

390
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,285
No, impossible!

391
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:39,594
Zafiro Añejo!

392
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:41,467
Look at this.

393
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:45,182
Even the bottle is a work of art.

394
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:47,180
It's perfection!

395
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:49,433
Perhaps...

396
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,320
...it's too good to share.

397
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:54,403
What do you think, Gustavo?

398
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:58,987
It's yours to do with as you choose.

399
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:04,289
I choose...

400
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:06,289
...to drink it!

401
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,394
Careful.

402
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:25,652
That's beautiful stuff.

403
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:27,489
If you spill a drop...

404
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,859
...I'll cut off your hand.

405
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:33,114
Come on, hurry up.

406
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,203
Gustavo.

407
00:38:40,968 --> 00:38:44,587
Welcome to Mexico.

408
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,342
Now you say:

409
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:55,398
This one's an addict.

410
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:57,985
To work, he must be sober.

411
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:01,568
None for you!

412
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,656
Enough business!

413
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,080
Bring the girls!

414
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,536
No. No, no, I don't...

415
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,692
Gustavo.

416
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,821
Cheer up, man.

417
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:38,283
Gustavo...

418
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:40,705
...I'm not angry.

419
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:43,795
I had to spank you.

420
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:46,960
But what choice did I have?

421
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:51,168
Look, once every 20 years...

422
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:53,679
...you forget your place.

423
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:03,520
There's no place for emotion in this.

424
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:07,649
You of all people should understand.

425
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:11,578
Business is business.

426
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:15,246
If you'll excuse me.

427
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,879
- Where are you going?
- To use your bathroom.

428
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:20,043
If I may.

429
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:25,182
Miguel!

430
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,803
Show Gustavo the pisser.

431
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,897
And make sure he doesn't get lost.

432
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:41,328
Hurry up.

433
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:17,577
Make yourself useful. Find a gun.

434
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:41,565
Don Eladio is dead!

435
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,025
His capos are dead!

436
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:49,744
You have no one left to fight for!

437
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:52,620
Fill your pockets...

438
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,625
...and leave in peace!

439
00:44:56,045 --> 00:44:58,371
Or fight me...

440
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:00,127
...and die!

441
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:03,801
I hope to hell that works.

442
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:05,639
Take him.

443
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:30,621
Keys.

444
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:34,719
No. No.

445
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,094
Okay. Okay.

446
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:44,984
Hey. Hey, you still with us?

447
00:45:45,194 --> 00:45:46,605
Go.

448
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,842
Kid, get us out of here, kid.

449
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,348
Come on.
