<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,383
I need you all outside
to do some wipe outs.

3
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:06,702
Wipe down this!

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,678
I heard you broke
new ground today.

5
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:13,147
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes.
Yeah, I guess I broke new ground.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,316
You worked here four years.
It's a story people would believe.

7
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:17,836
This is what we buy.

8
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,294
Slow down.
Oh God!

9
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,480
At the first opportunity
Gus will kill us.

10
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,262
So? How does it look?

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,164
You mean, in do I see it?

12
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:43,767
Yes.

13
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:46,774
Do you see it?

14
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:51,884
Basically, any lawman
worth his salt's

15
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,418
going to spot that, yeah.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,153
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

17
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:59,122
Yes.
It's a deal breaker.

18
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:06,734
Well, if stealth is what
you're aspiring to,

19
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:10,470
you best go with something
more compact--

20
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,339
.38 Special,

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,674
snub nose.

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,742
Got a concealed hammer

23
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,277
so it doesn't catch
on your belt when you draw.

24
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,613
Tried and true,
no nonsense about it.

25
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,417
Five shots?
Yep.

26
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:28,351
Automatic has how many?

27
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:31,020
Ten in the mag,
one in the chamber.

28
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,688
If you can't get it done
with five,

29
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:34,256
then you're into spraying prey,

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,557
in which case I wouldn't
count on another six

31
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,825
closing the deal.

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,429
You load that
with 158 grain hollow points

33
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:43,131
instead of your standard
wad cutters.

34
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,066
It's got plenty
of stopping power.

35
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:49,305
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,209
Here.
Um...

37
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,712
Try it on with this.

38
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:01,887
That snub,
you'll conceal real nice

39
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,955
if you carry it I-W-B.

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,057
Little harder to draw from,

41
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,926
but there's really
no substitute

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,896
if you're intent of fooling
a vigilant eye.

43
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,733
Comes in polymer, too.

44
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:15,335
I prefer the feel of leather.

45
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,204
Old school, I guess.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,674
Yeah, um...

47
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,310
You sure it's on
the correct side?

48
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:25,246
If you're right-handed,
it is.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,947
I don't know, ma--
Are you sure

50
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,816
because maybe it'll feel
better on the left side.

51
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,486
General rule--
You don't want to cross draw,

52
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,855
not unless
you're going to be sitting,

53
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,658
you know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

54
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,536
Either way you're going to want
to practice your draw...

55
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,938
a lot...

56
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,206
because if you're all fingers,

57
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,142
well, it might could be him

58
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,509
keeping a piece instead of you.

59
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,844
Catch my drift?

60
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,950
What's this?

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,786
That there is why
you're going to pay me

62
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,256
five times what you'd pay
your neighborhood gun store.

63
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,228
Serial number
has been filed off.

64
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,866
So...

65
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,401
to state the obvious,

66
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,204
I don't want to be
caught with this on me.

67
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,806
No, sir, to state
the obvious, you don't.

68
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,909
You know, Mister,
I've been providing my services

69
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,511
for the past 30-odd years.

70
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,979
You'd think in that time

71
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,148
I'd learn better than to ask
a man his business,

72
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,550
especially about one
referred by the lawyer,

73
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,919
but I do feel the urge
to ask you,

74
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,588
we strictly talking
defense here?

75
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,027
Yes, absolutely defense.

76
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,397
Why?

77
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,402
Because if it's just
personal protection,

78
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,338
aside from a bucket of money,

79
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,308
you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot

80
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,510
for carrying a weapon
with a defaced serial number

81
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,345
if you'd just buy it legally.

82
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,548
Yeah, but...

83
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,050
if you did have to use it,

84
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,385
wouldn't it still be better

85
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,153
to use one
that couldn't be traced?

86
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,888
This is the west, boss.

87
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,558
New Mexico's
not a retreat jurisdiction.

88
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,027
Man steps to you
bent on doing bodily harm,

89
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,463
you've got every right
to plant your feet

90
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,198
and shoot to kill.

91
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,800
Some call it a moral right,

92
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,002
and I do include myself
within that class.

93
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,005
All this to say

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,809
I'm happy to take your money,

95
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,213
but if you're not
a convicted felon,

96
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,348
you might best be advised

97
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:44,184
to bear your arms within
the confines of the law.

98
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,259
It's for defense.

99
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,734
Defense.

100

181
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,489
Amps them up like they've
been smoking the schwag!

182
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,458
Apples and oranges, bro.

183
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,860
Totally unfair
to compare the two.

184
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,699
Yo, Jesse,

185
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,701
where do you come out
on all this?

186
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,771
Ha ha! Ohh...

187
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,706
Agree, totally.

188
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,388
Did that just happen?

189
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,925
Damn, man.

190
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,693
It's quiet.

191
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,699
You know what this--
This place needs?

Fine.

Can't you sleep?

198
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,156
Actually, yes, Marie.
This is me sleeping.

What's it look like?

200
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,660
Looks like you're
looking at a rock

201

202
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,734
This is not a rock.
This is a mineral,

203
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,603
for, like, the tenth time.

204
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,474
Okay. Got it.

205
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:53,210
Blue corundum, to be precise.

206
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,547
Blue corundum.
Well, it's very pretty.

207
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,183
It's encrusted
with igneous biotite

208
00:14:58,218 --> 00:14:59,551
in a mica schist.

209
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:00,953
Would you like
some more detail?

210
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,755
Because I can give it to you.

211

it's 2 in the morning.

I'm just...asking if maybe--

217
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:28,082
You know, when last
I counted, Marie,

218
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:30,318
there were four bedrooms
in this house.

00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:38,794

Wait. Are you screening
all my calls?

242

No. No. No. I just--

243
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,616
What are you thinking,
leaving a message like that

244
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,851
<i>on my machine?</i>

245
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:10,620
What are you--
What did I say?

246
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,424
You just left recorded proof

247
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,526
of our intention
to buy a car wash.

248
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,794
Now you think that was wise?

249
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,063
Proof of our what?
What are you talking about?

250
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:24,034
Skyler, we should not even be
mentioning the words "car wash"

251
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:25,902
on the phone at all, period.

252
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:29,072
Walt, it is a car wash,
not a brothel.

<i>I mean, if we can't
even say what it is,</i>

254
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,376

No, no, no, no, no.
I will handle it, okay?

264

transplant right now.

00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:18,396
You want to go full-time?

364
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,031
We've got a spare bedroom.

365
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:21,866
I'll see you tomorrow.

366
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,642
Wow.

367
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:33,411
You were so strong today.

368
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:34,679
Did you work up an appetite?

369
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:36,247
I'm sure that you did.

370
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:38,883
Listen, I was thinking
about cooking tonight.

371
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,418
So--
Marie.

372
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:43,554
Get out.

373
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:58,505
<i>♪ </i>

374
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,282
Oh, yo, about time.

375
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,650
Oh, my God.

376
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:14,289
Yo, what's up with the pie,
man? It ain't cut.

377
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,159
Yeah. Right.
That's the gimmick.

378
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:18,560
What gimmick?
This place.

379
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:19,727
They don't cut their pizza,

380
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:21,662
and they pass the savings
on to you.

381
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,965
What savings?
How much can it be to cut a damn pizza?

382
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,533
Maybe it's, like,
democratic, bro, you know?

383
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:29,637
Cut your own Christmas tree.
Cut your own pizza.

384
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,305
Yeah. It's democratic.

385
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,407
What am I supposed
to do with this?

386
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,675
Don't sweat it, yo.

387
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:37,145
You got some, like, scissors?

388
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,114
I will cut this bitch up good.

389
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:42,485
Yo, come in!

390
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,354
Hey, would you mind?

391
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:48,924
I figure you make, like,
10 million pizzas a year.

392
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,694
Each pizza takes,
like, 10 seconds to cut.

393
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:55,197
In man hours, that's--

394
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,532
I don't know.

395
00:26:58,601 --> 00:26:59,601
A lot?

396
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:00,669
[Pete] Hey, Jesse.

397
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:01,703
Huh.

398
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:05,007
You got, um, yeah.

399
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,435
So, uh, how you doing?

400
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,406
I'm dealing.

401
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,609
How's Brock?

402
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,333
Good. He's...

403
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:48,551
Brock, honey,
wait in the car, okay?

404
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,952
Let the grownups speak.

405
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:52,321
Go on, little man.
We'll catch up later.

406
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:00,195
Guess you know
I've been calling.

407
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:05,901
Yeah, um, I'm really
busy at work and--

408
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:10,606
Jesse, I'm not here to make
you come up with excuses.

409
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:12,809
You got other things going on.

410
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:14,778
I get it.

411
00:28:14,812 --> 00:28:17,515
There's just one thing
you and me got to talk about.

412
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:20,852
And that's this.

413
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:23,755
After Tomás was murdered,

414
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:24,890
two dudes from the block,

415
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:26,558
a couple bangers
he used to hang with,

416
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:28,727
get run over,
one of them shot in the head.

417
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:32,931
Same night,
I get this in my mailbox.

418
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:40,639
This was you?

419
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:53,387
You know what?

420
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,990
Whatever it is you had to do
with my brother's killers,

421
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:57,325
I don't want to know.

422
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,762
But you got to tell me
one thing.

423
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:03,365
Is someone gonna come
looking for this?

424
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:07,635
No.

425
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:16,943
What exactly am I
supposed to do with this?

426
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:18,879
Use it to get you and Brock

427
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:22,082
out of that shit hole
of a neighborhood.

428
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:25,285
Or you can go out
and spend it on glass,

429
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,087
and I'd have no way
of stopping you.

430
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,059
But I got to believe
you won't do that.

431
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,262
<i> Go home, Walter.</i>

432
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:46,926
How you doing?

433
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:50,062
Hi.

434
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:51,564
Ton of bricks?

435
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,167
Rocks.

436
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,105
You, uh, want me
to wheel them inside for you?

437
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,340
Thank you.

438
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:10,383
Marie, is that my minerals?

439
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,984
Yes, Hank.

440
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:13,152
How many boxes?

441
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,453
I don't know--

442
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:17,389
Three, four, a hundred,

443
00:33:17,424 --> 00:33:19,458
a million.

444
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:20,726
I don't know.

445
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,361
Did you check them for damage?

446
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:23,962
[whispering] Oh, my God.

447
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:27,132
They're rocks, Hank.

448
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,233
No, they're minerals.

449
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:29,868
Jesus, Marie, I got
some geodes coming

450
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:32,237
that are very delicate,
all right?

451
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:34,840
And I will not accept
any boxes that have damage.

452
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,541
Those delivery jackoffs,
I'm telling you--

453
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:38,844
I'm not getting ass raped
by those bastards, all right?

454
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:39,878
Just--

455
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:43,848
Honey, would you check?

456
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:46,784
Just check, please?

457
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,031
[Man] Hey, you, too much wax.

458
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,666
Stop wasting it.

459
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,635
Look, tell your brother

460
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,370
that if he doesn't
show up tomorrow,

461
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,671
I'm going to have to fire him.

462
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:11,442
So now go back.
And no more excuses.

463
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:15,078
Mr. Wolynetz,
my name is Skyler White.

464
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:16,479
How do you do?

465
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:25,555
You want to buy my car wash.

466
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,959
I do. And I am prepared
to talk numbers right now,

467
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,193
if you'd like.

468
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:32,895
Do you think
this is an easy job?

469
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,833
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees

470
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,603
and scrub like a house maid

471
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:43,507
with all the chemicals
eating into your nice skin

472
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,909
and stinging in your eyes?

473
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:48,714
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

474
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:50,315
Any other advice for me?

475
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,184
Because
I am serious about this.

476
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:53,553
Good.

477
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:56,022
I am serious, too.

478
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:58,390
I have worked 30 years

479
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:00,326
of building this business
from nothing,

480
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,027
with my own hands

481
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:03,728
and my own sweat and blood.

482
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:06,898
I can appreciate that, truly.

483
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,299
So, with that in mind,

484
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,068
is there a figure
you can quote me?

485
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:12,970
One which you think
would adequately--

486
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:14,538
$10 million.

487
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:26,217
Well, let's try 879,000.

488
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,885
Where do you come up
with this number?

489
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,620
You pull it from your behind?

490
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,693
On a typical day,

491
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:38,328
you manage 19 cars per hour.

492
00:35:38,362 --> 00:35:40,930
Extrapolating,
I added the extra revenues

493
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:42,565
for hand waxes and detailing,

494
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,367
subtracted your overhead
and salary and maintenance,

495
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:47,536
operating fees, depreciation,

496
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,705
which I obtained
from comparable businesses

497
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,006
in the Albuquerque area,

498
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,543
giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here,

499
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:57,913
to which I applied the
industry standard multiplier

500
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,982
and added the market value
of your real estate,

501
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:04,721
giving me a total estimated
value of $829,000,

502
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:09,993
on top of which I generously
added an extra $50,000...

503
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:13,564
so as not to be insulting.

504
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,634
$20 million.

505
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:20,305
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz,
this--

506
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,907
This is the price
for Walter White.

507
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:25,944
Ah.
Oh, yes.

508
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:27,946
You don't think
I know who you are?

509
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,447
I remember.

510
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:32,417
Well, I have not
pretended to be any--

511
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:35,753
Your husband, he quit
without giving me notice.

512
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:37,855
He broke my air fresheners.

513
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,692
He cursed at me
and grabbed himself.

514
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:43,094
And now he wants to buy
my car wash.

515
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:44,562
But he's not man enough

516
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,664
to come in here
and face me himself.

517
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:48,299
Instead, he sends his woman.

518
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,600
Excuse me?

519
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:51,702
Walter White wants
to buy my car wash.

520
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:55,939
The price he pays
is $20 million.

521
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:57,274
Now please leave.

522
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:13,489
<i>Have you recently
lost a loved one</i>

523
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,258

542
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:53,234
<i>Se habla español.</i>

543
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,361
You might want to learn
how to tail better

544
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:20,963
if you're planning
on making a habit of it.

545
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,601
May I buy you a drink?

546
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,471
Next round, when you're done.

547
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:34,609
Why not? You make a hell
of a lot more than I do.

548
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,551
Uh, another round for him,

549
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:45,054
and I'll have the same.
No ice.

550
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:58,099
I feel like I need
to explain myself.

551
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:00,101
There were some actions
that I took

552
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:02,103
which I want you to understand.

553
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:07,275
I didn't want any of this
to happen.

554
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:10,879
Everything I did

555
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:13,948
I did out of loyalty
to my partner,

556
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:18,386
and then, later, of course,

557
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:21,122
it was purely
out of self-defense.

558
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:24,058
I hope you can
appreciate that...

559
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:27,529
just like I appreciated
that, uh--

560
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:35,538
I appreciate that when
you were going to kill me

561
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:37,740
you were simply
following orders.

562
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:39,742
I get that completely.

563
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,312
And I harbor no ill will.

564
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:46,249
Well, there's a load
off my mind.

565
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,185
Mike,
I'm trying to tell you--

566
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,553
I get it.

567
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,189
Fine.

568
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,157
Drink up, Walter.

569
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,173
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

570
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,045
Makes a man wonder
exactly where he stands.

571
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,551
Huh.

572
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:26,155
I mean, I--

573
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:29,992
I cannot be alone
in feeling this way.

574
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,162
Not after what happened
to Victor.

575
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,933
So...

576
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,804
what's with the piece?

577
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:44,906
Right hip
inside your waistband.

578
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:47,676
I noticed it the other
day at the lab.

579
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,213
You wear it if it
makes you feel better,

580
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,615
but if push comes to shove,
it's not going to help.

581
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:56,219
Mike, do I have to come
right out and say this?

582
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:01,558
You and I,
we're in the same boat.

583
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,993
Drink your drink.

584
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,229
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

585
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,431
And-- And what the hell
was that anyway?

586
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,901
Hmm? A message?

587
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,871
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

588
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,339
You won, Walter.

589
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,609
You got the job.

590
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,378
Do yourself a favor

591
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,181
and learn to take yes
for an answer.

592
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:28,385
Yeah, I got the job,
but for how long?

593
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:36,694
Get me in a room with him.

594
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:41,065
Mike, just get me in a room,

595
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,634
and I'll do the rest.

596
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,842
You done?

597
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,249
Yeah.

598
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,023
Ohh!

599
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,259
Oof!

600
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,361
Ohh!

601
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:34,251
Thanks for the drink.

602
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,322
Ahh.

603
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:51,703
Hey, my man, you know
how to party, brother.

604
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,339
Epic! Epic!

605
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:57,142
Uh, seriously, where
are you two going?

606
00:42:57,176 --> 00:43:01,480
Jesse, I've been awake for,
like, three straight days.

607
00:43:01,514 --> 00:43:03,549
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

608
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:07,252
So crash here. It's not
like I ain't got the space.

609
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:08,721
Yeah, that's cool and all,

610
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:11,323
but I think I got,
like, this cat.

611
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,494
I think I'm, like,
supposed to feed it.

612
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:16,728
Whatever, you little bitch.

613
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:18,964
What about you?
You sticking,

614
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:20,632
or do I got to flip you over

615
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,301
and check you for a slizz?

616
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:24,536
Bro, I'm kind of
pushing flowers here, yo.

617
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,505
I ain't proud of it,
but it's God's honest truth.

618
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,343
Hell, brother, you know
we got man love for you.

619
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,811
Now that you're
back in the mix,

620
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:35,848
it's like nothing
but good days ahead.

621
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:40,653
Plenty of time to pace it
out is all I'm saying.

622
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:41,754
Yeah.

623
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,189
Yeah, man.

624
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:45,458
Totally.

625
00:43:48,096 --> 00:43:50,831
I was thinking,
like, next week?

626
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,668
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.

627
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:55,737
Are we cool?

628
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,572
We are cool.
