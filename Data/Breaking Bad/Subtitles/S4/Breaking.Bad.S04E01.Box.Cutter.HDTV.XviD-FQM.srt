<i>Last season on
AMC's Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:03,539
You're a drug dealer.

3
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:05,302
I'm a manufacturer.
I'm not a dealer.

4
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,750
Grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

5
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,506
- You're my new lab assistant.
- Gale Boetticher.

6
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,350
They're assassins. I believe
I was their prime target.

7
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:15,864
They were steered away
from me to my brother in law.

8
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:19,848
- It's tens of thousands of dollars.
- We have the money.

9
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:22,567
- You are not in this.
- How I am not in this?

10
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,415
I was wondering how soon you might
be able to take over the lab yourself.

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,131
It comes down to
you and me versus him.

12
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,890
I'm sorry, but
it's gonna be him.

13
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:31,562
They got me in the laundry
and they're going to kill me.

14
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:32,661
Do it!

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,194
Just what the hell was that?

16
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,599
You might wanna hold off.

17
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:37,771
Why?

18
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,774
Because your boss
is gonna need me.

19
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:29,779
How's it coming?

20
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,182
Very, very well.

21
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:36,353
It's a flurry of deliveries.

22
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,689
Feels like Christmas morning.

23
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,892
Ah, it's exciting.

24
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,396
It's really coming together.

25
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,098
And I would like to point out

26
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:49,069
that if you have any
very understandable questions

27
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:50,604
about the price tag...

28
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,910
That sound-- Quality.

29
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:57,846
At Pfizer, at Merck,

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,448
that unit would be
right at home.

31
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:02,350
That goes for all of it.

32
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:05,120
Good.

33
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:06,955
I want you to have
what you need.

34
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,493
Oh. Well, I doff
my proverbial cap to you, sir.

35
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,495
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

36
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,764
Within a month, I'd say.

37
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,100
Two weeks.

38
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:23,808
Uh, yeah, two weeks.

39
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:25,976
Good. Very good.

40
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,244
By the way,

41
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,814
that sample
you asked me to run,

42
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:34,286
I ran it, and it is quite good.

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,788
Thank you very much, Gale.

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,323
You can give that
to Victor to discard.

45
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,058
Uh, sure.

46
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,560
Is that our competition?

47
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,928
I'm sorry?

48
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,563
The, uh...

49
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,999
It really is quite good.

50
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,767
The purity, of course,
I'm speaking of,

51
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,203
speaking strictly
in chemical terms.

52
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,172
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color,

53
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:59,245
but, uh... if that
is our competition,

54
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,514
we have our work
cut out for us,

55
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,316
so to speak.

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,118
You don't have
any competition, Gale,

57
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,887
not as far as I'm concerned.

58
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,123
After all,
how pure can pure be?

59
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:14,495
Well, it can be
pretty darn pure.

60
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:19,200
Mr. Fring,
I can guarantee you

61
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:23,037
a purity of 96%.
I'm proud of that figure.

62
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,473
It's a hard-earned
figure, 96.

63
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:29,211
However, this other
product is 99,

64
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,714
maybe even a touch beyond that.

65
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:36,351
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph

66
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,054
to say for sure, but, uh,

67
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:43,492
that last 3%, it may
not sound like a lot,

68
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,660
but it is.

69
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:47,796
It's tremendous.

70
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,399
It's a tremendous gulf.

71
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,868
Gale, for our purposes,

72
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:57,439
96% will do just fine.

73
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,576
Please, don't let this
trouble you.

74
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,647
Yeah. It's just...

75
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:07,685
I'd love to know
who synthesized it

76
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,153
is all.

77
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:13,958
A man who wants
to work with me.

78
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:16,160
A trained chemist,
like yourself.

79
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:18,796
But it won't happen.

80
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,265
I don't consider him
a professional.

81
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:27,903
If he's not, I don't know
what that makes me.

82
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:30,473
I'm not trying to talk
myself out of a job.

83
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:34,076
With this person,
there are other considerations.

84
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:38,915
His is the best I've
ever seen, hands down.

85
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,254
And I look at this
place that you've built,

86
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,457
the money you're investing,

87
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:49,127
sparing no expense.

88
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,163
And I know--

89
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,236
I know that you want the best.

Apartment 6.

93
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,000
No, no. Eubank's west.

94
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,502
It's between Eubank and Spain,

95
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:06,738
But Mazatlan's closest.

96
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,675
I don't know.
I just heard the one,

97
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,944
just the one single, like,
you know, like a backfire,

98
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,379
like a truck backfiring.

99
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,747
I came out of my apartment--

100
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,415
A couple of us came out.

101
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,850
No. No, nobody saw it.

102
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:20,652
Did you guys see anybody?

103
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,020
Guys, did you?

104
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,188
I don't know if they
speak English too good.

105
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:25,256
They're just
shaking their heads.

106
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,557
I don't think they saw anybody.

107
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:27,825
It was just this one loud--

108
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,328
This-- This very loud pop,
and that was all.

109
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,463
No arguing or like that.

110
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,032
So you guys good
in directions there?

111
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,334
You want me to--

112
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:41,272
They coming east or west?

113
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,740
If they're heading east,

114
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,877
tell them there's an Exxon
on their left-hand side.

115
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,746
Then it's straight residential.

116
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,548
You want me to what? Yeah.

117
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,651
No. I'll stay on the line.

118
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,124
You know him?

119
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:59,793
We all heard this shot.

120
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,861
Hey, I don't think
you ought to go in there.

121
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,196
Mister, this is a crime scene.

122
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,998
You don't want
to touch anything.

123
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,299
Mister--

124
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,236
Mister, are you
listening to me?

125
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,589
You little bastard.

126
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:34,726
Drive.

127
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,329
Drive!

128
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:13,724
What the hell happened?

129
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:16,694
He's gone?

130
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:20,031
Look at me.

131
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:21,833
Gone?

132
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,200
You sure?

133
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,669
Gone?

134
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:27,738
Splattered all over.

135
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,940
Oh, Jesus.

136
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,075
Oh, shit.

137
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,779
All right.

138
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,415
So...

139
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,583
Shit.

140
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,219
All right, you do a sweep?

141
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,121
I couldn't.
People there.

142
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:46,858
People?

143
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:49,427
He get himself seen
by these people?

144
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:50,762
What about you?

145
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,167
What about you?

146
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,636
Yeah. So what?

147
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:01,173
Just another looky-loo.

148
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,787
I guess I'd better
get this over with.

149
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,417
Hey.

150
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:48,253
Oh, geez,
I-- I-- I woke you up.

151
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,888
I woke you up.
No, no, no. It's okay.

152
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,290
I needed to get up anyway.

153
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,859
Are you coming in?

154
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,495
No, no. It's kind of my
only time to run errands.

155
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,130
I just needed to--
Ah.

156
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I--

157
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,670
Sorry.

158
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,173
It's okay.

159
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:11,678
And thank you,
big time, as always.

160
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:16,750
They seem to be getting
bigger instead of smaller,

161
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:20,219
and I'm not really sure
what that's all about.

162
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:22,589
Please, for God's sake,

163
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:25,525
tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you guys.

164
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,859
Absolutely not, okay?

165
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,260
It's absolutely fine.

166
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:29,495
Okay.

167
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:37,036
Does this mean
what I think it means?

168
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:39,539
What?

169
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,208
You and Walt?

170
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,544
What?

171
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,412
His car's
parked in the driveway.

172
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:46,680
It's not a state secret.

173
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:49,584
I-- uh, all right.
Okay. I'm not pressing.

174
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:51,452
I just--

175
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,254
I think that it's great.

176
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:55,423
That's all, all right?

177
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,158
I'm out of here.
Okay.

178
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,426
Oh, hey.

179
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,096
A big howdy-do
to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

180
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,888
Oh. Hey.

181
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,123
Breakfast?

182
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,524
Yeah.

183
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,692
Yeah? Okay.

184
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,434
All right.
What do you want?

185
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,459
All right, look.

186
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,763
So I make it 10 to 9,
which means--

187
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:17,699
Shut up.

188
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,270
Which means we need

189
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,306
to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes

190
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,175
to keep
to our schedule--

191
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,777
Gus' schedule.

192
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,515
And as angry as he may be,

193
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,817
I don't believe he's willing

194
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,885
to forfeit an entire batch.

195
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,088
That just might
make him angrier.

196
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,094
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

197
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:47,197
Isn't that what this
whole thing is about?

198
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:01,073
That's right, genius.
Watch me.

199
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,442
We ain't missing no cook.

200
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:30,046
We're closed!

201
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,048
Closed!

202
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:14,522
Saul Goodman and Associates.

203
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:17,125
I'll see if he's in.
Please hold.

204
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,230
Saul, Skyler White calling.

205
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:26,268
Saul.

206
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,784
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

207
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,652
Saul!

208
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:46,920
Hey.

209
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:49,223
Skyler White.

210
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,658
What the hell does she want?

211
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,734
Uh, h-he's nowhere
to be found.

212
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:01,902
I called his condo.

213
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,570
I called every number
I have for him.

214
00:19:03,604 --> 00:19:04,971
<i>Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.</i>

215
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:06,840
You're sure?

216
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:09,509
As in you know where he is?

217
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,311
Well, I'm not the man's keeper,

218
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,179
but, uh, Walt's a big boy.

219
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,580
He'll turn up.

220
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:16,315
<i>Mr. Goodman, clearly
something is going on here.</i>

221
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,150
I mean, why would he leave
his car in my driveway?

222
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,685
People carpool to work, right?

223
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,587
It's good for the environment.

224
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,755
<i>He carpools?</i>

225
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,424
He carpools to his job
at a meth lab?

226
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,327
Hey, whoa! Ho ho!
You're breaking up there.

227
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:32,063
I didn't quite catch
that last-- Whoo!

228
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:33,465
<i>You're a chatty Cathy today.</i>

229
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,433
Okay, do you know anything?

230
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,168
Anything at all?

231
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:39,204
I'm looking for some help here.

232
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,807
<i>Look, Walter is fine, okay?</i>

233
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,743
I guarantee that 100%.

234
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:48,179
100%.

235
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,919
You got a passport, right?

236
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,130
Yeah. Uh, Albuquerque.

237
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:41,499
I'm in, uh, Nob Hill.

238
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:44,402
I need the number
for a locksmith.

239
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,905
I don't know. Pick one.

240
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,140
You sure there's nothing?

241
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:49,575
No, it's not even me.

242
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,877
It's state law, really.

243
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,879
Are you sure there isn't
some sort of,

244
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:54,913
I don't know, um--

245
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,149
No. Nothing.

246
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:58,784
Maybe, uh, a car registration.

247
00:20:58,818 --> 00:20:59,952
That would have your address.

248
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:01,820
No, but I can't even
get in my car.

249
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:03,256
My car keys
were on the same ring.

250
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:06,625
My God, my-- My--
My credit cards,

251
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,093
my-- It's all right,
sweetheart.

252
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:10,095
My driver's license,
my checkbook.

253
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,930
I have to start
canceling all that--

254
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,398
My whole life
was in that purse,

255
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:16,234
and he just came, and he cut
it right off my shoulder.

256
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:18,169
We could have been stabbed.

257
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:19,704
I'm sorry, really.

258
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,340
But without
proof of residency--

259
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:24,576
I can take you down to my shop.

260
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,810
You're welcome to wait there,

261
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,045
file a police report.

262
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,747
I can't believe this.

263
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:30,548
I cannot believe this day.

264
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,083
I know. It's just...

265
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:33,485
the law.

266
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,353
Oh, my God.

267
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,422
My identification.
I-- It's gone.

268
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,961
Oh, God, not--
Not this second.

269
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,196
Call the pharmacy. I--

270
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,964
Are you okay?

271
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,066
Please, just--
Please, just take her.

272
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,601
Just take her, please.

273
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:53,271
Oh. Oh, God.

274
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:54,605
Not now.

275
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,177
No. No. No.

276
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,053
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
Truly.

277
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:09,421
Here you go, sweetheart.

278
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,189
Oh, there you go.

279
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:16,695
Um, how do you, um,

280
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,564
how do you want to deal
with the bill?

281
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:22,968
I-- Unfortunately, all
my cash was taken, so--

282
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,537
That's fine.
We'll mail it to you.

283
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:27,607
Will you? You do know
where I live, right?

284
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:30,610
Sir, again, thank you so much.

285
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:31,945
Really.
Yeah.

286
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:21,989
Hey, there! I'm back!

287
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:29,731
How was P.T.?

288
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:36,105
I heard it was very good.

289
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,239
Yeah.

290
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:40,510
I'm really liking
this new therapist.

291
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,111
He keeps me in the loop,

292
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:43,646
always has time
for a phone call.

293
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,648
I just-- I like it.

294
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:49,385
So...

295
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,788
tell me all about it.

296
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,357
I heard you broke
new ground today.

297
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:58,061
I broke new ground?

298
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,696
That's what he said.

299
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,764
Tell me.

300
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:08,071
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes,

301
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:12,008
which is up
from my 15 1/2 yesterday.

302
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,211
And I had maybe this much
less shit in my pants,

303
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,579
so yeah, Marie, if you and him

304
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,315
and everybody else in America
secretly took a vote

305
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:21,786
and changed the meaning of
the entire English language,

306
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,488
yeah, I guess
I broke new ground.

307
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,660
Well, call it
a figure of speech,

308
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,665
but I am seeing progress.

309
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,871
Definite progress.

310
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,574
You're ordering a new rock?

311
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,844
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

312
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:48,447
It's a nice one.

313
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,619
What? It's pretty.

314
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,188
I need the thing.

315
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,889
Okay.

316
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,824
<i>Numero uno?</i>

317
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,292
<i>Dos.</i>

318
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,137
Okay.

319
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:39,961
Those--

320
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,265
Those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

321
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:46,135
Okay.

322
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,217
All right, I just
want to go on record

323
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,452
we should all be wearing masks.

324
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,595
We should be wearing masks.

325
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,882
I bet he forgets the aluminum.

326
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,822
Guaranteed.

327
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:48,024
Guarantee he forgets.

328
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,964
Oh, you don't know

329
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,699
what the hell you're
doing, do you?

330
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,901
You forgot the aluminum.

331
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:04,740
One of the first steps
in the--

332
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,482
Son of a bitch.

333
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,864
All right, let's talk
about Gale Boetticher.

334
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,134
He was a good man
and a good chemist,

335
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,502
and I cared about him.

336
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:13,774
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

337
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,743
He didn't deserve it at all.

338
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:21,115
But I'd shoot him
again tomorrow

339
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,419
and the next day
and the day after that.

340
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:27,388
When you make it Gale versus me

341
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:29,423
or Gale versus Jesse,

342
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:32,526
Gale loses, simple as that.

343
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:39,398
This is on you, Gus--

344
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,766
Not me, not Jesse.

345
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,068
Gale's death is on you.

346
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:48,440
I mean, really, what did
you expect me to do,

347
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:50,509
just simply roll over

348
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,778
and allow you to murder us?

349
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:55,214
That I wouldn't
take measures--

350
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:57,684
Extreme measures
to defend myself?

351
00:30:57,718 --> 00:30:58,752
Wrong!

352
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:01,589
Think again.

353
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:02,957
And whatever--

354
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,260
Whatever it is
you're planning there,

355
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,295
whatever--
Whatever it is--

356
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,930
The point that you're
trying to make here,

357
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:12,135
let me-- Let me suggest that
you keep one thing in mind.

358
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,105
Without us,

359
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,107
without Jesse and myself,

360
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:21,279
you have no one
to make your product.

361
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,416
Certainly not him.

362
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,117
This-- This person
doesn't know

363
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,285
what the hell he's doing!

364
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,487
Been watching him for weeks.

365
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,323
I know every step of his cook.

366
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,961
Do you really? You--

367
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:46,170
Really? Oh,
so please tell me.

368
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,006
Catalytic hydrogenation,

369
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,908
is it protic or aprotic?
Because I forget.

370
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,511
And if our reduction
is not stereospecific,

371
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,815
then how can our product
be enantiomerically pure?

372
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:00,017
I mean,
is 1 phenyl, 1 hyrdoxyl,

373
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,586
2 methylaminopropane--

374
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,555
containing, of course,
chiral centers

375
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,025
at carbons number 1 and 2
on the propane chain?

376
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,427
Then reduction
to methamphetamine

377
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:12,931
eliminates which
chiral center is it again?

378
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,266
Because I forgot.

379
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,970
Come on, help me out,
professor!

380
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,205
Gus.

381
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,740
We're here. Come on.

382
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,010
Let us work.

383
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:29,047
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

384
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,416
See, everything comes down
to following a recipe.

385
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,085
Simple, complicated,
it doesn't matter.

386
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,521
The steps never change,

387
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,624
and I know every step.

388
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,893
Oh, is--
Is that what you want?

389
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:45,697
This-- This...
short order cook?

390
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,232
You're not flipping
hamburgers here, pal.

391
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,435
What happens when you get a
bad barrel of precursor?

392
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,170
Or how would you even know it?

393
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,939
And what happens in the summer

394
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,441
when-- When-- When
the humidity rises

395
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,743
and your product goes cloudy?

396
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,079
H-How would you
guard against that?

397
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,215
Gus.

398
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,785
You do this,

399
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,820
all you'll have left

400
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:13,091
is an $8 million
hole in the ground.

401
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,459
This lab--

402
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:17,962
This equipment is
useless without us.

403
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,331
Without-- Without
Jesse and myself,

404
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,466
you have no new product.

405
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,402
You-- You--
You have no income.

406
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,537
Your people out there
will not be paid.

407
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,039
Your distribution chain
collapses.

408
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,007
Without us...

409
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,942
you have nothing.

410
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:38,114
You kill me, you have nothing.

411
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,450
You kill Jesse,
you don't have me.

412
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,668
You won't do this.

413
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,471
You're too smart.

414
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,742
You can't afford to do this.

415
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,210
Please.

416
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,181
Let us just go back to work.

417
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,683
We're here.

418
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,018
Let us work.
We're-- We're--

419
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,920
We're ready to go to work.

420
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,589
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

421
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,813
Oh, my God.

422
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,039
Well?

423
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,276
Get back to work.

424
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:58,764
Let's just--
We'll just lay this down.

425
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:01,167
We'll put him in feet first.

426
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,935
Grab his shoe.

427
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:05,737
Oh. Here. Wait, wait.
Just life him up.

428
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,839
There. All right.

429
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:08,874
Here we go.

430
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:13,846
God.

431
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,915
If you push that way,
I'll hold him in.

432
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,685
Okay, ready?

433
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,720
1--

434
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:23,021
Oh, shit!

435
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,492
All right, wait. Wait.

436
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:30,296
Forget that.

437
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:41,074
Come on.

438
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:42,109
Up!

439
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:48,216
Get down.

440
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:51,585
Okay.

441
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:09,636
I never used this stuff.
You sure it'll do the job?

442
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,071
Trust us.

443
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:43,830
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

444
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,332
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

445
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:53,073
God.

446
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:15,960
How are you doing?

447
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:20,764
No, I mean, you know--

448
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:24,868
How are you doing?

449
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:34,977
You did the only thing
that you could.

450
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:36,913
I hope you understand that.

451
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,717
Thoughts?

452
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:46,890
Got any thoughts

453
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:50,059
on what our next move might be?

454
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:52,128
What next move?

455
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,796
Our next move.

456
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,098
Our next move,

457
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:58,501
given the fact that
at the first opportunity

458
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,270
Gus will kill us.

459
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:03,607
What, that wasn't
an opportunity just now?

460
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:06,476
Seemed like a pretty damn
good opportunity to me.

461
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,445
No, no.
Golden, I would say.

462
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:10,146
We bought ourselves some time.

463
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:11,781
Uh-uh.
Yes, but--

464
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:15,184
The question is how much.

465
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,286
He'll be looking
for another chemist.

466
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,421
He's not going to find
another chemist.

467
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,958
Where is he going to find
another chemist?

468
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:25,227
It's not just about somebody

469
00:43:25,261 --> 00:43:27,362
being able
to run a lab that big.

470
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,130
Someone he can trust,

471
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:32,334
someone he knows will
keep their mouths shut.

472
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,204
Yeah. Good luck with that.

473
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,476
Bet it took him years
to find Gale.

474
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:44,613
Bet he's sorry now.

475
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,123
Are you sure you're okay?

476
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:57,391
At least now we all
understand each other.

477
00:43:57,425 --> 00:43:59,760
Right?

478
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:00,828
What do you mean?

479
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:04,664
I mean him and us, we get it.

480
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,875
We're all on the same page.

481
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:20,082
What page is that?

482
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,752
The one that says...

483
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:24,754
if I can't kill you,

484
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:27,657
you'll shit wish you were dead.

485
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,269
Yo. Excuse me.

486
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:44,872
Thanks.

487
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:00,087
Here.

488
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,524
Thanks.

489
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:24,347
Hi.

490
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:28,418
Hi.

491
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:32,790
Um, it's-- It's parked
over on Amsden.

492
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:34,392
Junior was about to get up,

493
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:36,160
and he would have seen it,

494
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:38,764
so I wanted to avoid
a lot of questions.

495
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,167
That was smart.

496
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:43,970
Yeah.

497
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:47,473
Kenny Rogers.

498
00:45:53,746 --> 00:45:55,213
You okay?

499
00:45:57,115 --> 00:45:58,449
Yeah.

500
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:00,851
Right as rain.

501
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:09,994
Do you have your keys?

502
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:11,529
Yeah.

503
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:14,566
Uh, it's parked
three blocks down

504
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,967
on the right.

505
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:19,705
Yeah.
