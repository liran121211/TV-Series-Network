<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,841
Let Mr. White go.
Don't kill him.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,095
- You know that won't work.
- Then you've got a problem.

4
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:08,878
I've got nothing to
say to you, man.

5
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:16,662
I will kill your wife. I will kill your
son. I will kill your infant daughter.

6
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,031
You're gonna get new social's, new
identities. It's gonna cost you.

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,911
I've got the money.
Now I need you to call the DEA.

8
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:22,461
Gus has a hit out on Hank.

9
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:25,111
Where is the money!?

10
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:26,686
I gave it to Ted.

11
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:03,982
They're here.
They're out front.

12
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:05,016
- How many?
- Four.

13
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,384
Nelson Brey, three others.

14
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:07,918
- Did you get his toothbrush?
- Got it.

15
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,120
What about your stuff?
Oh, you know what?

16
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,025
We'll talk to them about
stopping at your place.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,894
Skyler-- Skyler...

18
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,229
- What?
- I'm not going.

19
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:17,500
What?

20
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:18,968
I'm not going
to Hank and Marie's.

21
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,002
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:21,137
But you said we're in danger.

23
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,373
Yes, that's true.

24
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:23,974
- Because of me.
- It doesn't matter now.

25
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,376
All that matters is--

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,244
All that matters is that
the rest of you are safe,

27
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,080
and that's why
I'm not going with you.

28
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,583
I'm the real target.

29
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,486
But we'll all be safer
at Hank's.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,854
- That's--
- No, no, no.

31
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:37,690
No one will be safe
at Hank's if I'm there.

32
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,491
Walt, it's DEA.

33
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,894
Skyler, you don't know
these people.

34
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,495
- I--
- No, Skyler, please,

35
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:45,696
trust me.

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,164
This is how it has to be.

37
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,099
Walt, those agents
outside--

38
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:50,834
they're not going
to just leave you here!

39
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,203
It's called protective custody.

40
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,639
All they know is that
Hank is the only person

41
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:56,507
that's in danger.

42
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,809
They're including us only
as a courtesy to Marie,

43
00:01:58,844 --> 00:01:59,944
just to keep her happy.

44
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:01,345
How am I supposed
to explain that to Marie--

45
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,484
or Junior or Hank,
for that matter?

46
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,953
I don't know, but you'll do it.

47
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:09,355
You'll figure it out.

48
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,226
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

49
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,029
Except she's not.

50
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:21,068
I'll talk to Hank.

51
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,804
You just back me up
with everyone else.

52
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,106
You really expect me to say

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,441
"Okay, Walt, sure,
just stay here and..."

54
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,646
No, there's got to be
another way.

55
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:33,948
There isn't.

56
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,651
There was,

57
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,686
but now there isn't.

58
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,891
Walt,

59
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,193
how long till you're safe,

60
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,628
till you can work this out?

61
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,101
Oh, Skyler...

62
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,640
- Skyler--
-

63
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:02,345
I have lived under the threat
of death for a year now,

64
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,549
and because of that,

65
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,683
I've made choices.

66
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:09,120
- Walt--
- Listen to me.

67
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:12,490
I alone should suffer
the consequences

68
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,492
of those choices, no one else.

69
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:16,961
And those consequences--

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,464
they're coming.

71
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,970
No more prolonging
the inevitable.

72
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,716
Feed that belt-- yep, right
through those seatbelt holders

73
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,151
- Thank you so much.
[chuckling] - Hank,

74
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,686
I've got a car wash to run.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,421
I mean,
you don't honestly believe

76
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,790
that I'm in danger,
do you? Me?

77
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,392
<i>[Hank]</i> <i>Oh, Jesus,</i>

78
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,227
everything's going to go
over like a lead balloon.

79
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,629
[chuckles]
It'll be Marie who kills me.

80
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,997
<i>All right, well,</i> <i>just know</i>

81
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,467
that I'll get there
as soon as I can,

82
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,736
and let Steve Gomez know.

83
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,839
I told some of his guys,
and just stay safe.

84
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:00,107
<i>Oh, please.</i>

85
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:02,110
Whole thing's
just a giant jerk-off.

86
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:06,815
Yeah, yeah, but keep your head
down anyway, all right?

87
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,450
<i>All right.</i>

88
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,819
All right, buddy, take care.

89
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:13,222
[Holly crying]

90
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,861
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

91
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:21,965
I know.

92
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:24,501
[crying continues]

93
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,239
Shh, shh, shh...

94
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,224
Okay, my love. We're okay.
[engine stars]

95
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,764
Okay, my darling.
It's okay.

96
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:56,898
[crying continues]

97
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,969
[muttering] Okay...

[sighs]

100
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,819
[Walter, Jr.] He's going to risk
his life over a stupid car wash?

101
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,587
Does he even understand

102
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:29,721
what's going on
with Uncle Hank?

103
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:31,423
He'll come when he's able.

104
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,858
That's pathetic.

105
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,928
How hard did you even try,
or did you?

106
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:39,664
[Hank] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Lay off your mom.

107
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,099
Well, you know, Hank, we wouldn't
even be arguing about this

108
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:44,803
if you and Steve
would just make him come.

109
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,238
Why didn't your people
put him in the car?

110
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:48,339
Uh, because it's not
Nazi German, all right?

111
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:50,174
Oh, pl-- you--
Nazi Germany.

112
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,376
If I had a dollar
for every time I heard that.

113
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,245
You know what?
I'm going to call him.

114
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,080
He's going to get
his behind here immediately.

115
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:58,682
End of story.
[dialing phone]

116
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:01,184
Thank you. At least somebody
is listening to me.

117
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,286
Because we are all
in danger here.

118
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,721
We are not all in danger.

119
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,122
Will you stop saying that?

120
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,925
That is asking for trouble.

121
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,127
[muttering] Oh, come on, Walt.

122
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,134
He's not picking up.

123
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,835
Look, could we just take
this down a notch?

124
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,403
Okay, everybody?

125
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,072
Sky, you guys can stay here
as long as you like, okay?

126
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,274
We've got plenty of room.

127
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,408
But I wouldn't worry

128
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,410
about any danger to Walt
or any of us.

129
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,179
Okay?

130
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:33,215
This whole thing's
just a damn smoke screen.

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,084
How do you mean
a-- a smoke screen?

132
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,020
An anonymous threat against me?

133
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,957
I'm stuck in a wheelchair.
I'm not even on the job.

134
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:43,995
No, someone doesn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

135
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,997
What, minerals?

136
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,970
Timing seem a bit odd
to you, huh?

137
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,705
I mean, I start looking
into, you know...

138
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,742
Fring, and all of a sudden
I'm under lockdown for my own protection?

139
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,710
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

140
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:01,244
Gus Fring?

141
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,646
From the chicken restaurant?

142
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,414
Hank, what are
you talking about?

143
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,383
[sighs]

144
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,151
Just one man's humble opinion.

145
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,419
That's all,

146
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,354
but I think Los Pollos Hermanos

147
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,357
is a front for the biggest
meth distributor

148
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,391
in the Southwest.

149
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:16,427
[Marie] - Oh, my God.
[Skyler] - Steve...

150
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:19,030
- Oh, my God.
Are you-- Are you even looking into this?

151
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,264
[Gomez] We're looking
into everything,

152
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,600
but we work on fact,
not conjecture,

153
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,035
and the fact is

154
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,871
that the scumbags
that hit you first

155
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,139
were Mexican cartel,

156
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,242
not some German multinational
whatever,

157
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:32,310
and definitely
not Colonel Sanders.

158
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,646
Now, if we even had
a shred of proof--

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,881
Isn't that what you
get paid to go get?

160
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,151
Remember that laundry
I told you about?

161
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:41,953
I'd start there.

162
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:43,354
Come on, man.

163
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:45,389
It's a perfect spot
for a meth superlab.

164
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:46,557
Oh, my God.

165
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,092
Hey, [clucks tongue]

166
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,361
what if I'm right?

167
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:52,762
Even if you were right--

168
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,397
and you ain't--
[chuckles]

169
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,332
but if you were,
there's no way in hell

170
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,734
a judge is going to give me
a search warrant--

171
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:58,969
Search warrant?

172
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:01,405
What happened to good,
old-fashioned knock and talk?

173
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:03,907
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

174
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,310
You were never very good
at those, were you?

175
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,346
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

176
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,216
My friend and I-- we wondered
if we could take a look around.

177
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,551
Why?

178
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,620
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Dennis.

179
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:47,921
Dennis. Hey, I'm Steve Gomez.

180
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:50,624
I'm with the DEA,
Drug Enforcement.

181
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:52,091
What, is there--
there a problem?

182
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:53,759
Not for you.
No, no problem.

183
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,094
We're just wondering if we
could take a look around.

184
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:56,128
I, uh--

185
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:58,997
Can I tell you a story?

186
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,667
- Yeah.
- I bust this chef.

187
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,968
Well, he says he's a chef,

188
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,503
but just because you work
at a restaurant

189
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:06,538
that charges $14 for a burger,

190
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:08,073
that don't make you a chef.

191
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,542
That makes you
a glorified burger flipper,

192
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:11,743
at least in my book.

193
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,145
- Yeah.
[chuckles] - Anyway,

194
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,514
so we bust this chef--
heroin possession.

195
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,416
He says, "Well, just
because you found heroin

196
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:20,187
"in my chef whites
doesn't make it mine."

197
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,655
Maybe it came from the place

198
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:24,158
that launders my chef
whites"-- this place.

199
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,193
Oh, come on, man. I don't want
to do this stuff with you.

200
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,629
I-I know, I know.

201
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,464
You don't have to say it.
I'll say it for you.

202
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:32,467
His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

203
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,602
I mean, we're going to
find heroin here

204
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,538
like we're going to find
Jimmy Hoffa. Right?

205
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,007
The thing is,
is that the chef's daddy

206
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,243
is a United States Senator.

207
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,777
I'm not going to tell you
which one,

208
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,479
but you probably know
who he is, right?

209
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:47,581
So now I've got to waste
my time

210
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:50,050
checking out
this burger flipper's story,

211
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,419
and if I don't, his old man's
going to jam me up,

212
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:55,323
my ASAC,
my whole entire office.

213
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,125
Politics, huh?

214
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,393
So what do you think?

215
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,295
Listen, you know what?

216
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,030
I have to check with my boss,
and he's out of town,

217
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,634
and I can't promise I'll reach him
anytime soon either, you know?

218
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,802
Well, yeah, that's probably
the way to go,

219
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,437
so I'll have to go get
a warrant,

220
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:10,106
and we'll do it official,

221
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,042
but you're probably going to
have to close down for the day.

222
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,176
What--? Why?

223
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,111
Twenty agents poking around?

224
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:16,513

226
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,883

228
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,059
You'll make it quick, right?

229
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:30,895
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

230
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:33,164
O-Okay.

231
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,367
- Could you tell him?
- Okay.

232
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,035
Okay.

233
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,180

out some of your people for us?

way in here and bust our asses?

00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,045
Nothing, huh?

351
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,513
[Hank] Clean as a whistle,

352
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,415
so he says.

353
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:26,965
<i>[answering machine beeps]</i>

354
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,232
<i>You have reached</i> <i>Walter White.</i>

355
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,767
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>please state your name,</i>

356
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,502
<i>number, and the reason</i>
<i>for your call.</i>

357
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:32,603
<i>Thank you.</i>

358
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,338
<i>[beeps]</i>

359
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,641
It's me again.

360
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,143
I really wish you'd pick up.

361
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:44,918
God, I just--

362
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:46,220
[sighs]

363
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:48,255
Call me back, okay?

364
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,859
Just-- Just call me back,
please.

365
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,279
Hi, I'm sorry. Is it okay if I
come out here for a few minutes?

366
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:17,049
Yeah, sure, just stay
up here, if you would.

367
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:33,399
Excuse me, I wonder if you
have a-- an extra cigarette?

368
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,202
I sure could use a smoke
right about now.

369
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,937
Sure.

370
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,942
Thank you.

371
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,383
Thanks.

372
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,285
[cell phone buzzing]

373
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,558
Hey, what's up?

374
00:23:32,296 --> 00:23:33,663
What?

375
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,964
Hey-- Hey--

376
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,001
What's wrong with him?

377
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,604
What hospital?

378
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,409
Andrea.

379
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,544
Jesse.

380
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,045
Where's Brock?
They've got him inside.

381
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,180
Grandma's with him.

382
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,682
They got me filling out
all this paperwork--

383
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,551
How's he doing?
Tell me what's going on?

384
00:23:57,585 --> 00:24:01,155
The doctors-- they don't
know what it is exactly.

385
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,958
It's like-- It's like
he's got the flu,

386
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,660
but-- but he just keeps
getting worse.

387
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,928
Oh...

388
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:13,802
Jess, I don't understand.

389
00:24:13,837 --> 00:24:15,604
He was fine this morning.

390
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:19,741
He was fine.

391
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:22,811
[sobbing]

392
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,847
- Andrea Cantillo?
- Right here.

393
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,815
Ms. Cantillo,
we're going to go ahead

394
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,318
and admit your son
to the pediatric ICU.

395
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:31,554
- You can bring that with you.
- Okay.

396
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:33,022
So you're the boy's father?

397
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,559
- No.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

398
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:37,962
It's just we try to keep it to
two visitors maximum, so-- okay?

399
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,796
No, go, go.
I'll be out here if you need me.

400
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:41,065
Go, go ahead.

401
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:11,661
No.

402
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:14,064
No, no.

403
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,466
No. No.

404
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,502
No... no...

405
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,773
Come on.

406
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:22,807
[grunts]

407
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,943
[whimpers] No!

408
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:26,411
No, No.

409
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:39,325
Andrea!

410
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Andr--

411
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:41,761
Hey, hey, hey, no yelling.

412
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:43,395
- Andrea-- I need--
- We can't have you back here.

413
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,797
No, I need to talk to her.
All right? I need to talk to her.

414
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:45,964
You two,
just take this outside.

415
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,432
Would you please--

416
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:48,700
Brock is sick in here.

417
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:50,101
Come here--
Here.

418
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:51,369
Jesse...

419
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:53,971
Jesse, what is it?

420
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,005
[whispers]

421
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,306
Jesse, I can't go.

422
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,440
Brock stays in here.

423
00:25:57,475 --> 00:25:58,508
- Okay.
- What--

424
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,676
I'm-- I'm thinking Brock

425
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:01,978
may have been poisoned.
Okay?

426
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:03,713
What?

427
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:07,350
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

428
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,484
It sounds like "rice."

429
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,586
You need to tell
the doctors about it.

430
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:12,355
Why would you say that?
How do you know?

431
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:15,125
It doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess.

432
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,460
Okay? Ricin.

433
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,429
They'll know
what you're talking about.

434
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:20,597
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying,

435
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:22,199
you've got to tell me--

436
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:24,368
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go see some one.

437
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:25,569
- Jesse.
- Look, I'm sorry.

438
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,571
I'm sorr-- I gotta go.
Just tell them.

439
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:29,206
Okay? Now! Just do it!

440
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:36,347
Hello? Can you buzz me in,
please?

441
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:37,815
Buzz me in!
[door buzzes]

442
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:46,390
[banging on door]

443
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,926
[banging]

444
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:00,737
[banging]

445
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,047
What do you want?

446
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:10,415
[Jesse] We need to talk.

447
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:13,551
Who's with you?

448
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:16,021
No one, just me.
Let me in.

449
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,671
I don't know what you're
thinking coming here.

450
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,508
Oh, Christ.

451
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,443
What does it matter?

452
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:44,448
Everything, it's all--
all coming to an end.

453
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:47,184
Do you even know
what's happening,

454
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:49,419
the full scope
of what's happening?

455
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:52,022
They took me out
into the desert.

456
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,591
They put a hood over my head

457
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,159
and drove me out
into the desert,

458
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:57,227
on my knees.

459
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,163
They threatened my family,

460
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:00,598
and not just Hank.

461
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:05,936
My wife, my children...

462
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,274
[whimpers]

463
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,144
It's just a matter of time now.

464
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,851
I was-- I was able
to protect them for now,

465
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,052
but...

466
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:26,191
Gus is going to make
his move...

467
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:44,010
and I don't--
I don't know when.

468
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:47,113
I don't know where or how.

469
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,584
All I know is
it's going to happen.

470
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:00,393
And I'm powerless to stop him.

471
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:07,835
What are you doing?

472
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:12,373
Why did you do it?

473
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:13,542
Why?

474
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:16,979
Jesse, Gus gave me no choice.

475
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:18,814
I had to call the DEA

476
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:20,049
to protect my family.

477
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,150
What else could I do?

478
00:29:21,184 --> 00:29:23,052
No. No, you son of a bitch.

479
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:24,319
You know what you did.

480
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:26,454
Okay, look, just--

481
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:27,722
just put the gun down.

482
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,891
Okay? Just put it down,
and we'll talk.

483
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,158
All right?

484
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:34,328
You tell me-- tell me what
it is you think I did.

485
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:37,097
Brock--
why did you poison him?

486
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,732
Who's Brock?

487
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:40,433
You saw him in my living room
just last night.

488
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,769
You came to my door,
and you looked right at him,

489
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,805
so don't tell me
you don't know him.

490
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,574
[stammers] The boy.

491
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:50,311
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

492
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:53,648
Now, please--
Okay, that's Brock,

493
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,250
and-- and he was poisoned?

494
00:29:55,285 --> 00:30:00,789
The ricin! He's dying because
someone gave it to him,

495
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:02,558
and only you and I

496
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,359
were the only two people
on earth

497
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:06,027
who knew about it.

498
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,595
Now wait a minute.

499
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,829
Wait a minute.

500
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:10,097
Maybe he went into
your pockets and accid--

501
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,199
No!

502
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,933
I had it.

503
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,235
I had the cigarette
with the ricin in my pack

504
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:16,570
this morning.

505
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:19,372
The last time I saw Brock
was last night,

506
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:20,640
and this morning

507
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:22,576
I switched the cigarette
into a new pack.

508
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,811
There's no way
Brock took it himself.

509
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:27,248
Jesse, you're not thinking
clearly.

510
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:28,883
Listen, you said it yourself

511
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,318
that you had it this morning.

512
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,721
Then when could I have
possibly gotten it?

513
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:35,223
You-- You had Saul do it.

514
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:36,858
- What?
- Yeah.

515
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:39,027
Yeah, I went to his office.

516
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,962
He called me and just had
to see me today.

517
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:43,231
His big man-mountain bodyguard
patted me down.

518
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:46,466
That's when he must've stolen
it off of me, right?

519
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:48,302
That's the plan?
Was that the plan?

520
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:54,942
Jesse, why?

521
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,579
[weeping] Why, in God's name,

522
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,313
would I poison a child?

523
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:01,781
To get back at me.

524
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,452
Because I'm helping Gus,

525
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:07,120
and this is your way

526
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:08,588
of ripping my heart out

527
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,557
before you're dead and gone.

528
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,526
Just admit it.

529
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,861
Admit what you did.

530
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:15,962
Admit it!

531
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:17,163
I did not do this!

532
00:31:17,198 --> 00:31:18,865
Shut up!

533
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,267
Stop lying!

534
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:22,669
I'm not-- I'm not lying.

535
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,304
I'm not lying.
Just listen to me.

536
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,074
Listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

537
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:30,711
What possible,
possible could--

538
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,213
Who-- Who would--

539
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,086
Oh, my God.

540
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:41,089
[chuckling]

541
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:42,557
Hey.

542
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,626
[chuckling]

543
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,894
Stop laughing.

544
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,697
Stop laughing!

545
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,769
I have been waiting.

546
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:01,140
I have been waiting all day,

547
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,143
waiting for Gus to send

548
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:05,078
one of his men to kill me...

549
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,548
and it's you.

550
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,054
Who do you know

551
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:18,124
who's okay with using
children, Jesse?

552
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:22,094
Who do you know who has allowed
children to be murdered?

553
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:25,030
Hm? Gus!

554
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:29,300
He has-- He has been 10 steps
ahead of me at every turn,

555
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:31,269
and now the one thing

556
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:32,403
that he needed

557
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,172
to finally get rid of me
is your consent,

558
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:35,340
and, boy, he's got that now.

559
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:36,541
He's got it.

560
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:39,377
And not only does he have that,

561
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,146
but he manipulated you

562
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:42,682
into pulling the trigger
for him.

563
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:45,619
Only you and I knew
about the ricin!

564
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:47,921
No! You don't even
believe that

565
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:50,224
with Gus' cameras everywhere.

566
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,928
Please. Listen to yourself.

567
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:55,631
No, he has known everything
all along.

568
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,700
Where were you today?
In the lab?

569
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,368
And you don't think
it's possible

570
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:02,637
that Tyrus lifted the cigarette
out of your locker?

571
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:05,240
Come on.

572
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,141
Don't you see?

573
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,877
You are the last piece
of the puzzle.

574
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:12,112
You are everything
that he's wanted.

575
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:14,214
You're his cook now.

576
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:15,949
You're the cook,
and you have proven

577
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:18,751
that you can run a lab
without me,

578
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:21,754
and now that cook
has reason to kill me.

579
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:24,692
Think about it!

580
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:26,827
It's brilliant.

581
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,330
So go ahead.

582
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,467
Go ahead.

583
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:37,106
If you think that I am capable
of doing this, then go ahead.

584
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,309
Put a bullet in my head

585
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:42,145
and kill me right now.

586
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,482
Do it!

587
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:49,185
[breathes] Do it.

588
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,453
I'll do it.

589
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,821
Do it.

590
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,158
Do it.

591
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,398
[panting]

592
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,056
Where are you going?

593
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,257
I'm going to find
the son of a bitch,

594
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,358
and I'm going to kill him.

595
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:31,094
No, don't.

596
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:32,929
He'll see you coming.

597
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:40,304
You'll die before you get
anywhere near him.

598
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:41,572
I don't care.

599
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:46,243
Jesse. Jesse,
just get in your car.

600
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,878
Just go.

601
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:50,280
Just drive.

602
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:55,118
No, I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

603
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,856
Then let me help.

604
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,334
[heart monitor beeping]

605
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:08,936
[breathing machine huffing]

606
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,859
[Nurse]
Oh, Jesus, Mr. Pinkman,

607
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:33,694
I'm not going to keep
telling you.

608
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:35,428
Unless the family wants you
in there,

609
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:36,763
you're not allowed.

610
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:41,000
You can't keep coming
in here like this.

611
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:44,536
You hear me?
You understand?

612
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:47,138
Mr. Pinkman,
I'm going to call Security.

613
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:51,643
All right, here we go.

614
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:58,050
Come on now.

615
00:35:58,084 --> 00:35:59,718
Mr. Pinkman,
final warning.

616
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,454
Hey.

617
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:38,127
You need to be at work now.

618
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,229
I already told you.
I'm not going.

619
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,368
You've got a batch
that will be ruined

620
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:49,338
and an employer
who will be very upset

621
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:50,605
if that happens.

622
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,041
And I could give a shit.

623
00:36:54,276 --> 00:36:55,977
I'm not leaving here.

624
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:58,880
If my employer
has a problem with that,

625
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:00,882
he can tell me himself,

626
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,884
not his errand boy.

627
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,124
Get--

628
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:12,661
Hey, I don't know this guy!

629
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:13,962
Call Security!

630
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:16,364
I'm being attacked!

631
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:24,639
Yeah, that's right.

632
00:37:40,189 --> 00:37:41,923
We've got a situation.

633
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:45,493
[liquid bubbling]

634
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:49,130
[power drill whirs]

635
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:58,138
[dishes clinking]

636
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:10,885
[beeps]

637
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:38,045
[beeps]

638
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:40,681
[beeps]

639
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:41,948
[continuing]

640
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:45,786
[beeping]

641
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,091
[sighs]

642
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:28,162
[elevator pings]

643
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,711
He'd like to speak with you.

644
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,581
I told you, I'm not leaving.

645
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,684
He's downstairs.

646
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,201
Tyrus told me
what's happening--

647
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,969
the sick child.

648
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,907
I understand
your preoccupation,

649
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,376
but, Jesse,
I am running a business.

650
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,247
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

651
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,050
You can return
when you're done.

652
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,988
I can't.

653
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,856
It is, as you must know,

654
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,724
in both of our best interests.

655
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:34,229
That little boy upstairs

656
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,897
is dying.

657
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:41,602
I can't be away.
I don't even want to be here now.

658
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:44,672
I can't be away if
something happens, if he--

659
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,941
I am very sorry.

660
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,411
Is there anything I can do?

661
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:53,015
I am on the board
of this hospital.

662
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,651
I can recommend doctors,

663
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,655
make sure he gets
whatever he needs,

664
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,223
the best treatment.

665
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,995
He's not sick.

666
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,032
He was poisoned.

667
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,869
How did that happen?

668
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,707
The doctors--

669
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,777
they don't know.

670
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:28,119
[sighs]

671
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:34,293
This current batch...

672
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:38,532
is surely ruined now.

673
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:39,933
Correct?

674
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,881
Stay with the boy.

675
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:01,654
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

676
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,724
You will start a new batch

677
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,425
when you are ready to return...

678
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,031
next week.

679
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,264
There you are.

680
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,702
There you are.

681
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:52,339
[beep]

682
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,823
Keep going.

683
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:32,077
Why'd you stop?

684
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,280
Why did you stop?

685
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,423
Why did you stop?

686
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,731
Come on.
Come on.

687
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,015
[groans]

688
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,472
Come on, come on.

689
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,310
Please. Oh, God, please.

690
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,945
Please.

691
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,800
No, no, no. No, don't go.

692
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,269
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

693
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:09,605
No. No.

694
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:13,576
Oh, sh...

695
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,880
No.

696
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,715
