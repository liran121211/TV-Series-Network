general goal of our Party

177
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,299
as determined by its 20th,
21st, and 22nd Congresses,

178
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,299
which is a Leninist goal.

179
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,591
It was, is, and will be

180
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,341
the only immutable goal
in the Soviet state.

181
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,716
The path of Leninist principles

182
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,507
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed

183
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,841
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet People,

184
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,174
its hopes and aspirations

185
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:42,609
as we guide the life of
the Party and the State.

186
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:44,716
This session of court is now open,

187
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,843
Comrade Judge Milan Kadnikov presiding.

188
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:50,591
Indictments:

189
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,716
Viktor Bryukhanov,

190
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,007
Anatoly Dyatlov,

191
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,007
Nikolai Fomin...

192
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,049
are accused of violating
Article 220 Section 2

193
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,312
of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

194
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:07,299
resulting in a nuclear
disaster on April 26, 1986.

195
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,883
The State calls
witnesses Comrade Khomyuk

196
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,341
of the Byelorussian Nuclear Institute,

197
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:16,507
Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy,

198
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:21,174
and Comrade Boris
Evdokimovich Shcherbina,

199
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,674
Deputy Chairman of the
Council of Ministers

200
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,217
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

201
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:06,758
It began with, of all
things, a safety test.

202
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,758
Why was there need for
a safety test at all?

203
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,090
Reactor Number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

204
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:19,716
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

205
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:23,758
Eleven days later, on
the last day of the year,

206
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,591
Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document...

207
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:34,926
certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

208
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:41,048
As a result of finishing the
work before the end of the year,

209
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,883
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

210
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:49,633
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

211
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:54,301
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

212
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,843
But their work was not finished.

213
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,674
And this document was a lie.

214
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,633
In order to sign this certificate,

215
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:12,090
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

216
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,217
and yet, one remained.

217
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,507
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

218
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,799
A series of pumps, here and here,

219
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,341
send a constant flow of
cooling water through the core.

220
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,883
The core's heat turns
the water to steam,

221
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,341
and the steam spins the turbine here,

222
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,716
and the result is electricity.

223
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,468
But what if a power plant has no power?

224
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:44,007
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

225
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,633
A blackout, equipment failure,

226
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,507
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

227
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:51,382
If there's no power,

228
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,341
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

229
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,215
And without water, the core overheats,

230
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,799
the fuel melts down.

231
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,299
In short, a nuclear disaster.

232
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,049
The solution?

233
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:07,049
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

234
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:09,382
So, problem solved?

235
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:10,924
No.

236
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,716
Bryukhanov knew that the
problem was not solved at all.

237
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:17,215
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

238
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,591
to reach the speed required

239
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,928
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

240
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:26,341
and by that time, it would be too late.

241
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,718
So we arrive at the safety test.

242
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:34,132
The theory was this: If
the facility lost power,

243
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,049
the turbine, which had been spinning,

244
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,841
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

245
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,299
What if you could take the electricity

246
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,591
it was still generating and
transfer it to the pumps?

247
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,257
What if the dying turbine

248
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,466
could keep the pumps working long enough

249
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:52,926
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

250
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:57,799
(COUGHING)

251
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,259
Any questions?

252
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,134
KADNIKOV: No. Continue, please.

253
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,049
To test this theory,

254
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,090
the reactor is placed in
a reduced power mode...

255
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,758
700 megawatts...

256
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,424
to simulate a blackout condition.

257
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,424
Then the turbines are turned off,

258
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,507
and as they slowly spin down,

259
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,382
their electrical output is measured

260
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,132
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

261
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:27,466
The science is strong,

262
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:32,509
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

263
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:37,299
Now, the first time
they tried, they failed.

264
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,132
The second time they tried, they failed.

265
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,883
The third time they tried, they failed.

266
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,965
The fourth time they tried

267
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:50,134
was April 26th, 1986.

268
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:03,757
STEPASHIN: Comrade Khomyuk.

269
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:27,507
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

270
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,341
To understand what happened that night,

271
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,424
we have to go back ten hours earlier...

272
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:35,007
April 25th, the day the
test was meant to take place.

273
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,341
By two in the afternoon,

274
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,466
the reactor has been lowered by half

275
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,716
from its normal output
level of 3200 megawatts

276
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,007
to 1600 megawatts and is stable

277
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,215
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test:

278
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,215
700 megawatts.

279
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:53,176
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

280
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,299
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

281
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,758
a further reduction in the
electricity until after midnight.

282
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,384
They are asking for a ten-hour delay.

283
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,382
This is the first critical moment,

284
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,924
the first link in the chain of disaster.

285
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:13,591
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

286
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,593
These three men allowed it to proceed.

287
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,382
Why was this delay so dangerous?

288
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,132
It created two problems:

289
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,092
One of them is scientific in nature...

290
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,924
and the other is very human.

291
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,051
This is the one we will consider first.

292
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:37,092
At midnight, there is a shift change.

293
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,343
- (MEN CHATTERING)
- Hey.

294
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,233
- Khodemchuk...
- Forget it. Find another fool.

295
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,799
Toptunov, want to buy a motorcycle?

296
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,257
BRAZHNIK: Toptunov?
He's just a little boy.

297
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,257
He's got more hair on his
face than on his balls.

298
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,633
Hair? Is that what's on his lip?

299
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,716
(MEN CHUCKLING)

300
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,299
Leonid Fedorovych.

301
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:11,061
Akimov says to come to the
control room as soon as you can.

302
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,014
- Is he already here?
- He came in early.

303
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,801
Something about a test.

304
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:19,967
- You see? Desperate.
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

305
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,468
TOPTUNOV: Sasha?

306
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,299
Ah. You know the test
they were supposed to run?

307
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,965
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

308
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,466
They couldn't do it on the day
shift, so they've given it to us.

309
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,591
To us?

310
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,176
- We don't know what...
- AKIMOV: Shh.

311
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,965
- (WHISPERING): We don't know what it is.
- It's fine.

312
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,174
We take it down to 700, hold it there,

313
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,007
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

314
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,512
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

315
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,924
I have to do something
I've never done before

316
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,449
with Dyatlov looking over my shoulder?

317
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:01,257
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

318
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,924
I'm looking at the instructions now.

319
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,468
Are we supposed to do those or not?

320
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:18,007
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

321
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,674
I have the manual for the rundown test.

322
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,591
You did it last year.

323
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:27,049
Yes, in the program there's
instructions of what to do,

324
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,591
and then, well, there's a
lot of things crossed out.

325
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,051
What should I...?

326
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,718
Well, what should I...?

327
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,174
Are you sure?

328
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,885
Right. Thank you.

329
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,132
He says to follow the
crossed-out instructions.

330
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,424
So then why are they crossed out?

331
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:49,009
(DOOR OPENS)

332
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,549
We've been cleared to run the test.

333
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,382
1600. Good.

334
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:01,633
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

335
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,676
- Well...
- Yes. Absolutely.

336
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,549
- Stolyarchuk?
- Yes.

337
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:09,674
- Kirschenbaum?
- Uh, I haven't reviewed.

338
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,633
We only just found out really...

339
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,007
There, review it.

340
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,924
Or you can just do what I tell you.

341
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,967
I think even you, stupid
as you are, can manage that.

342
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,558
Well, let's go.

343
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,402
I'm supposed to switch the turbine
off while the reactor's still running?

344
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:30,426
- This is not good...
- Shut the fuck up and do your job!

345
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,301
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

346
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,738
(WHISPERING): I've never done
this with the power so low before.

347
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:40,885
(WHISPERS): It's okay. I'm with you.

I want you to imagine that
he has been told nothing

351
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,799
of his mission into space until the
moment that he is on the launch pad.

352

I want you to imagine that all he has

353
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,758
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

354
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,299
some of which have been crossed out.

355
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,299
This is exactly what was happening

356
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,354

363
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,134

created by the delay.

the atoms themselves,

367
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:47,507

of my colleagues here

from the Kurchatov
Institute and Minenergo.

375
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,174
But you don't need to
be a nuclear scientist

376
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,299
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

377
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,382
You only need to know this:

378
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:07,049
there are essentially
two things that happen

379
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,758
inside a nuclear reactor.

380
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,382
The reactivity which generates power

381
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:16,341
either goes up, or it goes down.

382
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,841
That's it.

383
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:22,092
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

384
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,885
Uranium fuel.

385
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,841
As uranium atoms split
apart and collide,

386
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,466
reactivity goes up.

387
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,758
But if you don't balance the reactivity,

388
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,967
it never stops rising. So...

389
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,299
Boron control rods.

390
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:45,926
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

391
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:51,468
But there's a third
factor to consider: water.

392
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:55,424
Cool water takes heat out of the system.

393
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,841
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

394
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:02,341
In an RBMK reactor of the
type used at Chernobyl,

395
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:06,466
there's something called a
"positive void coefficient."

396
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,299
What does that mean?

397
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:12,841
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

398
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,924
the higher the reactivity,

399
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:18,049
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

400
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,674
which means...

401
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,674
It would appear we have a
vicious cycle on our hands.

402
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,633

00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:38,049
And we would, were it not for this:

405
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,549
the negative temperature coefficient.

406
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:47,551
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive, so...

407
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,257
fuel increases reactivity.

408
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,299
Control rods and water reduce it.

409
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,674
Steam increases it,

410
00:29:56,676 --> 00:30:00,049
and the rise in temperature reduces it.

411
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:03,897
This is the invisible dance

412
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,674

when things are normal.

415
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,299
As uranium splits
apart to release energy,

416
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,883
it breaks down into
a new element, xenon.

417
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,841
Xenon reduces reactivity.

418
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:27,341
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

419
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,382
When the core is running at full power,

420
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:32,466
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

421
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,674
But because of the delay,

422
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,633
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has
been held at half power

423
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:40,299

00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,799
Court is now in recess.

523
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:46,382
Thirty minutes.

524
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:48,468
(COUGHING)

525
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,635
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

526
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,635
Not really, no.

527
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,468
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

528
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,674
The Jews were killed in pogroms,

529
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:45,257
and Stalin forced the Poles out.

530
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,841
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

531
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,885
But after the war...

532
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,343
people came to live here anyway.

533
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:59,174
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

534
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,885
but they didn't care.

535
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:05,424
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

536
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,009
But not them.

537
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:13,176
No one ever thinks it's
going to happen to them.

538
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,009
And here we are.

539
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,674
How much time?

540
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,132
Maybe a year.

541
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:32,549
They call it a... (COUGHS)

542
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,841
They call it a "long illness."

543
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:37,716
It doesn't seem very long to me.

544
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:40,259
I know you told me, and I believed you.

545
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:43,215
But time passed, and I thought,

546
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:45,843
it wouldn't happen to me.

547
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,799
I wasted it.

548
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,593
I wasted it all for nothing.

549
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:54,885
For nothing?

550
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,799
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

551
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,543
how unconcerned I was?

552
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,633
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

553
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:04,674
but when they told me
they were putting me

554
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,924
in charge of the cleanup

555
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:10,885
and they said it wasn't
serious, I believed them.

556
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,217
You know why?

557
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,591
Because they put you in charge.

558
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,092
Yeah.

559
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:25,215
I'm an inconsequential man, Valera.

560
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,092
That's all I've ever been.

561
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,384
I hoped that one day I
would matter, but I didn't.

562
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:36,635
I just stood next to people who did.

563
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:41,174
There are other scientists like me.

564
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:43,758
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

565
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,092
But you...

566
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,926
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

567
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:55,134
Men, material, lunar rovers.

568
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,635
Who else could have done these things?

569
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:05,132
They heard me, but they listened to you.

570
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:09,174
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies...

571
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:13,799
entire congregation of obedient fools...

572
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:17,924
they mistakenly sent the one good man.

573
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:20,007
For God's sake, Boris,

574
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:23,468
you were the one who mattered most.

575
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,343
Ah, it's beautiful.

00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,217
STEPASHIN: Comrade Legasov.

579
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:47,633
LEGASOV: The time is 38 past midnight.

580
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,716
The reactor is nearly shut down.

581
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,424
The operators of Reactor
4 are locked on a path

582
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,466
that leads directly to disaster.

583
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,758
There's no way to turn back.

584
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,507
They do not yet know
it, but the die is cast.

585
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:03,841
At 30 megawatts, xenon
is still being created,

586
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:06,092
but none of it is burning away.

587
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,091
The reactor is drowning in poison.

588
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,257
To make matters worse, the
reactor isn't hot enough

589
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:17,051
to produce sufficient steam.

590
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:21,591
The only way to safely
raise power from this state

591
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:23,965
is to do it very, very slowly

592
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,841
over the course of 24 hours.

593
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,466
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

594
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:33,965
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

595
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,799
They begin pulling control rods out.

596
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,007
Dozens at a time.

597
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:41,132
Halfway out, three-quarters
of the way out,

598
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:43,965
still, the power does not budge.

599
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,758
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

600
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,633
There were 211 control
rods in Reactor 4.

601
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:55,341
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

602
00:42:55,343 --> 00:43:00,090
Remember... control rods
are the brakes on this car.

603
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:06,843
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

604
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:10,965
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

605
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,132
so the negative temperature coefficient

606
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:15,674
is no longer weighing
down the reactivity.

607
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,674
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

608
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:23,924
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

609
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:26,965
The control rods are out.

610
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,507
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

611
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,841
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

612
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,382
is water and xenon.

613
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:38,635
It's one in the morning.

I'm sorry, this is all we can get.

617
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:18,507
It's 200 megawatts. We've
pulled almost everything out.

that's all we have.

- Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

620

- Switch on pump 4.
- AKIMOV: No, wait a second.

621

- DYATLOV: Stolyarchuk...
- We have barely enough steam as it is.

622
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:30,215
The turbine is going too slow for
the test to deliver any valid results.

623
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:31,837
- It's enough.
- And if we add more water,

624
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,505
- there will be even less...
- I said it's enough.

625
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,676
I know what I'm doing. Stolyarchuk.

00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:12,549
They may as well have had 15 days.

638
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:15,466
The problem they were
facing was not solvable.

639
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:18,257
The power was too low,
the water was too high.

640
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,924
The test was already ruined.

641
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,633
The results would have been useless,

642
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,215
but Dyatlov didn't care.

643
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:26,593
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

Toptunov sees a report

00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:14,758
from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.

658
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,132
Based on the absence of
sufficient control rods,

659
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:21,676
the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.

660

Well, of course it's saying that.

661
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:30,635
It doesn't know we're running a test.

662
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:33,301
All right, comrades.

With every decision,

671
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:59,633
they have pulled this
reactor back like a slingshot,

672
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:01,965
further than anyone has ever pulled,

673
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,382
now the test begins.

674
00:47:04,384 --> 00:47:08,051
The pumps are shut
down, and they've let go.

675
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:13,841
The pumps stop moving
water through the reactor.

unchecked by fresh coolant,

The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.

A void is being created.

684
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,507
There is no fresh water to replace it.

685
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:38,507
Steam increases reactivity,

686
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:41,924
increases heat, increases steam,

687
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,758
increases reactivity.

688
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,051
The remaining xenon decays away.

689
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,468

00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:29,174
there is a button with
one single purpose...

697
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:32,633
to "scram," or instantly
shut down, the reaction.

698
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:36,257
In Soviet reactors, that
button is called AZ-5.

699
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:41,299
You press AZ-5, all of the
control rods insert at once,

700
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:45,466

- For God's sake, Dyatlov.

Legasov's already given it away.

He said before, there was no
way to avoid what was coming.

there was a failsafe.

he created, there wasn't.

These rods are made of boron,

but not their tips.

00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:04,507
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

For the same reason our reactors

00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:50,841
And when they do, the

Every last molecule of liquid water

00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,799
instantly converts to steam,

752
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,174
which expands and ruptures a
series of fuel rod channels.

753
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:06,382
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

The graphite tips are fixed in position,

about Chernobyl ever again.

871
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,924
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

872
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:23,799
that when you finally do die,

873
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:28,092
it will be exceedingly hard to
know that you ever lived at all.

874
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,259
What if I refuse?

875
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,591
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

876
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:41,924
(SCOFFS)

877
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:46,007
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

878
01:01:46,009 --> 01:01:48,341
Oh, that's perfect.

879
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:51,426
They should put that on our money.

(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

881
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:04,674
LEGASOV (ON TAPE): To be
a scientist is to be naive.

882
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:07,094
We are so focused on
our search for truth,

883
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:11,716
we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.

884
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:16,174
But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,

885
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:18,090
whether we choose to or not.

886
01:03:18,092 --> 01:03:20,924
The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.

887
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:22,716
It doesn't care about our governments,

888
01:03:22,718 --> 01:03:26,507
our ideologies, our religions.

889
01:03:26,509 --> 01:03:30,215
It will lie in wait for all time.

890
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:34,215
And this, at last, is
the gift of Chernobyl.

891
01:03:34,217 --> 01:03:36,924
Where I once would
fear the cost of truth,

892
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:39,543
now I only ask:

893
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:43,386
What is the cost of lies?
