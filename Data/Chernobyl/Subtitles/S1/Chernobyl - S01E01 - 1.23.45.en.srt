1
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,416
VALERY:
<i>What is the cost of lies?</i>

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,504
<i>It's not that we'll mistake them
for the truth.</i>

3
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,</i>

4
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,928
<i>then we no longer recognize
the truth at all.</i>

5
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,931
<i>What can we do then?</i>

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,518
<i>What else is left but to abandon
even the hope of truth</i>

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,313
<i>and content ourselves instead
with stories?</i>

8
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>In these stories,
it doesn't matter who the heroes are.</i>

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,362
<i>All we want to know is,
who is to blame?</i>

10
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,701
<i>In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.
He was the best choice.</i>

11
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>An arrogant, unpleasant man,
he ran the room that night.</i>

12
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,872
<i>He gave the orders.</i>

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>And no friends.</i>

14
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>Or, at least, not important ones.</i>

15
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:33,510
<i>And now, Dyatlov will spend the next
10 years in a prison labor camp.</i>

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,389
<i>Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.</i>

17
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>There were far greater criminals
than him at work.</i>

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>And as for what Dyatlov did do...</i>

19
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,818
<i>The man doesn't deserve prison.</i>

20
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>He deserves death.</i>

21
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,756
But instead, ten years
for "criminal mismanagement."

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,258
What does that mean?

23
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,427
No one knows.

24
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,512
It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,933
What does matter is that, to them,

26
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,228
justice was done.

27
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,857
Because, you see, to them,

28
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,778
A just world is a sane world.

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,325
There was nothing sane
about Chernobyl.

30
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,537
What happened there,
what happened after,

31
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,041
even the good we did, all of it...

32
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,794
All of it...

33
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,630
Madness.

34
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,097
Well, I've given you
everything I know.

35
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,434
They'll deny it, of course.

36
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,353
They always do.

37
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,777
I know you'll try your best.

38
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,167
VASILY: Lyudmilla?

39
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,902
MAN: Comrade Dyatlov!

40
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,994
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

41
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,751
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

42
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,837
What just happened?

43
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,672
I don't know.

44
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,842
There's a fire in the turbine hall.

45
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,762
The turbine hall?

46
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,182
The control system tank. Hydrogen.

47
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,060
You and Toptunov,
you morons blew the tank.

48
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,312
- No, that's not...
- This is an emergency.

49
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,440
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is...

50
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,566
- It's exploded!
- DYATLOV: We know.

51
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,401
Akimov, are we cooling
the reactor core?

52
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,236
We shut it down,
but the control rods are still active.

53
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,238
They're not all the way in.
I disengaged...

54
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,907
All right. Try and disconnect
the servos from the standby console.

55
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,367
You two, get the backup pumps running.

56
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,244
We need water moving through the core.

57
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,329
- That is all that matters.
- There is no core.

58
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,374
It exploded! The core exploded.

59
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,005
He's in shock. Get him out of here.

60
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,506
The lid is off.

61
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,592
The stack is burning. I saw it.

62
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,470
You're confused.
RBMK reactor cores don't explode.

63
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,929
- Akimov...
- Sasha.

64
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,224
Don't worry, we did everything right.
Something strange has happened.

65
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,601
- Do you taste metal?
- Akimov!

66
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,438
Comrade Perevozchenko, what you're
saying is physically impossible.

67
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,232
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

68
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,319
We're wasting time. Let's go.

69
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,072
Get the hydrogen out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

70
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,782
What about the fire?

71
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,909
Call the fire brigade.

72
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,465
You're not on call tonight.

73
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,551
VASILY: They're bringing everybody in,
military and civil.

74
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,138
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

75
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,015
This is a big one.

76
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,436
But it doesn't look right, the color.

77
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,856
Pravik says he thinks they're shining
floodlights or something.

78
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,316
And what if there are chemicals?

79
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,526
"Chemicals"?

80
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,904
The problem's the roof.

81
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,447
It's covered in tar,

82
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,366
so it's gonna burn all night,
and it'll stink like hell.

83
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,244
That's it. That's the worst of it.

84
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,873
Go back to bed.

85
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,119
- MAN: Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

86
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,248
MAN: Here. Here.

87
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,381
Are they bombing?

88
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,178
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

89
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,722
That's as high as it goes.
The good one's locked in a safe.

90
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,140
I don't have a key.

91
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,103
Valera... Your face.

92
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,314
Come on.

93
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,276
I'm going to find Khodemchuk
in the pump room.

94
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,860
You, here.

95
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,864
Get Shashenok. He's in 604. Go.

96
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,700
We need to get everyone out!

97
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,589
Shit.

98
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,967
Hey! We need to get
to the reactor hall.

99
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,970
- The lift's destroyed.
- Up two flights and across.

100
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,889
- Right.
- Why are you going there?

101
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,244
Have you seen Khodemchuk?

102
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,164
- No. Where's Viktor?
- Still in the pump room.

103
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,501
Stay here. I'll come back.

104
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,881
Viktor!

105
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,442
Viktor.

106
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,028
Viktor.

107
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,821
Oh!

108
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,407
Viktor, I'm gonna get you out of here.

109
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,826
Can you stand?

110
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,953
Khodemchuk...

111
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,121
Where?

112
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,542
Get Khodemchuk.

113
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,505
I dropped the control rods
from the other panel.

114
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,382
- AKIMOV: They're still up.
- What?

115
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,592
They're still only a third
of the way in. I don't know why.

116
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,094
I already sent the trainees down

117
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,512
to the reactor hall
to lower them by hand.

118
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,514
- What about the pumps?
- I can't get through to Khodemchuk.

119
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,142
- The lines are down.
- Fuck the phones and fuck Khodemchuk.

120
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,810
- Are the pumps on or not?
- Stolyarchuk?

121
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,688
My control panel's not working.
I tried calling for the electricians.

122
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,483
I don't give a shit about the panel!
I need water in my reactor core!

123
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,403
Get down there
and make sure those pumps are on.

124
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,738
Now!

125
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,998
What does the dosimeter say?

126
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,459
Uh, 3.6 roentgen, but that's as high
as the meter...

127
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,794
Three point six.
Not great, not terrible.

128
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,596
We did everything right.

129
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,351
FIREMAN 1: You, connect those hooks!

130
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,483
FIREMAN 2: Get the pumps going!

131
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,693
FIREMAN 3: Yeah, over here!
I'm right with you!

132
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,450
FIREMAN 1: We're working
bottom to top. Go in fast.

133
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,430
MISHA: Vastly...

134
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,227
- Hey, Vastly, what's this?
- I don't know, Misha.

135
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,437
Don't fuck around with it.
Hook these up. Come on.

136
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,653
Do you taste metal?

137
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,864
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

138
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,326
The valves, Misha.
The valves! Let's go.

139
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,869
The valves! Come on!

140
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,361
What do you need?

141
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,072
We need to get into the reactor hall

142
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,074
to lower the control rods,
but the door's jammed.

143
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,703
I don't think there are control rods.

144
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,163
I don't think there's a core.

145
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,083
No, you're... You're mistaken.

146
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,294
Akimov said.

147
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,854
Let's go.

148
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,119
FIREMAN 1: No!

149
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,831
Ignatenko, get on his hose!

150
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,792
FIREMAN 2: It's all right. Breathe.

151
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,126
Misha.

152
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,379
FIREMAN 2: All right, all right.
Easy, Misha.

153
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,625
Are you sure?

154
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,795
Akimov...

155
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,768
Move.

156
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,655
Come on! Go! Go!

157
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,785
Go! Go fast, go!

158
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,570
Let's go!

159
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,781
Let's go!

160
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,242
Hey!

161
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,875
Hey!

162
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,523
OKSANA: Lyudmilla! Do you want
to come with us?

163
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,066
Come where?

164
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,984
We're going to the railroad bridge
to get a better look.

165
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,779
It's not like anyone
can sleep with all the sirens.

166
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,073
I don't think you should go.
It could be dangerous.

167
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,157
MIKHAIL: What do you mean,
"dangerous"?

168
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,117
It's a fire.
It's over there, we're over here.

169
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,786
- Mikhail.
- What?

170
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,373
Oh. Sorry.

171
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,838
- Is Vastly...
- Yeah.

172
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,048
Did he say it was bad?

173
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,008
No. No, he said it was just the roof.

174
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,469
Well, he's never gotten hurt before.
None of the boys have.

175
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,138
He'll be fine.

176
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,891
Get some rest.

177
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,155
DYATLOV: The tank, it's big enough.

178
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,033
This kind of explosion,
the control tank on 71,

179
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,368
it's 100 cubic meters.

180
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,870
One hundred and ten.

181
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,456
Hundred and ten.
It could do this, definitely.

182
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,041
It's gone.

183
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,419
I looked right into it.

184
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,838
I looked into the core.

185
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,966
Did you lower the control rods or not?

186
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,762
Take him to the infirmary.

187
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,933
Toptunov, take him!

188
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,897
Where's Kudryavstev?

189
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,940
He fell.

190
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,902
- TOPTUNOV: I need a medic! Anyone!
- He's delusional.

191
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,821
- His face...
- Ruptured condenser lines.

192
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,033
The feedwater is mildly contaminated.
He'll be fine. I've seen worse.

193
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,911
Do we still have
a phone line to the outside?

194
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,497
Akimov?

195
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,250
DYATLOV: Call in the day shift.

196
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,711
But if the...

197
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,546
We have to keep water flowing
into the core.

198
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,466
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

199
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,302
How many times do I have to say it?

200
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,188
I'm going to
the Administration Building now

201
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,148
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

202
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,108
They're gonna want a full report.

203
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,905
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you...

204
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,824
But I can certainly make them worse.

205
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,288
Call in the day shift, Comrade Akimov.

206
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,418
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

207
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,078
DOCTOR: You're doing fine.

208
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,497
Raise her up.

209
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,713
That one, maybe an hour.
This one, not until morning.

210
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,217
How's it downstairs, Doctor?

211
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,885
DR. ZINCHENKO: Quiet.

212
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,804
Always is.

213
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,515
Nothing at this hour but babies.

214
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,519
Do you know I once went
two days without sleep?

215
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,480
Ten women went into labor
at the same time.

216
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,983
- Did I ever tell you that story?
- Yes.

217
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,195
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

218
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,698
If you want,
get some rest in the break room.

219
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,617
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

220
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,161
What fire?

221
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,746
The power plant.

222
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,666
DOCTOR: Oh.
Well, then it mustn't be too bad.

223
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,210
DR. ZINCHENKO: Do we stock iodine?

224
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,671
- Hmm?
- iodine.

225
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,549
You mean disinfectant?

226
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,218
No, pills. Does the hospital
stock iodine pills?

227
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,971
Iodine pills?
Why would we have iodine pills?

228
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,069
Hello?

229
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,613
Hello?

230
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,580
Who else knows this?

231
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,084
Have you called Fomin?

232
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:31,048
Of course, I want you to call him.
If I'm up, he's up.

233
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,840
Whatever the cause, the important
thing is that neither you nor I...

234
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,466
I take it the safety test
was a failure.

235
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,511
- We have the situation under control.
- FOMIN: "Under control"?

236
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,346
It doesn't look
like it's under control.

237
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,431
Shut up, Fomin.

238
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,685
I have to tell the Central Committee
about this. Do you realize that?

239
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,812
I have to get on the phone
and tell Maryin,

240
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:12,357
or, God forbid, Frolyshev,
that my power plant is on fire.

241
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,860
No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

242
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,361
Of course no one can
blame me for this.

243
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,573
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

244
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,534
Tell me what happened, quickly.

245
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,664
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

246
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,918
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

247
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,836
encountered technical difficulties,

248
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,173
leading to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

249
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,550
It regrettably ignited,

250
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,761
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

251
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,681
The tank is quite large.

252
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,059
It's the only logical explanation.

253
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,938
Of course,
Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov

254
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,942
was directly supervising the test,
so he would know best.

255
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,902
BRYUKHANOV: A hydrogen tank, fire...

256
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,573
- Reactor?
- We're taking measures to ensure

257
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,617
a steady flow of water
through the core.

258
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,329
- What about radiation?
- Obviously, down here it's nothing,

259
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,500
but in the reactor building,
I'm being told, 3.6 roentgen per hour.

260
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,127
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

261
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,212
FOMIN: Not at all.

262
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,673
From the feedwater, I assume.

263
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,757
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,512
We'll have to limit shifts to
six hours at a time, but otherwise...

265
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,181
The dosimetrists
should be checking regularly.

266
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,352
Have them use
the good meter from the safe.

267
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,688
Right.

268
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,148
I'll call Maryin.

269
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,777
Have them wake up the local
Executive Committee.

270
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,237
There'll be orders coming down.

271
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,452
OKSANA: Here.

272
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,539
Sure? Okay.

273
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,335
What do you think makes the colors?

274
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,420
Oh.

275
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,257
- It's the fuel, for sure.
- "It's the fuel, for sure."

276
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,677
What do you know about it?
You clean floors at a train station.

277
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,762
My friend, Yuri,
works at the power plant.

278
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:06,972
He says it runs cold.

279
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,224
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

280
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,477
Yuri says the only thing is,
you can't walk right up to the fuel.

281
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,605
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

282
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,025
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

283
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,819
At the nuclear power plant, yeah.

284
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,785
Well, it is beautiful.

285
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,163
Yeah.

286
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,526
Do you have a cigarette?

287
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,720
Do you need help?

288
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,686
It's over.

289
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,711
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

290
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,463
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

291
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,638
FIREMAN 1: Vastly!

292
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,348
You've gotta put it out.

293
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,188
FIREMAN 2: That's enough, comrades.
We're pushing ahead.

294
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,070
Come on, boys.

295
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,245
FIREMAN: Vastly,
it's just past, straight up.

296
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,289
All the way up, all the way in.

297
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,375
Come on!

298
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,806
Yeah. Going in now.

299
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,980
What about the auxiliary?

300
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,776
The pumps are gone, electrical's gone.

301
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,819
The core?

302
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,238
I didn't go in there, and I won't.

303
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,450
I think it's time we faced...

304
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,826
No, we have to get water into
the core.

305
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,994
Otherwise, there'll be a meltdown.

306
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,497
We have to open the valves.

307
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,582
- Sasha...
- What do you want, Boris?

308
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,668
If it's true, then we're dead.
A million people are dead.

309
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,044
Is that what you need to hear?

310
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,090
We have to open the valves.

311
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,675
- By hand.
- STOLYARCHUK: By hand?

312
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,178
The number of valves,
the amount of time to turn them,

313
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,888
you're talking about hours in there!

314
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,556
- Then help us.
- Help you do what?

315
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,393
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

316
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,487
Leonid, I'm begging you.

317
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,585
Watch the panel while we're gone.

318
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,254
It's not working.

319
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,548
Just watch it.

320
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,030
MAN: I guess we know why
they called us in early.

321
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,032
SITNIKOV: Is anyone
saying what happened?

322
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,785
MAN: They were running
the safety test on the turbines,

323
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,912
blew the control system tank.

324
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,415
It doesn't make sense to me either.

325
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,543
SITNIKOV: What about sabotage?

326
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,670
A bomb?

327
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,964
Sitnikov!

328
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,759
Bryukhanov wants us to use
the good dosimeter,

329
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,553
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

330
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,597
It's in Building Two. Hasn't...

331
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,016
Follow me.

332
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,196
Gentlemen, welcome.

333
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,824
Please, uh, find a seat.
Plenty of room.

334
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,660
I apologize for the lateness
of the hour.

335
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:12,123
Rest assured,
we are all very safe down here.

336
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,418
We built this shelter
to withstand a nuclear attack

337
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,379
by the Americans,
so, I think we'll be fine.

338
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,801
Um, as you can see,
we have experienced an accident.

339
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,512
A large control tank malfunctioned,

340
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:29,516
damaging reactor Building Four
and starting a fire.

341
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,144
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

342
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,355
Maryin spoke
to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

343
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,483
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolgikh,

344
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,070
and Dolgikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

345
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,655
Now...

346
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,577
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

347
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,206
for the work of the Pripyat
Executive Committee,

348
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,085
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

349
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,630
First, the accident...

350
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,674
It's well under control.

351
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:08,263
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

352
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,724
are considered key State secrets,
it is important

353
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:17,355
that we ensure that this incident
has no adverse consequences.

354
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,357
Now, to prevent a panic,

355
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,776
the Central Committee have ordered

356
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,445
a detachment of military police
to Pripyat.

357
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,114
How large of a detachment?

358
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,701
Between 2,000 and 4,000 men.

359
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,705
PETROVICH:
What's really going on here?

360
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:35,999
How dangerous is this?

361
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,044
There's mild radiation,
but it's limited to the plant itself.

362
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,213
- PETROVICH: No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

363
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,009
PETROVICH:
You saw men outside vomiting.

364
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,678
You saw men with burns.

365
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,931
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

366
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,767
We have wives here, we have children.

367
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,478
I say we evacuate the town.

368
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,439
BRYUKHANOV: Gentlemen...

369
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,151
Please... Please! My wife is here.

370
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,196
Do you think I would keep her
in Pripyat if it wasn't safe?

371
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:11,034
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

372
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,201
DYATLOV: The Cherenkov effect.

373
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,205
Completely normal phenomenon.
It can happen with minimal radiation.

374
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,053
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

375
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,350
We all call it "Chernobyl," of course.

376
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,770
What is its real name?

377
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,608
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

378
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,860
Exactly.

379
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,199
Viadimir I. Lenin.

380
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,043
And how proud he would be
of you all tonight.

381
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,672
Especially you, young man,

382
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,342
and the passion you have
for the people.

383
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,347
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

384
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,142
Sometimes, we forget.

385
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,813
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

386
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,527
But our faith in Soviet socialism

387
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,697
will always be rewarded.

388
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:37,495
Now, the State tells us
the situation here is not dangerous.

389
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,206
Have faith, comrades.

390
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,378
The State tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

391
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,838
Listen well.

392
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,053
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

393
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,557
But it is my experience

394
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,060
that when the people ask questions

395
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,312
that are not
in their own best interest...

396
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:08,568
They should simply be told
to keep their minds on their labor,

397
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,821
and leave matters of the State

398
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,115
to the State.

399
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,869
We seal off the city.

400
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,621
No one leaves.

401
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,374
And cut the phone lines.

402
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,419
Contain the spread of misinformation.

403
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,508
That is how we keep the people

404
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,219
from undermining the fruits
of their own labor.

405
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,891
Yes, comrades.

406
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,104
We will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

407
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,360
This is our moment to shine.

408
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,458
Thank you.

409
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,848
Comrade Sitnikov to see
the Chief Engineer.

410
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,113
Well?

411
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,039
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

412
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,209
The large dosimeter from the safe,

413
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,044
the one with
the 1,000-roentgen capacity...

414
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,129
What was the number?

415
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,925
There was none.

416
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,427
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

417
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,638
It's typical.

418
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,806
BRYUKHANOV:
See, this is what Moscow does.

419
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,809
Sends us shit equipment,
then wonders why things go wrong.

420
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,437
We found another dosimeter,
from the military fire department.

421
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,858
It only goes to 200 roentgen,
but it's better than the small ones.

422
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:12,942
And?

423
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,611
It maxed out.

424
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,697
Two-hundred roentgen.

425
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,076
What game are you playing?

426
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,744
No, I...

427
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,455
I asked him.
He took multiple measurements.

428
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,832
He's my best man.

429
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,543
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

430
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,670
I checked the meter
against the control.

431
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,964
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

432
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,966
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

433
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,262
You don't.

434
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,681
Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

435
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,187
I...

436
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,817
I walked around the exterior
of Building Four.

437
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,405
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

438
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,200
You didn't see graphite.

439
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,744
- I did.
- You didn't.

440
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,707
You didn't! Because it's not there!

441
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,335
What?

442
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,087
Are you suggesting the core...

443
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,548
What, exploded?

444
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:21,344
Yes.

445
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,354
Sitnikov.

446
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,357
You're a nuclear engineer. So am I.

447
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:40,488
So please tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

448
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,742
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

449
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,953
I'd love to know.

450
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,996
I can't.

451
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,249
Are you stupid?

452
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,001
No.

453
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,461
Then why can't you?

454
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,297
I...

455
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,010
I don't see how it could explode...

456
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,264
But it did.

457
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,348
DYATLOV: Enough!

458
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,600
I'll go up to the vent block roof.

459
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,353
From there, you can look right
down into reactor Building Four.

460
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,688
I'll see it with my own...

461
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,816
My own eyes.

462
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,781
I apologize.

463
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,159
Guards! Guards!

464
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,539
Get him to a medic, or the hospital!
Whatever he needs!

465
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,933
The feedwater.
Been around it all night.

466
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,645
You go, then.

467
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,400
What?

468
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,403
Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.

469
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,487
No.

470
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,909
No, I won't do that.

471
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,162
Of course you will.

472
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,376
You'll be fine.

473
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,295
You'll see.

474
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,505
Come on.

475
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,882
Okay.

476
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,885
Let's begin.

477
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,395
Leonid.

478
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,733
Leonid.

479
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,535
AKIMOV: It's all the way, okay?

480
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,995
All the way open.

481
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,589
I'm sorry.

482
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,220
There's nothing to be sorry for.

483
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,682
I told you. We did nothing wrong.

484
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,727
But we did.

485
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,703
MAN: Get everyone
in the infirmary up there.

486
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,290
Hello?

487
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,501
- MAN: <i>Valery Legasov?</i>
- Yes.

488
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,087
<i>You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director</i>

489
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,673
<i>of the Kurchatov Institute
of Atomic Energy?</i>

490
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,925
- I am. Who am I speaking...
- <i>This is Boris Shcherbina,</i>

491
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,344
<i>Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers</i>

492
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,513
<i>and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.</i>

493
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,725
<i>There's been an accident
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</i>

494
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,727
How bad is it?

495
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,438
<i>No, no need to panic.
There was a fire.</i>

496
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,316
<i>It's mostly put out.
The system control tank exploded.</i>

497
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,276
"Control system tank."

498
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,695
And the core?

499
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,447
<i>We've ordered them
to continuously pump water.</i>

500
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,534
Yes, I see. Any contamination?

501
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,704
<i>It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting</i>

502
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,455
<i>3.6 roentgen per hour.</i>

503
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,624
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the...

504
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,128
<i>You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?</i>

505
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,132
- Yes. I've studied...
- <i>General Secretary Gorbachev</i>

506
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,884
<i>has appointed a committee
to manage the accident.</i>

507
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,386
<i>You're on it.</i>

508
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,097
<i>We'll convene art 2:00 this afternoon.</i>

509
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,726
That late? Forgive me,
but don't you think,

510
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,602
given the amount of radiation,
that it would be...

511
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:53,814
<i>Legasov, you're on this committee
to answer direct questions</i>

512
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,108
<i>about the function of an RBMK reactor,</i>

513
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:59,361
<i>if they should happen to arise.
Nothing else,</i>

514
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,655
<i>certainly not policy.
Do you understand?</i>

515
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,324
Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...
