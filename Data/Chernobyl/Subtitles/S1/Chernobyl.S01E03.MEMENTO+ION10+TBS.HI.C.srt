364
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:04,789
There's no way to approach from
the interior of the building,

365
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:07,292

it from underground.

of the ground above to a minimum,

378

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,678
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic, touching him?

539
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:34,408
- Did you know she's pregnant?
- It's not true!

540
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,576
What have you done?

541
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,118
What kind of place is this?
Where is her protection?

542
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:40,908
- Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?
- Of course I do.

543
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,575
- Please, I do not...
- No.

544
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:44,877
- People are going to hear about this.
- Wait.

545
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,679
People are going to
hear. Do you understand?

546
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:48,681
Everyone is going to hear.

547
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:50,816
MAN: What is everyone gonna hear?

548
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,857
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission,

549
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,426
and I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

550
00:45:01,428 --> 00:45:04,362
- You can check this. My name is Ulana...
- We know who you are.

551
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:10,025
What is everyone gonna hear?

552
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:32,424
You have your notes?

553
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:34,026
Yes.

554
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:38,295
Khomyuk was arrested last night.

555
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:40,798
What? Why?

556
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,334
I don't know.

557
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:47,070
- Was it...?
- Of course it was.

558
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:49,640
I'm working on it.

559
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:52,543
- Boris...
- I'm working on it.

560
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,913
What more do you want from me?

561
00:45:55,915 --> 00:45:57,481
Fix your tie.

562
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,886
(DOOR OPENS)

563
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,422
They'll see you now.

564
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:19,102
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

565
00:46:19,104 --> 00:46:20,907
successfully extinguished the fire.

566
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,306
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

567
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,509
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

568
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:27,710
And furthermore, there is no longer

569
00:46:27,712 --> 00:46:29,712
a threat of additional explosion.

570
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:34,617
The Soviet people have faced the
challenge and risen to the task,

571
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,953
and they and everyone in
this room are to be commended.

572
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:44,794
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

573
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:47,263
to protect the security
interests of the State.

574
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,933
And since the unfortunate
release of information

575
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:51,300
directly following the accident,

576
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:54,336
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

577
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:56,873
Comrade Charkov,

578
00:46:56,875 --> 00:47:00,910
we hope we have lived up to the
highest standards of the KGB.

579
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:02,044
You have.

580
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:03,779
SHCHERBINA: Thank you.

581
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:08,284
Professor Legasov will now speak about

582
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:09,818
the work that remains.

583
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,426
Thank you.

584
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:19,995
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

585
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:22,030
and it is good.

586
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,633
The immediate danger is over.

587
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:27,836
Now, I'm afraid, a long war must begin.

588
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:31,740
There is an enormous
amount of radioactive debris

589
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:33,942
and contamination
spread out across a zone

590
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:36,478
of approximately 2600 square kilometers.

591
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,949
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

592
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:46,121
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

593
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:52,059
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

594
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:55,096
whether domesticated or wild,

595
00:47:55,098 --> 00:47:59,100
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

596
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:02,537
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

597
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:06,040
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

598
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:11,612
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

599
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:15,883
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

600
00:48:15,885 --> 00:48:18,653
which will be carried by the
wind and the rain if left exposed.

601
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:21,088
So we will have to raze entire forests.

602
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,223
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

603
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:24,625
and bury it under itself,

604
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:28,195
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

605
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:33,267
Um, and finally, we
will need to construct

606
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:38,305
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

607
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:41,909
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

608
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:46,480
There will be deaths.

609
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:51,652
What amount of time,

610
00:48:51,654 --> 00:48:53,320
and how many men do you require?

611
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:57,191
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

612
00:48:57,193 --> 00:48:59,560
and approximately 750,000 men,

613
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:05,065
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

614
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,634
How many deaths?

615
00:49:07,636 --> 00:49:09,636
Thousands.

616
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:12,239
Perhaps tens of thousands.

617
00:49:19,547 --> 00:49:21,347
GORBACHEV: Begin at once.

618
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:25,719
(MEN MURMURING)

619
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:29,214
- LEGASOV: Comrade Charkov.
- SHCHERBINA: Valery!

620
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:32,391
Yes, Professor?

621
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:36,295
My associate was arrested last night.

622
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:37,597
Oh?

623
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:41,935
I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.

624
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,303
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

625
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:47,173
She was arrested by the KGB.

626
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:50,309
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

627
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:51,842
I am.

628
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:54,813
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

629
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:57,316
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

630
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:01,120
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

631
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:03,289
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

632
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:07,360
Comrade, I know you've
heard the stories about us.

633
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:09,762
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

634
00:50:09,764 --> 00:50:11,764
But we are not what people say.

635
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:14,600
Yes, people are following you.

636
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:17,102
People are following those people.

637
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:18,437
You see them?

638
00:50:20,742 --> 00:50:22,575
They follow me.

639
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:26,745
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

640
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:28,046
Nothing more.

641
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:30,515
You know the work we're doing here.

642
00:50:31,786 --> 00:50:34,586
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

643
00:50:34,588 --> 00:50:37,634
But you know the old Russian proverb:

644
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:39,737
"Trust but verify."

645
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:45,530
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

646
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:46,965
Can you imagine?

647
00:50:47,968 --> 00:50:50,535
It was very nice speaking with you.

648
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:52,204
I need her.

649
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,375
So you will be accountable for her?

650
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:03,515
Then it's done.

651
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:07,419
- Her name is...
- I know who she is.

652
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:09,321
Good day, Professor.

653
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:22,567
No, that went surprisingly well.

654
00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:24,803
You came off like a naive idiot.

655
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:28,973
And naive idiots are not a threat.

656
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:47,157
MAN: I'll come back when
the paperwork is complete.

657
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,735
- Are you all right?
- They didn't hurt me.

658
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:02,038
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

(SIGHS) It doesn't matter.

660

They were stupid. I was stupid.

661
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:11,447
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

662
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,252
Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...

663
00:52:16,254 --> 00:52:18,988
(SIGHS) Valery,

664
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,556
Akimov...

665
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:23,459
his face was gone.

666
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,897
You want to stop?

667
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:32,234
Is that a choice I even have?

668
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:43,812
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

669
00:52:43,814 --> 00:52:47,416
I don't know. A 40% chance maybe.

670
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:52,721
I said 50. (CHUCKLES)

671
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:55,089
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing:

672
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,225
"Maybe."

673
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:58,993
(SIGHING)

674
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:02,397
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

675
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:04,866
Maybe the miners who I've
told to dig under the reactor

676
00:53:04,868 --> 00:53:07,335
will save millions of lives.

677
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:11,072
Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

678
00:53:14,878 --> 00:53:16,978
I don't want to do this anymore.

679
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:19,981
I want to stop.

680
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:23,184
But I can't.

681
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:27,455
I don't think you have a
choice any more than I do.

682
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:32,193
I think, despite the stupidity,

683
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:34,687
the lies, even this...

684
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,156
you are compelled.

685
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:39,700
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

686
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:41,202
until you find an answer.

687
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:44,472
Because that is who you are.

688
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,176
A lunatic, then.

689
00:53:49,946 --> 00:53:52,246
A scientist.

690
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:54,215
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

691
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:16,169
Did you know that they
were running a safety test?

692
00:54:17,306 --> 00:54:20,140
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

693
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:24,678
Akimov says they shut the reactor down,

694
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,080
and Toptunov confirms it.

695
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:30,808
- They pressed AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

696
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,410
No.

697
00:54:32,413 --> 00:54:37,116
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

698
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,820
and then the reactor exploded.

699
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:44,331
If it had been just one of
them, I would have put it under

700
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,699
faulty memory or delusion even,

701
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:50,570
but they both agreed. They were adamant.

702
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,576
Comrade?

703
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,682
- Do you think it's possible?
- I think it makes no sense.

704
00:55:02,684 --> 00:55:05,885
I think it's what I would say if I
was trying to cover my own mistakes.

705
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,520
But?

706
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,389
I believed them.

707
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:13,993
Then you should pursue it.

708
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:18,064
We have to pursue every possibility,

709
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,700
no matter how unlikely,

710
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:23,770
no matter what or who's to blame.

711
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,542
I'll go back to the hospital and
reinterview Akimov and Toptunov.

713
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,540
They're not.
