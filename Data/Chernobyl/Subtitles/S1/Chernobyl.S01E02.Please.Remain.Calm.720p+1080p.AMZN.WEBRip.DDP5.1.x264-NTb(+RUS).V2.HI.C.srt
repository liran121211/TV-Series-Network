- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

- GORBACHEV: Boris.

179
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,706
I will allow it.

180
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,454
LEGASOV: Um...

181
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:51,037
An RBMK reactor

182
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,329
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

183
00:12:55,331 --> 00:13:00,204
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

184
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,412
traveling at nearly the speed of light,

185
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,995
penetrating everything in its path:

186
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,204
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

187
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,371
Every gram of U-235 holds

188
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,583
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

189
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,979
That's in one gram.

190
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:19,245
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

191
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,954
and right now, it is on fire.

192
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:26,371
Winds will carry radioactive
particles across the entire continent,

193
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,371
rain will bring them down on us.

194
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:31,737
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

195

the water we drink, the food we eat.

197
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:44,913
Most of these bullets will
not stop firing for 100 years.

198
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,287
Some of them, not for 50,000 years.

199
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,079
Yes, and, uh, this concern

200

00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,915

General Secretary, but I...

00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,748
Do you know how a nuclear reactor works?

212
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,245
- No.
- GORBACHEV: No.

213
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,454
Well, then how will you
know what you're looking at?

214

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHUPPING)

216
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,204
How does a nuclear reactor work?

217
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,164
- What?
- SHCHERBINA: It's a simple question.

218
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,412
It's hardly a simple answer.

219
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:50,412
Of course, you presume I'm
too stupid to understand.

220
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:53,788
So I'll restate: Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

221
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,665
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

222
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,703
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

223
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:14,329
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

224
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,371
Where a typical power plant

225
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,329
makes steam by burning coal,

226
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,665
a nuclear plant...

227
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,496
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

228
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:36,537
We take an unstable
element like uranium 235,

229
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,682
which has too many neutrons.

230
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:41,414
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

231
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,033
Yes, the bullet.

232
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,954
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

233
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,371
Now...

234
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:55,287
if we put enough uranium
atoms close together,

235
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,746
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

236
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,913
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

237
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:06,287
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

238
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,120
- And the graphite?
- Ah, yes.

239
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:13,079
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast... we call this "flux"...

240
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:17,954
it's relatively unlikely that the
uranium atoms will ever hit one another.

241
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:22,995
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

242
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:27,997
to moderate, slow
down, the neutron flux.

243
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,010
Good.

neutron flux moderator.

Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

365

Now there you made a mistake,

366

much about nuclear reactors,

that people were injured
and may have died.

quick to acknowledge the accident

In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

670
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,913
The uranium will melt the sand,

671
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,704

00:51:33,164 --> 00:51:36,746
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

698
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,913
will be ejected at force

699
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:43,037
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

700
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,329
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

701
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:51,704
and likely be fatal to the
entire population of Kiev

702
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,829
as well as a portion of Minsk.

703
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,829
The release of radiation will be severe

704
00:51:56,831 --> 00:52:00,162
and will impact all of Soviet Ukraine,

705
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,871
Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia,

706
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:07,204
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

707
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,873
Romania, and most of East Germany.

708
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:16,414
What do you mean "impact"?

709
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:19,829
For much of the area, a
nearly permanent disruption

710
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:22,454
of the food and water supply,

711
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:25,537
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

712
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:29,079
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

713
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:31,037
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

714
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,454
"impact" means completely uninhabitable

715
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:36,873
for a minimum of 100 years.

716
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:44,204
There are more than 50 million people

717
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:47,037
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

718
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,873
Sixty, yes.

719
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:55,079
And how long before this happens?

720
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:58,956
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

721
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:04,913
But we may have a solution.

722
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,788
We can pump the water from the tanks.

723
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,287
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

724
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:12,496
and the gate can only be opened manually

725
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:14,120
from within the duct system itself.

726
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:17,371
So we need to find three plant workers

727
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:19,037
who know the facility well enough

728
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,746
to enter the basement here,

729
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:25,079
find their way through
all these duct ways,

730
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:27,245
get to the sluice gate valve here,

731
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:31,788
and give us the access we
need to pump out the tanks.

732
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,621
Of course, we will need your permission.

733
00:53:34,623 --> 00:53:36,746
My permission for what?

734
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,287
Uh, the water in these ducts,

735
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,204

00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:44,623
They'll likely be dead in a week.

permission to kill three men.

744
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,287
The valve will be difficult to operate,

745
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:39,204
so we'll need three men

746
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:42,829
who will need to know
the basement layout.

747
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:46,871
And, of course, any
volunteers will be rewarded.

748

And, uh, for those of you working
in reactors one and two, promotions.

Why are reactors one and
two still operating at all?

751
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:08,412

guard that night,

752
00:56:08,414 --> 00:56:10,079
and, uh, she's now dying.

753

And we've all heard about the firemen.

754
