(TRUCK RUMBLING)

538
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:28,760
SHCHERBINA: I'm sorry for all this.

539
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:32,509
But we needed to speak to
you somewhere without...

540
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:35,509
LEGASOV: They're going
to put Dyatlov on trial,

541
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:37,885
and Bryukhanov and Fomin.

542
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:41,885
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony,

543
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,468
all three of us.

544
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,051
But that's... Before that happens...

545
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:49,593
The Central Committee is
sending Legasov to Vienna.

546
00:55:49,595 --> 00:55:51,768
It's the headquarters
of the International...

547
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:55,053
Atomic Energy Agency. Yeah,
I know what's in Vienna.

548
00:55:56,845 --> 00:55:58,593
What are they asking you to do?

549
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:01,637
Tell the world what happened.

550
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:08,676
Well, then you better
know what happened.

551
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:10,718
I've constructed a timeline,

552
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,384
minute by minute.

553
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:15,551
Second by second in some places.

554
00:56:15,553 --> 00:56:17,426
Every decision, every button push,

555
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:19,593
every turn of a switch.

556
00:56:19,595 --> 00:56:22,551
And? Are they guilty?

557
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:24,009
Yes.

558
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:28,092
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

559
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,343
recklessness beyond belief.

560
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,009
But the explosion? I'm not sure.

561
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,345
What do you mean you're not sure?

562
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:38,343
I've analyzed the data.

563
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,593
Toptunov was telling the truth.

564
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:43,969
They shut the reactor
down, and then it exploded.

565
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:48,843
I think this article my have the answer,

566
00:56:48,845 --> 00:56:52,303
but two pages have been removed.

567
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,801
You've seen this before.

568
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,635
Please, believe me when I tell you that

569
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:05,134
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

570
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:08,136
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

571
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:12,834
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

572
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:14,926
a fuel channel ruptured.

573
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:16,801
The operators pressed AZ-5,

574
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,635
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

575
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,593
for a brief moment it went up.

576
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:24,282
How is that possible?

577
00:57:24,285 --> 00:57:25,885
Well, this was the very question posed

578
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,885
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

579
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,926
He's the one who wrote this article.

580
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:33,760
When an RBMK reactor runs at low
power, it's notoriously unstable.

581
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:37,176
Prone to swings in reactivity.

582
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,676
Under normal circumstances,

583
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,593
the control rods can
compensate for that.

584
00:57:40,595 --> 00:57:42,051
Under normal circumstances.

585
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:45,593
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

586
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,509
They pulled almost all
the control rods out

587
00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:48,774
to bring the power back up.

588
00:57:48,777 --> 00:57:51,426
This is what Volkov
learned from Leningrad.

589
00:57:51,428 --> 00:57:52,926
If the boron control rods

590
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,718
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

591
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,092
when they're put back in,

592
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:00,301
the first thing that
enters the core isn't boron.

593
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:02,511
It's graphite.

594
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:08,009
The control rods have graphite tips

595
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,509
that displace water and steam.

596
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,926
So the reactivity doesn't go down.

597
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,092
It goes up dramatically.

598
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:18,551
(SCOFFS) Why on Earth would
they press that button?

599
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:20,553
They didn't know.

600
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:25,092
LEGASOV: Volkov warned the Kremlin,

601
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,845
ten years ago.

602
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:30,217
(SIGHS) But there could be no doubt

603
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,176
about the supremacy of the
Soviet nuclear industry.

604
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,092
Ah.

605
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:39,762
The KGB classified it as a state secret.

606
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,593
LEGASOV: When I saw
the reactor blown open,

607
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:47,134
I still didn't think it
could be this flaw in AZ-5.

608
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,259
Because the flaw will
not lead to an explosion

609
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:55,509
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

610
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:58,426
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

611
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:00,470
But not only their fault.

612
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:03,386
No.

613
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:07,094
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

614
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,009
(SIGHS)

615
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,092
You can't possibly be that naive.

616
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:16,593
There are 16 RBMK reactors

617
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,468
running in the Soviet Union right now.

618
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,509
We have to fix them.

619
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:24,301
The only way to do that is to go public,

620
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,384
force the Central
Committee to take action.

621
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:29,468
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

622
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,551
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

623
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:35,092
We can make a deal with the KGB.

624
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:37,259
You'll leave this
information out in Vienna,

625
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:40,468
and they quietly let us
fix the remaining reactors.

626
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,885
A deal with the KGB?

627
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:44,595
And I'm "naive."

628
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:49,384
SHCHERBINA: They'll go after your
family, they'll go after your friends.

629
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:52,301
KHOMYUK: You have a chance
to talk to the world, Valery.

630
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:54,259
If that chance was mine...

631
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,928
But it isn't, is it?

632
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:00,384
I've know braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

633
01:00:00,386 --> 01:00:02,635
Men who had their
moment and did nothing.

634
01:00:02,637 --> 01:00:06,843
Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

635
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,551
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

636
01:00:09,553 --> 01:00:11,760
It leaves you.

637
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:16,303
And all you want at that
moment is not to be shot.

638
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:22,801
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

639
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:24,345
No.

640
01:00:25,678 --> 01:00:28,509
He was a fireman.

641
01:00:28,511 --> 01:00:31,676
He died two weeks after the accident.

642
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:34,438
I've been looking in on his widow.

643
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:36,309
She gave birth.

644
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:38,008
A girl.

645
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:40,303
The baby lived for four hours.

646
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:43,426
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

647
01:00:43,428 --> 01:00:45,899
but the baby absorbed it instead.

648
01:00:45,902 --> 01:00:47,319
Her baby.

649
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,801
We live in a country

650
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:53,511
where children have to
die to save their mothers.

651
01:00:54,762 --> 01:00:56,887
To hell with your deal.

652
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,219
And to hell with our lives.

653
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:05,053
Someone has to start telling the truth.

654
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:21,676
TARAKANOV: Congratulations, comrades.

655
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,301
You are the last of 3,828 men.

656
01:01:25,303 --> 01:01:28,051
You have performed
your duties perfectly.

657
01:01:28,053 --> 01:01:30,551
I wish you good health and long life.

658
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,509
All of you are awarded
a bonus of 800 rubles.
