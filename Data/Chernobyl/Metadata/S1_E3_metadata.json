At the part summit, he gets the green light from Gorbachov in person to do everything necessary, requisitioning all required means, to stop the open reactor contaminating not only the surrounding area (wide evacuation is still denied) but also the drinking water in the vast Dnjepr basin with 50 million residents. He encourages the Belorussian scientist to continue questions terminal survivors while they can talk to reconstruct how the disaster happened, yielding an assumed impossibility having occurred. When she's arrested by the KGB, Legasov gets her released on his responsibility.
