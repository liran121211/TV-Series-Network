00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,853
- Billy Dilley
- We're subterranean

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,140
- Billy Dilley
- You're such a brainy kid

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,648
- Billy Dilley
- It's fascinating how

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,781
- Billy Dilley
- It's complicated now

7
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,977
- Billy Dilley
- Situation critical

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,111
- Billy Dilley
- I hope it's fixable

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:34,371
- Billy Dilley
- Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

10
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,373
Billy Dilley

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,264
- Excellent shot, Master. (CHORTLES)
- Yes, yes, I know, Thurston.

12
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,085
What else should we hit, Master?

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,889
Oh, how about... (LAUGHS)

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,932
Blast it all, Thurston.

15
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,055
There's an entire world out there
not covered in sludge.

16
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,605
I need to soil something beyond this yard.

17
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,979
- But, Master, Mother says...
- Not now, Thurston.

18
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,532
Look at that crystal. All shiny and clean.

19
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,282
- MRS. WRETCHER: Raymond!
- (GROANS)

20
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,985
No sludging outside the yard!

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,500
COUNT WRETCHER: (MUTTERS ANGRILY)

22
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,754
Thurston, I can't stand one more day
cooped up in this castle.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,093
If I could take my sludge cannon
to the surface world,

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,634
oh, I'd finally be free
from Mother's prying eyes.

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,343
And the only way I'm getting up there

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,099
is with that red-headed buffoon
Billy Dilley's Cheeserator.

27
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,693
But he hasn't fixed it yet.

28
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,765
Perhaps it's time we changed that.

29
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:51,074
BOTH: (LAUGH, SIGH)

30
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,989
BILLY: Boop.

31
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,414
Now, Billy Jr.,

32
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,985
I think I hear your friends inside

33
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,582
doing something super exciting.

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,285
Hi, Zeke, what's cooking?

35
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,423
BILLY: (IMITATING ZEKE) Oh,
just my signature green eggs and bacon.

36
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,415
BILLY: (AS HIMSELF) Mouth watering.

37
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,012
How about you, Marsha?

38
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,756
BILLY: (IMITATING MARSHA)
I'm putting the finishing...

39
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,882
Mouth watering.

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,593
- COUNT WRETCHER: Hello, Billy.
- BILLY: (YELPS)

41
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,092
Careful, Count Wretcher.

42
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,221
I've been working on this diorama
day and night.

43
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,598
This represents all the fun times

44
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,855
me, Zeke and Marsha have had
here in Subterranea-Tania.

45
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,690
But what ever happened to
fixing the Cheeserator?

46
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,529
Oh, yeah, this place is filled
with natural resources

47
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,946
critical to the build.

48
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,619
(SNORING)

49
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:42,161
This sticky Dimetrodon pit sweat
makes the perfect adhesive! Eh!

50
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,287
- BILLY: Ow!
- (THUD)

51
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,753
And I also found
these nifty sheets of algae.

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,417
What part of the Cheeserator are they for?

53
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,835
None, but they make
the perfect slippy slide.

54
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,627
Slippy slide?

55
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,849
- Did somebody say slippy slide?
- MARSHA: (LAUGHING)

56
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,311
- BILLY: Hey, Count, why don't you join us?
- (SPUTTERING)

57
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,981
- COUNT WRETCHER: (COUGHS)
- ALL: (LAUGHING)

58
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,353
It's slip-slidey fun.

59
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,023
Fun? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

60
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,231
Bah, what a preposterous idea!

61
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,067
- ALL: Oh, come on, Count. Have some fun.
- MARSHA: Oh, come on!

62
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,153
Look, I really can't, okay?

63
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,445
I have many serious responsibilities,
I have to attend to.

64
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,244
- Ooh, that sounds important.
- Very important.

65
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,180
Like what?

66
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,205
- What are they?
- Things like... like...

67
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,458
Can we hear a couple?

68
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,838
What would they specifically be?

69
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,632
Super important Count-type things,
all right?

70
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:39,466
- What is it with all your fun and games?
- There goes a busy man.

71
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:46,984
COUNT WRETCHER: Look at them, Thurston,
giggling, cavorting, frolicking.

72
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,727
At this rate, they'll never fix
the Cheeserator.

73
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,355
They're having too much fun.

74
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,193
Perhaps, Master, there's a way
we could make their lives much more...

75
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,315
- un-fun.
- That's a great idea!

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,750
Thurston, I don't know why everyone says
you're so dumb.

77
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,079
- (SCREECHES)
- The ear-bursting screech nettle.

78
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,424
Once Billy gets an earful of this,

79
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,593
he'll come running out of that door
to fix the Cheeserator.

80
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,837
Excellent plan, Master.

81
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,143

COUNT WRETCHER: Any second now.

84
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,563
What is taking so long?

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,449
Hi, Count Wretcher.
Didn't notice you there, yeah.

87
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,780
Just over here listening and moving
to some of my favorite sounds ever.

88
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,163
It's some field recordings I made
of the ear-bursting screech nettle.

92

A sea serpent!

93

It's working, Thurston. Look at him run.

BILLY: (GRUNTING)

95
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,489

One look at this sea serpent...

BOTH: ...and it's good-bye, Billy.

97
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,410
Hello, sea serpent.

Huh?

100
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,908
I always wanted to see a sea serpent
up close.

You guys were eaten
by the sea serpent, too?

105
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,879
Don't worry, guys,
I'll get us out of here. (GRUNTS)

perhaps we've been kidding ourselves.

Could it be my dreams
of world sludge domination

112
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,569
were just that?

113
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,242
Am I never to leave the confines
of these four walls

114
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,905
and the ever-present gaze of Mother
to take flight on my own?

115

Raymond, my ointment!

116
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,674
Yes, Mother.

Hey, guys, you ready to go camping?

Ooh, looks like we don't even need
to leave the house

Camping?

What do I have to do
to get you to want to leave?

132
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,889
Leave? Why would I wanna leave?

133
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,311
I have all my fun memories right here.

Hey, don't worry.
We can make more fun times.

I wanted those fun times, understand?

00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,997
If those fun times are gone,

141
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,001

any more fun times here.

with broken memories.

have more fun times, Billy?

Back on the surface, where you belong.

The fun times you've had
in Subterranea-Tania

150
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,946
will pale in comparison
to what you can have on the surface.

So what do you say we fix
that Cheeserator,

153
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,536
and head back to the surface?

All right, Billy Dilley.
Here's your Cheeserator.

Fine. Take your dumb keys back.

What's your name?

(FLIES BUZZ AROUND)

You got any friends, Jared?

00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,053
I got a couple.

214
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,217
Wanna come over?

No, no, that's okay.
Zeke does that all the time.

You guys get to know each other.
I'm gonna go make us some smoothies.

he will become my newer old friend.

00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,508
that's not a swamp, that's a puddle.

231
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,095
- (LAUGHS)
- Tell another one, Jared.

Uh... what did the finger
say to the thumb?

JARED AND BILLY: I'm in glove with you.

- MARSHA: You are so funny, Jared.

Oh. Yeah, good one, Jared.
Much funnier when you say it.

239
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,213
Yeah, for being
a seven-legged swamp creature,

240
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,420
you sure are good at jokes.

241
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,009
Jokes maybe, but how about juggling?

BILLY: (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY, GRUNTS)

243
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,514

- Yeah, what gives, Billy?

244
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,312
I was just... I don't know,
I was juggling,

245
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,941
and Jared just kind of popped up
out of nowhere,

246
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,020
and messed me up, and...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

247
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,646
I think maybe I should go.

248
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,605
Yeah, that's... that's probably
for the best.

249
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,528
Jared, you can't go outside like that.

250
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,406
ZEKE: Yeah, you'll catch the night flu.

251
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,529
No, he won't. He'll be fine.
He'll be okay.

252
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:52,079
Besides, don't forget our super special
rafting trip we had planned for tomorrow.

253
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,916
It's gonna be super special.

254
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,670
- Eh, we can go rafting any time, Billy.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,835
- (GLASS SHATTER)
- Eh, I guess so.

256
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,560
Gee, Billy, your friends really are great.
Thanks for having me over.

257
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,597
Yeah, okay. Good night, Jared.

258
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,611
Hey, guys, since we're
not doing rafting today,

259
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:22,738
I thought of some other fun activities
we could all do together instead. (GRUNTS)

260
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,414
Oh, what's this?

261
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,284
"Dear Billy, we didn't want to wake you,

262
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:34,039
"but we realized you were right about
how special the rafting trip was,

263
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:39,127
"so Zeke and myself went rafting
with Jared.

"Love, Zeke and Marsha."

265
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,378
So that's how it is.

266
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,263
Well, two can play at that game.

267
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,934
I mean, three can play at that game.

268
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,853
No, wait, four can...
Oh, you know what I mean.

269
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,187
Yeah, that whitewater part
after Creeton's Bend was...

270
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:08,121
Oh, hey, guys. Were you out somewhere?
I didn't even notice you were gone.

271
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,743
We went rafting after all. It was...

272
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,411
What is that?

273
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,579
Oh, that's just Gregory.

274
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,789
- My new best friend Gregory.
- GREGORY: (SNORING)

275
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:24,471
We had such an incredible day together.

276
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,969
We're so wiped out. It's really... ah.

277
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,683
He looks kinda... not good.

278
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,475
Um, no, he's sleeping

279
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,602
from all the super special activity
we had.

280
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,653

- GREGORY: (SNORES)

00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,865
Uh...

285
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,880
He has anxiety sometimes.

286
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,416
Aw, come on, Billy.
Let's all do something together.

287
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,178
I don't wanna do anything with him.

288
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,678
- Well, what do you mean?
- Yeah, what's the matter with Jared?

289
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,345
Well, for starters, he's... he's, uh...

290
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,150
- he's... he's a thief.
- BOTH: A thief?

291
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:24,073
Exhibit A. One empty, fully eaten
jar of Zeke's

292
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:28,072
extra crunchy, no salt
or preservatives added cashew butter.

293
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,034
Exhibit B.
Evidence of said Zeke's extra crunchy

294
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,659
no salt or preservative
added cashew butter.

295
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,590
I submit that this individual,
Jared, is the perpetrator responsible.

296
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,093
Take him away.

297
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,670
Billy, it's totally cool.

298
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,010
I told him he could eat the cashew butter.

299
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,932
Oh, so, that's how it is.

300
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,222
Jared eats here, Jared sleeps here.

301
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,677
Why don't you just have Jared
move in here?

302
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,635
Billy, that's a great idea!

BILLY: (LAUGHS)

308
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,363
You're right, Billy.
I can see my house from here.

309
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,526
Quite comfy for an observation deck.

310
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:57,159
Nothing but the best for my good friend!

311
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,829
Yes!

312
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,918
Oh, no! (YELPS)

313

314

Zeke, Marsha!

315
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,967
I've done a terrible thing.

316
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,636
BOTH: Surprise!

317
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,925
What do you think of your new,
double-decker

318
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,849
custom-made just for Billy raft?

319
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,903
R... raft?

320
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,736
- It was all Jared's idea.
- When we went to go rafting with Jared,

321
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,744
we were really building you your new raft,
and didn't want you to find out.

322
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,070
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

323
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,542
Oh, hey, guys.

324
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,865
- What happened, Jared?
- Yeah, man, are you okay?

325
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,747
BILLY: (BAWLING)

326
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,549
- It's all my fault!
- BOTH: Your fault?

327
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,876
You guys started liking Jared
more than me,

328
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,507
and he became your best friend,

329
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,474
and I tried to make you notice me
and like me,

330
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,854
but it didn't really work,
so I tried to get rid of him.

331
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,139
BILLY: (SOBS)

332
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,517
But Billy, nobody's more important
to us than you.

333
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,604
Huh?

334
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,765
Yeah, buddy.
Like, we'd never replace you with anyone.

335
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,606
Can you forgive me?

336
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,322
BOTH: Of course, we forgive you.

337
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,029
- BILLY: (CRIES)
- Aw, that's better. Let it all out.

338
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,037
And you, Jared.

339
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,160
- Could you ever forgive me?
- Of course, Billy.

340
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:30,341
But, uh, why don't you pour
this barbecue sauce on yourself first?

341
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,295
Why would I do that?

342
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,383
I prefer to moisturize
with mayonnaise and mustard.

343
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,048
That's how I get my hair and skin
this silky smooth.

344
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,930
I'm glad you asked.

345
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,100
You see, when I hit my head
on that huge stalactite,

346
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,940
I suddenly remembered what
I was doing when you found me.

347
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,111
Turns out I'm a hideous
flesh-eating monster,

348
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,692
and I was setting a trap
for unsuspecting prey,

349
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,817
when I hit my head so hard
that I forgot who I was,

350
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,448
or what my dietary preferences were.

351
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,033
- Until now! (GROWLS)
- ALL: (SCREAMING)

352
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,788
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- (RECORD SKIPPING)

353
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,215
(NEEDLE SCRATCHING)

354
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,720
Zeke, Marsha, follow me.

355
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,428
Hurry!

356
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,015
JARED: (LAUGHS)

357
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:32,771
Nice try, Billy Dilley.
Shame you can't reach the control lever.

358
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,282
Well, guys, I guess this is it.

359
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:40,986
Now, eenie, meenie, meinie, mo.

360
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,664
JARED: (SCREAMING)

361
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,448
ALL: (CLAMORING)

362
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,671
ALL: Anaximander!

363
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,956
You saved us, buddy!

364
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,554
ALL: (CHEERING)

365
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,430
BILLY: Well, Zeke and Marsha,

366
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,635
regardless of the whole Jared ordeal,

367
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,770
and no matter who we meet
during our fabulous adventures,

368
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,563
you'll always be my pals!

369
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,652
MARSHA: (CHUCKLES)
That sounds really good, Billy Dilley.

370
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:17,395
Almost as good as eating
these swamp jelly sandwiches. (LAUGHS)

371
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,938
BILLY: (CHOMPS)

372
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:26,738
BILLY: (CHUCKLES) The only thing that
Jared is eating today is "airplane food."

373
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,366
ALL: (LAUGH)

374
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:34,708
JARED: (LAUGHS) Airplane food.
That's a good one.

375
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,508
I said you've got the wrong number

376
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,723
For the right guy

377
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:50,847
I'll do the job for you
Just pay the price

378
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:55,403
Run, run, run away
Baby, stick to the plan

379
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,613
Whoo, hoo Run, run, run away

380
00:21:58,753 --> 00:22:00,693
Catch me if you can
