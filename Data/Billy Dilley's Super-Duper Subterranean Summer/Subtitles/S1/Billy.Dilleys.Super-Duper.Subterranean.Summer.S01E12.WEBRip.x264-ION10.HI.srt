00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,645
I'm glad that Anaximander is okay and all.

338
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,696
That means we put on that whole show
for nothing.

339
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,160
JASPER: Hey, Marsha!

340
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,992
Uncle Jasper!

341
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:30,792
(LAUGHS) Whoa! you kids
must have had one heck of a party.

342
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,537
You got a lotta cleaning up to do.

343
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,296
(MUSIC PLAYING)

344
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:45,512
I said you've got the wrong number
For the right guy

345
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,893
I'll do the job for you
Just pay the price

346
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,311
Run, run, run away

347
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,436
- Baby, stick to the plan
- Whoo, whoo!

348
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,775
Run, run, run away,
catch me if you can
