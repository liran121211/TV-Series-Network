then who is... huh?

176
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,024
BILLY: Ladies and gentlemen,

177
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,309
the moment you've all been waiting for.

178
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,609
Billy!

179
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,364
BILLY: Please put your tusks together

180
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,028
- for Maria the Mammoth!
- (DRUMROLL)

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,950
Oh, Maria!

- (GASPS)
- (LAUGHING)

183
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,923
Aah!

184
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,918
(GASPS)

185
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,415
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

186

- (CHEERS)
- (WHISTLING)

187
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,518
I just can't believe my eye!

188
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,939
It's amazing!

189
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,191
(SNUFFLES)

190
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,240
My name is Billy Dilley,
and I'm here about a wig.

191
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,254
Billy, these new wigs
are selling like hotcakes!

192
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,865
That will be three hundred dirdles.

193
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,543
My share of the mammoth contest
winnings ought to cover it.

194
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,344
See you around, Big Doug.

195
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,264
See you around, kid.

196
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,054
Hey! This is only four dirdles.

197
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,756
(VOCALIZING)

198
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,271
- Aah!
- What? You lost, kid?

199
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,558
Okay, guys, I get it. You hate my hair.

200
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,558
Nah, kid, we like the hair.

201
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,824
Oh!

202
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,025
- Now give us your wallet.
- Oh.

203
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,202
(FURIOUS KNOCKING)

204
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,824
- Hello, Hagwitch!
- Hello, Hagwitch!

205
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,200
Apprentice Billy...

206
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,947
And ex-apprentice Tony...

207
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,949
- ...reporting for duty, ma'am!
- ...reporting for duty, ma'am!

208
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,536
At ease, simpletons.

209
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,249
Will we be using the awe-inspiring power

210
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,376
of chemistry to do
something incredible today?

211
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,377
No. I have to run an errand,

212
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,301
so while I'm gone, you gentlemen

213
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,636
have the great honor of... dusting.

214
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,056
Dusting? Is this like one
of those trust-building exercises?

215
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,927
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

216
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,734
Anyway, dust your little hearts out.

217
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,105
You have free rein over everything
in the house!

218
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,818
Except the cabinet.

219
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,068
That's off limits to both of you!

220
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,448
What would happen if we were to, like,
you know, accidentally open the cabinet?

221
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,251
No, Billy, you don't want to make
an oopsie at the Hag house.

222
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,002
Some days are good, some days are...

223
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,326
Eeeeeh!

224
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,750
(QUIVERS) Oh.

225
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,343
Right, but if you unlock the cabinet,

226
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,215
it'll be a lot worse than that,
you got it?

227
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,763
- Yes, ma'am, Hag ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am, Hag ma'am.

228
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,086
All right, gotta run.

229
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,011
Gonna take care of this pesky boil.

230
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,522
Uh-huh, getting that removed?

231
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,475
No, I'm getting it enlarged, you imbecile!

232
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,773
That's why I'm going to see my sisters.

233
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,944
They're beauticians.

234
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,270
(WHISTLES)

235
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,776
They are pretty!

236
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,356
See you in a couple hours.

237
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,649
And just forget about the cabinet,
will ya?

238
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,027
All right, Billy, we better get started.

239
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Billy?

240
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,617
- (BABBLES)
- Billy, what are, what are you doing?

241
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,248
I'm analyzing, Tony.

242
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,213
I won't be able to forget the cabinet

243
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,833
unless I first know all about the cabinet.

244
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,211
Otherwise I'd have nothing to forget, see?

245
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,222
Why don't we get started
on that dusting instead?

246
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,545
Yeah, maybe you're right, Tony.

247
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,894
Doesn't this feel better?

248
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,813
You never know what you'll find
when you're dusting.

249
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,056
Look at this doily! It's so beautiful!

250
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,056
Do you like doilies, Billy?

251
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,475
Oh, not again!

252
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,230
- (PANTS)
- Billy, get away from there!

253
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,570
I can't, Tony. I'm obsessed!

254
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,243
Just imagine the wonders
that might exist in here!

255
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,080
We can't! We promised, Billy.

256
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,446
Not knowing is worse than anything
the Hagwitch can dish out.

257
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,671
We've got to know, Tony!

258
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,377
Well, I guess there might
be doilies in there.

259
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,165
WITCH SISTER: You call this a boil?

260
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,840
It's no wonder she can't land
a date with Count Wretcher!

262

Can you old bags help me or not?

263
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,847
I think we can help.

264
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,348
Let's get started.

265
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,402
It's so easy

266
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,902

274
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,634
Nothing.

275
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,745
Nothing to it

279
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,006
I don't think it's gonna open for us,
Billy.

280
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,350
Maybe we should just get back to dusting.

281
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,016
That's it, Tony!
Hagwitch said it wouldn't open for us.

Dilley, yeah.

284
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,607
I'm over at the Hag House,
and I was wondering if...

285
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,740
- Yucky!
- Oh, hey, Yucky!

286
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,619
Hey, Yucky, let me call you back.

287
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,907
Uhh.

288
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,697
We tried, like, pretty much everything,
right?

289
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,580
Yeah. We tried the slim jim,
the battering ram, the crowbar...

290
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,209
- Uh, Yucky?
- Just a second, Yucky.

291
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,245
- We tried sweet-talking it...
- Ah!

292
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,585
Yeah! Ooh!

293
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,507
This is the most astounding collection
of ingredients I've ever seen!

294
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,352
Hey, there's no doilies in here!

295
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,513
Oh, well, let's close it up.

296
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,926
Billy, we're closing it, right?

297
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,024
Right after I find out what happens
when milk of sea anemone

298
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,227
is combined with swamp potato,
right, Yucky?

These silly spheres are way too good
to keep to ourselves.

Well, there is one more thing
you could try.

- What?

No, don't do that, Billy.

352
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,751
Wrong, wrong

353
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,549
Tony's so wrong (SNIFFS)

354
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,005
Needs a little something.

355
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,255
Got it! A little Billy con carne.

356
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,272
The sludge cannon is not going
to calibrate itself!

357
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,684
Sorry, Count Wretcher, it's just...

358
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,855
Wonderful! It's time for Hour of Excuses,

359
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,942
starring everyone's
favorite loathsome loser,

360
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,027
the most incompetent little cretin
in all the land,

361
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,114
the pharaoh of failure,

362
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,743
the sultan of stupidity,

363
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,276
the maharajah of moronic...

364
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,750
- (CHIMES)
- Hi! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

365
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,630
Oh, Thurston, how marvelous it is

366
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,590
to have a little love buddy
like you around!

367
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,257
Count Wretcher, are you feeling okay?

368
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,218
Why, Thurston, I've never felt better
in my entire li...

369
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,179
What... is... happening to me?

370
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,058
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh... yah!

371
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,984
- (LAUGHING)
- Yucky! Yucky! Yucky!

372
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,404
Dilley!

373
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,992
Make a laughing stock of me, will they?

374
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,152
Whoo!

375
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,740
It's so easy, one, two, three

376
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,326
You know, Billy,
that was actually pretty funny.

377
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,492
Yucky!

378
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,285
Dilley!

379
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,828
You'll pay for this!

380
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,118
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

381
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,632
If you don't go faster,
tiny Mr. Wretcher is going to catch you!

382
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,545
I'm carrying too much weight!

383
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,917
I need to unload some ballast!

384
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,756
(PANTS)

385
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,507
Guys, it's working!

386
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,099
So, there I was,
in the heart of the battle,

387
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,135
- when all of a sudden...
- (HONKS)

388
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,018
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

389
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,555
MR. WRETCHER:
Come back here, rapscallions!

390
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,111
Billy!

391
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,316
Uh, looks like it's shoes
for dinner again, old buddy.

392
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,278
Gads! My physique!

393
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,034
- Billy!
- Billy!

394
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,584
Is it just my imagination,
or does everyone

395
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,043
in Subterranea-Tania
look more handsome today?

396
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,203
Yucky!

397
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,461
(ALL SCREAMING)

398
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,538
- (POUNDING ON DOOR)
- ALL: Billy!

399
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,342
Might've gone a little heavy
on the swamp potato.

400
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,173
Oh, Tony just knew we shouldn't open
the cabinet.

401
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,511
Now he's going to be beaten up
by scary clones!

402
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,847
- Yucky.
- Well, the door is locked,

403
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,563
so maybe they'll just, you know, go away?

404
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,886
- Yah!
- Yah!

405
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,401
Or maybe they'll just burst through
the door and kill us.

406
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,316
I know you're in here somewhere,
Billy Dilley!

407
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,065
Where are you, Billy?

408
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,323
(PANTS) Oh, so, so much harder
without muscles.

409
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,485
(GRUNTS)

410
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,828
Show yourselves, cowards!

411
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,083
Ugh!

412
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,788
(GRUNTS)

413
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,325
Wretcher! Any sign of Billy?

414
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,247
I wasn't actually looking for Billy.

415
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,668
I just relish the idea of destroying
the Hagwitch's belongings.

416
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,679
(ALL SCREAM)

417
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,675
This doesn't look good, you guys.
I think we have to make a break for it.

418
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,349
But, Billy, shouldn't we try
to fix the problem we caused?

419
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,389
Not if we want to live, Tony.

420
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,269
Not if we want to live.

421
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,605
Aah! Ooh!

422
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,192
- Ah!
- After them!

423
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,280
- Maybe if we reason with them?
- Billy! Billy!

424
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,241
We'd probably have better luck dealing
with the Hag...

425
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,277
HAGWITCH: Holy smokes!

426
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,714
I'm gone for three hours,
and this is what I come home to?

427
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,291
Wait, what? You opened my cabinet?

428
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,961
- You fools!
- (CHIMES)

429
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,626
- Ah!
- (THUDS)

430
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,094
(BLUBBERS)

431
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,384
Oh, Miss Hagwitch,
please have mercy on us.

432
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,136
And why in earth would I do that?

433
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,348
Things just got out of hand so fast.

434
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,555
First, the cabinet was so fascinating,
and maybe there were doilies in it.

435
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,479
- Doilies?
- And then Yucky came over and opened it.

436
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,149
What the heck is a Yucky?

437
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,319
- Yucky.
- (GROWLS)

438
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,986
Right. So then, in a fit
of scientific curiosity, we mixed up...

439
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,737
trashed the place looking for us,
and then you arrived,

440
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,411
and then I started explaining
what happened,

441
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,945
and telling you that I learned my lesson

442
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,778
and that I should've listened
to you in the first place...

443
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,161
(GASPS) ...and then it was right now!

444
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,209
- Whee!
- Whee!

445
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,587
(GIGGLES)

446
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,130
Billy... (GIGGLES)

447
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,257
...as soon as this wears off,

448
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,394
I'm gonna turn you into a toadstool!

449
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,012
Billy!

450
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,095
Oh, Miss Hagwitch, I'm so sorry!

451
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,348
No. It's perfect!

452
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,274
Uh, it is? What?

453
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,733
You saved the day, Billy!

454
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,895
Now, all of you, clear out of here.

455
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,937
I got some cleaning up to do.

456
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,363
I'll be seeing you later,

457
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,120
- Raymond Wretcher.
- (SIGHS)

458
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,115
Shouldn't we help you clean up, ma'am?

459
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,620
Don't worry, kid, I got my ways.

460
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,459
Ala-kazaam!

461
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,666
Gosh! I thought for sure that we would get

462
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,713
some kind of punishment for disobeying
the Hagwitch.

463
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,715
Oh, well,
another house-sitting success story.

464
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,523
I said you've got the wrong number

465
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,682
For the right guy

466
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,598
I'll do the job for you

467
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,983
Just pay the price

468
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,398
Run, run, run away

469
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,609
Baby, stick to the plan

470
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,357
Run, run, run away

471
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,531
Catch me if you can
