stole a rock from the rock people.

into horrible beasts! (GASPS)

- Thanks.

171
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,207
Guess we better take that rock back,

172
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,297
and reverse the curse
before Billy wakes up.

Oh, please turn Billy back into a human.

(BILLY PANTING)

180
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,256
- The curse for stealing a rock.
- Curse? What curse?

- What?

- I don't put curses on people.

Eh. What? Did you say there isn't a curse?

Are you kidding me?
I'm a rock person, not a magician.

185
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,266
But what about when I was overcome
with insatiable hunger?

186
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,767
You probably missed your second breakfast.
It always makes my tummy rumble.

187
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:12,571
- Then how did I know about the petunias?
- I always know when petunias are around.

188
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:17,367
- They give me terrible hay fever.
- Then how do you explain the hair?

189
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,874
It's a hair!
I'm a rock person, and I have hair.

190
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,367
Mostly on my back. See.

- Ooh.

on these hash browns?

Oh, no, thanks, Zeke,

Gee, Zartran.
Maybe we should get you back to my place

- I can't put you and your friends...

- In the kitchen.

- What happened to all your arrows?
- Oh, the arrows.

226
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:27,619

So I chased him outside.
But he ambushed me,

235
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,940
and pulled my ponytail scrunchy clean off
with all seven of his arms. (GROANS)

(GASPING)

237
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,030
Then I made him carry
seven heavy suitcases

up the stairs of insanity!

239
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,040
- That must've finished him off.
- Not even close. (GRUNTS)

240
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,542
And then he threw his soup at me. (GROANS)

241
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,536
So I punched him in his big, dumb eye!
(GROANS)

242
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,304
Then he ran away. The end.

- Holy guacamole!
- Whoa! Amazing!

244
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,636

with the arrows?

- Yeah. Tell us every barbaric detail!

- Tell us, tell us.
- Tell us, tell us.

- BOTH: Tell us, tell us.
- (GULPS)

- BOTH: Tell us, tell us.
- Yes, like I said,

265
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,628
I was battling that Gumbrump,

266
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,462
but he's got three arms, and he's...
- BILLY: Oh. Oh, wait.

267
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,051
I thought you said seven arms.

268
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,802
Well, he has seven now.

269
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,723
He can grow three more arms
any time he wants.

270
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,887
But three more only makes six.

271
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,099
(MUMBLES) Oh!

272
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,977
Oh, the seventh one, he stole
from the poor saps in the soup line!

273
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,896
So that's how he carried
the seven suitcases.

274
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,146
- Wow!
- Whew!

275
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,777

I don't understand.

- Zeke! Zeke! Tell me, what is that object?

278
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,576
You mean my hacky bag?

279
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,838
(CHUCKLES) Yes!
You must regale me with the tale

280
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:23,381
of how you achieved such mastery
over this hacky bag of yours.

281
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,298
Sure thing, Zar-dog.
It was me, Trevor, and Chris,

282
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,048
and we were totally bored one day, so...

283
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,560
This affords me the perfect opportunity
to shift the focus.

284
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,024
- Ah.
- So where exactly

285
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,654
do these stairs of insanity lead?

286
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,361
Off me, creature!

287
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,693
Billy, Zartran wants to hear
about the bag master.

288
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,146
Sorry, Zeke.

289
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:52,486
Oh, please, Zeke, start again.
I've got all the time in the world.

290
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,700
- (SLURPS)
- Hey, Zartran buddy...

291
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,791
(SPITS) You certainly are
a persistent little fellow, aren't you?

292
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,748
The reason you are confused

293
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,128
is that I left out the part
where I body slammed

294
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,547
the Gumbrump so hard that it ripped open

295
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,848
a hole in the space-time continuum,

296
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:16,643
which we tunneled through,
head... (MUNCHING) ...over heels...

297
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:22,817
for a thousand eternities!

298
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,315
- Wow.
- Whoa.

299
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:29,824
We arm wrestled each other for supremacy
until the landscape was decimated,

300
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,331
leaving nothing but sand. The end.

301
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,749
So now, O curious one,
have I answered all of your questions?

302
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,671
- Every single question was answered.
- Whew!

303
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,875
And every single answer
raised several more questions.

304
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:53,678
What do you want?
A full-scale reenactment or something?

305
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,432
- Reenactment! Reenactment!
- Reenactment! Reenactment!

- Hold that thought.
- Reenactment! Reenactment!

- ALL: Reenactment! Reenactment!
- ZARTRAN: A full-scale reenactment?

309
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,902
How in the loincloth am I gonna do that?

310
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,572
Ah, forget it. I'll just leave.
I mean, who needs things like...

311
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,160
fuzzy toilet seat cover?

312
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,667
No. It's just too much to give up.

313
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:29,878
Who's ready for a full-scale reenactment?
(CHUCKLES)

314
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,883
- All right!
- (BOTH CHEERING)

315
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,971
(CHUCKLES)
The first thing we'll need is soup.

316
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,519
From the soup kitchen?
Let's go get it, you guys!

317
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,641
Now for a little Plan B!

- MARSHA: I have the soup.

Hey, Zartran soup's... Oh!

326
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,047
- Just look at this place.
- And look at Zartran.

327
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,676
- Zartran!
- Huh? Oh.

328
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,602
What happened, Zartran?

329
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,351
The Gumbrump was just here. (COUGHS)

- Here?

331

A real battle.

00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:29,439
Aw, man, I can't believe we missed Zartran
in a real battle.

333
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,282
Good news, my friends.
The Gumbrump is coming back.

334
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,816
But the bad news is

335
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,739
that it's far too dangerous
for you to stay here.

336
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,620
So, for your own safety,
you'll have to find a new place to live.

337
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,617
- (BOTH GASP)
- What's that?

338
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:46,331
Gather a few prized possessions,
and leave before it is too late.

339
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,592
I shall protect this place
to the best of my ability.

340
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,715
It is the least I can do...
Oh, and, Zeke,

341
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:57,222
- better leave me the keys, son.
- Good call. Thanks, Zartran. Be safe, bro.

342
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:04,643
Woo! (LAUGHS) I win!
It's mine, all mine.

343
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,024
- (WHOOPING)
- Wow. Zartran sounds real upset

344
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,439
- about us having to leave.
- He's not only brave, he's sensitive.

345
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,530
- He's the perfect man!
- Oh, no, Marsha. You've been shot.

346
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,328
With Cupid's arrow.

347
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,082
Looks more like you were shot
by the Gumbrump to me.

348
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,704
What? Eww!

349
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,791
That's the last time I go clothes shopping
in the dumpster.

350
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,787
Wait.

351
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,666
- "Property of Zartran."
- He's a total phony.

352
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,889
And he took advantage of our hospitality,
just so he could steal our house!

353
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,392
We've got to figure out a way
to get it back from him.

354
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,385
I feel so violated.

355
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,522
Wait a second. What's this?

356
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,908
- What is it, Billy?
- What do you see?

357
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:53,113
Guys, I think I have a plan.

358
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,702
(GROWLING)

359
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,238
Pardon me, sir,
but you wouldn't happen to be

360
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,947
- the Gumbrump, would you?
- Who want to know?

361
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,325
See, I told you this was the guy
Zartran beat up.

362
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,287
- What?
- Oh, yeah. He said he beat you

363
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,630
like a big, soft crying drum.

364
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,629
Where is this liar?

365
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,965
He's right down there.
In that house.

366
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:24,136
Stand to side.
Gumbrump have important business

367
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,726
with rotten little liar man!

368
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,811
- (ZARTRAN SCREAMING)
- Could've used the door.

369
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,560
- (ZARTRAN GRUNTING)
- (GUMBRUMP GRUNTING)

370
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,781
Well, at least we finally
get front-row seats to an epic battle.

371
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:41,319
Now it time to finish you
once and for all.

372
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,830
That's an entertaining story, but...

373
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,080
you're gonna have to catch me first.

374
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,878
Gumbrump get you!

375
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,633
Doodly doozers, guys!
We got our house back!

376
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,389
- (SHRIEKS) Who goes there?
- (GROWLS)

377
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,937
(WHIMPERS) Oh, hey, Francis. Have a seat.

378
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,354
Oh, thanks, Zart, old buddy.

379
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,731
Sorry for going so hard on you earlier,
partner, but they were watching.

380
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,611
- I had to make it look good.
- Eh, no hard feelings.

381
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Plan A kinda went south,
so we had to improvise.

382
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,123
- Did you at least get some food?
- Only the mother lode.

383
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,286
Tonight, we feast like kings!

384
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,342
(BELCHES)

385
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:40,166
(MUSIC PLAYING)

386
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,394
I said
You've got the wrong number

387
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,512
For the right guy

388
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,433
I'll do the job for you

389
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,939
Just pay the price

390
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,403
Run, run, run away

391
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,266
Baby, stick to the plan!
Whoo whoo!

392
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,534
Run, run, run away

393
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,692
Catch me if you can
