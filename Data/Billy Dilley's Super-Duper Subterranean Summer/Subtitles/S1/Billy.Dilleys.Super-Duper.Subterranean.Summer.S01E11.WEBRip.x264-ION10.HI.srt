I've been doing a lot of thinking
about you and me, and us,

and I'm not so sure the us part
is working out so well.

- Because I lost our only two shovels.

That's okay.
We can use these teaspoons.

250

It'll quadruple the clean-up time,
but that's more fun for us.

- Zeke, what happened?

258
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,874
Well, I had the shovels in my hand,
and then, the volcano erupted.

259
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,118
Funny, I didn't hear anything.

260
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,583
It was a silent but deadly eruption.

261
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,502
The most dangerous of all.

262
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,551

They're not usually afraid of anything.

00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,801
- It was a chicken pterodactyl.
- Oh, okay, that would explain it.

265
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,008
Anyway, it swooped down, so I ducked,

266
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,894
and that's when I fell right
into that bush of itchery.

you can shovel trash in your condition.

We'll be together at the bitter end.

supposed to get us the antidote?

- Oh, no, I didn't mean...

347
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,614
BILLY:
The outer shell is heat-resistant gelatin,

348
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,401
and the inner mechanisms
are a convoluted system

349
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,572
of levers, pulleys, and switches,

350
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,857
operated by the power of our limbs.

351
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,695
So, we move our legs
to move the legs of the suit.

352
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,870
Yeah, pretty much.

353
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,329
BOTH: (GRUNT)

354
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,380
- We did it, Zeke, we took a single step.
- All right!

355
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,722
Now there's only 20,943
and a half steps to go.

356
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,881
(GROANS)

357
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,048
BOTH: (GRUNTING)

358
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,804
BILLY: Eighteen thousand, six hundred
and seventy two...

359
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,390
ZEKE: (GRUNTS)

360
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,845
BILLY: Seven thousand, five hundred
and eighty six...

361
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,021
- ZEKE: (GRUNTS)
- BILLY: Thirty seven...

362
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,691
- ZEKE: (GRUNTS)
- BILLY: Thirty six...

363
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,403
- Billy, would you shut up?
- Quiet, Zeke. Look.

364
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:30,276
- "Gorbone & Son's Garbage Town"?
- This is it.

365
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,241
ZEKE: Okay, so is the antidote
in that giant pile of trash,

366
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:38,195
or in the giant sleeping
next to the giant pile of trash?

367
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,334
- The giant.
- Pile of trash?

368
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,038
No, just the giant.

369
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,211
- Well, technically, in his ear.
- His ear?

370
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,383
The giant's ear wax is the antidote.

371
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,296
Side effects may include nausea,
stinky feet...

372
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,764
- Uh...
- ...and life-saving.

373
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,641
(GROANS, SNORES)

374
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,720
ZEKE: We're almost there, Billy.

375
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,470
- Just one more.
- BILLY: We did it, Zeke! We did it!

376
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,273
BOTH: (CHEERING)

377
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,520
(GROWLS) Tickles.

378
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,397
- You wanna try the stepladder?
- Stepladder?

379
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,068
- (GROANS)
- Zeke?

380
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,406
We're doomed, and it's all my fault.

381
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,663
Your fault?

382
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,914
I didn't accidentally fall in that shrub.

383
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,238
I rubbed it on myself

384
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,330
so I wouldn't have to shovel
garbage with you.

385
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,787
Wow, Zeke,
I really appreciate your honesty.

386
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,087
- (SCREAMS)
- What's the matter?

387
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,842
- You're ballooning.
- Oh, no. So are you.

388
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,337
- ZEKE: What do we do?
- BILLY: I don't know!

389
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,386
BOTH: (SCREAM)

390
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,137
I'm sorry, Billy. Good-bye.

391
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,934
It's okay, Zeke. I wouldn't want
to explode in a garbage dump

392
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,270
with anyone else.

393
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,345
Lab friends for...

394
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,362
Billy, look. Now's our chance.

395
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,940
- The ear.
- Our last-est hope.

396
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,185
Swim for it.

397
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,028
BILLY: (GRUNTS)

398
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,609
Swab ready.

399
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,032
Steady.

400
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,195
We must dock precisely.

401
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,827
Contact.

402
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,958
Retract the swab.

403
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,296
It's no use.
My arms aren't strong enough.

404
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,507
Wait, that's it.
We have to use our legs.

405
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,376
A cooperative squat.

406
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,970
Shoulder-width stance and...

407
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,974
BOTH: (GRUNT)

408
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,023
- Feel the burning in my quadriceps.

BOTH: (GRUNT)

410
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,312
Quickly, into the feed hatch.

411
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,490
Deploying the nutrition chutes.

412
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,364
(SLURPS)

413
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,161
- (RETCHES)
- Not bad. (BELCHES)

414
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,082
- Tastes like health smoothie.
- (BELCHES) Ah...

415
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,040
- BILLY: (GIGGLES)
- ZEKE: (BELCHES)

416
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,786
(BELCHES)
Zeke, it's working!

417
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,344
- Whoo!
- (BELCHES)

418
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,297
ZEKE: Whoa! Whoa! Uh-oh!

419
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,127
BOTH: (SCREAMING)

420
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,346
I'm totally alive! Mm!

421
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,559
Zeke, as much as you know
I would love to hug right now,

422
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,138
I don't think this is the time,

423
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,864
seeing as we're trapped
in a giant mountain of garbage.

424
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,441
Isn't this awesome?
There's only one way out,

425
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,653
so grab a shovel, friend.

426
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,031
Or perhaps teaspoons, pal.

427
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,412
- One teaspoon of trash on the pile
- One teaspoon of trash on the pile

428
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,501
- One teaspoon of trash...
- One teaspoon of trash...

429
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,963
All clear, Papa Gorbone.

430
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,792
Roger that, Junior.

431
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,168
- ZEKE: (SINGING)
- BILLY: (SINGING)

432
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,344
I said you've got the wrong number

433
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,513
For the right guy

434
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,215
I'll do the job for you

435
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,679
Just pay the price

436
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,230
Run, run, run away

437
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,146
Baby, stick to the plan

438
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,194
- Whoo, whoo
- Run, run, run away

439
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,694
Catch me if you can
