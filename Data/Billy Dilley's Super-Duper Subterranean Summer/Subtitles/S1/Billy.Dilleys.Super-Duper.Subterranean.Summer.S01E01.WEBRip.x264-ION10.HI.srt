(BOTH SING)

334
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,526
BILLY: (GASPS)
Zeke and Marsha. Mr. Whatzit.

335
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,528
BILLY: (YELPS) Almost.

336
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,620
BILLY: (GRUNTS) Gotcha.

337
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,118
- ZEKE: Billy! It's a huge spider!
- MARSHA: Billy! It's a huge spider!

338
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,791
- (BILLY GRUNTS)
- MARSHA: Hairy, too.

339
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,666
- (CONTINUES GRUNTING)
- ZEKE: Big fangs.

340
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,665
- ZEKE: Billy, we need you!
- MARSHA: Billy, we need you!

341
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,471
MR. WHATZIT: Your friends need you.

342
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,756
Sorry, Mr. Whatzit. Can't talk now.
My friends need me.

343
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,483
Oh, I never thought I would end up
as lunch for a giant tarantula.

344
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,274
Oh, I did. It was in my horoscope
in Teen Person Monthly.

345
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,730
Are you a Pisces, too?

346
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,114
- (BILLY SCREAMS, GRUNTS)
- (BOTH GASP)

347
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,285
- Billy, you came back.
- That's right, Zeke.

348
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,495
And now, I... (GASPS)

349
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,588
- Fascinating.
- (ALL SCREAM)

350
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,878
- (ALL GRUNT)
- Hey, look. It's the Cheeserator.

351
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,178
And to celebrate... (GRUNTS)
...the emergency survival pack.

352
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:28,475
- Billy, is that what I think it is?
- BILLY: That's right, Zeke.

353
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,900
For emergency use only.

354
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,734
Billy, we can't survive
on this stuff, man.

355
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,357
I'm talking about barbecued frosted
pickle bursters.

356
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,071
Blammo bars. Cherry crud cola. (FARTS)

357
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,744
(TOY FARTS)

358
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,617
Those things are all in the other
emergency survival pack, Zeke.

359
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,329
The other emergency survival pack?

360
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,712
ZEKE: (GULPS, SIGHS) Cherry crud cola.

361
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,625
- Now, this is what I call surviving.
- (ALL LAUGH)

362
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,679
Now we can look forward to three
whole months of days just like today.

363
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,505
- (ROARING IN DISTANT)
- ALL: Uh...

364
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,108
Who knew we could build an entire shelter

365
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,192
out of a few non-essential scraps
from the Cheeserator?

366
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,864
- I guess this is home sweet home.
- For the summer anyway.

367
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,699
It's just too bad Mr. Whatzit
isn't here to celebrate.

368
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:35,208
BILLY: (GASPS) Mr. Whatzit!

369
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:45,546
I said you've got the wrong number
For the right guy

370
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,943
I'll do the job for you
Just pay the price

371
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:55,313
Run, run, run away
Baby, stick to the plan

372
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,231
- Whoo, whoo!
- Run, run, run away

373
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,686
Catch me if you can
