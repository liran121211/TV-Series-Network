I'm not pumping up, Marsh.

I am itching to go home.

Phew! Battling evil sure packs a wallop.

335
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,107
- I'll say.
- BILLY: (GRUNTS)

336
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,953
You cheated.

337
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:44,924
Clearly, I am superior in every way.
What a fool you were to challenge me.

338
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,631
I was a fool, but you have a screw loose.

339
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,094
EVIL BILLY: (MOCKS) Oh, oh, oh!
What is it you humans always say?

340
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,547
"Sticks and stones may break my..."

341
00:18:55,635 --> 00:19:00,055
No, you really do have a screw loose.
It's on the right side there.

342
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,889
Of course not, human.
I am perfect in every way... Oh!

343
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,443
(CLINKS)

344
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,113
Don't worry. I'll fix it
with my Turbo Tune Twister.

345
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,685
- Your what?
- It's the screwdriver

346
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,489
that's also a music box.

347
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,238
- Here. I'll show you.
- No, wait. What are you doing?

348
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,365
Hold on a second.
The controls are a little finicky...

349
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,695
- BILLY: (SHRIEKS) My Turbo Tune Twister!
- EVIL BILLY: You fool!

350
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,129
- What have you done? (SHRIEKS)
- (TUNE TWISTER WHIRS)

(SHRIEKING CONTINUES)

353
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,851
BILLY: Zeke was right.

354
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,017
He told me this thing would break
the first time I used it.

355
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,687
EVIL BILLY: (GRUNTS, SHRIEKS)

356
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,237
EVIL BILLY: (SHRIEKS)

357

ALL: (CHEER)

360
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,089
- You did it.
- Yeah, Billy. You beat him!

361
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,429
He was a worthy, handsome adversary.

362
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,601
- Ugh! Uh!
- ALL: (GASP)

363
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,139
(SQUELCHES)

364
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,230
Ew. That's all right.

365
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,308
- We gotta destroy that thing.
- CREATURE: (GRUNTS)

366
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,654
ALL: (CHANTING) Destroy it, destroy it!

367
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,315
- Wait!
- ALL: Huh?

368
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,815
What gives us the right

369
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,026
- to destroy this creature?
- (RETCHES)

370
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,070
Billy, that monster threw us all
in prison, and decimated our planet.

371
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,124
Yeah, that thing's, like, bad news, man.

372
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,289
- He's just misunderstood.
- CREATURE: (GRUNTS)

373
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,825
Every creature's fascinating,
in its own way.

374
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,748
CREATURE: (SCREAMING) Huh?

375
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:57,053
If you just look close enough,
everyone is beautiful.

376
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,719
Aw!

377
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,391
CREATURE: (EXHALES DEEPLY)

ALL: (GASP)

379
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,765
Oh, my gosh, Billy.

380
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,397
Subterranea-Tania is restored.

381
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,323
I guess there is beauty in everyone, bro.

382
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,284
Just look at this place.

383
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,736
- Hip, hip...
- ALL: Billy!

384
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,985
So, you mean we're friends after all?

385
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,027
Billy, if you repeat this, I'll deny it.

386
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,206
But for a filthy, repulsive,
surface dweller, you're okay.

387
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,748
ALL: (LAUGH)

388
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,881
You know, Billy, you don't have to leave.

389
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,337
ALL: (MUTTER)

390
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,722
I wish we could stay, but summer's over.
Time to fire up that Cheeserator.

391
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:46,139
Well, there might be one small wrinkle
in our plan, Billy.

392
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,773
- What's that, Zeke?
- The Cheeserator's gone.

393
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,981

Just pay the price

399
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,046
Baby, stick to the plan
