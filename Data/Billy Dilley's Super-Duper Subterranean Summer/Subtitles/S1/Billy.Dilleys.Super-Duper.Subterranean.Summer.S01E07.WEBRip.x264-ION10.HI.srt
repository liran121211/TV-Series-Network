- Billy Dilley
- You're such a brainy kid

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,226
- Billy Dilley
- It's fascinating how

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,808
- Billy Dilley
- It's complicated now

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,940
- Billy Dilley
- Situation critical

8
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,105
- Billy Dilley
- I hope it's fixable

- MAN ON TV: Cheese and how it's made.
- MARSHA: Hey, guys.

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,341
It all begins in the field.

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,051
Who's ready to help me
do some decorating?

14
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,508
- Hey, Zeke, look what I found.
- Uh, what is it?

15
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,354
I don't know.

16
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,353
But it'll make the perfect wall art.

17

(SCREECHES)

18
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:10,646
- Billy, you wanna help me decorate?
- Normally, I would, Marsha,

19
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,584
but I've got some very important
decorating of my own to do.

20
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,038
No ant farm would be complete
without a working tractor.

21
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,794
There you go, Vern.
And here's a hat for Elmer.

22
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:28,458
And don't think I forgot about you, Wyatt.
You get your very own mechanical bull.

23
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,593
Sorry 'bout that, Wyatt.

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,638
Oh, Billy! That's so adorbs!

25
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,925
You have to let me help you
decorate your little ant farm.

26
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,726
So, where do I start?

27
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,858
- Uh... the ants.
- They're so cute!

28
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,111
They're also exhausted,
what with all the excitement and all.

29
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,029
All right then.

30
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,452
Let the little dears
have their power nap.

31
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,157
I'll be in my room when you're ready.

32
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,163
Can't wait.

33
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,454
Can't wait to kiss your ant farm good-bye.

34
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,867
- What?
- Billy, in case you haven't noticed,

35
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,537
I'm pretty sure
Marsha is a card-carrying klutz.

36
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,551
I think she's just having a bad day.

- (MARSHA LAUGHING)

38
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,875
- Who put that there?
- (CRASHING)

39
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,431
You were saying?

40
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,885
Marsha, can I speak to you a minute?

41
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,941
Um, I really did want
you to help me with my ant farm,

42
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,694
but I think, uh,

43
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,742
you might be sort of a klutz, so...

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,742
A what?

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,954
I, uh, I was merely saying
you might be kind of...

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,122
- A klutz?
- Something wrong?

47
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,168
I may be a lot of things...

48
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,672
but one thing I'm not
is a klutz!

49
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,100
If I can't tell her she's a klutz,

50
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,679
then the only way
to keep my ant farm safe

51
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,675
is to somehow avoid...

52
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,687
- What's up, Billy?
- Hi, Marsha.

53
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,689
Can I decorate
your ant farm now?

54
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,611
Uh... you can help me,

55
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,940
right after you gather
the correct accoutrements.

56
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,778
Accoutre-what?

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,201
You can't just throw
any old ribbons or glitter

58
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,531
on this enclosure.

59
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,868
You need rare and precious
prehistoric tube coral

60
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,124
to glue around the sides here.

61
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,457
Too bad the only place to get it
is deep on the ocean floor.

62
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,842
guarded by man-eating
sabretooth salmon.

63
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,723
That seems awfully
time consuming.

64
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,931
Exactly.

65
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,886
I mean, I know.

66
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,312
I guess I better get a move on then.

67
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,846
That should keep her busy for a while.

68
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,271
- Whew!
- Wow.

69
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,778
that was rough. I don't know
what was worse...

70
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,857
holding my breath
under the ocean floor,

71
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,614
or avoiding the sabretooth salmon.

72
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,411
Anyway, here's the tube coral.

73
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,319
Great job.

74
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,195
You know, I just remembered,

75
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,616
I think I forgot to put
my mold out to fester.

76
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,246
What about the tube coral, Billy?

77
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,462
There's not a lot of time.

78
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,763
If I can't hide from her,
then I have no resort

79
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,380
than to kick it into phase two.

80
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,007
Hey, Zeke, check it out.

81
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,595
Is it time to decorate yet?
I've got the perfect color for the barn.

82
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,772
Marsha, look. I got you a present.

83
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,769
Ooh, I love presents.

84
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,981
What could it be?

85
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,687
Billy, what is this?

86
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,186
- It's a hat.
- This isn't a hat.

87
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,567
- It isn't?
- No.

88
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,781
- It's a fashion statement!
- Whew.

89
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,454
How do I look, Zeke?

90
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,082
Uh...

91
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,294
And it's perfect for painting, too.

92
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,961
Guess what, Zeke.
That wasn't actually just a hat.

93
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,455
(SNICKERS)

94
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,960
It's a bio-magnetic
proprioception appropriator.

95
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,429
It lets me remote control
Marsha. Watch.

96
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,311
This is odd.

97
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,389
I guess I'm going this way.

98
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,651
See? It's gonna save
my precious ant farm

99
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,401
from Marsha's klutzing.

100
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,895
- Must decorate...
- Oh, no, you don't.

101
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,993
Pause, pause, pause, pause.

102
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,414
Success.

Billy?

104
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,881
- Yeah. Sorry about that, Marsha.
- No biggie.

105
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,383
But there is far more
to limburger cheese...

106
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,258
- What am I gonna do, Zeke?
- Hang on, Billy.

107
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,679
Limburger cheese has
a dark and frightening secret.

has left by now.

was meant for me?

still, Marsha, then I could...

00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
Because I didn't want you...

177
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,349
Because I didn't want you to beat me up.

178
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,603
Billy, I wouldn't have beaten you up.

179
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,106
Though I kinda want to beat you up now

180
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,479
for acting so ridiculous.

181
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,611
Besides, there's a reason
I've been acting so klutzy lately.

182
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,946
Boy-yo-yo-oing, what?

183
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,907
Boy-yo-yo-oing, what?

184
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,120
I got a bug bite this morning. See?

185
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,204
A bug bite?

186
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,752
And I've been klutzy ever since.

187
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,999
So it's only temporary.

188
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,548
Fascinating.

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,220
Hmm.

190
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,302
I think I know what she's so upset about.

191
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,393
Here you are, Mama Saur.

192
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,849
Safe and sound.

193
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,769
Fascinating.

194
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,395
Sorry about chasing you
through the forest,

195
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,486
and trying to shoot you
with saliva-covered darts, Marsha.

196
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,656
And I'm sorry for endangering
your ant farm, Billy.

197
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,412
Put it there, lab friend.

198
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,495
Oops! I guess the bug bite
hasn't worn off yet.

199
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,747
BILLY: Zeke, Zeke, Zeke,
Zeke, Zeke, Zeke.

200
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,507
Zeke, Zeke, Zeke.

201
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,551
Have you see
my belly button lint ball?

202
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,925
I can't find it anywhere.

203
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,047
I usually keep it
right here in my belly button.

204
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,434
But it's missing and I...
oh, wait, wait.

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,350
Never mind. It was here all along.

206
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,644
That's great, Billy.

207
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,855
Boy, am I relieved.
For a second there, I thought I...

208
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,148
- Zeke.
- Yes, Billy.

209
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,736
- What are you doing?
- Eating breakfast.

210
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,533
Out of your shoe? Fascinating.

211
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,615
Yep. But when you're living
the X-Factor lifestyle,

212
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,704
nothing is too extreme.

213
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,326
The X-Factor?

214
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,751
That's what the Zekester's all about.

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Eh?

216
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,048
Fascinating.

217
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,881
It appears to be a size nine,

218
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,554
Modern Mukluk with pleather insole,
leather outsole,

219
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,177
triple stitched mud guard
with a foot bed shanked peep toe.

220
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,595
Yep, it's a boot.

221
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,983
There's something weirdly familiar
about that size nine.

222
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,729
(SCREAMING) Yeah, dude!

223
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,686
Wait. I know that logo. Could it be?

224
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,106
Ah, yeah!

225
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,945
Yeah, baby!

226
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:26,785
That marks the 1,999th extreme stunt

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
delivered by yours truly...

228
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,707
Tommy X.

229
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,461
- Tommy Eggs?
- Not Tommy Eggs. His name is...

230
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:41,393
Tommy X! X, X, X.

231
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,847
Tommy X is only the most awesome

232
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,853
extreme stuntman on cable TV.
What?

233
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,686
Sounds like someone's a Tommy fan.

234
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,857
(GIGGLES) I'm Zeke. Big, big fan.

235
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,824
- Oh, why did I say that?
- Yeah, well...

236
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,406
Have my autograph.

237
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,276
(SQUEALS)

238
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,493
You want one, too, 'fro bro?

239
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,407
- No, thanks.
- Wait, what?

240
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,535
I have to check on my plant dandruff.

241
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,836
Sleep tight, my flaky little angels.

242
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,670
- Fascinating.
- Fascinating.

243
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,630
- So, Tommy, where were we?
- Where are we, is the question.

244
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,762
Welcome to the center of the Earth.
And welcome back to your boot.

245
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,636
Oh, not just any boot.

246
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,636
I've worn this boot
in every stunt I've ever done.

247
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,348
Kind of like this patch
of poison oak right here

248
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,361
that I've been cultivating
since the third grade.

249
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,191
That's right, little man. Own that oak.

250
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,660
- The X-Factor is strong in this one.
- I'm pretty sure it's even stronger in me.

251
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,122
Do you remember when you
got hopped up on Krud Kola,

252
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,661
and jumped four tubs
of guacamole on a seg... whoa!

253
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,922
- That was so awesome.
- You know your stuff, bro-seph.

254
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,958
Now you gonna show me around or what?

255
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:03,008
- Tommy X wants me to show...
- I mean, wait up, bro-seph.

256
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,676
Okay, Tommy, you're gonna love this.

257
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,353
I've been piecing this
together for a while now.

258
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,483
I call it the Tommy X.

259
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,768
We can take it out for a spin.
You know, do some stunts.

260
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,809
Then maybe we could... Huh?

261
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,938
Hey, guys.

262
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,653
- How's it rollin'?
- Hey, Billy.

263
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,491
(STRAINING)

264
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,454
- (BONES CRACKING)
- Uh-oh.

265
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,753
I think we better get going, Tommy.

266
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,537
Remember we were gonna
hit the old bike trail.

267
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,750
Tommy?

268
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,972
You got the Factor X!

269
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,094
(BOTH BABBLING)

270
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,822
Tommy, wait up.

271
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,151
I got the X-Factor, too! See?

272
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,866
Oh, Billy.

273
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,250
Listen, I know you mean well and all,
but I need to ask you...

274
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,417
Billy, are you even listening? (SHRIEKS)

275
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,213
- Oh, hey, Zeke.
- (SHRIEKS)

276
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,299
I see you've met Skela-Billy.

277
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,879
- Skelly, meet Zeke.
- Actually, Billy,

278
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,258
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

279
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,894
Anything for you, buddy.

280
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,096
You want me to put bologna
in your tennis shoes?

281
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,103
Do you want me to organize
your scab collection?

282
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,773
Do you want me to braid your toe hairs?

283
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,891
You want me to tape
your nostrils together?

284
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,230
- Do you want me...
- Billy!

285
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,110
I need you to do nothing.

286
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,779
- Boy-yo-yo-oing nothing?
- Yes. Nothing.

287
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,605
Just stand here silently and do nothing.

288
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,908
Do you think you can do that
for your old pal Zekester, Billy?

289
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,867
Billy?

290
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,711
Now for some hang time with Tommy.

291
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,365
X!

292
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,706
(SLURPING)

293
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,634
Zeke! What up, home slice?

294
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,764
I found some puddles
of green muck nearby

295
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,763
that look just like guacamole.

296
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,644
Was thinking we could maybe go
jump over 'em or something.

297
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,723
I, uh, wrote down where they were.

298
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,813
- Wanna?
- Excellent.

299
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,727
Only let's not bring the map.
More chance of getting hurt that way.

300
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,938
X!

301
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,030
So there I was,
covered in hot sauce

302
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,028
and surrounded by donkeys.
What in the X is that?

303
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,990
- It looks like... Billy.
- But what's he doing?

304
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,458
- He's supposed to be doing nothing.
- Nothing?

305
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,122
Yeah, nothing you'd be interested in.

306
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,963
Come on, Tommy,
let's go find that...

307
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,876
Oh! Now this is what
I'm talking about.

308
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,844
Doing absolutely nothing.

309
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,684
This is what the X-Factor's
all about, bro-ham.

310
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,890
You go on ahead.

311
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,676
I'll be right here doing absolutely
nothing with Billy.

312
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,694
Fascinating.

313
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,701
Oh, yeah. My main man, Billy.

314
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:10,824
Whoa!

315
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,830
Tommy, Tommy, have you
seen my belly button lint ball?

316
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,617
I usually keep it right here
in my belly button.

317
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,869
Uh, hang on.

318
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,538
There's supposed to be some lint in here.

319
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,750
Dang it, dang it!

320
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,166
You okay, bro?

321
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,338
No, Tommy, this isn't me.

322
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,795
I'm nothing like Billy at all.

323
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,929
I was just trying to get you
to hang out with me.

324
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,887
You're telling me you did all this

325
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,893
- just to get my attention?
- Yeah.

326
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,979
Whoa, that's, like,
the realest thing I've ever heard.

327
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,860
- Off the charts X-Factor, baby.
- It is?

328
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,652
To tell you the truth,
I need someone like you.

329
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,862
Someone to tell it like it is.

330
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,697
To be real, and also willing
to break every bone in their body.

331
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,791
So what do you say, Zeke?

332
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,038
Do you wanna be
the next Tommy X?

333
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,038
- Your boot.
- Take it, my child.

334
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,208
It's beautiful.

335
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,217
So does that mean
we're gonna hang out now.

336
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,431
(LAUGHS)
Of course, kid.

337
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,932
But first, we've got stunts to do.

338
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,390
- TOMMY: X!
- ZEKE: Tommy!

339
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,188
(SCREAMS)

340
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,902
(ZAPS)

341
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,530
(THUDS)

342
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,195
(GRUNTS)

343
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,043
- Make it stop!
- We can't make it stop now, Zeke.

344
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,287
You haven't even
broken any bones yet.

345
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,918
I know I've left a big boot to fill, Zeke,
but you're not alone.

346
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,798
I'll be here, inspiring you,
flinging you like a rag doll.

347
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,801
I'll always be right here.

348
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,431
Forever.

349
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,223
I mean, it's not like I'm going anywhere
any time soon.

350
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,483
Right?

351
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,726
ZEKE: Ah, or maybe you are.

352
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,066
- That oughta show 'em.
- Exhausting. Hey, what's that?

353
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,034
Same thing it was last time you asked.

354
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,324
- It's a jabby stick.
- Up there.

355
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,121
Looks like some imbecile's
about to attempt

356
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,121
- an impossible stunt.
- Let's go!

357
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,956
Batter up. Huh?

358
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,290
What the...

359
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:41,681
- Zeke-meister, what's all this?
- Hey, Tommy ex-X.

360
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,886
Oh, not much. I was just, like,
using everything you taught me to,

361
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,770
you know, create and execute
the world's most righteous stunt

362
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,610
in the history of punishing oneself
for the amusement of others!

363
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,186
Pretty cool, huh?

364
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,066
Well, I guess it's time
I'll get this party started.

365
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,199
Wouldn't wanna keep
my fans waiting.

366
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,994
(CHEERING WEAKLY)

367
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,833
You know how they are, right, Tommy?

368
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,081
(GROWLING)

369
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,830
- Zeke, wait.
- Yes, Tommy?

370
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,746
I know you were
looking forward to this.

371
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,800
In a way, so was I,

372
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,632
even though I had no idea
it was gonna happen,

373
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,593
but I'm afraid you're not ready.

374
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,136
Just a second.

375
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,057
(GASPS) Not ready?

376
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,140
- Of course I am.
- Shhhh!

377
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,523
And one day, you will be ready.

378
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,727
But until that day,
I'm gonna need that boot back.

379
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,693
- This boot?
- Sorry, buddy.

380
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,698
Tommy X is back!

381
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,359
(CHEERING WEAKLY)

382
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,371
Now step aside, hombre,

383
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,905
and watch the master at work.

384
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,124
X!

385
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,460
- (GASPING)
- Later, bros!

386
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,175
Wow.

387
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,763
Well, I guess everybody
is back in their original habitat.

388
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,885
Sorry things didn't
work out with you

389
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,562
and the most awesome
extreme stuntman on cable TV, Zeke.

390
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,942
That's okay, Billy.

391
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,019
I walked a mile
in my hero's boot,

392
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,824
and what do I have to show for it?
Foot fungus.

393
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,065
Maybe people just shouldn't
wear each other's boots.

394
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,738
Or taste them.

395
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,856
Yeccchhhh!

396
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,121
- You know what would taste good right now?
What's that, Zeke?

397
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,446
A little breakfast with my buddy Billy.

398
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,245
- Out of a shoe?
- I don't think so.

399
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,039
- BILLY: How about out of a sandal?
- ZEKE: Nope.

400
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,042
- BILLY: Clog?
- ZEKE: Uh-uh.

401
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,247
- BILLY: Rain boot?
- ZEKE: No.

402
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,754
- BILLY: Galosh? Penny loafers?
- ZEKE: No.

403
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,424
- BILLY: Quarter loafers?
- (ZEKE GROANS)

404
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,469
I said you've got
the wrong number

405
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,716
For the right guy

406
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,520
I'll do the job for you

407
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,889
Just pay the price

408
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,310
Run, run, run away

409
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,441
Baby, stick to the plan

410
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,773
Whoo whoo

411
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,727
Run, run, run away

412
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,858
Catch me if you can
