332
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,851
(PANTS) Don't worry, Count.

333
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,138
- I got an idea.

334
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,689
(GRUNTS)

335
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,646
(WHIMPERS)

336
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,608
(GRUNTS)

337
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,453
(SHOUTS)

338
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,823
(GROANS) This is it.

339
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,540
(SCREAMS) Billy! Shoot the Cheeserator!

340
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,790
I'm on it, Count. (SCREAMS)

341
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,754
Whoa!

342
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,468
Nice knowing you, tumbleweed.

343
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:22,971
Oh.

344
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,394
(SCREAMS)

345
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,188
CHEESERATOR: Limburger not found...
(DISTORTED)

346
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,319
- The Cheeserator stopped.
- What is that smell?

347
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,649
Sludge.

348
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,160
- Huh?
- Huh?

349
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,371
The sludge masked the Limburger smell
that was causing the Cheeserator

350
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,294
to target Count Wretcher.

351
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,003
So Count Wretcher's toxic sludge
saved our lives.

352
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:55,129
(GIGGLES) And that is precisely
why I want to share my sludge

353
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,797
with the surface world.

354
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,756
You said you wanted to cover
every single inch of the world with it.

355
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,640
- Including us!
- Well... (STAMMERS) ...in that instance,

356
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,427
- sludge was just a metaphor for love.
- Still don't trust him.

357
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,102
- Nope.
- (CHUCKLES) But you, Billy,

358
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,783
you still trust me. Don't you, Billy?

359
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,152
Absolutely!

360
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,236
- MRS. WRETCHER: Raymond!
- COUNT: (GROANING) Yes, Mother?

361
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,579
MRS. WRETCHER:
It is past your bedtime, young man.

362
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,656
- COUNT: Coming, Mother.
- THURSTON: Welcome home, Count Wretcher.

363
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,003
COUNT: Not now, Thurston. Not now.

364
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,045
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

365
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,339
I said you've got the wrong number

366
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,684
For the right guy

367
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,270
I'll do the job for you

368
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,886
Just pay the price

369
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,310
Run, run, run away

370
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,402
Baby, stick to the plan
Whoo whoo

371
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,529
Run, run, run away

372
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,694
Catch me if you can
