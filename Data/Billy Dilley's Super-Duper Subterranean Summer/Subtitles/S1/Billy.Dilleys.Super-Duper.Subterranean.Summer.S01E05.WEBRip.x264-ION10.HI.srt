- Here, let me take care of that.

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,247
It's silly, really. I was attempting
to study some hornets

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,370
but I couldn't get close
enough so... (GASPS)

23

circumference, too!

Is that a subterranean roly-poly?

- I love roly-polies.
- Me too.

you're fascinating-ing.

I think I'm seeing something special
in you that I didn't notice before.

- You are?
- Yes. An earthworm! (CHUCKLES)

Isn't she fascinating?

- What?
- For Lisa.

that would show her how much I care.

you're doing with this T-shirt, mister?

meet each other?

around helplessly

00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,544
in my swamp, so I pulled him to safety.

- Well, isn't that interesting?
- Not really.

Thank you, Master.

337
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,697
- What else you bumbling idiots got?
- He's right! Plan A is a bust!

338
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,410
I have no choice but to resort to Plan B!

339
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,826
- (CUNNINGLY LAUGHING)
- Brute force!

340
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,375
- Oh, you're a crazy person!
- Count, I need you!

341
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,168
BILLY: And I need you!

342
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:20,093
(CACKLING) You can run,
but you can't hide!

343
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,466
How do I shake these imbeciles?
Thurston, we've got a big problem!

344
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,848
(YELLS) Swap clothes with me!

345
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,395
You know how you love
to wear epaulettes!

346
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,440
(EXCLAIMS) I'll take all your dinners
with Mother for a month!

347
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,570
(SOBBING) Help me, you nincompoop!

348
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,120
- Make a break for it. I'll hold her off.

349
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,873
Oh, Schmoopies!

350
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,162
(BOTH GASP)

351
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,161
- Here I... Huh?
- BILLY: Fine love!

352
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,833
Don't fight your feelings. (GRUNTS)

353
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,961
- (PANTS)
- Aah!

354
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,840
Now you're mine! Mwah, mwah!

355
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,011
- No!
- Yes!

356
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,342
Billy!

357
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,768
Thurston! Help me, you dumb dumb!
(GRUNTS)

358
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,853
- (BURPS)
- (POPS)

359
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,985
Funny, I had a strange
and unsettling dream

360
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:23,533
that I was head over heels for you.
Isn't that interesting?

361
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,161
Some days are good
Some days are...

362
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,622
(GURGLES)

363
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,962
So... what time should
I show up tomorrow?

364
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,420
(MUSIC PLAYING)

365
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,336
I said You got the wrong number

366
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,431
For the right guy

367
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,433
I'll do the job for you

368
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,849
Just pay the price

369
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,403
Run, run, run away

370
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,267
Baby, stick to the plan!
Whoo, whoo!

371
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,652
Run, run, run away
