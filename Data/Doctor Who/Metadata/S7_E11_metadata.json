Alec is a former army Major, now a psychologist, whilst Emma is an empathic psychic who can not only sense the presence of paranormal beings, but can sense their feelings as well. Palmer explains the house has been haunted for hundreds of years, and the ghost - a woman - is likely much older. Emma senses the ghost is very lonely, but the Doctor realises she's not a ghost at all, but a creature trapped in a zone where time moves much faster there than it does here. The good Doctor gets to play Cupid.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2267332", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 6582, "number_of_episodes": 175}
