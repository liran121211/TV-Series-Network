So losing it in a black hole somewhere in deep space is a bit of a worry. Not least, he says, because without it he'll have to settle down and get a mortgage. In this two-parter (The Impossible Planet and next week's The Satan Pit), the Doctor and Rose land in a ramshackle spaceship stationed on an obscure planet that's trapped in permanent orbit round an all-consuming black hole. But that's only half the problem. An army of hideous-looking Oods stalks the corridors, while a disembodied voice repeats, \"The beast is awakening.\"\u2014Jane Rackham", "The Doctor and Rose arrive on a planet that should not be there - it's on the edge of a black hole. The answer seems to lie in a counterbalancing gravitational force emitted by the planet. The human scientists are there to study the phenomenon and are assisted by a subservient race of beings, known as the Ood. The surface of the planet is unstable and the Tardis vanishes into a pit. It soon becomes clear that here is a creature of some sore living in the pit and that the Ood are not the benevolent creatures they at first appear to be.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0772457", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 9380, "number_of_episodes": 175}
