John has his head frequently in the clouds. He has recurring dreams which he jots down details of in his journal and recounts to Joan Redfern, the school's plain, kind-hearted Matron. They involve an alien time traveler who calls himself the Doctor who journeys through time and space in a blue box, picking up numerous companions along the way. But he wonders if it's all really just the dream. As John and Joan's feelings become more and more apparent is there more to Martha's concerns over Mr. Smith than just mere infatuation? Events begin to take another twist when a mysterious, other-worldly family with an army of animated scarecrows make their presence known.\u2014Robert McElwaine", "When Doctor realizes that he is being hunted by the family, he must find a place to hide - he must also turn himself into a human.
