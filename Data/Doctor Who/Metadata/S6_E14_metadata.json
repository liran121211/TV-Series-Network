Having finally accepted his fate the Doctor travels to Lake Silencio for his final day. But one woman refuses to let time take its course.", "It's April 22, 2011 the day the Doctor is supposed to die but time seems to be stuck at 5:02 p.m. London streets are clogged not only with automobiles but also Roman chariots; pterodactyls fly in the sky. The Holy Roman Emperor, Winston Churchill, calls on a prisoner to explain what is happening. In fact, all time seems to be occurring all at once. The Doctor determines that a fixed point in time has been altered or prevented from occurring. That fixed point is his own death at Lake Silencio where history records that River Song killed him. Of course not all is as it seems, particularly as it relates to the Doctor himself.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1824359", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 7895, "number_of_episodes": 175}
