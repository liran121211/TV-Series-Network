Donna sees an opportunity to warn everyone and evacuate the city but the Doctor flatly refuses. When the Doctor learns that those with the ability to see future are slowly turning to stone, he quickly comes to the conclusion that alien beings are operating inside the volcano - and that he has a far greater decision to make than that put to him by Donna.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1173173", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 8596, "number_of_episodes": 175}
