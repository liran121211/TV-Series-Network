It's a Christmas-themed cruise with a visit to this strange planet called Earth. When some of the passengers travel down to the planet's surface, they find London deserted, owing to a series of alien attacks that in recent years always seem to occur at Christmas-time! The Captain purposely lowers the ship's shield resulting in severe damage from asteroids. Joined by Astrid Peth, a waitress, and several passengers including Foon and Movin Von Hoff, Bannakaffalatta, Rickston Slade and Mr. Copper, the Doctor fights robot-like creatures in the form of angels.
