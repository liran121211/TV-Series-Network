Spike has a hunch that Decker would be blending in at a bar. Course the bar he went to is full of all the bounty hunters in town. Spike meets a female Space Trucker name V.T. Very few people know what her real name is. So every time they try to guess what it is they'd have to bet on it. If they loose she gets the money, if they win they receive all the money she won on the bets.
