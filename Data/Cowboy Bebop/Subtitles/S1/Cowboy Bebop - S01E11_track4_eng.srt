1
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,152
Space travel log 0968.

2
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,423
We were wasting our free time.

3
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,124
It sounds good to call the
bounty-hunting job a "freelance" job...

4
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,897
...but all that means is
that we're self-employed.

5
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,871
When we have no jobs,
we have none at all.

6
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,931
Well, that's all a
part of our destiny...

7
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,170
...but it's troublesome
that we're out of money.

8
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,374
And so, we get urges
to make quick cash...

9
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,223
Any problem with using these?

10
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,258
Evens!

11
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,029
Evens, is it?

12
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,961
No, odds after all!

13
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,933
Odds, is it?

14
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,407
Yeah... odds.

15
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,874
Double ace... Even.

16
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,562
I can't eat any more...

17
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:29,500
Well, it would be easiest for
me if you paid up in cash...

18
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,004
So, what'll it be?

19
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,247
A man does not take back his word!

20
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,618
That's why I told you not to do it...

21
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,681
Humans were meant to work and
sweat for their money after all.

22
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,727
Those that try to get rich quick...

23
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,525
...or live at the expense of others...

24
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,123
...all get divine retribution
somewhere along the way.

25
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,466
That is the lesson...

26
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,064
But one thing about
humans is that they...

27
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,199
...quickly forget the
lessons they just learned.

28
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,410
Dammit.

29
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,917
There was a fridge way back here?

30
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,428
"Survival of the fittest"
is the law of the land.

31
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,527
To fool and to be fooled
is the reason we live.

32
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,634
I've never had anything good
happen to me when I trust others.

33
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,505
That's the lesson.

34
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,983
How much did you swindle?

35
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,384
Would you stop saying things
that would hurt my reputation?

36
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,012
He lost on his own!

37
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,920
Because he couldn't
see through this cheat?

38
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,521
It's part of one's skill
to see through it.

39
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,587
At least give his clothes back to him.

40
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,996
I'll lend them to him.

41
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,728
Greedy, aren't we?

42
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,270
It's rough out there in the real world.

43
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,246
Hey, what's up?

44
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,410
Something bit me.

45
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,214
What do you mean, "something"?

46
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,092
I-It wasn't a rat!

47
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,193
Look at this! This wound on my neck!

48
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,100
HEY!

49
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,639
This is silly. It was a waste
of time running over here.

50
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,143
Spike! I was bitten around that fridge!

51
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,941
Fridge?

52
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,379
Hmm? You have a clue?

53
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,348
I'm sure... there was something...

54
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,853
Nope, can't remember.

55
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,781
You sure this is gonna work?

56
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,976
The only thing it doesn't work on
are near sightedness and cavities.

57
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,981
Then it works on athlete's foot?

58
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,350
Of course.

59
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,687
Don't you have something more
legit that would get rid of sores?

60
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,690
That would be this.

61
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,787
That gets rid of sores?

62
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,726
Yeah.

63
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,789
Crush this, and you boil it
in 3 cups of water until...

64
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,767
...the liquid simmers down
to 1 cup, and you drink it.

65
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,066
Spike, isn't there something more...

66
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,867
...different?

67
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,237
Oh, I got just the thing.

68
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,502
Yeah, gimme that...

69
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,807
Gimme what you had before.

70
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,883
Hey... I'm feeling a lot sicker now...

71
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,188
Do I look pale?

72
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,161
You're pretty pale to begin with.

73
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,391
What is this awful smell?

74
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,455
Herbal medicine.

75
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,001
Herbal medicine? THIS?

76
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,869
It smells like you just left a rag
that cleaned up spilt milk out to dry!

77
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,205
I think it's more like rotten soybeans.

78
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,938
Knock it off!.
I have to drink this ya know!

79
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,255
Oh, brother.

80
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,589
Hey, now, this goes
too far for a joke...

81
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,179
It was a rat, right?

82
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,275
There's nothing to make a fuss about.

83
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,846
Am I wrong?

84
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,784
I have no clue.

85
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,286
He seems to have gotten some poison
that's not in this database.

86
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,259
Looking at similar poisons...

87
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,222
Cryptosporidium...

88
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,264
...that's not it...

89
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,558
Cholera...?

90
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,195
Nope...

91
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,239
Ebola virus...?

92
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,773
Nope...

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,800
Bifidobacterium...?

94
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,503
Not even close.

95
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,812
What is it?

96
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,541
Ein, you're being noisy.

97
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,607
I can say for sure that
it wasn't an ordinary rat.

98
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,243
Hey, keep it quiet.

99
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,878
So what is it?

100
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,047
Well, it's...

101
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,455
A mysterious space creature!

102
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,825
Spooky! The attack of
a horrible space creature!

103
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,061
Oh, yeah, there's that possibility...

104
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,102
Heh... Yeah, right.

105
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,602
Then what is it?

106
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,400
It's not in the database.

107
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,166
Yeah...

108
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,174
These base-pairs are weird, too.

109
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,971
You think so?

110
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,104
We've never seen symptoms
like this before either.

111
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,479
Other than a space creature,
what is it? What is it?

112
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,113
Well... um, perhaps something like
a rat went through a mutation...

113
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,181
...and evolved into
some mysterious creature...

114
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,160
...and carried a mysterious poison...

115
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,695
What's that about?

116
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,755
That isn't too different from the
"mysterious space creature" theory!

117
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,734
This is too silly.

118
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,328
Aiya... what are we gonna do, Ein?

119
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,533
It's a space creature!

120
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,873
It's spooky!

121
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,581
All right. This is made
to sense heat sources.

122
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:54,846
It's usually used to find
bounties that are hiding.

123
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,547
Can you see me?

124
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,264
All right, I'm gonna test it,
so move just like I tell you...

125
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,261
Ein! Where are you going?

126
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,324
Hey, wait!

127
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,564
HEY!

128
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,134
That's weird... Is it broken?

129
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,571
Was that response from you?

130
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,140
That story you were telling, about some
mysterious creature or something a rather...

131
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,515
Oh, yeah.

132
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,884
What happens if you're bitten?

133
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:34,221
I can't say for sure until we catch
the creature, but I'm going to guess...

134
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,952
...death?

135
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:41,130
No... why did it have to be this way?

136
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,692
I still have a lot to live for...

137
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,969
I haven't committed any crimes...

138
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,841
I'm still young and lively...

139
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,234
Lively?

140
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,948
Oh, poor little me!

141
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,918
Hey now, why are you
getting into this...?

142
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,876
August 6th. Skyday.

143
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,848
Today, we will go look for the
spooky mysterious space creature.

144
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:36,313
Lesson, lesson... if you
see a stranger, follow him!

145
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,292
Are you here?

146
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,093
Are you here, Mr. Spooky Creature?

147
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,600
Ed! Ein!

148
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,661
Hey! This isn't hide-and-seek!

149
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,146
Exploration, experimentation,
exclamation.

150
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,444
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

151
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,476
I will come back alive.
I trust you, Ed.

152
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,055
Ein!

153
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,957
Are ya in here?

154
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,194
You're not in here?

155
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,930
Answer me!

156
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,062
Really...

157
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,079
Ein, Ed... What happened?

158
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,227
Ein!

159
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,696
Hey, hang in there!

160
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,263
Where's Ed?

161
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,808
I can't believe it got you this easily.

162
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,071
You're a dog!
Where're your natural instincts!?

163
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,028
No choice...
Guess I'm going in!

164
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,070
Cruising down Route 66.

165
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:19,083
Approximate cruising
time left: 82hours.

166
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,813
From here, we will
enter full autopilot.

167
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,357
After passing the gate, this ship
will automatically land on Mars.

168
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,459
The route cannot be
changed after confirmation.

169
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,864
Ed! You aren't here, are you? Hey!

170
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,540
Did that thing get her too...?

171
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,113
Don't surprise me!

172
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,317
I've been waiting for ya!

173
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,767
Excellent!

174
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,375
Come on, you slime!

175
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,679
Got 'im!

176
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,760
This thing seems familiar...

177
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,708
I guess I should a eaten that...

178
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,836
Oh yeah, it should be in the fridge...

179
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,945
That was when
I remembered everything.

180
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,750
It was... oh, one year ago.

181
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,353
When I had gotten a hold
of a real lobster...

182
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,658
...I hid it in the fridge
in this stockroom...

183
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,960
..just so nobody
else would eat it.

184
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,399
But I had forgotten about it, and
left it in there for a whole year...

185
00:18:59,471 --> 00:18:59,471
I wonder what it looks
like in there now...

186
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,635
I wonder what it looks
like in there now...

187
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,960
Shit...!

188
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,434
Dammit...!

189
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,108
You shouldn't leave
things in the fridge.

190
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,578
That is the lesson.

191
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,698
Sweet bean roll!

192
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,400
Mmm... can't eat anymore...

193
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,974
And so... they all passed away.

194
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:18,546
Everyone, it was brief,
but thanks for your support.

195
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,716
This was the last episode.

196
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,953
I hope they rest in peace.

197
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,893
Amen.

198
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,296
And starting next episode,
we bring you "Cowgirl Ed"!

199
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,197
I'm the main character!

200
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,064
Hey, wait a minute!

201
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,626
What kinda selfish crap is that!?

202
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,400
Next episode: Jupiter Jazz, part 1 .

203
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,942
There really is another episode!
