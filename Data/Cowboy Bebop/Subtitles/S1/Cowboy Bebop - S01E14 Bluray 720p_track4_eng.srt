1
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,210
Welcome back.
And how was it?

2
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,350
—Oh, they were just thugs!
—Nothing to do with the syndicate…

3
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,380
—Dammit, was just a salaried employee…
—…they just wanted money to play with.

4
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,450
—…that gave into his temptations.
—They went to the cops penniless!

5
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,960
Then, what?

6
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,430
All of you caught the criminals, but no
clue about the bounty we’re really after?

7
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,970
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY

8
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,930
They still use paper just
for all the complaints.

9
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,940
Dammit, they’re just harassing us.

10
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,460
And it’s a waste
of valuable resources!

11
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,410
The e-mail server is going down
from the sheer number of complaints.

12
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,420
There is a movement out there
to sue our company for damages…

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,420
What the hell are
the bounty-hunters doing?!

14
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,440
We already have a huge bounty on him!

15
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes, however…

16
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,150
<i>Amigo!</i>

17
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,990
<i>All you bounty-hunters in the</i>
<i>Sol system, how are y’all doing?</i>

18
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,260
<i>Once again, it’s time for Big Shot!</i>

19
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
<i>We’ll start with today’s hot news!</i>

20
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,770
<i>They apprehended the culprit in</i>
<i>the series of recent Gate assaults!</i>

21
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,000
<i>Really? The bounty on him was</i>
<i>12 million Woolongs, right?</i>

22
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
<i>But the weird thing is that</i>
<i>20 culprits were apprehended!</i>

23
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>What do you mean?</i>

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,110
<i>Apparently, they were all caught in</i>
<i>the act, but none were the mastermind.</i>

25
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,710
<i>Then you don’t get the reward</i>
<i>unless you find that mastermind?</i>

26
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,020
<i>But of course!</i>

27
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,050
<i>Oh my…</i>

28
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,530
<i>I feel sorry for all the guys</i>
<i>who caught the culprits!</i>

29
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,090
Why the hell do these
thugs that normally just…

30
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,470
…rob convenience stores
attack at the Gates?

31
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,230
Maybe there are fads in crimes?

32
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,800
Like “Hyperspace Gates are the IN thing
among today’s fashion-conscious kids!”

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,970
“That girl won’t even look your way until…”

34
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,180
“…you assault at least
one Gate!” or something?

35
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,920
Hey, guys.

36
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,860
Why don’t we trade the
information that we each have?

37
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,760
And split the bounty three ways…

38
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,990
What do you mean?

39
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,860
You’re the one that
started all this, saying…

40
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,390
…that we should research
this case on our own.

41
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,170
You also said that the occasional rivalry
between comrades would be good for us.

42
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,870
Come on, did the reward amount
make you lose your memory?

43
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,370
What? You guys were really
keen on the idea, too!

44
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,050
After all, we all wanted the
bounty to ourselves, right?

45
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,900
<i>In this case, all 20 cases</i>
<i>were done the same way,</i>

46
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,450
<i>All of them infiltrated</i>
<i>the tollbooth…</i>

47
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,620
<i>…deftly attached the hacking unit…</i>

48
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,180
<i>…and in the exact</i>
<i>moment that passing ships…</i>

49
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,250
<i>…access the tollbooth</i>
<i>to pay the toll…</i>

50
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,130
<i>…they steal the entire</i>
<i>balance from the credit card.</i>

51
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,260
<i>Furthermore, the unit automatically,</i>
<i>sent the money data that it just stole.</i>

52
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,670
<i>It immediately launders all</i>
<i>the funds in a bank on Europa…</i>

53
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,240
<i>…making it impossible</i>
<i>to track where it went.</i>

54
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,940
<i>All the culprits that were caught</i>
<i>in the act have nothing in common.</i>

55
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,680
<i>Age, gender, nationality,</i>
<i>religion, criminal record…</i>

56
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,850
And on top of it, nobody has any of
the money that they supposedly stole.

57
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,790
Well, that’s about all I know.

58
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,920
How about you?

59
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,560
The guy that I nabbed said that
he was just following the…

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,040
…instructions from a manual
that he got through mail-order.

61
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,970
Perhaps the other culprits are
reading the same manual that he was?

62
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,340
Manual?

63
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,800
This.

64
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,980
“A new criminal support software.”

65
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,420
“Right now, it’s a real bargain.
For the low introductory…”

66
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,120
“…price of 30000 Woolongs,
you too can be rich!”

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,350
What the hell?

68
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,120
It’s not easy to be a thief nowadays.

69
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,030
I’m sure there are people
who want manuals to help them.

70
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,930
And where is this mail-order company?

71
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,230
It’s a store that’s only on the
’net, so I don’t know where it was.

72
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,170
Besides, the store has already closed.

73
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,300
Spike, how about you?

74
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,070
The hacking unit that was placed
on the Gates was something that…

75
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,670
…couldn’t be made unless you knew
about the Gate system really well.

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,180
The mastermind’s likely someone who has
some connection to the Gate Corporation.

77
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,950
That was my hunch, and
I investigated that front…

78
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,260
The programmers would be fishy.

79
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,460
…but the guys from the Gate Corporation
suddenly became uncooperative.

80
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,460
It was as if they knew something, but
didn’t want us to find out about it.

81
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,010
Are you dead?

82
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,490
Where were we?

83
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,340
Well, I guess those are the
only clues we have for now…

84
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,100
Gimme that.

85
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,540
Gimme.

86
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,010
Yeah.

87
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,710
This is a memory cartridge for
playing chess over the ’net.

88
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,050
This piece has one match in its memory.

89
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,350
And, when you push it,
it connects to the ’net.

90
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,520
See?

91
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,020
And this has something to
do with this incident?

92
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,660
Nothing at all.

93
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,370
Maybe all of this is a game…

94
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,300
For now, continue playing
that game with the opponent.

95
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,030
Yup.

96
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,440
I’ll go talk to the Gate
Corporation guys once more.

97
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,970
Lesse…

98
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,940
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe…

99
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,150
Play ball!

100
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,600
Another bounty hunter?
I don’t care, send him back.

101
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,630
But he’s asking about
a chess-loving programmer…

102
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,650
What?!

103
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,640
Jet!

104
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,110
What, Jonathan, were
you another one that…

105
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,060
…went through all the
trouble to get nothing?

106
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,060
This thing isn’t that easy.

107
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,470
I believe we have given
out all the information.

108
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,270
What more are you saying
you would like to know?

109
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,140
Sorry, but there is no smoking
allowed in this building.

110
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,240
Oops. I’m so sorry…

111
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,240
Actually I had something
that I wanted you to see…

112
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,750
What is it?

113
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,260
This is a planned game.

114
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,660
You guys at the Gate Corporation
should know what this means.

115
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,230
I mean, to put a bounty on a mastermind
that we aren’t even sure exists…

116
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,970
…suggests that it’s someone you don’t
want the police to know about, no?

117
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,850
Bounty-hunters should just
look for their bounties.

118
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,180
I don’t know who you are, and
whether or not you used to work for…

119
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,520
…the ISSP, but it’s better for
you to not make any extra inquiries.

120
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,450
He’s going home.

121
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,960
Make sure he is kindly
escorted out of here.

122
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,660
Damn this old piece of shit!

123
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,100
<i>I believe our risk is too great.</i>

124
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,670
<i>If that gets out to</i>
<i>the general public…</i>

125
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,040
<i>I am fully aware of our risk.</i>

126
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,170
<i>If we don’t catch him,</i>
<i>the situation will just get worse.</i>

127
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,880
<i>But why is a ghost from</i>
<i>50 years ago coming back now…?</i>

128
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,940
<i>To think that he gave</i>
<i>everyone a chess piece…</i>

129
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,820
<i>Chessmaster Hex…</i>

130
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,020
<i>So it is a game that he set up…</i>

131
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,720
Chessmaster Hex…

132
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,550
No good. This doesn’t have anything
other than chess data in it.

133
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,040
I wonder what they were going
to do with such a thing…

134
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,020
If there is no meaning to the content,
maybe the pieces are the message…

135
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,090
Great, great!

136
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,570
<i>Spike, I have a name…</i>
<i>Can you investigate the guy?</i>

137
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,870
<i>He might be the mastermind</i>
<i>behind this whole thing.</i>

138
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,670
Hey, Ed.

139
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,110
Ed’s really busy right now.

140
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,190
Here, here!

141
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,880
Checkmate!

142
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,160
…or so you thought!

143
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,600
I’ll fork the king and the rook!

144
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,800
Indeed! This is either
an idiot or a genius!

145
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,830
I like this chap!

146
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,080
Chessmaster Hex. Estimated
to be 98 years old.

147
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,820
A programmer that had been
dubbed a genius from his teens.

148
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,260
In the Cosmo-net chess tournaments, he
dominated the champion’s seat for decades.

149
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,460
He began work on the Hyperspace Gate
control program when he was 30…

150
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,940
…and created the central control
system that all Gates use to this day.

151
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,270
However, that was his fatal error.

152
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,800
He started to doubt the safety
of the Gates he helped create…

153
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,010
…and was against putting
them to practical use.

154
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,410
As a result, he was banned
from the Gate Corporation.

155
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,040
Ever since, his whereabouts
have been unknown for 50 years…

156
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,880
So he’s the mastermind behind
our current string of crimes…

157
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,180
What do you mean?

158
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,550
I mean, why is he seeking revenge
50 years after the fact?

159
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,360
If we figure out where he is,
we’ll know for sure.

160
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,190
Hey, Ed.

161
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,060
Ed’s really busy right now.

162
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,290
Hey, you, quit playing games
so much and help out a little…

163
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,770
Ed, we want to figure out
where a guy named Hex is…

164
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,240
Hex… Hex… The Chessmaster?!

165
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,750
That’s who I’m playing
chess against right now!

166
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,150
We’re almost at the location we got from
the trace we did on Ed’s chess opponent.

167
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,320
You guys standing by?

168
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,330
I really don’t like this.

169
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,170
I mean, he’s basically giving
us his exact location…

170
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,900
Can we even trust that
trace in the first place?

171
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,170
—Ya think he’d be in a dump like this?
—No, I think it was… that.

172
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,240
<i>I had heard once that there was a place</i>
<i>where all the scrapped remains of…</i>

173
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,720
<i>…obsolete Gates were gathered along with</i>
<i>scrap metal and abandoned spaceships…</i>

174
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,190
<i>…and that there were people</i>
<i>that started living there.</i>

175
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,390
<i>Why the hell do they want</i>
<i>to live here of all places?</i>

176
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,330
<i>That area has no nationality,</i>
<i>nor a government.</i>

177
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,100
<i>You don’t have to pay taxes,</i>
<i>and there are no cops.</i>

178
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,130
<i>I see… It’s the perfect</i>
<i>place to hide yourself.</i>

179
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,050
<i>It might be a trap…</i>

180
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,250
<i>This might be the</i>
<i>continuation of the game.</i>

181
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,250
Whatever happens, happens.

182
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,440
Looks like we have air.

183
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,040
<i>Then there is someone here…</i>

184
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,980
<i>Yo, Jet.</i>

185
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,140
Jonathan!

186
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,780
How the hell did you get here?

187
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,020
<i>Thanks for leading the way</i>

188
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,490
You… were following
us the whole time?

189
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,960
<i>Tough luck for you, but I have</i>
<i>important business with that guy,</i>

190
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>So I’ll be going ahead.</i>

191
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,100
What the?

192
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,610
What?

193
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,260
How the hell?

194
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,930
What is this?

195
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,700
What is this?

196
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,920
Hi!

197
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,890
Peace to the world…

198
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,990
…and love to my bank account!

199
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,890
You want one?

200
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,170
Wow! Amazing!

201
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,370
Chessmaster Hex?

202
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,390
All right, give up!

203
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,690
You guys…

204
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,120
Can you be a little quieter?

205
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,130
Old man!

206
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,090
Don’t joke with me!

207
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,360
Hey, wait a minute.

208
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,770
You won’t get away with
pretending to be senile!

209
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,570
Who are you?

210
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,570
If you don’t hand over
the money you stole…

211
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,240
…you’ll get a nice
hole in your brain!

212
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,040
That’s a big tube you got there…

213
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,380
Hey, whatcha doin’, Hex?

214
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,110
You gotta hear this. It’s my first
formidable opponent in quite a while!

215
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,490
Must be some player if
you have trouble winning!

216
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,750
But before that, where’s lunch?

217
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,320
What are ya saying?
You just ate lunch a while back!

218
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,730
Oh, is that so?

219
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,560
—Really, you’ve lost so much of yer mind…
—Who are these guys?

220
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,730
—…that all you can do is play chess!
—Dunno. But you know, this old fogey…

221
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,500
—Have ya lost it?
—Like you can speak… You…

222
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,140
To… To think my life savings
are never coming back…

223
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,400
Damn… Goddammit…

224
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,470
Anyone and everyone, you and
that guy over there…

225
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,140
The world is all a mistake!

226
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,800
What are we gonna do?
This old man doesn’t seem to…

227
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,500
…remember anything about
yesterday, let alone 50 years ago!

228
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,030
That’s right.

229
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,800
Hex is no longer here.

230
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,770
Here we merely have an
old man that loves games…

231
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,140
Back then, Hex was riled up for
revenge, and planned this all out.

232
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,120
He made it so that this incident
would happen 50 years later…

233
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,790
…during the one moment that the Gate
program gets automatically updated.

234
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,390
Even making those that
physically commit the crime…

235
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,730
…hold chess pieces to hint
that it was his doing.

236
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,770
However, to that old-timer,
50 years was too long.

237
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,900
He went senile,
and had completely forgotten…

238
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,110
…about the traps that
he himself had set.

239
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,610
Well, it works out better
for you this way.

240
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,550
Because now you don’t
have to worry about…

241
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,210
…the fundamental defect
in the Gates leaking out.

242
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,620
Although, the price you paid was
that we learned about that defect.

243
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,350
What do you want? Money?

244
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,330
Or… are you planning to leak
this information to the press?

245
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,370
Just leave that old guy alone.

246
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,930
That’s all I want.

247
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,680
It’s a good deal, isn’t it?

248
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,850
Ed would get lonely if she
lost her chess partner…

249
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,220
You’re playing that thing again?

250
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,890
Not again. Still.

251
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,830
Still?

252
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,800
You’ve been playing that
thing this whole week?!

253
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,270
Yeah.

254
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,790
I see.

255
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,570
Well, good luck.

256
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,700
Yo, newcomer. You seem happy today.

257
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,840
Hi!

258
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,210
He’s a really easygoing
fellow, isn’t he?

259
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,810
That he is…

260
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,310
Checkmate.

261
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,490
I lost…

262
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,690
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

263
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:58,030
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

264
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,730
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

265
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:10,470
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

266
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:19,720
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

267
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,730
The real folk blues.

268
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:33,140
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

269
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:40,770
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

270
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,270
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

271
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:54,190
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

272
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,170
COMING EPISODE

273
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,240
Love… It is to believe everything.

274
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,510
Hey now, are you serious?

275
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,670
Love… It is the heart
that provides for all.

276
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,440
Come on… was that what
the story was about?

277
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,710
Love… It is the heart
that accepts everything.

278
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,120
You know, this is getting fishy.

279
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,920
Whitney… You loved me that much…

280
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,390
You really can’t trust
the previews on this show.

281
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,220
A romantic love story
for all you lovers.

282
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,790
Next episode: “My Funny Valentine.”

283
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,560
I’m sure it’s a lie.

284
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,160
Yeah, a lie. A lie.

285
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,400
MY FUNNY VALENTINE
Yeah, a lie. A lie.

286
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,160
MY FUNNY VALENTINE
