1
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,600
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

2
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,910
Those who don’t work, don’t eat.

3
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,640
Go find your own food.

4
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,950
Me? I’m okay.

5
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,150
Women are grand by birth.

6
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,090
3 million…

7
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,760
Well, I’ll have the
guys earn it for me.

8
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,630
Damn, blues harp music is good.
It’s just as good as I thought.

9
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,100
I thought you were a fan of jazz music?

10
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,930
Don’t be stupid.

11
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,510
I even warbled when I was
sucking on my mother’s milk!

12
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,580
You were a pretty thoughtful kid…

13
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,380
No mistake, that’s Giraffe.

14
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,020
All right, I’m going from the right.

15
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,930
You go from the left.

16
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,260
There’s a fatso in the way…

17
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,230
That’s… Fatty.

18
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,640
The ball’s in your court.

19
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,970
Hey, Fatty!

20
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,980
Fatty River! Long time no see!

21
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,640
Oh! Who’d have thought, it’s Jet Black!

22
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,980
When the hell did you get here?

23
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,710
How about you? You look so easygoing!

24
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,920
Did ya catch a big one?

25
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,490
I didn’t know you were
a fan of blues music.

26
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,290
You’re kidding me.

27
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,820
I’ve lived only for the blues
since I was in my dad’s sack!

28
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,400
Give him back!

29
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,240
Zebra!

30
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,920
Hey you! Don’t die!

31
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,110
Hey!

32
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,590
Shit, are you going to
wipe out my bounty?

33
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,960
D-Don’t be fooled by his appearance…

34
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,930
You idiot! Don’t speak!

35
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,260
…him… Help…

36
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,630
…him…

37
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,610
This stone…

38
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,370
Hey!

39
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,640
I can’t say for sure
until I analyze it…

40
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,410
…but it might be worth a hefty sum…

41
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,310
So, what are ya gonna do?

42
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,080
Like I know?

43
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,210
He’s the one who gave it to me and
he’s the one who went off and died.

44
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,880
I see no harm in keeping it.

45
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,890
There is no harm.

46
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,050
After all, it’s not your
duty to help the kid.

47
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,530
This is gonna pay for our food.
There’s none for you.

48
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,590
You have such a poor heart…

49
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,100
I’m not like that.

50
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,500
Here, have a gift.

51
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh, what’s this?

52
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,680
An invoice? What for?

53
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,080
All the expenses that you’ve
racked up on our ship.

54
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,910
Thanks for your business!

55
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,010
You’re welcome.

56
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,020
So why are you asking
about the dead bounty?

57
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,720
Well… uh…

58
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,990
So you were after Giraffe, too.

59
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,590
Ya got a good deal?

60
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,330
Go ahead, eat.

61
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,910
Ah well.
There’s no bounty in it anyway.

62
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,810
Yeah. No gain at all.

63
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,940
No, no. There really is nothing.

64
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,140
Ah well. You’ll owe me one for today.

65
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,610
You know that kid on the
blues harp the other day?

66
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,560
Giraffe was after
that kid Wen’s father.

67
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,220
His old acquaintance, Zebra.

68
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,660
Acquaintance?

69
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,630
You didn’t even know that?

70
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,330
That they were the top of the Volunteer
Self Defense Squad until ten years ago?

71
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>But why is he after an old comrade?</i>

72
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,280
<i>Ten years ago, Zebra and Giraffe</i>
<i>attempted to reclaim a certain facility,</i>

73
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,950
<i>But, a few days later,</i>
<i>Zebra ends up missing…</i>

74
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,980
<i>…and Giraffe finds himself blindfolded</i>
<i>in a weird place he’d never seen before.</i>

75
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,730
<i>Giraffe was going after the top spot</i>
<i>in the group, but he was betrayed.</i>

76
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,960
<i>But Zebra was still alive…</i>

77
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,550
So, in the end, Giraffe was
killed by some form of betrayal?

78
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,350
Women easily betray others,
but men live for duty.

79
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,350
Duty, huh?

80
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,320
That’s what I’d like to believe.

81
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,210
Who are you?

82
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,190
Someone suspicious.

83
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,920
What do you want?

84
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,300
Giraffe asked me…

85
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,960
…to help you.

86
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,540
But Zebra shot Giraffe…

87
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,900
Yeah…

88
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,180
Then why did Giraffe tell
him to help the kid?

89
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,910
This kid’s showing up here, too.

90
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,210
He must be pretty famous.

91
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,480
Yeah. The kid’s a genius.

92
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,650
This guy isn’t Zebra!

93
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,020
What?!

94
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,720
Look… the date!

95
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,990
What the?!

96
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,000
Why the hell is this kid in an article
from 30 years ago with the same face?!

97
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,730
Come on. There’s nothing to fear.

98
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,970
Come over here.

99
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,830
Little twerps should stay outta this.

100
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,820
If you stick your neck
in too far, you’ll get burnt.

101
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,810
Don’t give me that
conceited crap, kid.

102
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,760
I ain’t a kid.

103
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,730
All kids say that.

104
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,190
I may look like this, but…

105
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,220
…I’ve been alive since
the days when humans…

106
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,000
…crawled only on
the face of the Earth.

107
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,910
It started on the day of the accidental
explosion of the hyperspace gate.

108
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,270
My body has ceased to age.

109
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,020
I can’t die.

110
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,120
The guys that took interest in me, and
experimented on me, all died before me.

111
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,400
The end for this guy started
when he snuck into the lab.

112
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,160
I needed a “parent” to use as a cover.

113
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,100
<i>D— Don’t be fooled</i>
<i>by his appearance…</i>

114
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,110
<i>…him…</i>

115
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,570
<i>Help…</i>

116
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,040
<i>…him…</i>

117
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,710
I think this was the third guy.

118
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,480
Now, gimme the ring.

119
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,990
Ring? What ring?

120
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,860
That’s fine…

121
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,060
Even if you had it,
it’s a pearl before swine.

122
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,500
Give me a break, you big klutz!

123
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,870
You’re lucky you got
away with this little…

124
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,510
…since we don’t have
the money for a funeral!

125
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,510
Sorry.

126
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,250
Knock it off, Ein!

127
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,760
Shut up.

128
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,990
Oh?

129
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,740
Jet, the alpha-catch.

130
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,080
Shit… this piece of junk…

131
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,680
All right!

132
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,380
Now… what are ya seein’?

133
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,390
The hotel.

134
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,100
He’s remembering the time
that Giraffe died.

135
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,060
<i>Give him back! Zebra!</i>

136
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,590
<i>Come over here!</i>

137
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,860
Shit!

138
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,460
And then what?

139
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,270
What did Giraffe say?!

140
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,640
<i>I have it now.</i>
<i>I can do you in with this.</i>

141
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,270
<i>This is a stone that</i>
<i>will return time to you!</i>

142
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,740
<i>Now, hand Zebra over to me!</i>

143
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,250
<i>Zebra!</i>

144
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,480
When the Gate exploded,
a vast amount of energy and…

145
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,180
…an imaginary coordinate system
were created from the…

146
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,460
…resulting twists in hyperspace and
got enclosed into the gem of this ring.

147
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,200
And that same energy broke
Wen’s circadian rhythm.

148
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,400
His pineal gland continually
produces a substance…

149
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,780
…similar to melatonin
that inhibits aging.

150
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,210
That’s how the theory
goes in a nutshell…

151
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,410
You understand?

152
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,710
Like I do…

153
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,710
I don’t either.

154
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,850
So, in other words,
there’s no way to make sure…

155
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,120
…other than to stick
that gem into Wen.

156
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,150
I don’t know what will happen.

157
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,690
It might explode the
moment you shoot it in…

158
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,200
This makes me excited.

159
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,580
What?

160
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,970
I thought this might be
the last time I’d see you…

161
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,610
…so I thought I’d see you off.

162
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,710
Oh, so you’re finally
going to leave us?

163
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,780
No, you aren’t coming back.

164
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,560
I don’t like it.

165
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,560
I don’t like it one bit.

166
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,280
Men are such idiots…

167
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,760
I see…

168
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,220
I can finally die now…

169
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,190
I feel so heavy…

170
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,000
But… I feel so at ease now…

171
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,170
Do you know?

172
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,640
Do you understand? Do you…

173
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,890
Like I do…

174
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,840
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

175
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,180
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

176
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,880
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

177
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:10,620
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

178
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:19,870
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.
