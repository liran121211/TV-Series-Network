1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,520
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD

2
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,630
And so, the turtle took him to a
place called Ryuuguujou as a reward.

3
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,930
Ryuuguujou?

4
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah. At that palace,
they held a welcome party for him.

5
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,450
Beautiful women,
and scrumptious feasts.

6
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,250
Breams and halibut swam about…

7
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,850
…and so he spent his
time as if in a dream.

8
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,380
I see…

9
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,590
I haven’t eaten breams or
halibut in quite a while…

10
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,660
Days passed before he knew it,
and when he was about to go back…

11
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,730
…he was given the Tamatebako
as a souvenir.

12
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,100
Tamatebako? Is that yummy?

13
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,840
It’s not food.
It’s a chest with treasure inside.

14
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,850
I haven’t seen any treasure
in quite a while either…

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,110
You guys are so tasteless.
This is an old fantasy tale!

16
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,520
The turtle’s Tamatebako…

17
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,990
What were you listening to?

18
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,630
I should quit the horses now.

19
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,260
Pay up 6300 woolongs.

20
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,230
What, where did that come from?

21
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,750
This was for you.

22
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,630
For… me?

23
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,500
C.O.D. even.

24
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,030
To top it off, no return address.

25
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,560
I had no choice but to accept it…

26
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,340
H-Hey! Wait!!

27
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,510
Hey! What about the 6300 woolongs?!

28
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,480
Busy woman.

29
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,390
Could it be a collection agency
from the life extension firm?

30
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,410
Or…

31
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,980
No, could it be…

32
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,050
Oooh… I just have too
many things it could be…

33
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,620
So for now, I’ll just run away!

34
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
Don’t you think it’s fishy?

35
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,660
For a woman who always claims
other people’s property…

36
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,470
…as her own to run away
without even touching it?

37
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,840
She seems to have picked up a lot
of grudges from all over, though.

38
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,980
I should do an explosives test and
a biochemical test just in case…

39
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,880
No!

40
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,080
I should return this to
the courier service…

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,850
…and have them refund
the money I paid for her sake…

42
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,150
Hey, Spike!

43
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,640
What the hell is this?

44
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,140
Does it make any ticking noises?

45
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,470
Nope.

46
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,340
I got data!

47
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,540
Data from the courier service!

48
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,450
The sender is…

49
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,050
A nonprofit nunnery in Europa?!

50
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,210
There’s more…

51
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,220
Pluto Prison?

52
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,350
Asteroid Actors’ Studio?

53
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,560
Fourth Uranus Observatory?

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,090
Venus News Network?

55
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,070
Forwarded, forwarded,
and forwarded some more…

56
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,410
This thing’s been passed
around the entire solar system…

57
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,800
Here.

58
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,280
Due to the explosion of the Lunar Gate,
all data from before 2022 has been lost.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,910
An antique.

60
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,350
It seems to be something
called a videotape.

61
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,980
An artifact of the good old days.

62
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,790
She’s the one that ran away.

63
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,820
She has no right to complain
even if we sell it off.

64
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,460
You think it will sell?

65
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,290
They say he’s a maniac when it
comes to 20th century images…

66
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,430
—I’m sure he’d buy it.
—I just don’t think this is worth anything.

67
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,340
The real worth of treasures like this
can’t be determined from the outside.

68
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,540
You may be surprised at how
much you can sell it for!

69
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,510
I need to get enough to cover
the C.O.D. charges at least.

70
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,780
Excuse me!

71
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,440
<i>So…</i>

72
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,250
Quiet!

73
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,720
<i>Everything about this city is different</i>
<i>from Minnesota, where we were before.</i>

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,920
<i>Hey, brother, are you sure</i>
<i>we can get along well here?</i>

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,630
<i>Mm… To tell the truth,</i>
<i>I wasn’t so sure that we could.</i>

76
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,030
<i>But, I’m sure we’ll be all right.</i>

77
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,400
<i>Because I’m here with my twin sister.</i>

78
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,900
<i>Thanks, brother.</i>

79
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,170
<i>Oh man, I have to work in the morning!</i>

80
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,580
<i>Good night, brother.</i>

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,600
<i>Good night!</i>

82
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,040
God, that’s good! Drama series
from the 20th century are so good!

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,050
On the other hand…
Drama series as of late are so…

84
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,180
I have something you want to watch…

85
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,650
Hey, hey, hey, you can’t do that!!

86
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,420
The cigarette, man, the cigarette!

87
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,720
Don’t you know that smoke can totally
screw up electrical appliances?

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,590
Sheesh, this is why I hate
people who don’t know…

89
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,670
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! Sheesh!

90
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,470
What the hell do you guys want?!

91
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,200
What do you have against me?!

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,070
No grudges, but no gratitude, either.

93
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,100
I just have something we
want you to buy from us.

94
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,740
Ah! Is that a Beta cassette?!

95
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,900
That’s amazing!

96
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,680
Where did you get a hold of this?

97
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,010
This is a true find, mister!

98
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,920
It’s close to a miracle that
this thing exists in one piece!

99
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,880
Beta?

100
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,910
You don’t know what this is?

101
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,020
Oh, all right, do you
want me to explain?

102
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,330
Back in the 20th Century, they didn’t
use disks like we do to record movies.

103
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,290
They used things called video tapes,
which are in cassettes like this.

104
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,300
It’s not digital! It’s analog!

105
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,530
And to top it off,
it’s magnetic… Yeah, magnetic!

106
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,270
They were recording with electromagnetic
signals! Ain’t that amazing?

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,750
But a disagreement between
the companies who created…

108
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,440
…this technology resulted
in two standards, Beta and VHS.

109
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,420
Beta had a small cassette
for their day…

110
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,320
…and the playback decks were
compact and didn’t take much space.

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,190
You didn’t get that much
noise when using the special…

112
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,880
…replay features like
still frame and slow motion.

113
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,660
And, because Beta had
high quality images…

114
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,560
…users who were into good graphics
supported it really heavily.

115
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,800
But, there begins the unfortunate
history of the Beta tape.

116
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,270
You don’t need to tell me.

117
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,660
This is just the introduction!

118
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,870
I told you what we wanted.

119
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,740
So how is it? Are ya gonna buy it?

120
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,180
Well, that depends on what’s on it…

121
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,970
Hey, what’s wrong?

122
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,210
It’s so hard to adjust the tracking
for these early Beta tapes…

123
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,980
This way?

124
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,450
Or this way?

125
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,930
It’s eating the tape!!

126
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,170
It’s not getting any better…

127
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,280
It’s coming…

128
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,650
It is… It is…

129
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,050
I got it!

130
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,090
Dogs are better than horses after all!

131
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,550
Most things get better if I kick ’em.

132
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,330
You just don’t know when to quit.

133
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,770
<i>Dammit, repay me for breaking my deck!</i>

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,340
You again…

135
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,140
<i>You broke someone else’s</i>
<i>valuable machinery…</i>

136
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,080
<i>…and you’re not going</i>
<i>to take responsibility for it?!</i>

137
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,480
And how are you going to take
responsibility for our valuable tape?

138
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,850
<i>Early Beta decks often eat tapes!</i>

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,150
<i>In any case, I’ll have you</i>
<i>pay for the repair costs!</i>

140
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,710
We’ll call it even with
the cost of the tape!

141
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,020
<i>What?! Be…</i>

142
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,920
Sheesh…

143
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,590
Hello, Beta deck!

144
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,520
There’s just one of those.

145
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,470
Where is this?

146
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,440
The Underground City
Electrical Museum in old Asia?

147
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,840
I’m going to figure out what’s
on that tape at any cost!

148
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Is it really something
worth all the trouble?

149
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,650
It’s coming…
It’s… It’s… It’s…

150
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,120
Yeah! I got it!!

151
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,110
Really, I wonder if those guys were
sucking up all my luck all this time.

152
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,680
<i>Ah… Hello.</i>

153
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,020
Hello?

154
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,520
Hey, helllllloooooo…

155
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,010
<i>Ah… it’s… Faye… Yoohoo…</i>

156
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,990
Wait… Hello?

157
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,490
What is this, where are you guys?

158
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,890
<i>Earth…</i>

159
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,320
<i>Earth!</i>

160
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,490
Earth?!

161
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,900
Wait a minute, you guys left me
behind to go that far away…

162
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,870
<i>Spike… and Jet…</i>

163
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,530
All right, just a little longer.

164
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,300
Is there really one left
in a place like this?

165
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,260
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

166
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,070
28th underground floor.

167
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,550
It’s not moving?

168
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,030
The cable broke, so it’s stuck.

169
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,110
Why are we going through all of this?

170
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,740
It just means that
treasure-hunting isn’t easy.

171
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,350
Treasure?

172
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,150
What was the treasure we were after?

173
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,850
The Tamatebako, was it?

174
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,530
I kinda see why the
man turned into an…

175
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,050
…old geezer after
opening the Tamatebako now.

176
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,930
Even if we head back now,
we’re not gonna be any younger.

177
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,270
This is some Ryuuguujou…

178
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,510
Where did that broad go
in the first place?!

179
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,040
It’s coming… It’s, it’s…

180
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,960
Oh well, nothing I could’ve done.

181
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,690
Races are all luck anyway.

182
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,530
Is it here?

183
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,980
It’s here.

184
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,000
All right.

185
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,120
Is this it?

186
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,990
Yeah, that’s gotta be it.

187
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,000
And?

188
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,860
Which one are we taking back?

189
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,000
Let’s see…

190
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,470
Well, bigger is always
better, they say.

191
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,620
What’s wrong?

192
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,990
The size…

193
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,890
Isn’t it all right?

194
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,920
It’s not going in.

195
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,720
Force it in.

196
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,560
But…

197
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,830
Ah! That’s not it!

198
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,430
That’s VHS, so…

199
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,700
…ya can’t see the tape!

200
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,220
Oh, hello, it’s me.

201
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,140
<i>Ein, who are you talking to?</i>

202
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,940
<i>Oh, it’s Faye!</i>

203
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,370
I’m glad there’s an organism
there that I can talk to.

204
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,080
<i>What is it?</i>

205
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,550
Was there anyone who went
there to visit me?

206
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,180
<i>Visitors?</i>

207
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,550
Like scary middle-aged guys.

208
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,220
You know, guys that
scream stuff like…

209
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,190
…“gimme back my money!”
or “You’re under arrest!”?

210
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,590
<i>Yeah there was one.</i>

211
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,250
Eh? And?

212
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,800
<i>Something about repay him, even with</i>
<i>tape munch, munch and grind, bye -bye!</i>

213
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,700
Eh? Okay…

214
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,690
Oh, well.

215
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,470
Where’s Spike and Jet?

216
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,440
<i>Disappointed and zoned out.</i>

217
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,180
I see… Hmm…

218
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,540
That’s how…

219
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,640
Oh, well.

220
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,520
If they’re so lonely without me,
I guess I have no choice.

221
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,820
I’m coming back!

222
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,490
What?!
Another package for that broad?!

223
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,900
I won’t accept it!
Take it and go back!!

224
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,370
Shit, why do I have to
pay for her C.O.D.?!

225
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,350
And not once, but twice!

226
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,610
You sure are persistent.

227
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,630
A Beta!

228
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,250
We can see the tape with this?

229
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,390
Yeah.

230
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,900
Hey guys, long time no see.

231
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,640
It’s done.

232
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,680
Hold up.

233
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
If you’re going to watch…

234
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,390
…pay back the C.O.D. charges.
With tax, a total of 31,500 woolongs.

235
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, fine.

236
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,960
We have something!

237
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,570
Ooooh… what’s this?

238
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,840
Shut up and watch.

239
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,230
<i>Um… Everyone decided to…</i>

240
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,000
<i>…send a message to themselves</i>
<i>ten years in the future.</i>

241
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,570
<i>Oh, come on, don’t laugh!</i>

242
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,240
<i>Um…</i>

243
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,390
<i>This makes me blush after all!</i>

244
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,910
<i>Eh? Something I want to say?</i>

245
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,960
<i>Good morning…</i>

246
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,960
<i>Oh! Nevermind!!</i>

247
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,780
<i>Good morning, me.</i>

248
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,570
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

249
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,780
<i>And did you wake up well?</i>

250
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,720
<i>Does the light and the wind, the air</i>
<i>and the smell, all feel brand new?</i>

251
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,720
<i>Is each and every cell</i>
<i>in your body awake now?</i>

252
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,490
<i>Today, you are who you are today,</i>

253
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,060
<i>You are a newer version of me.</i>

254
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,360
<i>Myself ten years from now…</i>

255
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,810
<i>That’s so far away for me that</i>
<i>I can’t even begin to imagine.</i>

256
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,640
<i>Am I alone?</i>

257
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,840
<i>Or is there a wonderful</i>
<i>person next to me?</i>

258
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,820
<i>Well, knowing me, I’m sure I am</i>
<i>troubling a lot of different people.</i>

259
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,690
<i>But that’s all right.</i>
<i>There’s no problem.</i>

260
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,460
<i>I will always be cheering you on.</i>

261
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,760
<i>And now for a big cheer…</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

262
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,540
<i>Go! Go!</i>

263
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,510
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

264
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,600
<i>Do your best, do your best!</i>
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

265
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,480
<i>Don’t lose, don’t lose!</i>
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

266
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,450
<i>I don’t know…</i>

267
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,950
<i>I can’t remember…</i>

268
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,460
<i>Is this… me?</i>

269
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,960
<i>I am no longer here.</i>

270
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,530
<i>But I’m here today, and I’ll always</i>
<i>be cheering for you right here.</i>

271
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,310
<i>Cheering for you, my only self.</i>

272
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,790
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

273
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,130
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta

274
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,830
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

275
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:10,570
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

276
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:19,820
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

277
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,830
The real folk blues.

278
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:33,240
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

279
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:40,870

282
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,170
COMING EPISODE

283
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,950
You know, I’m starting to get tired of
us doing all the previews like this.

284
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,210
Once in a while, can’t we
have someone else…

285
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,720
Oh? Oh! You’re perfect. All right!

286
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,250
Here, you try doing it this time.

287
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,330
Oh! So, that’s how it is!

288
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,860
Wow, this is going to be
an interesting episode!

289
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,730
Next Episode: “Wild Horses”.

290
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,200
