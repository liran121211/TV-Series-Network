1
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,350
Confirmed.

2
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,200
To our new relationship,
and our new friendship.

3
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,000
And, to prosperity.

4
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,200
The view from here makes me
sad that I must leave so soon.

5
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,870
It’s an amazing sight.

6
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,080
Next time, we should
have dinner together.

7
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,020
The Cantonese cuisine that
our head chef makes…

8
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,080
…is just about as superb
as this scenery.

9
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
That’s a wonderful
invitation, however…

10
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,720
To think that the day that I’d dine
with an executive from the Red Dragon…

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,960
Rest assured,
the food will not be poisoned.

12
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,380
I can finally take a breather.

13
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,810
Thank God.

14
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,860
Doing things like this
won’t do you any good!

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,940
Times have changed!

16
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,270
The syndicate cannot survive
just by fighting alone!

17
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,280
O-Only if…

18
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,640
…S-Spike returned…

19
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,850
…someone like you would…

20
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:22,598
BALLAD OF FALLEN ANGELS

21
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,820
I don’t feel up for this.

22
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,490
Wha?

23
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,440
I said, I don’t feel like doing this.

24
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,000
Then there’s no choice.

25
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,800
Wait, Spike.

26
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,780
I can’t burden you.

27
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,870
Don’t say stuff like that.

28
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,010
You know who that is, don’t you?

29
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,310
Superficial stuff, yeah.

30
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,370
Then…

31
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,450
Good money.
Easy to get info on him.

32
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,280
We also have a lead.

33
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,650
What makes you scared?

34
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,060
Spike, you’re deliberately
avoiding the subject.

35
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,030
Are you hiding something from me?

36
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,130
So… what happened
to that arm of yours?

37
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,940
What does that have
to do with anything?

38
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,100
Nothing.

39
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,630
So, you have no intention of telling me?

40
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,270
I could ask you the same.

41
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,680
Why is this door so damn narrow?

42
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,280
Oh? Am I interrupting something?

43
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,690
None of your business.

44
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,050
We’re supposed to be comrades!
That’s awfully cold of you!

45
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,750
What do you mean, comrades?

46
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,730
Troublemakers should keep
themselves outta this.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,090
Well, I don’t care.

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,230
So, who is this? What’s he up to?

49
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,700
Don’t look without asking us.

50
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,940
What do you mean?
He’s just there on the screen!

51
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,300
Spike!

52
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,210
Hey, wait, Spike!

53
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,510
I’m taking off.

54
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,580
<i>Spike!</i>

55
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,860
<i>Shit, I won’t be responsible for you!</i>

56
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,480
Roger that.

57
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,130
Dammit! He’s such a…

58
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Mao Yenrai.

59
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,010
A bounty of 28 million
for the alleged murder…

60
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,310
…of an executive from
an opposing syndicate.

61
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,880
Amazing! And you guys are after him?

62
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,110
What, did you have a fight?

63
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,380
Shut up. You’re being obnoxious.

64
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,090
—You’re such a kid.
—I said, you’re being obnoxious!

65
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,530
He can do whatever the hell he pleases.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,830
Oh, God…
He’s throwing such a huge fit.

67
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,300
<i>You there, Jet?</i>
<i>I got something big for ya!</i>

68
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,230
Something big?

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,480
Excuse me, madam,
but I need to see your ticket.

70
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,860
Oh, I don’t have anything like that.

71
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,300
Well, then, I am afraid that
you cannot enter the hall…

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,860
But, they told me I didn’t need one.

73
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,570
You know. The guy in the box seat…

74
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,940
Him.

75
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,800
Mao Yenr…

76
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,050
Can you park my vehicle for me?

77
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,910
If it’s not one, it’s the other…

78
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,210
Why do they all do
everything as they please?!

79
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,680
There’s a protective
encryption on this thing.

80
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,530
You worried?

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,860
Just watch.
These are decrypted like this…

82
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,830
See? And then, I input “Mao Yenrai”…

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,440
The bounty part sure
seems to be true, but…

84
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,880
Is this Sir Mao’s seat?

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,450
I looked all over for it.
Actually, I…

86
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,420
We were waiting for you.

87
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
U-Um…

88
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,370
They are performing,
so please stay quiet.

89
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,810
Hold it right there!

90
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,460
I’m not letting you get away!

91
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,530
Whatcha doin’?!

92
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,170
Give it back!

93
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,730
Shit. Give it back, you dumbass!

94
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,910
Really, kids these days!

95
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,040
I’ll hand you over to the cops!

96
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,710
Y-You!

97
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,012
Yo.

98
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,920
Hey, isn’t it bad for you to
drink it in one shot, Annie?

99
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,660
You coming back to life
is worse on me than this glass.

100
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,230
What terrible treatment!

101
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,500
The words of the dead are meaningless.

102
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,300
But I’m alive.

103
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,740
No, you died three years ago!
That’s how things work here.

104
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,450
I know.

105
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,220
The fact that you came here… means you
have something you want to know, right?

106
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,320
If it’s not much, I can be of help.

107
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,290
Anastasia…

108
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,570
Stop it! There are only two people
that can call me by that name…

109
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,830
So, what do you want to know?

110
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,540
Mao Yenrai.

111
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,510
What happened to him?

112
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,360
Mao-taijin?
There’s a reason for this…

113
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,960
No need to talk, Miss Valentine.

114
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,800
We have done a background
check already.

115
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,860
Rest assured, it will be
held in a safe location.

116
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,470
Please, to your seat.

117
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,664
You’re trembling…

118
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,660
Who… are you?

119
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,530
Vicious.

120
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,960
You know…

121
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,860
I won’t say anything bad to ya.

122
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,670
Don’t get yourself involved
with Vicious anymore.

123
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,100
But I know saying that is useless.

124
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,110
Sorry.

125
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,580
You’ve never listened
to what others say.

126
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,080
On top of it,
you’re a stubborn showoff!

127
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,250
It can’t hurt you to listen to
your elders once in a while…

128
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,050
About Mao…

129
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,860
He had a lot of people looking
for you after you were gone.

130
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,420
He said that you still
had to be alive…

131
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,770
You’re finally back, but Mao is…

132
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,030
Stop it already.

133
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,270
This is for Mao!

134
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,150
I’ll take that one for Mao.

135
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,840
What are you up to now…
to need something like that?

136
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,130
Where’s the broad?

137
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,580
She lost sanity looking at
the bounty figure and took off.

138
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,910
Right now she’s probably
somewhere, screwing up.

139
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,880
I see.

140
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,952
I’ll tell you something.
You won’t get the bounty for Mao.

141
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,940
He’s already dead.
He was killed.

142
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,320
Internal discord.
Do you understand?

143
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,420
This is a trap! I’m sure of it!

144
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,505
Yeah. I know all that.

145
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,790
You know?!

146
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,370
Then what, you’re Mao’s?

147
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,387
I owe him one from before…

148
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,300
I’ll tell you something, Spike.

149
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,780
This arm. It’s the price I paid
for being over-spirited…

150
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,780
…and running ahead of the game.
You understand?

151
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,650
I don’t wanna go, either.

152
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,570
Then…

153
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,790
Let’s just say,
duties of the life I live.

154
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,090
<i>Tee hee. I’ve been caught.</i>

155
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,530
You…

156
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,970
<i>Come to the place we specify,</i>

157
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,900
<i>Otherwise, my life is over.</i>
<i>So they say,</i>

158
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,640
<i>Lesse… the time to meet is…</i>

159
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,510
It’s because you did as you please.

160
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,380
<i>You’re being cold.</i>
<i>We’re comrades, remember?</i>

161
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,210
You reap what you sow.
Take care of it all yourself.

162
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,100
<i>Hey, wait!</i>

163
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,550
Where is it?

164
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,980
<i>You’re really gonna come?</i>

165
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,060
Don’t worry.
I’m not going there to save you.

166
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,150
Spike!

167
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,240
Angels that are forced from
heaven have to become demons.

168
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,570
Isn’t that right, Spike?

169
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,290
I’m only watching a dream
that I never awakened from.

170
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,750
I’ll wake you up right now.

171
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,730
Don’t be so anxious, Vicious.

172
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,890
It’s our first meeting
in a while, right?

173
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,450
A plea for your life?

174
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
Hardly.

175
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,240
Something like that doesn’t
work on you, remember?

176
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,230
After all, you even kill
those who’ve saved your life.

177
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,740
He was a beast who lost his fangs.
That’s why he’s dead.

178
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,240
The same goes for you.

179
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,290
Now, we want you to drop your gun.

180
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,260
What’s wrong? If you don’t hurry…

181
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,980
Are ya tryin’ to kill me?

182
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,920
Oh man, what the hell’ve I done…

183
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,550
Yeah?

184
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,560
<i>Thank God! Jet? Spike is…</i>

185
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,390
Not my problem!

186
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,660
God dammit!

187
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,230
Spike.

188
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,390
Do you know what your face
looks like right now?

189
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,360
What?

190
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,440
The same blood runs in you and me.

191
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,540
The blood of a beast who wanders,
desiring the blood of others.

192
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,380
I’ve bled all of that blood away.

193
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,880
Then why are you still alive?!

194
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,360
Just like that…

195
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,360
…sing for me.

196
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,280
Oh, you’re finally up.

197
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,220
You’ve slept too much.
It’s been three days.

198
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,760
What? I was worried about you.
You have to be thankful to me!

199
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,510
Tone-deaf.

200
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,820
Oh, well…

201
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,210
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

202
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,550
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

203
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,250
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

204
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:31,990
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

205
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:41,240
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

206
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,250
The real folk blues.

207
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:54,660
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

208
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:02,290
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

209
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,790
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

210
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:15,710
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

211
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,724
COMING EPISODE

212
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,470
But you know what? What a tough
world we live in nowadays…

213
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,600
What are you talking about?

214
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,370
This guy, that guy… They’re all trying
to put a lid on something that stinks.

215
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

216
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,070
Can we let things go on like that?

217
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,817
I’m asking you,
what are you talking about?

218
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,653
World affairs, man! World affairs!

219
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,906
With all these lids about,
the world’ll be buried in lids!

220
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,180
I don’t really get it…

221
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,380
With stuff like that,
you can’t see the truth!

222
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,950
Truth, huh?

223
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,050
So lids like that…
I’ll crush them all away!

00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,707
