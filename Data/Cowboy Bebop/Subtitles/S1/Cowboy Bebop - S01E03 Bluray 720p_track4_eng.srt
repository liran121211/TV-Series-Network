1
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,670
Such pretty eyes.

2
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,000
You’ve pretty eyes
and a smile to match.

3
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,540
Lookin’ to score riches?

4
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
I welcome all.

5
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,420
Ya know the first rule in combat?

6
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,730
…to get the first attack.

7
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,230
What an extended greeting this is.

8
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,250
HONKY TONK WOMEN

9
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,250
I didn’t know that the
sure-shot and master of poker…

10
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,290
…the legendary female gambler
Poker Alice was still alive.

11
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,660
If she was still alive,
she’d be 219 years old now.

12
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,140
Of course.
You sure don’t look over 200.

13
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,270
Besides, Alice never
lost during her lifetime.

14
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,010
She kept winning, without cheating.

15
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,110
You have a way to prove that?

16
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,220
I hear you are carrying a large debt.

17
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,300
Which do you prefer…
the police, or my establishment?

18
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,220
A prophecy?

19
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,490
Charlie said,
“Only hands can wash hands.”

20
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,360
“If you want to receive,
you must first give.”

21
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,430
Hey, doesn’t that mean that Charlie
is telling us to just do it?

22
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,470
Right?

23
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,670
Do you think Charlie Parker
would quote Goethe?

24
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,510
Oh come on, it’s all part
of the dream I had.

25
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,670
The way things go,
I say that even the hard-earned…

26
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,980
…5000 woolongs will
disappear with your dream.

27
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,980
Let me tell you something, Spike…

28
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,010
This is a no smoking area.

29
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,780
You shouldn’t play.
Your eyes are too good for this.

30
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,650
They’ll kick us out
if you win too much.

31
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,650
Then don’t bring me here.

32
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,540
Pray, man.

33
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,420
I’ll take one.

34
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,940
Small jack.

35
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,940
I’ll play a few.

36
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,920
<i>Must be him.</i>

37
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,820
Nice, Jackie.

38
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,640
The target will sit at a blackjack
table, and lose at a certain point.

39
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,610
Of course, you will help him with that.

40
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:27,880
And, he will hand you the last
chip he has as a dealer’s chip.

41
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,950
And what about it?

42
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,160
It’s something that’ll
make your debt…

43
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
…as small as one tiny
second in this universe.

44
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,410
Last game.

45
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,380
I’m not lucky, nor am I nimble.

46
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,450
Then what are you?

47
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,790
Generous.

48
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,460
Blackjack.

49
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Ya got me. I give up.

50
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,640
—I’ll take this as a memento.
—Huh?

51
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,540
Wait a minute!

52
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,910
Hold up!

53
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,740
Hey, you!

54
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,350
What part of you is generous?

55
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,520
This wasn’t the plan I heard!

56
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,320
I thought you were supposed
to give me the last chip!

57
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,850
Why should I?

58
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,090
I played along with you
and your cheats!

59
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,370
Did ya hear that!?

60
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Cheating!

61
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,500
That for real?

62
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,530
The dealer has been cheating!

63
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Can you come with me to the office?

64
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
Why?

65
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,760
What do you want?

66
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,360
You piece of!

67
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,210
Come on…

68
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,710
Does this casino also
run a fitness club?

69
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,550
It’s showtime!

70
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,040
Heh heh. Pardon me here.

71
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,450
Spike…

72
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,790
All right.

73
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,630
Jet.

74
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,330
That’s why I told you not to…

75
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,960
That’s not it!
But we gotta split!

76
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,770
I haven’t cashed these in yet!

77
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,670
Hey!

78
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,270
He doesn’t have it. The chip is a fake.

79
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,110
Neither you nor your boss realize
why we cooked up this whole thing…

80
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,280
If that chip falls into police hands…

81
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,750
It’s all over!

82
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,420
Boss, we still can’t find that broad.

83
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,050
Find her!

84
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,460
Put a reward on her if you have to!

85
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,780
Wait a sec!

86
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,780
Why is my reward
for bringing ya back…

87
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,650
…being trapped in here?!

88
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,290
I see. She smells like
money to you too, huh?

89
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
You have GOT to be kidding!

90
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,160
Jet, how much did you have?

91
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
Oh, 200K. Easy.

92
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,340
And who put it all to naught?

93
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,800
What, only 200K?

94
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,900
That’s nothing compared to my debt…

95
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,110
Besides, don’t you think this is
a bit much for a false accusation?

96
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,450
Well, that mono-carrier
should sell for about 400K.

97
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,390
If you had just given me that chip,
we wouldn’t have had a problem.

98
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,250
Chip?

99
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,590
Yeah!

100
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,690
Disgusting.

101
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,890
If you give that to Gordon,
he’ll give you as much as you want.

102
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,030
Yeah, let’s do that!

103
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,700
I don’t know any guy named Gordon…

104
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,570
…nor do I want to
believe your stories.

105
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,870
Wait a minute!

106
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,380
Let’s go, Ein.

107
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,240
Are you listening to me? Come on!

108
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,820
It’s a chip.

109
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,020
Of course it’s a chip.

110
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,050
I don’t mean that kind of chip.
There’s a microchip in this thing.

111
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,940
<i>Amigo! Leave it to us</i>
<i>for bounty information!</i>

112
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,240
<i>Thanks for waiting!</i>
<i>It’s time for Big Shot!</i>

113
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,760
This is…

114
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,090
<i>So, first up this week is…?</i>
This is…

115
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,520
<i>So, first up this week is…?</i>

116
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,130
<i>It’s a shame we have to hand her to</i>
<i>the police. She doesn’t look it, but…</i>

117
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,860
<i>…she’s a real mean one. Faye Valentine.</i>
Hey, Spike!

118
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,120
<i>…she’s a real mean one. Faye Valentine.</i>

119
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,700
<i>The bounty is a whopping</i>
<i>6 million! A real deal!</i>

120
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,530
<i>First come, first served.</i>
Hey, Jet!

121
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,560
<i>Good luck, cowboys!</i>

122
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,100
I’ve been waiting for you.

123
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,580
<i>First off, let me tell you</i>
<i>that I didn’t intend to run.</i>

124
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,880
I trust you. Where are you?

125
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,410
<i>An old fishing ship in the gate.</i>

126
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,510
<i>They have the chip.</i>

127
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,710
<i>So hurry up and…</i>

128
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,290
What?

129
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,360
Well, we thought we
were being immature.

130
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,800
To leave a young woman
in a place like this.

131
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,970
You aren’t thinking
weird thoughts, are you?

132
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,910
No, we thought we’d escort you to a
place more considerate of your situation.

133
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,740
Oh, and where would that be?

134
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,580
The police.

135
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,310
We’re sorry that we were so cheap
earlier with the 200K bit…

136
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,250
…Faye Valentine.

137
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,410
What, there’s a bounty on me?

138
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,790
A whopping 6 million.

139
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,320
What… only 6 million?

140
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,290
How much ARE you in debt?

141
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,870
Come on, please!
Anywhere but the police!

142
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,130
Only the police would give us money.

143
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,500
My mother’s last will was for me to
not be in any place for too long!

144
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,340
Yeah, yeah…

145
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,310
My family have always been “Romanies,”
wandering about in search of love.

146
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,440
You don’t know anything, do you?
That’s another term for Gypsies!

147
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,850
Everyone else, like you guys, with no
pride in their lives are called “Gorgio.”

148
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,880
I’m fine with being a “Gorgio.”

149
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,390
It’s calling me…
The great outdoors is calling out to me…

150
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,200
You can do all of this with the cops.

151
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,560
Let’s go, Jet.

152
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, fine. I won’t run.
At least untie one hand!

153
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,800
I can’t even go to
the bathroom like this!

154
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,760
Man, we got one yappy woman here…

155
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,540
Like taking candy from a baby.

156
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,820
More like a small sacrifice
for a large reward.

157
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,880
As Charlie said, “If you want
to receive, you must first give.”

158
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I guess what I see in dreams is
worth something once in a while…

159
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,620
Ow…

160
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,130
What do you think you’re doing?

161
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,770
<i>I don’t know who you are…</i>

162
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,900
<i>…but I would like the chip back.</i>

163
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,500
<i>I don’t know who you are…</i>

164
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,100
<i>…but I refuse.</i>

165
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,240
It’s just a chip that
means nothing to you.

166
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,120
<i>Although we can sell what’s</i>
<i>IN the chip for a pretty penny,</i>

167
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,450
There was a decryption program
called Crypt-Breaker…

168
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,430
…that was developed by
SIT three years ago.

169
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,470
Rumors say that right after its
completion, the programmer was killed,

170
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,090
and the program
went into the black market.

171
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:16,410
<i>It’s a “magic key” that can decode and</i>
<i>unlock almost every protection code.</i>

172
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,040
<i>But that program itself was encoded.</i>

173
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,040
So, there was a need to find
the key to open the program.

174
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,390
I heard rumors that both the cops and the
ISSP were parting hairs to find the key…

175
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,360
I never thought I would see
it in a place like this.

176
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,600
You’re pretty good.

177
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,260
I used to work in a shady
place called the ISSP.

178
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,760
<i>I’m sure the casino was to</i>
<i>take attention away from…</i>

179
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,860
<i>…the large sum of money,</i>
<i>and to fool the cops…</i>

180
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,670
<i>You just chose the wrong day,</i>

181
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,270
<i>Of course, this thing is</i>
<i>useless for us as well.</i>

182
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,710
<i>It would only be proper</i>
<i>to give it to the cops.</i>

183
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,840
I’ll pay.

184
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,120
<i>300 million… Nah, too much.</i>
<i>How about 30 million?</i>

185
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,650
<i>Not bad for the price</i>
<i>of a magic key, eh?</i>

186
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,020
All right…

187
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,040
<i>Okay, 6 million turns into 30 million.</i>

188
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,780
The money just keeps growing…

189
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,450
<i>Don’t get caught off-guard.</i>

190
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,620
Okey dokey.

191
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,900
Someone who specifies cash
up front is rare nowadays.

192
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,670
I’m an old-fashioned guy.

193
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,010
<i>All right.</i>

194
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,820
We’ll both count to three.

195
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,750
At which point, we will release the
magnetic field of the suitcase…

196
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,920
<i>…and send it that way,</i>

197
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,480
<i>You toss the chip our way,</i>

198
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,360
Okay.

199
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,850
I’m trusting you…

200
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,540
When you confirm that we got
the chip, sink that ship.

201
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,040
Roger.

202
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,000
Let’s go!

203
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,740
One.

204
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,010
Two.

205
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,940
Three.

206
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,960
Shutters are meant to be opened!

207
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,200
What!?

208
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,690
Hi, “Gorgio.”

209
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,390
Hey, “Romani.”

210
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,520
Bye!

211
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,120
Don’t let her get away! Fire!

212
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,100
Shit!

213
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,140
Jet, let’s get outta here!

214
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,870
All right!

215
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,880
Get them! Get them!
What the hell are you doing!?

216
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,530
She dropped chaff!

217
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,270
What?

218
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,670
Missiles are approaching!

219
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,430
That wench…

220
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,540
It’s only proper to use it.

221
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,510
Guess we have to build up
again from square one.

222
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,280
That’s cheating!

223
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,550
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

224
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:59,890
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

225
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,590
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

226
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:12,330
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

227
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:21,580
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

228
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,590
The real folk blues.

229
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:35,000
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

230
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:42,630
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

231
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,130
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

232
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:56,050
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

233
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,050
COMING EPISODE

234
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,620
It sucks… this world is
such an unruly place.

235
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,270
Economic recession everywhere,
making kids lose their minds…

236
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,270
Come on, this isn’t the time
to be reading the paper!

237
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,630
Things aboard the Bebop are
becoming even more unruly!

238
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,500
Bah, this is nothing!

239
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,840
Look at this… terrorists!

240
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,930
Apparently they want
to blow Ganymede up.

241
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,470
Oh? Environmental Protection Society?

242
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,610
Perfect! We can have them
take care of this fleabag.

243
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,030
Next episode: Gateway Shuffle.

244
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,810
GATEWAY SHUFFLE
Next episode: Gateway Shuffle.

245
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:38,880
GATEWAY SHUFFLE

246
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,040
Man, I’m about to lose it.
GATEWAY SHUFFLE

247
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,150
