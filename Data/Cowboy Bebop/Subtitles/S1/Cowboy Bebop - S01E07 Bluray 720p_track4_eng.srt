1
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,840
HEAVY METAL QUEEN

2
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,960
VT! Your shift’s up?

3
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,230
Finally. How about you?

4
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,260
I’m off to Europa now.

5
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,430
That’s got pretty good pay.

6
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,300
It’s nothing compared to yours.

7
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,970
I heard you made a round-trip
from here to Venus in 4 days?

8
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,570
Three days.

9
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,980
See what I mean?

10
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,910
Anyway, take it easy.

11
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,570
Thanks.

12
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,670
Oh yeah, I forgot.

13
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,320
VT!

14
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,590
You’re still not giving up?

15
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,490
Of course not!
How much do ya think I lent ya?

16
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,650
Suit yourself…

17
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,000
All right. You only get
one shot, and you get no clues.

18
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,630
Yeah! VT, your name is…

19
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,600
Vivian Tillana.

20
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,400
Nope!

21
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,880
Oh, man…

22
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
This is a bad omen…

23
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,940
You be careful now.

24
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,650
Yeah, you know that Cock-Eye guy that
was worth 8 million the other day?

25
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,520
Believe it or not,
I was the one who caught him!

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,890
What do you mean, the other day?
That was 10 years ago, you old geezer!

27
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,990
What are you saying, you younguns!
I was the one that taught Telpsicorei!

28
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,060
You mean the legendary bounty hunter?

29
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,330
Every bounty cowered in fear just
at the mention of his name…

30
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,310
Oh, Everyone knows that.

31
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,210
Hey, Zeros.

32
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,910
Welcome, VT. The usual?

33
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,050
Yeah.

34
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,960
What’s going on today?
The place is usually empty.

35
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,650
Oh, this?

36
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,560
Apparently a bounty named Decker
is gonna pass by around here.

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,260
They’re all bounty hunters.

38
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,030
No wonder they all look so cheap.

39
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,640
What was that about
’top secret’ information?

40
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,640
This place is full of our kind.

41
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,440
And I got a hangover today, too…

42
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,550
Besides, we don’t know the face. The
only clue is a dragon-shaped tattoo…

43
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,850
Faye?

44
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,580
Like that place is gonna be any better.

45
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,850
<i>Welcome to Woody’s!</i>

46
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,120
<i>Right now, all of our friends who</i>
<i>are celebrating their birthdays…</i>

47
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>…can get their pictures taken</i>
<i>with Mackey and Mannie!</i>

48
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,960
<i>Moms and Dads, please tell your server!</i>

49
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,900
Hi.

50
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,040
Whadduyawant? Ya wanna get some?

51
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,550
I’d rather be the one that gives some.

52
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,380
I’m fine with that.

53
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,410
Hands in the air, Decker!

54
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,890
Don’t be so difficult!

55
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,920
Just get the hell over here.

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,220
But I have work!

57
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,160
Just make yourself comfortable!

58
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,170
Git!

59
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,060
P-Please, stop.

60
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,400
I’ll give you a good time.

61
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,640
Stop!

62
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,370
Someone!

63
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,030
What the hell are ya?

64
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,100
VT!

65
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,740
So it’s a bounty hunter’s job to chase
a woman’s ass instead of a bounty?

66
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,020
Sorry, but this is my job.

67
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,080
W-What…

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
Don’t play dumb with me.

69
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,890
That dragon-shaped tattoo
is unmistakable proof.

70
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,590
Y-You got the wrong man…

71
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,030
Hey, you over there!

72
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,930
Call the police!

73
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,530
Tell them I caught Decker the bounty!

74
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,580
This is?

75
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,710
Yakkun, the eight-eyed eel…

76
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,780
Don’t be so mistakable!

77
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,400
Why you!

78
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,420
You!

79
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,630
VT!

80
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,230
You’re wearing my patience thin…

81
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,100
W-What the hell are ya?

82
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,340
Grudges over lost food
aren’t a pretty sight!

83
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,310
Shit, let’s get this guy too!

84
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,290
Found him!

85
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,050
Shit, I’ll get you back for this!

86
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,590
Uh, just kidding.

87
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,180
Forget about us!

88
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,370
My 12 million…

89
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,310
Really. Bounty hunters
are all stupid scum.

90
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,270
You think so?

91
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,300
Yeah!

92
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,780
As far as I know, they’re all
living their lives by gambling.

93
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,740
Well, maybe so.

94
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,950
Come over here.
I’ll treat you to a drink.

95
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,290
What? Bean sprouts are good for you!

96
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,530
Give me a break! That’s all we have!

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,090
Oh! Here it comes!

98
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,440
Oh, it’s you, Faye. That was quick…

99
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,100
What!?

100
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,450
But that sure is a disgusting drink.

101
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,310
It’s a prairie oyster.

102
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,710
It’s good for hangovers.

103
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,620
You’re the second person I’ve
met that drinks that stuff.

104
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,650
And the first one?

105
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,850
My husband.

106
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,490
VT!

107
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,260
We’ll get it this time.

108
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,960
The money!

109
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,090
Once for the three of you?

110
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,330
Yeah!

111
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,500
Suit yourself.

112
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,110
All right! Here we go!

113
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,310
VT, your name is…

114
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,610
I think Adrienne is good…

115
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,080
That doesn’t start with a V.

116
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,680
That’s why I said we should
stick with Leticia!

117
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,550
You think so?

118
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,650
I can have that money if
I guess your name?

119
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,920
Yeah.

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,930
I don’t remember who started it…

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,330
…but it kept piling up
and here we are now.

122
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,630
Can I try too?

123
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,060
<i>Spike! It’s me!</i>

124
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,330
<i>Faye let Decker get away.</i>

125
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,310
<i>Go after him now…</i>

126
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,300
Spike!

127
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,010
Get lost!

128
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,350
Idiotic lying scum!

129
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,410
I ain’t treating you!

130
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,520
No, Spike!

131
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,060
Oh, my.

132
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,530
Oh, this, those whachamacallit brothers
did this before they took off.

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,370
And you were watching?

134
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,500
Uh-huh.

135
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,210
Why didn’t you tell me?

136
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,170
What? I just told you right now!

137
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,280
What?

138
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,990
Hey, VT… going home?

139
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,050
Got a problem with that?

140
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,290
Come on, Zeros.

141
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,800
…and what are you doing?

142
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,570
Hitchhiking.

143
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,840
My machine was vandalized.

144
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,000
You’re really a stupid…

145
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,780
…lying, shameless scum
of a bounty hunter?

146
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,310
If you don’t stop with all this!

147
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,080
Follow me.

148
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,520
Can I bring someone with me?

149
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,510
Man! How many times do I
have to say the same thing!?

150
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,140
He was short, bald, wearing
glasses, and a Sarasvati…

151
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,870
Huh!? What!?

152
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,400
I just said…

153
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,510
Really! Can you turn that
shit-loud noise off!?

154
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,750
They say, “When in Rome,
do as the Romans do.”

155
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,050
And it’s not shit-loud noise.

156
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,460
It’s called heavy metal!

157
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,510
Really, both of you together…

158
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,010
Who do you think is
going to repair these?

159
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,610
What the hell am I supposed to do
with that little bit of information?

160
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,250
How many bald people with glasses do
you think there are in this universe?

161
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,420
So I said, bald, short, with glasses…

162
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,550
…and driving a gaudy truck
with Sarasvati painted on it!

163
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,290
Yeah?

164
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,770
<i>That you, VT?</i>

165
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,530
Oh, Otto. What’s up?

166
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,640
<i>I got into a hit-and-run.</i>

167
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,110
<i>The guy cut in line at the gate</i>
<i>entrance, rammed me, and took off!</i>

168
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,940
<i>Shit, I gotta make him pay for repairs!</i>

169
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,810
<i>Tell me if you see him!</i>

170
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,280
<i>Anything specific?</i>

171
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,810
Let’s see…

172
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,290
There was some oriental
goddess drawn on…

173
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,980
<i>Wait a minute! Was it Sarasvati?</i>

174
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,290
Oh yeah, her. How’d you know?

175
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,330
Zeros.

176
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,530
<i>Breaker one nine, Breaker one nine.</i>

177
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,540
<i>To all truckers in the asteroid belt.</i>

178
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,660
<i>This is Heavy Metal Queen.</i>

179
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,470
<i>Ring me up if you see a gaudy truck</i>
<i>with Sarasvati painted on it. Thanks.</i>

180
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,270
<i>VT, this is Love Machine.</i>

181
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,040
<i>What’s up with it?</i>

182
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,780
<i>Some guy you were chasing ran away?</i>

183
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,480
<i>Something like that.</i>

184
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,820
I haven’t seen the guy,
but I’ll be on the lookout.

185
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,790
<i>Thanks. It’ll help.</i>

186
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,920
This is Sneaky Snake. Did you
say it was a painting of a clown?

187
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,990
<i>Nope.</i>

188
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,870
<i>This is Spider Mike,</i>
<i>Black Panther of Jupiter.</i>

189
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,330
<i>VT, I’ve never met you but I hear lots</i>
<i>of rumors about the Heavy Metal Queen.</i>

190
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,070
Thanks for the compliment.
So, any info?

191
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,470
I passed by someone like the one you’re
looking for about 10 minutes ago.

192
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,770
It was around the Linus mines.

193
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,340
<i>That help?</i>

194
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,750
Thanks, I’ll owe you one.

195
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,990
I gotta exchange this too…

196
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,300
There he is!

197
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,150
Trying to throw me off his trail…

198
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,290
Maybe in the next century!

199
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,290
Hey, is the stupid, lying, shameless
scum of a bounty hunter around?

200
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,500
What!? The Linus mines!?

201
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,440
You’re being reckless!

202
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,140
<i>What did you say?</i>

203
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,770
Stay away from Decker!

204
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,900
His cargo is dangerous!

205
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,110
Hey!

206
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,480
Wait! I called first dibs on Decker!

207
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,150
What is this? Really?

208
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
Do I have to put this silly thing on?

209
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,000
I would have preferred that it was
your loud mouth that broke.

210
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,700
I heard that.

211
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,530
I’m going out, Jet!

212
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,010
Spike, the main gun on that
thing isn’t fixed yet!

213
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,470
Nice try, buddy…

214
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,860
What is this?
Isn’t this a little risky?

215
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,700
This way!

216
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,750
My 12 million…

217
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,350
<i>Hey Are you alive?</i>

218
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,860
<i>If you hear me, answer!</i>

219
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,530
<i>I’m fine. It takes more</i>
<i>than that to kill me.</i>

220
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,760
We gotta run. Now!

221
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,300
<i>Decker was a master of explosives.</i>

222
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,860
<i>He’s currently hauling the solid</i>
<i>nitro he was making deals with.</i>

223
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,140
All of it? That’s enough to
blow up this entire asteroid!

224
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,580
<i>On top of it,</i>
<i>this place was an excel mine.</i>

225
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,580
<i>The reactors have been randomly,</i>
<i>exploding for a while now…</i>

226
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,050
We gotta get this truck outta here.

227
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,040
<i>How much further is the exit?</i>

228
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,550
<i>A little further…</i>

229
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,050
<i>20 degrees to the left.</i>

230
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,330
There, the exit.

231
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,070
No good.

232
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,630
Behind us!

233
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,700
No! In front!

234
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
<i>What’s with that?</i>
<i>That’s nowhere near enough!</i>

235
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,970
My main gun is busted!

236
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,210
This is all I got!

237
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,810
<i>And this is all I have!</i>

238
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,580
What are we gonna do?
Isn’t there another way?

239
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,210
<i>Yeah, there is.</i>

240
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,820
There’s a ton of it in
the truck behind us!

241
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,020
<i>I don’t like this.</i>

242
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,760
<i>I’m not one for delicate</i>
<i>operations like this!</i>

243
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,870
Quit whining.

244
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,130
Let’s hit it big!

245
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,440
<i>Yeah, now grab one.</i>

246
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,310
That’s easy for you to say.

247
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,120
<i>…something is leaking…</i>

248
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,780
<i>That’s probably the stabilizer.</i>

249
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,220
<i>That means…</i>

250
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,730
<i>Touch-sensitive.</i>

251
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
<i>Wait a sec!</i>

252
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,700
<i>At worst, you screw up and die.</i>

253
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,370
<i>I got one.</i>
<i>What do you want to do with it?</i>

254
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,110
<i>This pod will shoot towards the exit</i>
<i>and self-destruct in 40 seconds.</i>

255
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,110
<i>So get that thing in this</i>
<i>pod within 40 seconds.</i>

256
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,990
What are you going to do!?

257
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,350
I’m gonna do… this.

258
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,300
Zeros, we’re opening the hatch!

259
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,840
Bingo!

260
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,430
It’s clear!

261
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,610
This sucks.

262
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,790
Really…

263
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,370
Thanks for the help,
Victoria Telpsicorei.

264
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,900
And give your husband my thanks.

265
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,040
I figured out your
name because of this.

266
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,510
Unless you’re a hermit,
everyone knows about him…

267
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,980
About the legendary
bounty hunter, Telpsicorei.

268
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,290
It will be a while.

269
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,520
My husband’s working
in Heaven right now.

270
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,960
I see…

271
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,260
Give the rest to your husband.

272
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
I’m sure he’s suffering
from a hangover…

273
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,300
…so I’ll treat him
to a prairie oyster.

274
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,860
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

275
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:59,200
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

276
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,900
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

277
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:11,640
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

278
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:20,890
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

279
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,900
The real folk blues.

280
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:34,310
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

281
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:41,940
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

282
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,440
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

283
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:55,360
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

284
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,300
COMING EPISODE

285
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,670
Once in a while,
I’ll do the preview by myself.

286
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,080
I’m Jet Black, 36 years old.

287
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,180
I’m often told that I don’t look 36…

288
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,590
…but you shouldn’t judge people by
their looks or how much hair they have.

289
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,250
Things are never what they seem to be.

290
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,950
The next episode is like that, too.

291
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,290
A fairy tale that seems
very unlike Bebop.

292
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,280
Next episode: “Waltz for Venus”.

293
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,300
WALTZ FOR VENUS
Next episode: “Waltz for Venus”.

294
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,330
WALTZ FOR VENUS

295
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,200
Stuff like this is
good once in a while…
WALTZ FOR VENUS

296
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,290
WALTZ FOR VENUS
