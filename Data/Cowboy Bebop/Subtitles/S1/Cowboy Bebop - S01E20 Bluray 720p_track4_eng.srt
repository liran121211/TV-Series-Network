00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,600
Hello, gentlemen.

2
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,710
I have come to take your lives.

3
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,719
PIERROT LE FOU

4
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,880
Hello, boy.

5
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,860
Your partner sure is unlucky, Jet.

6
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,320
Well, he wasn’t all that
lucky to begin with…

7
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,090
This case is especially bad.

8
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,030
It would be better to not get
yourselves involved in this one.

9
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,430
I don’t care, just answer me. Now.

10
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,430
I’m telling you this
for your own sake, and…

11
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,910
…if you get too involved in this,
I’m gonna get in trouble, too.

12
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,520
You know, Bob…

13
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,310
You’re the only person
I can rely on right now.

14
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,050
I’ll make sure it won’t
be bad for you. So…

15
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,250
Don’t you say that every time?

16
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,190
Really… you always have been a guy
that likes to get into trouble…

17
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,160
All right, this is only a rumor, but…

18
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,600
Have you heard of
the name “Mad Pierrot”?

19
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,110
There he is… the rumored mummy.

20
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,320
So, I heard you got beaten
up by some weird guy?

21
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,620
I recall you were sleeping
like this once before.

22
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,490
You really haven’t shown
any improvement…

23
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,550
Oh well, it doesn’t have
anything to do with me.

24
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,440
Don’t you end up in situations
like that because you never behave?

25
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,670
Well, I have nothing to do with it.

26
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,240
So, since I have nothing to
do with it, if you’ll excuse me…

27
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,440
Take care.

28
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,310
The victim was a high-ranking
guy from the ISSP.

29
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,150
He was the seventh victim.

30
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,250
What did you say?

31
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,190
Can’t blame ya. This is top-secret.

32
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,890
Apparently those higher-ups don’t
want the world to find out about this.

33
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,960
Why?

34
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,100
Your partner is in deep trouble.

35
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,970
The guy is a perfect killing machine.

36
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,410
They say that nobody who has seen
his face has made it out alive…

37
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,040
Even those lucky enough to escape’ll be
tracked down to the ends of the world…

38
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,680
…and they always wind up dead.

39
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,820
They say he appears with a smile,
and he leaves with a smile…

40
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,440
Yeah, he is the mysterious
assassin known as Mad Pierrot…

41
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,920
Tongpu.

42
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,950
Faye-Faye!

43
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,090
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye!

44
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,260
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye…

45
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,640
Hey you, can you stop saying
my name twice like that?

46
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,330
Faye-Faye, a weird mail came, came.

47
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

48
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,480
…and I woulda been done if
I had a little more time…

49
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,610
I can’t read it!

50
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,640
“Hello, boy. I’ll invite
you to a wonderful party…”

51
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,380
Wait, this is…

52
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,320
Listen, keep the fact that this
mail came a secret from Spike.

53
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,730
Secret?

54
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,660
Why?

55
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,990
Why secret?

56
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,890
If we don’t, that idiot…

57
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,300
…will run out to meet him?

58
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,670
It’s a secret, secret mail!

59
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,980
Space Land?

60
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,280
Pretty considerate of him
to hold the party there.

61
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,040
You’re gonna go like that?

62
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,910
Well, it would be perfect
if it was a masquerade.

63
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,320
Maybe this one really
will be the end of me…

64
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,050
Just kidding!

65
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,790
Would you come rescue
me if I said that?

66
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Idiot.

67
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,930
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

68
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,080
<i>Hey…</i>

69
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,750
<i>Oh, it’s you, Ed. Where’s Spike?</i>

70
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,320
<i>He went somewhere.</i>

71
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,510
What?

72
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,110
Not that this is anything new…
That idiot…

73
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,860
Idiot, idiot?

74
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,480
<i>Ed, I have a favor to ask.</i>

75
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,990
What, what?

76
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,300
Hello!

77
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,350
Welcome!

78
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,080
Yo…

79
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,480
Let’s party!

80
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,280
<i>You can’t enter here!</i>

81
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,290
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

82
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,590
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

83
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,460
Shut up!

84
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,980
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

85
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,320
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>

86
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,900
<i>It’s dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let’s play outside!</i>

87
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,600
Hi!

88
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,980
<i>All right, Ed…</i>

89
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:26,050
<i>First, enter the ISSP’s main</i>
<i>computer, and look for section 13.</i>

90
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,750
Aye, aye!

91
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,160
That’s the section that doesn’t
exist to the general public.

92
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,930
<i>It’s a pretty tall order…</i>
<i>Can you do it?</i>

93
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,030
Yup!

94
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,160
Hello!

95
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,550
Found it!

96
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,650
<i>After you open it, find the</i>
<i>file with the code name “Tongpu.”</i>

97
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,890
Yup!

98
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,840
Peek-a…

99
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,140
…boo!

100
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,960
<i>ISSP Assassination Ability,</i>
<i>Improvement Experiment.</i>

101
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,090
<i>Experiment sample chart number 46.</i>

102
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,230
<i>Code name: Tongpu.</i>

103
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,500
<i>Confirmed a strong regression</i>
<i>of the mind during…</i>

104
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,700
<i>…the experiment.</i>
<i>Experiment was canceled.</i>

105
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,110
<i>Sample to be permanently kept</i>
<i>in a quarantine facility,</i>

106
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,380
In the beginning, he escaped
from the facilities to seek revenge…

107
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,350
…but now he seems to be enjoying
the actual act of killing.

108
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,350
His mind must be
continuing to regress.

109
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,080
So, he’s like a child with
superhuman fighting abilities.

110
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,190
Really…

111
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,320
There is nothing as pure
and cruel as children.

112
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,160
It’s show time!

113
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,470
That was unnecessary!

114
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,870
<i>Hello, hello…</i>

115
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,540
<i>Hello! Hello!</i>

116
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,870
Hello…

117
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,850
T-That hurts!

118
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,620
It hurts!

119
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,200
It hurts!!

120
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,740
It hurts!!

121
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,970
Hurts…

122
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,910
Mommy, it hurts!

123
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,670
Mommy!!

124
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,650
It hurts… Mommy!

125
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,890
<i>Spike! All right,</i>
<i>we figured out what he is! He’s…</i>

126
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,720
No. I don’t need it anymore…

127
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,620
It all ended just now…

128
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,000
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

129
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,340
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

130
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:02,040
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

131
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,780
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

132
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:18,030
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

133
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,040
The real folk blues.

134
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:31,450
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

135
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:39,080
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

136
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,580
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

137
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:52,500
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

COMING EPISODE

139
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,150
I knew there was something
fishy going on lately.

140
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,180
So, that’s what it was!

141
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,520
What are you guys talking about?

142
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,710
You really can’t judge
people by their looks…

143
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,520
Honestly disgusting.

144
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,220
Hey, hey, what are you
guys talking about?

145
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,560
I never thought it would
be a teenage girl…

146
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,360
It makes me despise him.

147
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,300
Who are you talking about?
