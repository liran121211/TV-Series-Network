1
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,760
Someone’s here!

2
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,260
Hello there! You approaching
this area, can you see me?

3
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,460
I’m a little troubled
because I’m out of gas…

4
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,130
Can you take me to Ganymede?

5
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,800
Oh, dammit, why does everyone?!
Why won’t they stop?!

6
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,300
GATEWAY SHUFFLE

7
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,550
This sea rat…

8
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,720
…used to be raised in
the oceans of Ganymede.

9
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,560
After the gates stabilized,
food was no longer scarce.

10
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,470
And so, now the ones in the wild get
eaten by those who have a fancy for them.

11
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,100
So, is it good?

12
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,660
It’s totally disgusting.

13
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,970
It’s just expensive because
it’s a Ganymede specialty.

14
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,070
Then it’s no good.
I’ll have the lobster miso stew.

15
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,810
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,080
That doesn’t look good, either.

17
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,750
Well, I thought I’d go for
something expensive while I’m at it.

18
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,090
You mean, because we’ll
soon have some money?

19
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,740
To think that Gould was a spy…

20
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,900
But, Mom, don’t worry.
We sunk his ship.

21
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,840
It’s all right. One vial nowadays
doesn’t mean much…

22
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,780
Let’s continue the deal
as we initially planned.

23
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,980
But… who was in charge of
watching the house then?

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,850
M-Mom…

25
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,090
It was you, Harrison?

26
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,730
Um, ur, Mom…

27
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,600
Hey! Where’s my sea rat sauté?!

28
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,740
Come on, there, come ON!

29
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,420
No doubt. It’s Morgan.

30
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,940
Then shall we go before
we get breakfast?

31
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,050
Hey, kid, did you know
that the Ganymede sea rat…

32
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,060
…is a very
intelligent and kind animal?

33
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,190
—What’s that?
—That woman… I think she was…

34
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,360
I don’t remember ordering a circus!

35
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,280
I know I’ve seen her somewhere…

36
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,810
<i>We, the Space Warriors, work night</i>
<i>and day to preserve the environment…</i>

37
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,940
<i>…and protect endangered species</i>
<i>all over the universe.</i>

38
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,280
I remember now!
That lady’s worth 25 million!

39
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,260
Mom, hurry!

40
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,490
This is the end, Mademoiselle.

41
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,600
Mom?!

42
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,030
Don’t move!

43
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you want to see your mom in pain?

44
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,660
Who are you?

45
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,930
How’s Morgan?

46
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,770
He’s full of holes.

47
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,300
That’s a problem. He was
gonna put food on our table.

48
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,740
But he’s worth nothing compared to
the 25 million that you’re worth…

49
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,680
—You!
—Let go of Mom!

50
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,880
Stop it. These guys are bounty hunters.

51
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,820
We can’t do anything.

52
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,480
Mom!

53
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,880
Take care of the home.
I’ll be back soon.

54
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,360
Come on. If you don’t go now,
the cops are gonna arrive!

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,190
Mom, sit tight!

56
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,160
Harrison, you’ll get plenty
of punishment later.

57
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,860
M-Mom?!

58
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,560
—Let’s go!
—Mom!!

59
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,900
Lucky you, Harrison.
Your mom won’t be back for a while.

60
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,920
Hey, are you alive?!

61
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,520
Please… Take this to the ISSP…

62
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,730
But… don’t open it…

63
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,700
H-Hey, wait a minute!!

64
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,830
What does he want me to do?!

65
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,810
Universal Environmental
Protection Society?

66
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,710
More like environmental terrorists.

67
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,550
They’re called the Space Warriors.

68
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,020
They used to be a good group
working on environmental…

69
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,650
…preservation and the
protection of endangered species.

70
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,650
But since their leader changed two years
ago, their focus drastically changed.

71
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,820
There are only a few members,
but now they’re…

72
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,100
…even worse than a lot
of syndicates out there.

73
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,360
They’re especially keen on
protecting the Ganymede sea rats.

74
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,410
And she’s the leader of this terrorist
group: Twinkle Maria Murdock.

75
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,840
Please, don’t associate
us with terrorists!

76
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,880
We are warriors of peace,
fighting for the law of nature.

77
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,980
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,450
And where can we get
the 25 million in reward?

79
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,560
The Ganymede government.
But we can’t cash in.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,460
I’m checking on it…

81
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,470
The government canceled
the reward yesterday.

82
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,760
Why?

83
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,180
When you’re told not to open it,
the more you want to…

84
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,510
I didn’t open it!

85
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,710
This thing opened by itself!

86
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,770
<i>So, as you requested,</i>
<i>we have canceled the bounty,</i>

87
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,780
<i>And we are debating</i>
<i>about prohibiting…</i>

88
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,610
<i>…the fishing of sea rats</i>
<i>on Ganymede as well…</i>

89
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,550
So, where’s Mom?

90
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,650
<i>As I said, we haven’t gotten</i>
<i>word of Twinkle’s capture!</i>

91
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,280
<i>If we can find out</i>
<i>who captured them…</i>

92
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,990
If Mom doesn’t come back…

93
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,790
…we’ll set that plan
into action immediately.

94
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,270
<i>W-Wait! We’re not going</i>
<i>against your wishes…</i>

95
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,170
Doesn’t look like it
would ease my hunger…

96
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,190
Wait a minute, that terrorist act
we saw isn’t on the records, either!

97
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,820
What’s going on?

98
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,550
See? I told you that you
couldn’t do anything.

99
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,290
So, you can just let me go.

100
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,590
I don’t get it…
There’s something behind all this.

101
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,770
<i>Hello there! You approaching</i>
<i>this area, can you see me?</i>

102
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,540
<i>I’m a little troubled</i>
<i>because I’m out of gas…</i>

103
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,740
Hey, she’s!

104
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,810
Can you take me to Ganymede?

105
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,890
<i>Please?</i>

106
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,520
<i>Even getting a little propellant</i>
<i>would be wonderful!</i>

107
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,760
Hey! Can you hear me or what?!

108
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,960
D’oh…

109
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,940
Then what?

110
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,480
You spent all the money you
took from us at the casino?!

111
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,220
As they say, “money makes
the world go round.”

112
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,590
They also say,
“thieves have no compassion.”

113
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,860
How is it over there?

114
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,700
Yeah, I’m contacting an old friend.

115
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,570
Man, there isn’t even
anything worth keeping…

116
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,970
Huh? What’s this?

117
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,340
Yes… I still don’t know
where that virus is…

118
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,850
Yes, Mr. President…

119
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,280
We will continue to do our best!

120
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,150
<i>Chief!</i>

121
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,250
What?

122
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,050
<i>The one who nabbed Twinkle…</i>

123
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,820
You found them?!

124
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,460
And, that guy told you to
take this to the ISSP?

125
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,130
Yup. Doesn’t that look
like it’s worth something?

126
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,500
So, how about we call it even?

127
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,300
I never trust anything thieves say.

128
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,230
What?!

129
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,580
What’s all this about?! Hey, Bob!!

130
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,770
<i>Nothing is really up.</i>

131
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,580
<i>The bounty has been canceled.</i>

132
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,180
<i>They’re saying you should</i>
<i>let her go immediately,</i>

133
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,690
Hey, Bob…

134
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,350
<i>When we worked in</i>
<i>the same department…</i>

135
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,950
<i>…a lot of the confiscated</i>
<i>eye drops disappeared, you know?</i>

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,330
W-What do ya wanna say?

137
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,590
<i>If you wanna work</i>
<i>until retirement age…</i>

138
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,200
<i>…isn’t it a better idea for</i>
<i>you to go along with me?</i>

139
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,530
Oh, all right.

140
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,040
I get what you’re saying.

141
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,020
Hey, don’t break it!

142
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,480
<i>The guys are threatening</i>
<i>under the mask of “negotiation.”</i>

143
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,320
<i>They’re holding the 8 million</i>
<i>residents of Ganymede hostage.</i>

144
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,590
What do you mean by that?

145
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,600
They basically kidnapped
the leader in…

146
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,790
…virus technology and created
a virus to their liking.

147
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,100
<i>The virus is called Monkey Business.</i>

148
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,170
<i>They say that humans and monkeys only,</i>
<i>have a 2% difference in DNA structure…</i>

149
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,110
<i>…and apparently this virus</i>
<i>acts on those two percent…</i>

150
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,280
<i>So, that virus selectively,</i>
<i>acts only on humans.</i>

151
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,320
Why don’t you give up?

152
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,830
We lost contact with the ISSP spy
that infiltrated their group.

153
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,770
So, we had no other option.

154
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,000
So you’re going to
agree to their terms?!

155
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,240
Man, this was a big one
that we caught, too!

156
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,880
It’s orders from up above!
WE couldn’t do anything about it!

157
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,320
We’re releasing her.

158
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,880
Us… or them…

159
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,580
Which one of us deserves
punishment from heaven?

160
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,690
Soon, the time of
judgment will arrive…

161
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,660
Yes… Soon…

162
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,200
The release procedure
has been completed.

163
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,940
We will continue to monitor
her using our special agents.

164
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,270
How’s the satellite?

165
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,970
It will be ready in about an hour.

166
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,450
Get the chemical tech group as well.

167
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,940
Don’t do anything until we
know where the virus is.

168
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,650
Sir, a communication from Twinkle.

169
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,090
<i>Long time no see, Minister.</i>

170
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,520
<i>About that promise we made…</i>

171
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,630
So… about the sea rats,
we will keep a stable…

172
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,960
…population using
limitations on hunting them.

173
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,500
<i>Didn’t I say prohibition of hunting?</i>

174
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,100
W-Well, we will look at the
demands in a positive light…

175
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,750
<i>Looks like you need some</i>
<i>punishment to understand.</i>

176
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,940
AH! Hey! Wait!

177
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,950
Mom! I don’t want to
become a monkey! Mom!!

178
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,870
<i>Alpha 1-0-5 to headquarters.</i>

179
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,470
<i>The target has entered</i>
<i>the wasteland area.</i>

180
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,040
Roger. Continue pursuit.

181
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,690
Man, they’re too easygoing.

182
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,120
Dammit…

183
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,250
All that and no reward…

184
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,260
<i>Jet, can you hear me?</i>

185
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,230
<i>Turn on channel 72 and watch it!</i>

186
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,200
<i>They’re broadcasting…</i>

187
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,200
<i>…from their own satellite!</i>

188
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,140
<i>This isn’t just about the sea rats.</i>

189
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,440
<i>Humans, with their culture…</i>

190
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,610
<i>…have escaped from the</i>
<i>great system of nature…</i>

191
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,140
<i>…and are committing crimes</i>
<i>that cannot be amended.</i>

192
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,710
<i>Those that don’t realize this…</i>

193
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,520
<i>…are what you could call</i>
<i>“bugs” in the nature system.</i>

194
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,230
<i>That ship was a decoy</i>

195
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,030
Where are they broadcasting from?

196
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,200
It’s near here. They’re…

197
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,100
…in hyperspace!

198
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,040
<i>Monkey Business, our virus…</i>

199
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,480
<i>…takes such humans and</i>
<i>returns them to nature.</i>

200
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,570
<i>Understand?</i>

201
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,150
<i>Au revoir.</i>

202
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,490
<i>Good news, Jet!</i>

203
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,020
<i>The Ganymede government has reestablished</i>
<i>the ransom on Twinkle and company.</i>

204
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,300
What?!

205
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,460
This is our chance!
We’re the only ones around here!

206
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,370
<i>But just catching them won’t do.</i>

207
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,010
<i>If the missile falls, there’ll be</i>
<i>nobody here that can pay the bounty</i>

208
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,290
So there’s nothing to bitch about
if we get rid of the missile, right?

209
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,190
But they’re at the exit to a gate.

210
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,590
I know.

211
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,980
What about the defense system?!

212
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,950
4 minutes and 30 seconds to impact!

213
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,380
The system won’t make it in time!

214
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,740
T-This is an emergency!
Get the President!

215
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,490
They’re here.

216
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,400
It split?! Shit!

217
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,680
Jet! Get the last one!

218
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,820
What?! There aren’t any
weapons over here!

219
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,000
If I wait for the next shot to fully
charge, that thing’ll hit Ganymede!

220
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,500
<i>Oh? Are you in trouble?</i>

221
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,130
<i>How about for 80% of the earnings?</i>

222
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,190
You’ve got to be kidding!

223
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,100
<i>Okay, bye! Have a nice day</i>

224
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,970
All right. 40%. No more.

225
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,300
OK! I get the 60!

226
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,810
Fine… We got no choice.

227
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,480
Shit, will she make it in time?

228
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,350
Welcome!

229
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,020
What is this?!

230
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,060
Multiple warheads?!
This ain’t the military!!

231
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,230
Now all of you, become apes!

232
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,440
<i>Jet!</i>

233
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,670
<i>The guys from the government</i>
<i>are closing down the gate!</i>

234
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,540
What?!

235
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,440
<i>They’re going to enclose all of it</i>
<i>in hyperspace, missile and all!</i>

236
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,350
Wait a minute, this isn’t a joke!

237
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,400
<i>Spike!</i>

238
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,610
I hear ya!

239
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,070
Spike!

240
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,830
Why?

241
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,100
<i>Didn’t you learn in high school?</i>

242
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,800
<i>Matter that gets enclosed</i>
<i>in hyperspace can be seen…</i>

243
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,270
…but will never interact with
matter in this realm again.

244
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,250
Mom! The gate’s closed!

245
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,120
Hey, Mom, what can we do?!

246
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,590
Stop! Stop!

247
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:47,140
So… this and that and no reward.
All that work for nothing.

248
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,680
Oh, don’t look so down,
we can make money next time.

249
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,580
Well, I’ll go take a shower.

250
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,590
Next time? Make money?

251
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,690
Hey, Jet, what did she just say?

252
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,220
Don’t ask me! Just don’t!

253
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,890
And she’s off to shower
without asking us…

254
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,400
Hey, are we gonna take all of this?

255
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,170
Don’t tell me! Just don’t!

256
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,310
Fine, I’ll go tell her.

257
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,350
Hey, Spike…

258
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,510
Should’ve seen that coming.

259
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,790
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

260
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,130
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

261
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,830
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

262
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:10,570
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

263
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:19,820
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

264
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,830
The real folk blues.

265
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:33,240
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

266
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:40,870
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

267
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,370
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

268
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:54,290
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

269
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,090
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move…

270
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,170
COMING EPISODE
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move…

271
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,840
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move…

272
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,240
…and a nostalgic tune fills the air.

273
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,340
I then happen to wake up
from the dream.

274
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,380
There is no such thing
as a music box…

275
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,610
…yet, there is a small
music box nestled in my hand.

276
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,450
And I awake from the dream again.

277
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,720
As if I was peeling an onion,
it’s a dream no matter how far I go.

278
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,290
I can never return to reality.

279
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,820
Such a nightmare, this is.
